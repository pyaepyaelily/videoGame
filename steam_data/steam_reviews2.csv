2016-08-23,0,0,37,False,Recommended,"I don't get why this game has had so much hate i personally have not had any problem with finding lobbys or anything related to connection never ever had any lagspike or smh. And even if some people have had problems joing lobbys then ive never heard it beeing more than 5 minutes wait and for me thats fine as the game is fairly new. Otherwise in gameplay ive had much fun playing killer AND survivor never have i found it ""unbalanced"" or something but as the game is new and there isn't much content or maps i give this game a 7.5/10",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-23,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Overall if Steam still had the star system I would probably give this game 4/5 stars as the only major let down is the lobby set up.Personally I can't stand horror games and survival games BUT Dead by Daylight is an exception. It gets the heart racing which makes you slightly paranoid for a few moments after you close the game which I think is great for horror games like this cause it means it isn't just a jump scare but it's a lingering fear.As a survivor teamwork is necessary but so is a good reaction speed. Once you're down to one or two survivors its pretty much game over cause it makes the killers job so much easier.I have yet to try playing as a killer but it looks pretty fun!The graphics is alright but the style sets up the atmosphere perfectly!The music builds up the tension and puts you on edge the closer the killer is to you which to me sets this apart from jump scares and other horror games as it has that heart racing spine tingling build up before some maniac slashes you. As an Australian player I don't seem to have any connection issues with the servers and the game flows pretty well theres no lag!One issue however is trying to play with friends if you don't have 5 or 4 people. As far as I can tell you can't play as the killer with your friends unless you have 5 people set up together searching for matches involves researching multiple times until the game finally puts you and your friends into a lobby and if someone dc's it boots everyone out and then you have to send all the invites again and then restart the constant clicking of ready until the game decides to place you into a lobby.A minor thing as currently the servers seem relatively stable Needs more servers preferably in other countries! Not just America!So if you're interested get this game! It's easy enough to search by yourself and find a match and it's pretty fun with friends too!,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-01,0,0,747,False,Recommended,Really fun game and very addictive. It is like a morbid game of hide and seek and i cant get enough! The only things are that there seems to be tons of connection issues. Not sure if it has to do with servers or purly issues connection to lobbies or players just plainly disconnecting if they dont get their way. So sometimes I can sit here for 5 to 10 minutes just trying to get on a stable connection to play as a survivor. And once I do it would figure that that connection would get lost once i have entered the playing fields. That alone can make the game very irritating. But other than that it really is a fun and heart throbbing game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-01,0,0,149,False,Recommended,"8/10 rating Behavior Digital Inc. really gives an extraordianary design of games where players tend to interact with the environment that they adapted to. Furthermore for the killer part is more like an instinct behavior of surviving in harsh choices. Players will tend to give emotions towards the game even towards others because of this interactive multiplayer game.Players already seen the behavior of others well there is skill in this matter. I'm not saying that this will help you from certain chase of a psychopath or a serial killer no. It tests our instinct of choices and adaptivity. The game content is well not to shabby i guess balancing in this type of gameplay is quite hard but acceptable. Between an unexperienced survivors they sometime tend not know what to do but the killer only has one purpose just plan course of action stab the hell out of them and sacrifice the survivors. If players uses survivor and test it all the time they get some points to redeem it for talents. Well this is quite a downer to me. Talents earned are so fast that the graphics on reaching the point where the killer needs to do the hard work from now onLast its about the mechanics and system. First of all the mechanics the mechanics of the game is quite acceptable from TPS view for the survivors and the FPS view for the killer I think its quite fair. Controls are definitely good to me but for the ""falling down the wooden part to escape"" is lack in responds. For this game system you guys really need A GOOD INTERNET CONNECTION. This is the part what I hate about at first I don't want to buy this game because of waiting for players part or disconnecting and so but the least to prevent that is to having good internet connection. In conclusion this game has been adapted quite well a 8/10 spot for me. Pros Creative gameplay Acceptable controls Interactive graphics Marvelous sound effects and BGMCons Game balancing harsh Unfriendly internet connection properties ADVICE Try making a server for each region if can but it really costs a lot. For connections support",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-09,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Its a fun game and all but the matchmaking is terrible you can't enjoy the game with camping killers or being up against eltie players. Its like being a lvl 1 against a lvl 90 veteran. It takes like hours to find a match with just 1 friend and like days for with 2 or 3 friends. Once it puts you into a match during the loading process it has a 80% chance to just disband your party but all in all the games pretty good plus if it is you against a higher up it just makes the game much more exciting and gives you a better view on who your up against when you lvl up.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-21,0,0,4,False,Recommended,People really need to relax here when it comes to the game and do your research.Dead by Daylight is a asymetrical multiplayer horror stealth game where one person is a killer and the other 4 players are survivors. There is a progression system that allows you to improve your character(s) over time with flat consumable upgrades or situational upgrades called perks.Now onto the stuff that i see all over the place in the reviews section.Matchmaking Matchmaking is probably the weakest point in the game running off of a MMR system. Currently there are alot of lobby hoppers due to the inability to queue up with your friends.This will be amended as the development team has been very good about listening to the community and are working on a survivor group mode to come out soon.Options menu The development team has also explicitely stated that the options menu is to be completed POST release. which is now. They plan on creating a fully fleshed out options menu for us along the way.Balance Simply to say if the game starts with a lower amount of players than the max then there will be less nessissary generators. Going down to only 2 being required to be turned on. The devs have said they are looking at the ranking system at the moment. But i am hoping they will make a ranked queue myself so that people can be punished for disconnecting early.Honestly this game is alot of fun. But it is incomplete at the moment. If you want a fun experience that will only grow over time (If the devs are being honest) Then get the game while it is on sale. It's a fairly inexpensive game for how much fun you can have killing your friends as the killer or enjoying a bit of running away like a scared child.,Dead by Daylight

I bought this game not only because it's literally the only thing I've been seeing when I'm on YouTube but also because it looked not only stunning but just a good game. My thoughts changed rather quickly actually. Here's why It's really boring if you don't have friends to play with I mean matchmaking is good but there's no interaction between the survivors. It felt like one of those ""this game will be boring after 50 hours"" games which is the reason I refunded it. I'm no expert at the game hence my 1 hours of playtime. There's also a rank system I would understand why but they really need to fix it.Although it did scare the sh*t out of me the graphics are good and the gameplay is okay.

And is a very nice idea.When everything is working as its supposed to both survivors and the killers can have fun.Cons The execution of the concept is laking and unbalanced.The game is riddled with bugs both for the survivors and the killers.The game seams to still be in the beta testing and we are the ones testing it for the devs.As the killer you are not playing against survivors of your lvl. As a rank 20 (witch is the base rank you start od as on both sides) You are often stuck playing against players that are not only higher lvl then you but are ranked way higher then you. 1 being the highest rank possible. The same can be said about the killers. as a lvl 1 rank 20 i played against killers way to high lvl and rank then me.The lvl is how you get perks with blood points and the ranks are how good you are considered by the game.You are given more blood points the more you play with the victims but they tend to escape if they know how to play.And help each other. If you tend to play efficiantly your are penlized by receiving less points. The fact that the killer whipes his blade after every successful hit is frustrating at best and the destabilizing effect of a wooden pallet barely falling on you is infuryating considering you are a beefy brute that can swipe those said pallets with one foot.All in all id wait for the bugs to get fixed and the balance to be worked out by the devs. I personally wanted this game to be good but i consider it ok at best. This is the kind of game i always wanted to play and i love horror movies. But as a survivor the only thing you get to do is fix generators to be able to escape. I wish both the killers and the survivor had other things to do to be able to win. Running around killing is fun for a while but gets boring after a day or two of play. Witch for a 20 dollard game is very disapointing.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-10,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game on PS4 and most recently PC. After a long love/hate relationship I finally gave this game up and I hope I can convince you to try this game out even though I'm giving this game a bad review. Let me explain DBD isn't a pick up and play game. Deceptively so. There are tons of things to learn before you'll even get close to winning a game as a survivor or killer. I found this super refreshing! I love horror and having a deep evolving game to play online is such a refreshing change of pace from early access horror games that last one or two hours long. The strategy behind surviving and killing requires so many mind games that make this game really fun at times. If you're looking for a casual game to pick up and feel good about think twice. I easily put in 10 or so hours before I was even at a 25% winrate.But when you stick with it there is so much to learn and try out. Perks killers and survivors add a lot to this game and if the dev's keep up their development schedule we could be seeing many more in the next year. You always feel like you're building your characters and becoming tangiably better. Even when all you get is crap for levelving up you feel like the next breakthrough is just around the corner. It's a good feeling. One that horror games don't usually provide. However the worst part of this game isn't the game itself. It's the devs. They're a prime example of what not to do with a evolving community. Game is still running on client side servers. Meaning the killers lag is now your problem including lag switches (which inspired me to write this review). Skills like juking fake outs 360s and feints are mostly useless when your actions don't make it to the killers client side server and get you killed. Constantly I'd see a killer teleport to me and land a hit even though I was behind a window across a pallet or a good six feet away. It's a HUGE issue with this game and it will leave you yelling in some matches with frustration. Another is toxicity and too many mechanics in game that allow a survivor or killer to throw the game. Camping is a legit strategy that is straight up reccommended by the devs and that can either confuse newcomers or just straight up scare them off. Real talk I've bought this game for four different people and three of them got frustrated and don't play this game anymore because of the campers and lag. The community is still very uneven about camping (In all honesty.... it's basically required if you're a killer but I can understand both sides). Eventually you'll work around it but it's still frustrating to have teammates run into a camping killer or fall into his obvious camping trap and throw the game. The devs having a position on this would reduce a LOT of toxicity in this game and possibly up retention with new players. But their main concern is mostly cosmetics and paid dlc. Sure reworks come and tiny fixes go live but most are riddled with bugs that are recinded with a week or two or just 'kinda' change the meta. I felt often that I was losing or winning matches due to dumb luck lag or rng and less like I earned a neck and neck victory. Don't get me wrong it's a really fun game. But these bugs and issues will most likely have you rage quiting most of the nights you play DBD. A lot of my friends through this game (about ten or so in total) will get audibly upset disconnect or start raging. This is probably the biggest reason I won't play this game any more. It's straight up unhealthy. I'm yelling at bugs the devs have no intention of fixing bad players who exploit the game or toxicity. All in all this game is worth a try. Sure it's hard and sure it doesn't seem to be improving as much as it needs to be. But it's fun for what it is. A good asymmetrical horror game you can sink your teeth into every blood moon. Would I reccommend this game to a horror fan? Absolutely. To anyone looking for a fun game? Absolutely not. This is a game you grow to love through blood sweat and frustration. If that doesn't sound like your sugar and spice. Look somewhere else. Please add servers devs.... You need to stopbeing apathetic to bug reports and release a major update. Hopefully this is a game I come back to in the future.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-07,0,0,192,False,Recommended,The game can be very fun and entertaining for hours on hours. Has a good scare factor and thrill element to it. The only problem i have is with the matchmaking. It can take a long time a higher ranks to get into a game. Also the developers of the game don't seem to care to much about the players as there are glitches that go on and on without being fixed. Personally spent over 100 hours in the game and my data was completely erased which is a known glitch for some time that for some reason doesnt take priority and the developers are slow to respond to inquirys. Other then that i really love playing the game the glitches just make it unbarable sometimes.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-30,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,"Fun concept but the game is flawed. What other game has you thinking about ranking when you play rather than winning? This game is designed so doing 4 generators is a waste of time (just do 3). This game is designed so kiting the killer all game is a waste of time even if your team wins because you're doing it because you don't get all the right categories. This is equivalent to say in Overwatch getting 20 eliminations and being ""maxed out"" on points to rank. Then you have to get max assists and objective time etc. rather than actually just winning. That isn't a well made game. The reason for this is simple everyone can win. In a game so heavily focused on ranking and competition having a system where everyone can win is simply not good enough. Unfortunately this is such an integral part of the game I don't see how the devs could fix it without actually trying instead of just releasing new DLC.",Dead by Daylight

There are many ways for the survivors to just run the monster in an infinity loop.3. Lack of variety. Only 3 maps currently.4. Graphics could be better.5. Insanely difficult to lvl up. Lvl 15 is the first time you get 2 perks. So you have to struggle through 14 levels just so be somewhat on par with other players.6. ALOT of bugs. Dropped matches unable to match glitches etc.Good Merits 1. Intense. Great concept. Kind of like Evolve.2. Great Audio cues. Need to listen.3.

After spending over 200 hours in the game I can say that my experiences have been mostly positive. The game is relatively well balanced (especially considering the a symmetrical format) and players have been relatively friendly (especially considering it's a game where people brutally kill each other).No game is perfect but DbD offers a unique survival horror experience that still gets my adrenaline pumping every time I play it. The recently added store and cosmetic options do not bother me either I actually think this was a long time coming. I've got 100x more out of this game than my initial $20 investment warranted so I don't mind dropping a few bucks for some well designed skins. So if you're looking for a game that drops you into a different horror movie experience every time you play it remember death is not an escape.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-24,0,0,367,False,Recommended,Ive played this game for quite a long time(259 hours) and it has been a lot of fun but its really not nearly as fun without friends and most of the time people are too incompetent to really help you in a match against killer. Most of the time you will get farmed on a hook and then you'll get downed and put right back up on the same hook you were put on last time. i have a prestige 2 level 30 ish David King (not legacy prestige) and I am not bad at the game (most consider it a respectable amount) but its mostly the teammates that screw you over hiding in lockers when there's a heartbeat not doing generators and walking around when you can see them whilst on hook. And honestly killer isn't the greatest occasionaly you will get a good feeling of killing all four of the survivors but then other times even in really low ranks you will get horrid survivors. Not bad survivors but bad as in evil the survivors then control the game you can't kill them they will outsmart you. Considering im a survivor main this is a huge problem for me and even if i'd like to relieve some stress even killing won't help me.

2016-06-14,0,0,255,False,Not Recommended,"Remember in Friday the 13th where everyone just threw boards at Jason and casually outran him after rubbing dirt on their injuries?UPDATE I've updated this from recommened to not recommended. The devs clearly don't know how to balance anything nor how to get patches out in a reasonable amount of time.Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where 4 survivors attempt to escape the killer. The survivors have to repair 5 generators and then open one of several exit gates before they can leave or if all but 1 survivor are dead escape through a hidden hatch in the nick of time. The killer has the job of finding people and placing them on meathooks in order to sacrifice them to his entity. There are currently 4 killers and 5 survivors. The survivors have different unique perks ranging from self healing to destroying meathooks which are what the killers use to kill people. The Wraith can cloak (Albeit with a loud signalling of their bell) and decloak (with their bell again) in order to surprise survivors. The Trapper sets up beartraps around the map which can catch unwary survivors and make them easy pickings. The Hillbilly gets a chainsaw straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre which can instantly knock down a survivor if he manages to land his charge meaning no he can't always instantly take you down. The Nurse has a teleportation ability which lets her jump past obstacles that survivors place in her way but if she misses her teleport then she gets stunned and almost blinded assuming she doesn't use her remaining two very short range blinks to correct her mistake.There's a ""levelling up"" and ""ranking"" system in play both separate. Levelling up involves collecting XP (Bloodpoints) during matches from naturally doing what your role entails (escaping/killing) and doing it well. You then spend your bloodpoints on the bloodweb where different perks(Equippable permanent buffs that have several ranks) offerings (one time use randomly activating powerups) and add ons (Things that improve your tools as a survivor or improve your special ability as a killer) are available for purchase. Note that add ons will always disappear if used as a killer but if you use one as a survivor and don't die OR expend your items ""charges "" then the add on should stay with you. The ranking system grades you on a scale of 20 to 1 20 being the lowest. If you do very well as a survivor or killer and rack up a lot of bloodpoints in matches you will gradually climb ranks towards 1. It seems to influence matchmaking but don't be surprised if you're a rank 20 something and the game feels like throwing you against rank 1's. Because matchmaking is hard.GameplayThe gameplay can be considered ""tense"" when you first start playing as a survivor. You don't know where the killer could come from only that he's looking for you. You don't know where your friends are you just know you need to fix these generators and leave ASAP. This goes out the window entirely when you level/rank high enough then the game becomes stupidly easy and you can abuse your broken perks to handily evade the killer for 3 minutes while your friends fix every generator.Playing killer is like playing a time attack game. You're constantly under pressure to kill survivors and you can't stop for a second. If you hesitate the generators are already fixed and the survivors are teabagging you at the exit gate and then complaining about how laggy you were. For some reason the survivors dominate the flow of the game. If you play killer expects lots of frustrating matches against high ranking VOIP teams determined to make your life completely unfun.The game is definitely survivor sided and the devs refuse to admit this while regularly nerfing killers. Don't get this game to play killer. Or if you do get 4 friends play regular gameplay for a while to unlock levels and items and then only ever play Kill Your Friends mode with them so everyone can actually have fun.Visuals/AudioThe game looks fine. I'm not much of a graphics person. It ran on my six year old laptop if that says anything. Sound design is very important so it really is a good idea to play with a headset plugged in. The killer FOV is always extremely limited (Unless you find a certain perk for the Wraith) so that killers are forced into tunnel vision survivors get a third person camera to use. Apparently the game runs in Unreal 4 and this game looks pretty bad if that's the case.Major Pros and ConsYou can rebind some keys now which is better than what it was at the start.There is now a party up system which has understandably frustrated a lot of killers since people abuse this system to VOIP with their friends guaranteeing very easy games for survivors.The game can also be frustrating as a survivor should your teammates prove useless as with all team games. At least in this game you don't HAVE to rely on them all the time but they're your only ray of hope should the killer catch you and place you on his meathook.A gigantic con is the insane grind of this game. You will spend hours working to level up your characters and you have no choice but to focus on one character to level up. Playing low level killer against high level survivor is a nightmare where the survivors bully the killer. A survivor without any perks can still win but it's just not the cakewalk it could be. Survivors are massively overpowered (Don't let the survivor mains hear that though) and have game breaking perks letting them remove hooks AKA the only way they can die run faster than the killer (The cooldown COOLS DOWN WHILE THEY'RE STILL RUNNING) and heal themselves in the occasional event the killer catches up to them. There are loops the survivors can run in the game where the killer literally cannot catch them. A dev with functioning brain cells could fix this in a map editor in 5 minutes. These devs took 3 months to unveil a ""fix"" that does absolutely nothing.The only major pro is that if you manage to get a high levelled survivor you can mercilessly bully all the killers in your path and enjoy the devs pandering to you with every new patch and stream.Except all future support aside from bugfixes that create more bugs to cost money. Enjoy paying for this early access game.OverallThe game devs clearly favor the survivors. In their latest patch (In fairness a public ""beta"" to test the upcoming patch) they debuted a slew of killer nerfs while leaving all the unfair survivor tactics in the game. Their proposed infinite loop fix does nothing at all. Playing killer past rank 10 becomes a chore and is unfun. Avoid this game at all costs and go buy The Last Year or Friday the 13th instead.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-06,0,0,331,False,Not Recommended,"This is all just my opinion interlaced with facts. 1. LOTS of cheaters in this game. 2. Survive with friends DOES NOT WORK. Tonight we sat in a lobby for over a half hour until we quit with four survivors... All we needed was a killer. Seems to take a long time no matter how many players you have. I have a video of this actually on youtube and its more like 50 minutes of sitting in a lobby waiting for games to start.3. Developers seem focused on pushing out new paid content instead of fixing the bugs and exploit issues in game?4. The game is a cool concept could use more objectives or something though. As a survivor you fix 5 generators and exit the map to win there are also ""skill checks"" where you have to stop a needle within a certain area or you will stop reparing the generator and make a loud distracting noise and the killer can see where it happened on the map. These skill checks really involve no skill and they are random (love it when you get like seven of them back to back...) this also applies to healing sabotaging hooks/traps etc. As a killer you hunt down and kill the 4 survivors and hang them on hooks AND YOU DONT CAMP THEM (sadly most of them do). It has replay but gets boring.5. Save your money for Friday the 13th. Theres a reason this game is cheap you get what you pay for.6. Matchmaking is non existant. Beginning I started with some top level players and killers... JUST starting the game mind you.7. This game is really buggy and often freezes up during matchmaking and has extremely long load times causing people to CTL+ALT+DELETE and then you get to start with 3 survivors. If people leave the match early there is no penalty at all. You just dont get the points.8. I would say roughly 50% of the time I have into this game has been been spent trying to connect to a game or lobby. No joke... My biggest problem with this game is not being able to play it when I want to due to connection errors.https //steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/0/366298942103813048/I cant recommend this game but I have to keep playing it because my friend bought it for me. Which is really sad because I LOVE this game I just get so frustrated with all the bugs and glitches. At least I can say I didnt waste my money on this. Greedy developers are ruining this game. When the game is fixed I'll change my review. Don't get me wrong I dont hate the game I just can't recommend it until they fix it. I wouldnt wish all these bugs and exploits on anyone.4/10 would smash but not in a good way.https //youtu.be/XTrPP3oKlD0https //youtu.be/af3l1lm1yAUEdit It took them awhile but they fixed most of the problems additionally dont buy Friday the thirteenth its garbage. 7/10 would smash",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-22,0,0,6,False,Recommended,The game is still in Beta but the devs are listening. Mistakes are being made but changes are constantly being applied.Pros 1.) The controls are smooth and work well. This is important when reacting to jump scares.2.) Objectives are simple to understand and intuitive. There's a proper learning curve for the minor mechanics such as personal items.3.) Nothing will ever make you lose unless you make mistakes. It's so easy to learn from your mistakes which is so nice.Cons 1.) Players with low levels/ranks (like myself) tend to stick with a very predictable meta/style. This causes an awkward balance/scale The survivors either win super easy at the cost of a single player or everyone dies. This tilt happens constantly and will continue until new fixes occur or a new meta exists. (Will be fixed with time)2.) The levelling system is currently broken. Survivors who escape without scoring enough points can still be demoted there's no method to determine your current score and players who synergize well win fast meaning there aren't enough points for everyone to rank up together. You pretty much have to make mistakes just to earn more points. (Will be fixed with future updates hopefully)3.) The Bloodweb/items currently are either super easy to understand &amp use or is completely vague on how it works. The tutorials as normal with beta releases leaves a lot of information missing.Go watch Twitch players to understand the mechanics of this game. It's a classic game of hide and seek with an adult theme. It's a blast to play and feels ridiculously satisfying to escape the murderer but the odds are blatantly stacked against you. That is what makes it fun.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-22,0,0,108,False,Recommended,"Great game. Love the concept. Hours of fun. Only downside for me is the connection bugs that probably shoulda been knocked out in Beta.

I wish I was exaggerating in saying nothing beats being a lvl 3 monster with your one uncommon perk... against 3 other survivors who have 3 survivor perks all rare or higher. Yep.

2016-06-24,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Great game. The only time where you can kill your friends.Killers! Stop freaking camping! The more times you struck a victim down the more blood points you get. The more you hook a victim the more blood points you get. What is the fun of being a Wraith and just cloaking/uncloaking infront of your hanged victim? God damn it! Stop it! That kind of makes victims disconnect every time.Survivors. Help the killer out. Run around a bit. Jump over . Taunt the killer. Teamwork is important. Save your friends. More blood points unhooking people. If you are crazy enough repair all generators. More points! Troll the killer! Hope the survive with friends mode come out soon.Heck I am just rambling! Thanks for reading!Side note if devs are reading maybe put some description for each survivor and the killers too. Fun to read. A little story won't kill the fun. Are you going to charge us for new killers or survivors?,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-24,0,0,155,False,Recommended,I would like to start this review off by giving my overall experience then i will go into further detail. So that this review can be as helpful as possible.Overall Score 8/10 Fun experience as both survivor and killer but does have some flaws.Looks of game 8/10 It doesn't have the best graphics but it really doesnt need to (will go into this more later)Playing as Survivor 9/10 easy to learn how to control easy objectives overall fun.Playing as Killer 9/10 this is my favorite it is a little harder to figure out but once you do so much funOther Players currently anywhere from a 5/10 10/10 this one is hard because you can have 5 matches in a row with people that don't disconnect don't hop windows etc. or it can happen every match you play in one day.I will now try to break this down the best I can Also this review is the game state of patch 1.0.1 any changes in the game will not be reflected in my review.Starting with my least high score Other PlayersAs of patch 1.0.1 there sadly is a large amount of players that are taking advantage of some design flaws in the infrastructure of the game. Here is a list so you know what to expect 1 If you are playing a game and don't like what is happening you can alt f4 out or disconnect your internet this causes you to leave the game and not lose any addons perks and your rank. (Rank is number one reason people leave a match)2 because of problem #1 it ruins the game for not just killers but survivors a like If you are playing killers your chances of ranking up has diminished and same with survivors so to fix this players have been quiting lobbies as soon as a low rank is seen causing grief for the players that actually earned their rank.3 window hopping I personally have no problem with this but it is discussed in the forums as a problem area for some.4 one problem that players have also caused is the killers camping once again it does not bother me but others see it as a problem.That is all of the problems that I have read about or encountered on my own. Sadly it is not the game's fault but because of people being people the Devs will have to work on this and it sounds like they are.Playing as the Killer Fun exciting. Imagine that your playing hide and seek and your the seeker that is what I think the killer feels like I have no complaints I like all three killers some more than others but thats me. My favorite is the Hillbilly. Playing as survivor I like it i'm not good at it. I always get caught but that is part of the game. It still has its rewarding moments when you escape with the killer right behind you.looks of the game It is not the most beautiful game to look at but it is a horror game that is suppose to be creepy I think that its dull looks make it more creepy so it works out plus it gives gamers with smaller PCs the chance to play.So overall I like the game I feel anybody that likes to get scared or be the scarer will like this game. It has a few bugs but what games doesn't if you want a bug free game then wait. Hopefully issues will be fixed and players will become genuine gamers that want to make the game better too.So I hope this review helped you out and cut right to the point.Jimmy Nerdtron,Dead by Daylight

The bloodweb's design is unique and interesting there is a wide variety of characters so you can never get bored and so on.. Great game really,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-11,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,I rarely give reviews for games.This game deserves one.I have been following the game development for quite some time and I found that the concept was interesting and bought the game 1 2 weeks after launch.The idea of being a psychotic killer hunting 4 survivors is a gore fest / horror movie fan dream of a good time. Gameplay is solid with most of the stuff done in a manner that is fitting for the concept a lone killer versus 4 victims or a survivor trying to escape the brutal stalker.Playing on either side is a challenge on its own right. Ignore the whining on the discussion boards. Some people think that the only way the game is fun for them is to keep on stacking wins in their favor. No doubt some game mechanics are being abused by the community (looking at infinite window cheesers) but steps are being made into making them more risky to keep on prolonging the time spent in a session.Pros choose to be either a killer or survivor (80% survivor 20% killer here) random generator spawns atmospheric music and environmental triggers ( ravens flying away if you get close / heart thumping when killer is nearby) risk/reward management ( do i save this guy or do i get out and leave him behind? )Cons yet to be implemented ranked game with friends (coming soon) infinite window cheesing by some high ranked players penalties for DCing too low no latency meter for survivors to assess connection to killers (game session host)Verdict in the current state the core game is very much solid but will require more updates from the devs. however there's nothing to prevent anyone from getting the game now and figuring out the quirks and enjoying it as it is.tl dr wear diapers you will your pants trying to get away from the killers.10/10 will play in the dark with headphones and scare myself silly. REVIEW UPDATE 05/18/2017 I have long left this game after finding that more and more killer skills and perks being tweaked according to the devs to the point where the killers are disadvantaged and disincentivised in trying to capture all the survivors.playing the killer is now very frustrating.,Dead by Daylight

If you search for game with 2 or more friends it took forever to be matched and sometimes host just left and you have wait for up to an hour or more. The gameplay felt solid but this queue time makes the game unplayable for us. Have to give up the game after just 15hrs of in game time (most of it are waiting),Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,48,False,Recommended,So after long time i came back to DbD and realized that my game doesn't reset to zero(because of the special characters in my name the game kept reseting my game everytime back in the days).I liked the game when it launched but had no fun restarting over and over but now i can say that this game is worth its money.So what is Dead By Daylight?Well in Dead by Daylight you get to choose playing as a Survivor or the Killer. Survivor Part Play in a Group with 3 other persons Restart Generators while doing Quicktime Events (press Space in the marked area and get a boost or if you fail you make a lot of noise) Help your Teammates (Repairs Heal Pick up Rescue off Hook...) Search for Crates which contain Items like a Toolbox or Map Each Survivor has his own Unique Perks and Skills Killer Part You play alone You have a first Person camera while Survivors are in 3rd Person You are faster as survivors (I think the nurse walks same Speed like Survivors but she can teleport) Each Killer has his Own Unique Skill and Perks Hunt people torture them by not killing them instantly (Play with your prey)and then hook em' upAlso you can Unlock Perks from one Survivor/Killer also for another one so you are not forced to play only as one survivor/killer (the unlocking Part takes long tho).After jumping into the Game i really had fun playing as Killer and Survivor. So yeah i give this one a Thumbs up and i recommend it. If you don't like this one you might go check out Friday the 13thstore.steampowered.com/app/438740/Friday_the_13th_The_Game/,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-05,0,0,13,False,Recommended,I really enjoyed this game when I first bought it. I play both sides fairly frequently and I think it's really original and fun. My big problem with the game is that if the host (killer) doesn't have a strong connection everyone in the game is punished for it with so much lag and jumping that it makes the game unplayable for survivors. This isn't an issue in every game but I didn't pay for a game that can only be played about 75% of the time.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,20,False,Recommended,The game is great to play especially with frineds however some things need to be changed. Firstly the speed of the killer is way too fast. To fix this you could make it so that the survivor is as fast as the killer on full health (or near the same speed) then when the survivor is hit he is slower just as is now. The next change i feel is necessary is the red scratch marks all over the floor and walls as the survivor runs from the killer. Me and my group that play the game together also feel as though this ruins the game as there is basically no way to hide from the killer as he can just see your path. We would like this to be removed to endulge us in a more thrilling game environment.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,57,False,Recommended,First of i see a lot of mixed reviews about this game but i believe it is a great game that has the potential to be loads better. a lot of people i believe write there reviews without giving the game a chance or reading the development twitter. here are some points i have en counted and my taught on the matter1) play ranked with friends so many people rate this game badly because its not implemented yet they are working on it once this is added it will be a lot more fun to play as strategy can be talked over online chat with other friends in the same game. they are vocal about developing it people need to chill with the hate about not having this feature im sure people want a good implementation that take longer to develop than a buggy quick one2) no new content just bug fixes I have seen this a few times guys the game is like 2 week old some games do not even get bug fixes after like 6 weeks I my self would rather see a stable game before adding in content to something that is broken. The creates seem active in the development I like that my suggestion to make it better1) few balancing issues or even make escaping more skilled like a generator spinner for the super quick but for getting off hooks obviously this would have to be hard and balanced once off the hooks I believe it would be good it it stunned the killer if he was in a close proximity this would make escapes to be skilled to get them off the hook but camping is not an issue2) proximity voice chat so if you are close to a ally you can chat to them maybe if you spoke to long the killer could see it like befor if its balenced it would be nice to seethings I like1) level tree perks and items I love seeing progression in a game and this makes you feel like you are getting somewhere while being benefiting at the same time how the map can be influenced by offerings brings you closer into the game2) the maps these are well engineered and flow nicely making both player and killer have to play smart to kill / not be killed. Overall its a game that I would recommend and the bigger the player base the more the players voice can be heard to make changes hope you find this helpful don t blame me if you don t like it its not every ones cup of tea but I like it give it a solid 9.4 / 10,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-23,0,0,56,False,Recommended,"A very creepy asymetrical horror game it has a great atmosphere and you can choose between the killer or be a survivor. Feel your heart racing as you escape from the farm with the killer right behind you or curse others for revealing your hiding spot! The price is great considering how much fun you will get out of this. I've had a ton of laughs playing with my friends doing our ""Drunken Dead by Daylight"" parties where everyone keeps failing skill checks and the killer can barely catch anyone. Some cons Still farily buggy after recent release some bad ones are ones where you cannot pick the survivor up or people getting stuck etc. they're patching quite a few things it's good to see a very active dev team Some annoying issues such as too much window vaulting people disconnecting if they think they are going to lose No queuing with friends you can only host a private lobby with them.

2016-09-19,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Review revised for balance issues.Okay let's get this straight. The game's buggy as hell. Progression and matchmaking is unbalanced new players can be stuck up against vets. The Killer player is the host and can easily lag switch for free kills. The maps aren't all balanced properly. XP progression's disabled when you're playing a custom game (to prevent farming).However this game is a hell of a lot of fun regardless. It's got such potential for badass moments like saving 3 of your friends from a creepy basement while being stalked by an invisible ghost. Or hunting and downing a player then using them as bait to draw in their friends.If this goes on sale and you've got a little patience grab it.

Fun game short matched and always intense if you pay the survivors. it wont get boring either because there is almost always progression in perks etc. playing the killer is fun to you are powerfull and you have control over the match although you are powerfull you realy need to step it up because time is not at your hand. i rated this game a positive because ive played it over and over and i wont get bored of it. BUT there are alot of things that are frustrating i almost want to give it a negative score but after playing that much i just simply cant. negative points are bugs rank system and frustrations. there are alot of bugs like getting stuck no matches found laggs dc's etc.rank system is just a total waste it wont match you with ranking as far as i encounter. frustrations is the worst.... people leaving rage quits campers trolling and alot of these things getting you screwed.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-02,0,0,215,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Played sufficiently enough and I love the game. Adrenaline junkies out there this is the game for you. It's got all kinds of things to offer for both competitive and casual players. Now for the dirt though Personally I think this game should still be labeled as BETA. There are way too many bugs to consider this a full release. I'd list the bugs but then we'd be here all day. The Devs are wonderful and working hard but it was too soon to release this game as a full. I'd say this game is 3/5 currently but if they can fix the bugs this game will be easy 6/5 play it 24/7 status. Overall get the game still the bugs are numerous but the game itself is just too fun despite the bugs. Once the bugs are fixed and playing with friends are added then this game is hugely fun.EDIT1 With the survive with friends now available to rank players this game has become infinitely more fun. Despite the matchmaking it has made surviving easier now that you have that communication with your friends be it in steam chat or off client server chats. that communication gives survivors a hidden advantage despite survivors being nerfed not only in terms of perks but in terms of juking the killer. There are still bugs and yes as i said you may still have unfair matches of all rank 20 survivors versus a rank 10 killer but the game changer is the play with friends. It used to be I get on and die so quick thanks to strangers leadin the killer to me while i am sabotaging but with friends they lead the killer NOT in my direction and we all typically win. This game is definitely worth grabbing and when more players join this game I am sure they will make a more solid rank matchmaking system where the matches will be more fair. Get this game even if you don't have friends you may make a friend or two from this game.EDIT2 With the new Last breath chapter the survivors are seeing a collection of nerfs and killers are getting buffed. It has come to a point basically where hiding from the killer will be near impossible without some high coordination and high end perks. It is really frustrating as well that the game still has not done anything to punish killers for camping hooks. It is impossible to save a friend if a killer does not move after hooking you. the killer can just afk there and know that you cannot be saved. Also the trapper in the game has an addon that instantly downs survivors that step in it which is a problem should he put it under you if you are hooked. no one can save you unless they sacrifice themselves but then technically that means someone is still being sacrificed. The new perks for the nurse on top of the general perks makes it impossible to dodge the vision of the killer and it practically demands that you have to be faster than the killer to avoid him. The new update even brought in more bugs as well and survive with friends might as well be thrown out the window. You can queue with your friends for 30 minutes and when a match is found you DON'T actually get in with your friends as someone gets thrown out and replaced with a random. This is even more frustrating since they removed the icons on top of the survivors that shows their names and rank. I am ok with rank being hidden but the names is something that needs to come back cuz we want to know if we are playing with our friends or with a random. EDIT 3 with the fixes to campers and queuing this game is now worth it. Ranking system is a bit flawed but with the game design it will not matter. this game is still great for those who crave the adrenaline and this game is fun with friends (obviously). not to mention cosmetics are now available to the killer finally (if limited).,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-23,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I originally heard about Dead By Daylight through a streamer I watch on youtube. Watching her play I was immediately intrigued by the gameplay. I finally bought it and I have never been happier with a game especially for the price. I could literally play this game for hours if my hands could handle it. It is so addicting and scary and fun all at the same time! I really love that the makers of the game are always trying to work on the game to make it better. It has come a long way from when I first started playing and I cant wait to see where it goes next. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves 1st person /horror/ survival games. The best part of the game is that you can play with friends! It makes it a ton of fun especially when youre playing as the killer against them. Each month the ranks reset that way you have an incentive to keep playing. You never get tired of this game! The only bad thing about this game that they havent fixed yet is if someone decides to leave the lobby/match you have no way to report it at least that I know of currently.

2018-05-06,0,0,2258,False,Recommended,"I think it's safe to say we've found a game I'm just as addicted as Left 4 Dead. ) Can't get enough of it I actually get excited when I think about future killers for the game. I hope they add a meta morph someday. Someone who can change shape to look like a teammate or a generator. It's totally my new favorite game! . That being said there are a few things that could be balanced a little better. I play for fun usually but for those who enjoy making rank the system is overly complicated and it's gotten even more difficult to make rank after recent changes were put in. It would be great for both killers and people if they simplified it a bit. Some of the killers are also a little over powered. While I don't usual play killer I do love playing Freddy and having the ability to constantly know where everyone is it does make me feel like a little kid on a power trip though. This ability is a little over the top but not as annoying as the Pig Lady the killer from the ""Saw"" chapter. While it is a really cool idea to have to get the reverse bear trap off your head it changes the game completely making it basically impossible for whoever has been trapped to continue playing. If anyone finishes a generator it starts the timer on the trap and if the person playing the killer chooses to they can go against her character and just kill you. They don't even have to give you the chance to try to get the trap off. Really the only way to get around it would be to get all the gens close to done make sure no one has a trap on their head and then set off all the gens at once. But that's pretty difficult even if you have a well coordinated team. Her character would have been amazing with her stealth ability and the skill to see the last generators being worked on but the traps push her into the realm of irritating and frustrating to play against. There isn't even a real counter against it aside from everyone working together which without mics is pretty hard to do. With everything that goes into this game it's pretty amazing that I only have those two complaints for it. Everything else is pretty awesome. I hear there's a lot of toxicity from some people but I've only seen it once or twice myself and in all honesty that's not something the game makers can control. This game is amazing and as a horror movie fanatic I totally approve. .",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-26,0,0,3,False,Recommended,This game is fun haha no matter all the trolls and people that leave the lobby because you arent good in level wise just wait there are still great people on this game to team up with. When it comes to balance this game isnt that far off despite all the reviews. When it comes to it this game is about outwitting a single person which is fun to sneak away and do or fail at.The only thing about this i dont like is how you know how a game is going to end within the first 4 minutes If your team is able to coop and sneak out a generator within this the survivors will most likely win.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,7,False,Recommended,This game...Where do I even begin?As a survivor this game is nerve wracking. You're constanly looking over your shoulder listening wondering... But you've gotta stay cool. One wrong move and you're done. Especially if you've got an attentive persistent killer on your tail. Which segways into my favorite aspect of the game being the killer.Literally everyone is your . If you want them dead they die. While you can bully one survivor while he's hung on a hook your attention to only him/her will cost you dearly as another survivor may activate a generator. You have to be brutal but very aware of what's happening around you.Sound is crucial to this game from both sides. If you don't have a headset I recommend you get one before playing this.10/10Would slash again.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,17,False,Recommended,I don't usually write reviews but I felt I needed to for this game. I basically want to communicate to everyone thinking of getting this game that it is a really fun time. It has some trilling gameplay and offered a fresh new experience to me and my group of friends. I think this really is a diamond in the rough but there is so much potential. The developers are asking a fair price for what is offered and with a few quality of life improvements (letting people play in groups in online match making) and some new survivors/killers this could be a great game for a long time.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,223,False,Recommended,I dont write a lot of reviews but with this game i just had to go out and talk about it. I bought this game and started playing it about 5 days ago and I have been playing it hours and hours a day since then. This game is very intense and a ton of fun to play alone with random people or with friends. I love the stealth aspect of the game when being a survivor and hearing the music and heartbeating makes it so much more intense and scary. There are still a lot of bugs with the game i notice it mostly when your dying and being rescued from the hook at the same time your body can be floating above the ground on your screen but on other screens everything is normal. But this is still a fairly new game and I'm sure that will get sorted out soon. Still a fun game none the less. One thing i would recommend is more character customizations and maps (im sure more will be added in the future anyways). One cool map idea would be inside an asylum or some big building with plenty of rooms floors and a front/back door to escape. Being chased in corridors would be insanely intense and scary/fun!,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,Feels like being thrown into an arena with a fork in your hand. One of the most frustrating experiences as gamer and I've been playing for 30+ years. The game lacks information almost on every department for example I received a daily task that i just simply don't know how to complete then I found out that to do it I need very rare item so I tried to move on tried to cancel the daily quest but I can't because I don't know how I tried reading the manual visiting forums playing the game for hours but the learning curve is extremely steep and you seem to be going to need hours and hours of experience to get good in the game and receive items that really make a difference.If you play against people that know what they're doing be prepared to lose in the most humiliating way possible. I just can't remember feeling so humiliated by a game in a very very long time. Just asked for a refund but I know I will not get it because I played it for nine hours trying to get a sense of the gameplay. What a terrible experience.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,96,False,Recommended,What a great game! I love playing as The Trapper! So much fun chasing folks around (sometimes literally around and around something!) and then slashing them with your homemade machette! Picking them up and hanging thme on a hook set a trap or two around them and back to the hunt (no camping survivors cry about it lol although it is a legit tactic its more fun to hunt others hope that one gets away to catch again more points). Yeah the game has a few issues what new game don't especially one like this. But it is SO much fun!,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-26,0,0,409,False,Recommended,10/10 my game committed suicide now i cant join any games/lobbies cant even play with friends in private lobbies,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-18,0,0,111,False,Recommended,This game. What can I say. I love it but there are many issues. So the genral basis of the game is a 4v1 survival horror in which 4 survivors have to turn on generators to open this escape door to win while the killer has to find and down all suirvivors and then play hooky with them by hoisting them up on a hook. I love the 90s slasher flick theme to the game and think the gameplay is very fun but there are some issues. 1st the matchmaking sucks. It takes multiple clicks to actually join a lobby whilst playing as a survivor. Sometimes it's so bad you may have to furiously spam the button for it to work. This gets quite annoying. 2nd the hitboxes are really bad sometimes. You could be playing as a killer and be pretty hot on a survivors and swing but not hit them even if they were right in front of you. The same happens to a survivor but in the opposite way. You could be running and be looking back and see that the killer is at least 7 feet away yet he will swing and hit you. The same can happen when jumping through windows amd sliding over barracades then even while you're off of it you'll get grabbed and then screwed. It becomes annoying and I don't know if it's a poor connection to the killer (since the killer hosts the matches) or just super glitchy hitboxes. 3rd the community can be pretty annoying. No one likes to play against a but this game unfortunatly has many. I don't think I'm the only one who get's aggrivated when I get hooked and the killer stands in front of you not moving. It's called killer camping and it gets fustrating for it makes it nearly impossible to escape. I wish that there was some sort of like penalty for staying within a certin range of the survivor on the hook like maybe you only get half the points for the kill instead of full? It just is an annoying way to have a game end when you were doing so good them maybe a teammate needed help so you did then you pay the price. Also survivors that taunt the killer in the escape doors at the end is not cool too. Just leave so then a new game can start. 4th there are tons of little glitches like animation glitches heartbeat glitches(it might not go off when the killer is directly behind you)((and I don't mean for the Wraith))) things that may not be gamebreaking persay but do need to be fixed sometime soon. Well I've ranted on enough about the bad so time for a bit on the good. 1st the game is great for making you feel suspensful. The feeling you get in your own heart when your heartbeat in game goes off is awesome. It feels like you are in that situation and that you do have to survive. 2nd the music is great. While it may not be a huge soundtrack to the game the way they use the music they do have is cool. The closer the killer is to you the louder and more suspenful the music gets. It's like that to make you panic and try to run when that's usually what you shouldn't do. It's mind games really forcing you to go against your flight insinct. The music for whe you are chasing a survivor is this cool chase music with a very powerful drumming and I enjoy it. 3rd the leveling up system feels unique. You have this Bloodweb for either side of the coin(killer or survivor) and you have to aquire the in game currency called Bloodpoints. You get these for doing various things in a match. You see a list of things layed before you and have to spend your Bloodpoints to fill the web up to collect them all to move to the next character level. Eventually you will have to spend these point wisely to get what you want quickly. 4th I love the maps. Right now there are only three loactions in game of places where the action takes place but they all are directly from horror movies. A creepy abandoned mineing site an old slaughter house farm and an old car wrecker shop in the middle of the woods. They all are great for setting the atmosphere of the game. Middle point The rank system can be considered good or bad It's a system where you either have to win a lot of matches in a row to level up or survive a lot of matches to keep it up. It's challenging but alos can casue people to play cheaply and in a douchey way i.e survivors completly forsaking teammates in need and camping killers. All in all I love this game. I love the slasher movie theme the survival aspect and the gameplay. It reqiures you to play smart and work hard. At the end of the day teamwork works the best. The developers are still hard at work to make the game better fix bugs and add new content. I love it a lot even though I do get fustrated with killers who camp slow matchmaking wonky hitboxes and animation bugs that cause a charcters hair to stretch across the world(yes iv'e seen this often). I think the game has poterntial to be huge if the developers fix glithces and change a few things to make the game funner. I love it and if you like slasher movies survival games game where you can hunt people suspense inducing games and a good ol demon sacrifice then you'll enjoy this game a lot.,Dead by Daylight

THere is cheesing in every game and guess what if the person is doing window hoping leave them and go get someone else because they are not at the hatch they are not rescuing teammates and they are not activating generators they are purely wasting your time by avoiding you and distracting you so if you are standing their playing into their distraction then thats bad on you.

Also it uses player host networking meaning that if the host has a terrible connection everyone else will also lag. This also means that you can build a lag switch and if you are host then you can make everyone lag and then unlag. They promised 6 month ago to change host to every player in the game but as of now the only player that can get host is the killer. I am not going to talk about the bugs this game has and how unbalanced it is. Also 90% of the perks are useless comparing to other ones and devs consider that nerfing that 10% of the perks will actually help. Hillarious.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-10,0,0,149,False,Recommended,The game is really intresting one of the best co op horror games Ive seen yet. Even if you dont have any friends to play with it still can be really fun. Killers are unique in their own way and the offerings can really have a nice turn on the game such as a no/dim moonlight heaver/lighter fog more luck or bloodpoints to gain and you could be lucky for a map change as well! (..But for the love of god let us use offerings for the dlc maps to be burned why have them if we cant ACTUALLY use them?) The bloodweb is really nice too the more you play the more you earn to help you have a better chance to survive or kill easier. However you may get some killer campers but rarely ever now I only see them around once every 20 games.I highly recommend this game to anyone even if they are trying horror games for the first time. This was my first horror game and I love it. There is more to this game but its better to experince it for yourself.,Dead by Daylight

He was level 1 when I logged in offline so I assumed that all of the stuff was saved online and I simply didn't have access to it. I logged in again in online mode and nope it's still gone.This is honestly the last straw this game has matchmaking three hour plus killer queue times incentives for survivors to disconnect mid game instead of just ing playing the game and now it deletes all of my hard earned perks. this I'm out. Developers shouldn't have let this out of alpha. The Forest is in alpha and it has better multiplayer than this garbage. It also doesn't delete my stuff for no ing reason. It also doesn't reward you for ragequitting. How the hell this was allowed to be a full release is beyond me. Seems like the devs all used to work at Ubisoft.I wanted this game to be fun and it's a great premise but it's littered with bugs and poor gameplay decisions.

But if you don't have 3 or 4 friends to play with then I'd say maybe pass on this one for now and look into Damned.Side note the lobby system really is just inexcusable. Seriously what is this 2004?

2018-04-06,0,0,162,False,Recommended,This game is amazingly fun. It has loads of content and frequent updates for both the killer and the survivor. It might appear repetitive but every match always plays out differently. I stopped playing this game for a while since the killer side was terribly unbalanced. Killers used to be a joke and would get bullied hard by survivors. Currently though if you are a skilled enough killer you can almost always guarantee at least 1 kill regardless of the circumstance. Don't get me wrong though this game still needs a lot of work. Survivors simply get too many chances (Decisive strike). The most broken feature by far is Survive With Friends which can give survivors critical information about the killer (location perks etc.). Killers should get bonuses or buffs when facing a group of SWF since they are obviously at a tremendous disadvantage even with top tier killers. Obviously not every SWF group is impossible to deal with but a lot of them are. Still the game seems to be in a good state and appears to be headed in a promising direction. Buy it if you are looking for an intense heart pumping experience that is addicting as hell but can be frustrating at times.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-27,0,0,55,False,Not Recommended,After originally giving a positive review on this game I actually had to make a point to go back and change my opinion. The lack of stability with this game is extremely infuriating. I find myself struggling to get into servers sometimes spending 15 20 minutes waiting only to find that some of the team has left upon starting the match because it took so long. This stands true even when playing with friends and already having 3 out o the 4 required survivors... Joining servers is often nearly impossible!,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-18,0,0,106,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight or better Dead my loading Screen?The idea of the game is brilliant and when it comes to the point where you play a game with or without friends its really fun and thrilling beside some camper noobs and some bugs.The real Problem is the queue. Most of the time you cant join a game and if you were able to its mostly the killer lagging out and lose connection so the game crashes. With the new update it worked for a short time but now i tried 50 times to join a game as a single player which wasnt a problem before the big patch with nurse killer came out. Now i werent able to play for the whole evening and guess what i payed 20 for a not working software. Seems not right yes ?So here is my tip for all of you who want to buy the game. Wait and follow the rewiews. When you see reviews that tell that the queue system is fixed then buy it. If thats not the case buy some game that works and wait. Update 22.08.16 The queue was fixed and the game is now playable. The Dev Team messed the queue again up in a previous update but then there was the last update where they fixed bugs and now you can find games easily. The game is now definetly playable. There are some grafic bugs left and there is still no punishment for leaving players but in general its now a really good game in the early phase with a lot of potential. Update 25.08.16 Because of unknown reasons the queue is again not working for groups of 2 or more. The Solo queue is still buggy and also works worse. This might be the result of an bad algorithm or to few people playing the game to make the existing algorithm work. Update 28.08.16 It seems like the queue is in general fixed. Maybe there is a problem with grouping players when there are a bit few people to match but im positive that the developers can do it and improve the game to a level where it is fun to play Update 31.08.16 a New Patch Update Message was implemented very nice ! the queue is totally messed up again. I really dont understand what those dev's do with it but was only possible to play 1 freaking game in 2 hours with a 4 man premade group. Really poor. Update 18.09.16 Lets talk about the last 2 weeks of this game. As you can see i reduced the gametime by quiet a few hours but still there are some i played. An lets be honest. I played 3 games. 3 GAMES !I mean wtf xD I sit there and wait several hours just to play one hour in total. That seems quiet unfair. I guess i will stop playing for now until a patch is released that fixed the queue.And i will report the game to be removed from buying until this is fixed. Update 05.11.16After a 2 month break i gave the game a new try and FINALLY the queue is working. I cant tell when within the last 2 months it was fixed but now the game is a playable game. New DLC isnt free I was a bit upset but well nearly every game has DLC's that arent free so im not really suprised it has come to that point here too. But the game is still good without dlc ) Update 23.12.16Today i was the first time happy a game was canceled haha. The Anti Cheat System works pretty well as i experienced a lot less cheating the last days playing ) Update 13.01.17The first Friday 13th in year 2017 and im very sad that the queue system is now a it more optimized but its still unable to match a group of 4 survivors with a single killer within less than 20 minutes. Very confusing. The Dev's argue around that problem by telling us something like Ohh the single players are priorized but i guess thats t. Whats so complicated to implement something like this if(groupsize 4 &amp &amp waitingtime &gt 10minutes) set priority high ??? Update 16.04.17Queue is working fine today so i guess its fixed. Good Job keep up the good work!.,Dead by Daylight

Killers hitting you from many feet away be it through a pallet window etc. It's an issue and has yet to be addressed.Another issue that has yet to be addressed is playing with your friends. If you are trying to play ""survive with friends"" after every game you have to back out of the lobby and reinvite your friends which is kind of a pain but not an absolute dealbreaker. It is kinda unfortunate that the game has been out for 2 years without a fix tho.All in all this is a very fun asymmetrical strategy game.

2018-07-21,0,0,984,False,Recommended,This game is not balanced for ranking purposes I would suggest that you rank up to rank 1 for the achivements if you'd like and then just play the game how you want to. Survivor gameplay is too easy and killer is a bit of a challenge but I would not say that it's hard because it's not once you learn the mind games and such. I do believe that the devs are making good changes so far and I do hope they'll eventually forget about balancing it around rank 20's and such (AKA Low Ranks) and base the game on higher ranks because that is what will make the game more fun and obvisouly some gimmicky perks as well. It's still fun to play and it's EXTREMELY easy if you're playing with your friends or at least 2 people that know what they're doing. I would recommened at least trying this game to see if it's for you and if it's not you can just refund it within 2 hours of game time but don't expect playing a killer to go so well the first few days you play.,Dead by Daylight

First Game Lobby If you play with only friends you gonna have bugs. For example 5 Player. One opens one can join instantly. So far so good. The third has some problems gets kicked out but after a couple of times he can join. The fourth pretty much the same but just more time. The fith one CAN NOT ING JOIN. AFTER JOINING THE GAME BREAKES DOWN.Second survive with friends Are you serious? At first bring a patch of 60MB to implement it and then after a few minutes they reverse it... with another 60MB ""UPDATE"". WTF? Then it is finally implemented. Cool finally... BUT WAIT! WE CAN ALSO UP THIS ONE! The lobby is joinable like mentioned befre kinda buggy. After everybody joined you just have to click ready and it is going to find a game after a five seconds countdown.

The game is really easy to get addicted to. I guess you could say i'm *hooked*. Pun 100% intended. The game has a simple concept of 4 survivors 1 killer but is extremely complicated when you add in all the items perks and addons you can get in this game.Playing as a survivor is fun and challenging while trying to get away from the killer. While the Killer is also fun and satisfying when you get or kill someone in the game. Finally in my opinion this is a must have steam game!

2016-12-22,0,0,801,False,Recommended,"I bought this game after the recent free weekend ended. I gotta say it's an addiction to me.The option ""Survive with Friends"" simply mean premade team for Survivor up to 4 survivors. While in ""Kill Your Friends"" you can invite your friends as survivor and you kill em. You can see reviews from other I ain't gonna say much but do search for gameplay video(not beta version)This game is great what's making it imperfect is the glitches while you're in queue for a match(applied on killer or survivor) you'll be automatically quit to main menu or worst blop into a screen where your background wallpaper is the DBD icon pulsing animation while the main menu interface is still there but not functioning although clickable. This forces you to restart the whole game just to start a new queue again.Another turn down for this game is the server though if theres' enough amount of player I personally believe dev team will start their dedicated server for this game.The reason I don't complain about gameplay is because we doesn't even have enough player and having problem getting in a god damn game. I'm just protizing core problems before go deeper. Now I have met some friends whose facing data save lost problems (Was shown to me through screenshot they have full bloodweb system at lv0 character.) ??? What?! Oh also I played with him for around two hours and when I played with him again after that his character is lv0 again(He was lv6 something.)23 December 2016Overall rating 7.5 out of 10I think I'll give 8.5/8.9 atleast when 2 of these core problem are solved.",Dead by Daylight

2018-05-27,0,0,292,False,Not Recommended,This game was one a true gem. One of the most funnest and awesome games i ever played. Playing killer was challenging but very doable. Playing survivor was a little bit easier than being a killer but still a challenge. Now the game is a pile of disgusting boring rubbish. If you plan to buy this game to play killer. Dont. The new system has made it virtually impossible to enjoy. Even if you get a 3 4 kill its the most toxic vile crap i have ever played. You have over 10 killers to choose from and yet only 2 are any good at the moment. And if you cant aim with them (hillbilly and nurse) then your f****d. Every other killer is weak as hell. If youre playing survivor make sure you play with 2 or 3 friends. If you play alone and get caught you will be camped. and camped hard. Before the emblem system came in you would get the odd camper now though because its so hard for killers 9/10 games if you get hooked you will be face camped. Plenty of people will moan about this but even as a survivor i cant moan as its infuriating.If youre looking for a game that is easy with a few friends then play this. if you play survive with friends in a group of 4 49 games out of 50 all 4 of you will survive.The game is boring now. Its infuriating to play as a killer because pallet loops are way too easy and theres way too many pallets on maps. And its just a bore as a survivor because once the killer finds 1 person itll take him 2 3 minutes to hit them once an by that time 2 3 gens are done. By the time the killer catches your team mate all gens are done you get so few bloodpoints that playing survivor just isnt worth it. All in all this game was once 10/10. But with the changes they made this is now a must avoid at all costs. Its just turned too Pathetic. Theres zero challenge anymore.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-27,0,0,239,False,Recommended,The game itself is pretty good but the problem that should be solved in addition to the animations that are bugged from time to time is the multiplayer system. I do not understand why I can not win blood with friends or not being able to play online with a friend being one a murderer and another survivor. In the Hearthstone the gold gain system with friends is pretty good and I do not understand why you can not replicate with this game. You should also be able to buy the murderers and survivors with blood as has the Rainbows Six Siege system that your players' cup has increased for that reason. I give the game a 6/10 because it has many things to solve being that they have been with the game for 2 years. I hope the developers someday listen to the community or finally listen to my message to have a better game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-26,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Anyways I don't usually write reviews but I just had to share a story in this game.I was a survivor. Our team tried our best to win but the killer had been outplaying us the entire game and eventually it led to a hook fiesta where eventually everyone on the team was downed in the same area. The killer seemingly satisfied starts to pick up the survivors.Suddenly.One by one the survivors DC. The killer helpless watches as the fruits of his hard work slip away as the survivors in a fit of salt and rage all disconnect. Meanwhile I'm still on the ground watching this happen. I'm considering disconnecting when he picks me up. Instead of hooking me on the hook right infront of him he rapidly shakes his head cloaking and uncloaking. He takes me to a generator. He starts furiously beating the generator with his club. He lets me wiggle free and repair the generator. When I finish he swings and downs me. Perhaps he wanted to give me a little more points before my defeat. However instead of hooking me he takes me to another generator and beats that one with a club too. We repeat the process.Once I'm finished repairing the generator the killer downs me once more. I'm sure he just wanted to give me a couple more points so I don't lose my rank. He carries me in the direction of a hook. Just as I thought the journey had ended he walks right past the hook and plops me down on the trapdoor. I spin circles in the ground trying to indicate that he deserves a victory. He just looks at me solemnly and slowly nods looking as I'm still spinning on the ground. He turns away cloaking and leaves me alone. I escape. Bless you Gaz.The game is great with a few bug fixes and a few balance reworks I can feel that the game will be much better in the future. Devs also seem to listen to the players and party queue and window cheesing reworks seems to be coming soon. Few issues like disconnecting problems but overall game is fun and very enjoyable.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,24,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A very fun game with edge of the seat excitement and absolutely a must for anyone who enjoys playing group co op games... but only when it works properly.Don't know if it is just the free weekend but the wait times are immense and sometimes even trying to queue up into a quickplay creates a game breaking glitch where it never loads you into LOADING a lobby. The download rate for new maps is extremely intensive as well so if you are playing with new players sometimes the maps can take up to 10 minutes to load and by then most of your team has left.Another thing is that when there are less than four survivors things are grotesquely not in your favor. The game does try to give you a break and requires one less generator per survivor that left BEFORE the game started (youre SOL if they disconnect mid game. They might as well have died on you) but this is no where near balanced enough as losing a survivor is much more of a loss than one generator is a gain. I have yet to win one of the many 3v1 (or 2v1) games that i was stuck in because of this problem. Sure you can leave as well but you basically over the person left behind and lose any items you might have tried to take with you.They desperately need to increase their servers to take on the load they are getting for the free weekend and they desperately need to correct their game breaking bugs.That being said if they correct it this game would be outstanding and a must for any horror lover.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"I really wanted to like this game. The concept genre and setting were right in my wheel house I LOVE horror based games. I decided to give this game a try during the 'Free"" weekend with the strong intention of buying it. I'm really glad I decided to try before buy.I played the game less than a couple of hours but during that short time I ran into numerous game breaking problems. I had to CTRL ALT DEL and kill the tasks several times when I was caught in a ""waiting for the match to start"" cycle. At one point I waited 15 minutes...just to be sure. It's really frustrating to ""think"" that you are about to start a match and then you just sit and wait...and wait...and wait... until you have to kill the program.The game also seems to host on the Killer's system. So whoever is the killer is the host. This can really cause a wide variety of network based performance issues based on player's proximity to one another and bandwidth etc. I had some games that seeem to run smoothly while in several others all of the characters were skipping frames and rubber banding all over the place. Really a poor experience considering this game is primarily a multi player focused game.There are other issues...but those two issues were enought to tell me that I would really be wasting my time if I purchased and tried to get into this game.

2016-06-15,0,0,43,False,Recommended,"Below as my previous thumbs down but the connection issues seem to be much better and they finally implemented ""survive with friends"". Really fun game that can get the heart pumping. Easy thumbs up if you allow me to play with my friends outside of a private match. Also should allow proximity chat for survivors even if you let the killer hear it if he is close enough. Killers are way to OP to not allow simple communication between survivors.I know it shouldn t be easy for survivors but the invisible killer is a little much... But I could work with it if it maybe took a little more time to come out of invisibility and/or couldn't move while doing so. Or hell even a time limit and cooldown. But the ability to invisible at all times increased speed and take a short time to come out while still chasing...Biggest issue is really the queuing with friends thing. I will change my review immediately upon the implementation of this. Aside from the above this is an amazing game and concept. You truly feel fear at times and for survivors it takes a lot of skill and patience to win. Because of this when you do win it is a very accomplishing feeling.Edit Finally got 2 extra friends to buy the game so we could actually all play together in a private match without joining 1000 lobbies and without fail everymatch someone gets dissconnected.....

2016-08-19,0,0,2140,False,Recommended,"1908 hours in (25 July 2018) The best sign of the game FINALLY starting to go back towards a balanced state is the Survivor mains review bombing Patch 2.1.0 (even though they only got minor nerfs I don't want to imagine how petty they'll be once their beloved crutch Perk Decisive Strike is nerfed). Killer mains and Players who play both sides could finally rechoice with 2.1.0. The devs seem to have gotten the message and I'm thankful for that. As an impartial player of both sides from day one I'm so happy to be able to recommend the game again. 1727 hours in (15 April 2018) The game seems to be taking the first few cautious steps in the direction of some balance again but it's still way too soon to really tell what the devs will break next (yes a running gag that's all too true). The new Emblem System took some pressure off of Killers and punishes Survivors playing the game for and giggles trying to bully the Killer. However none of that addresses the broken core mechanics of the game that hugely favour Survivor if they simply focus on doing their objective instead of clowning about so I'm still not going to recommend it until further changes take place. 1430 hours in (7 November 2017) It's been a long time since my last update to this review. Sadly once again I cannot recommend to buy Dead by Daylight and thus support the Developers anymore. The game is riddled with problems the devs ignore or are blatantly not willing to address and fix. The game becomes a clown fiesta for the Killer from mid ranks upwards. Survivors disconnect to save their crutch items and generally the game is more toxic than ever. People have lost all sense of manners and sportsmanlike conduct. IF there's anything to be abused it will be.Also the developers have just recently acknowledged that they will from now on balance the game for the lowest ranks meaning newcomer and low skilled casual players steamfacepalm None literally no competitive game even if it still tries to be that balances around the end of spectrum especially not the low end. Small changes there have immense balance impacts on high ranks with experienced players.They should fire their statistics guy in all honesty as I have rarily seen such incompetence in creating and interpreting statistics. Most high schoolers would do a better job at that. 906 hours in I think I can finally recommend it again and I'm happy to do so. Patch 1.5. has brought some much needed changes and after adapting a bit to the new mechanics the game finally again feels like it has originally been envisioned by the developers. Killer feels like a powerful killing machine again and playing Survivor is now challenging again across the board something I missed. Unlike many crybabies on the forums (people who exploited and didn't learn how to properly play the game) I know that the game is going in the right direction now and I couldn't be happier. I would have felt really sad to give up a game I've now played for so so long because it was no longer the game I fell in love with almost a year ago. I'm so glad that things changed. Now 757 hours in. Haven't played nearly as much as I used to because the game is going in the wrong direction I can't recommend it anymore and I'm so sad about that. At least not in the current state it is in. Killers get treated as the personal toy of mid to higher ranked Survivors the game is heavily unbalanced and the devs seem to do everything in their might to make it even more so. With the newest update they added 2 perks that once they become the new meta they will make Survivors more or less invincible. Killer mains are leaving the game in heaps now. I don't want to see this game die but the developers are completely clueless about the problems they have and have no idea of their own game in mid/high ranks as they are all low ranked players catering to the need of low ranked Survivors not realising that they give experienced players more and more tools to with Killers. 735 hours by now can't believe that I haven't gotten tired of the game yet although I'm feeling a bit burnt out as Killer you need to be a masochist to play the high ranked games as one but thankfully that is about to change. Still going strong after 566 hours. I can't get enough of this game it's almost like a drug. Absolutely love it. Sure there are bugs and annoying things but most of the time they are minor and the devs are (contrary to popular belief) constantly working on fixing them and keeping the game alive. Alright 373 hours in I'm going to back up my own review. Still love this game ""ORIGINAL REVIEW from 19 August 2016 Absolutely love this game I'm now over 200 hours in and it still doesn't get boring as no two games are the same also there is a big diversity of areas and maps and there will be even more in the future. I recommend it to anyone that likes the horror genre and the Survivors get chased by a Killer theme.P.S. Don't get discouraged by all the negative reviews. 85% of them are by people with very low gameplay time. This game takes several hours to ""git gud"" as you need to learn how to play against each of the four Killers and counter each of their specific abilities and unique play styles. Practice really makes perfect in this game. Same thing applies when you play as Killer you need to learn how all the game mechanics work.""",Dead by Daylight

2017-07-04,0,0,1287,False,Recommended,"This is the first review I have ever written but I thought important enough to do so... I absolutely love this game. The graphics are very good using the unreal engine 4 and gameplay is top notch. I have over 800 hours in this game and very few games have held my attention as long as this one. What keeps you coming back is the intense rush of trying to escape the killer if playing as survivor or the edge of your seat anticipation when hunting down survivors if you are playing as killer. This game lends itself to different play styles in that some survivors will play stealthy and try and hide from the killer others may play bolder and try and distract and harrass the killer by provoking chases. There is a very high learning curve at the beginning. Learning how to play with camera angles gaining experience and earning better ""perks"" will make for a much more pleasurable gaming experience if you can endure past the ""noob"" stage. Some in the community will complain about balance issues the devs are constantly updating the game game with fixes and new content. While the game itself is excellent if I have one complaint there is an associated toxic community pitting ""survivor main"" vs ""killer main"" which can become discouraging to read all the negative comments on the forums over time. I highly recommend this game you won't regret playing it!10/10",Dead by Daylight
2017-07-04,0,0,248,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game and now that I'm approaching 200 hours I think it's time for a review. The devs still have some things they need to work out but just like most games that are constantly evolving the tactics change with them. They've already fixed some issues that were present in the past but I just played a couple of games today that I could definitely see some issues with.1. Killers and survivors being able to blody block. Sure it's nice when you're trying to take a hit for a teammate but honestly you'd be surprised at how many people do that. However when a hillbilly or myers can just camp at the top of the stairs of the basement and charge a chainsaw or just stalk until Evil Within 3 it's kind of broken.2. Pallets are a continous work in progress in my book but earlier I saw a killer glitch through the pallet onto the side the survivor was on the survivor didn't get hit and got a killer stun but I think if someone was to pull a pallet down the killer should be on the side that they approached it from not the opposite side. Needless to say that survivor couldn't escape nor juke the killer because he was too close.3. I think the doctor needs a complete re work. Sure the survivors can't hide from him but he's not that great in a chase and his symprtoms to his madness don't do much especially against high ranking survivors. The doctor is so easy to counter at his current state just do everything as fast as possible and forget about juking and hiding it's almost impossible to lose him and if he get's too close just hide in a locker to avoid your madness going up.Again DBD is a great game that stills needs some tweaking. There's no doubt some killers are a lot stronger than others and some of them don't require the same amount of skill to be good as some of their counterparts. Some survivors perks are pretty game changing too. I'm interested in what the devs are going to do with this game to keep it balanced and make it a bloody deadly good time for both survivors and killers.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-30,0,0,40,False,Recommended,This game is like a shot to nostalgia. I grew up watching old 80s horror movies this game despite its initial simplicity has lore that is a throwback to those times.

2016-06-30,0,0,24,False,Recommended,This game really scratches the itch where I can really try to hide from my enemy where making little noises matter not leaving trails or just managing my time and maneuvers in a way that keeps me alive just a little longer. This game is gruesome albeit tiring when you're spent after all the adrenaline.Just needs more content but for $15? Yeah I'm sold. I wouldn't have spent a dime though if the devs weren't actively patching and working on more features/content. It's good but not really a full package release in its current state.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-05,0,0,1789,False,Recommended,I really love this game. It's an excellent blend of action and horror that becomes more and more addicting each hour you sink into it. But no game is without flaws and this game is a prime example of this. First off the community is absolute trash. There's so much toxicity being passed around the community and there's seemingly no end to it. Second off the balance is verrry off. With a concept like this there's no true way to completely balance the game. You will either destroy or be destroyed. There's camping tunneling pallet looping flashlights infinites and all kinds of other scary words that can make players tremble in complete fear. And if you're not familiar with these terms you are likely new which means you WILL get destroyed. It also doesn't help that it's too easy to stay at lower ranks facing really new players or really skilled players. But like I said there is no true way to balance the game perfectly and let's just all be thankfull that it's not F13. And my final issue with the game has to do with the bugs. The devs seem to try really hard to fix various bugs and do it successfully for the most part but there are a few bugs that can potentially be game breaking and could give either side an unfair advantage. And some of these bugs have been present for MONTHS without being fixed! But like I said earlier no matter how much the flaws irritate me the game is just too addicting to leave. I can recommend this to anyone who plays ANY online games because the constant feeling of adrenaline and progression that shows up in games like CS GO or Civilization is really present in this game and on top of that they add new content every few months that always changes up the game whether you buy the DLC or not. For lack of a better conclusion thiz gaem iz priti neet! C,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-21,0,0,938,False,Not Recommended,"Don't buy this game until the developers fix pallet looping. If you play in high ranks everyone does the exact same strategy and just runs in circles to waste the killer's time instead of trying to get away. It's unfun and the developers still haven't fixed it or really even acknowledge it as much of an issue.8/12/2018 They still haven't fixed it. These devs are bad. They lack direction for which way they want their game to go buffing and nerfing each side of the game arbitrarily and based on player outrage instead of having a clearly defined vision of what they want this game to be. They heavily favor survivors as well refusing to remove another game breaking feature called ""survive with friends"" that allows survivors to choose who they play with giving them a huge advantage by talking over microphones. This was also added to the game by player demand again going against the original vision of the game they had as being a completely solo experience.If you plan on playing this game as a hard core killer your only option is the Nurse.. If you just want to play casually or with friends I'm sure you'll have fun. But if you stick around long enough to reach the high ranks you'll see the flaws as well.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-13,0,0,545,False,Recommended,I loved this game It was scary kept you on your toes and everytime that heartbeat would blare in your ears yours would start too. The consept is exactly what horror lovers will adore.Now the bad part. ALL OF THE BUGS! It's truly ridiculous. Most time when I take an item into the game it shows I have it on my character BUT IT WILL NOT LET ME USE IT or set it down I have to find a chest and grab that item to grab my original otherwise after the match I lose it either way.Daily rituals... I just completed my first daily ritual in a while said I would get so much for doing it completed with no prize tried reseting still nothing.Most times I can not start a match it'll glitch and I will have to shut it down with task manager.Other players are of two sorts. One is very helpful and fun to play with. Others are extremely rude not a teamworker volgur in chat or they enter a match just to leave so you are pretty much screwed that match. The host is the killer and if they have terrible internet they will lag extremely bad and you can not do anything without making mistakes that will get you killed.Perks are a hit and miss. Some work some sometimes work others will not work. Premonition is a perk to alert you if the killer is looking in your direction from so far... Ive got murdered a couple times because it did not alert me. I have been chased and with them directly behind me and it still would not go off and its suppose to work regardless of the killer's perks.Overall parring the bugs it is a great game. But they need to stop doing so many updates for expansions and whatnot and just fix all of these problems.Oh this game will frustrate you to no end.,Dead by Daylight

I can't wait to try the new characters.Edit FInally into the new year we have multiple dlc's out now however I would love to see the developers take a pause on dlc's begin to focus on the game mechanics and start to tweak them. I have been in two bugs where I was never able to move and it showed the map name and the location of the paticular area while small it will eventiually make the survivor's game harder with a player that cannot play. Along with this there are multiple occations where when a round starts a player is unable to join and there is a space between the survior game tags. I would also like to see more of an improvement of map selection and server choosings because too many times I have gone to the same place with the same killer round after round.Maybe input something that will track what places you have been to and what killers you have been put against to help change things up for survivors. Don't get me wrong the game is great but I would love to see a change from pumping out dlc's to working on game mechanics to make the expierience better from giving new content to give a slight change in expierience. It would also be great to have a matchmaking system as well becasue many times you get these killers who you find out are very ranked put players against people with thier own ranks and not putting rank twenites up against rank ones.",Dead by Daylight

2017-07-14,0,0,267,False,Recommended,An unexpectingly addicting experience. You are able to choose from being a survivor or a killer. The game styles are very different between the two and honestly feels like a whole other game. As a survivor you mainly have one objective turn on power generators situated around the map to open the doors of escape. However many things will happen during the game that will challenge you in trying to accomplish this goal. Other survivors can be taken by the killer and placed on meat hooks to die or may be injured by the killer before escaping his gaze. In both scenarios you have to decide if it's worth trying to help your team or continuing on with the objective.Balance wise there are definitely still some issues. One killer called the Nurse is able to teleport. This basically allows her to bypass every obstacle other killers face and she is very strong because of it. Killers who camp the hook are also a problem but mostly for new players. Once you gain experience you realize they are actually giving you time to repiar generators when the killer chooses to camp one player.Overall a fun game that isn't near as repetitive as I thought it would be.,Dead by Daylight

Survivors can gen rush and beat a trail in 5 10 minutes and killers can hook and kill everyone before a genny even gets done.and on top of this everyone is constantly complaining about stupid things that dont need to change and will plug their ears and shout at any and all suggestions.The take away should be Play this game with some friends and casually if you want a good time.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-01,0,0,73,False,Not Recommended,My Initial go would have been to reccommend this game but however after the first couple weeks of me playing it seems to have turned into a game of boosting stats and no fun. Everone tried to join with their friends on the ranged games so they can boost their stats and if you happen to get stuck with them you are the first killed as they give away your position. I played 10 games in a row like this. This game could have been awesome if not for the new gaming community of losers and stat buffers like it Fu*king matters anyways.

There is potential here for an even better experience than this expertely crafted and most importantly fun game already provides. I have no idea what you say to relate to young gamers I'm a 31 year old man who owns 11 games. I picked up on 'Git Gud' which should maybe have an umlaut and those people aren't completely wrong.

Then I found out you can become the killer himself. You'll get a thrill of the chase as the killer chases you with the classic movie music playing faster and faster as the killer nears. Great little skill checks during completing objects and teamwork to survive adds more excitement. Even though I found it easier to throw the other survivors to killer I found it more challenging to help.I find that it gets rather repeatitive the more you play the game.

2018-06-15,0,0,454,False,Not Recommended,This game Dead By Daylight. I will be honest it has a lot of bugs in the game but the idea of it is fun and makes for a good time.The devs are good they are active and constantly bring new stuff to the game not all of it good however but they do their best to fix it/ change it. The game is not balanced in anyway shape or form. Early survivors levels you will get frustrated at the game but as you progress you will then become frustrated at killer at high levels.I really want this game to do well and i think it can all it needs is one change and this game will become a masterpiece. I just feel this game has so much potential and unfortunatly this change would be a hard change but maybe instead of matchmaking by ranks matchmake by hours played.Another problem is that this game has no dedicated servers meaning the games can be very laggy and the game is infested with lag switchers. Dedicated servers will fix this please implement it into the game.

2017-07-13,0,0,215,False,Recommended,With a bit of experience under my belt as both killer and survivor I can say that this game is pretty fun and balanced surprisingly well. Works well both as a competitive game and as a game to play with friends.Playing both killer and survivor offer rewarding but very differing styles of play. Surviving is tense and butt clenching throughout thanks to long action times and high risk high reward situations where killing makes you truly feel like an 80''s B movie horror villain. The game is balanced fairly well in my opinion. I have had a fair amount of matches where most survivors escape and a fair amount where none escape. Almost every game though someone dies. My only real balance complaint is how powerful the survivor perk Borrowed Time is and how survivors are allowed to think because of it.If I were to have any complaints about the game itself outside of balance there are a few obnoxious but uncommon bugs and matchmaking can be a bit wonky at times. I have had games against both rank 1's and rank 20's as a middling survivor/killer. Also the community can be incredibly salty at times. Survivor mains and killer mains are always at odds.I would have to give Dead by Daylight a 8/10. Tense on the edge of your seat survivor play matches the raw power and cleverness of killer gameplay. The game's got a pretty good future too thanks to developers that are constantly working on updates and keeping their community up to date on future plans and changes. Definitely worth the price tag. Get some friends together for maximum YouTube fodder.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-07,0,0,1982,False,Recommended,More of a PSA then a review. It's just not fun for newbies unless you play with friends I think. There's not a fair matchmaking system in place currently. I'd have 5 15 hours on this game and I'd get matched up with survivors who had hundreds of hours on the game. Most games are like this. I couldn't take it anymore and I uninstalled. I definitely regret the purchase. P.S. the community is very toxic. It's nothing like what you see on streams.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-22,0,0,598,False,Recommended,This game is a fun concept and reasonably well executed. Sure it has it flaws but for its price it's well worth every cent if you are into horror/survival type games. You play 4v1 or 1v4 depending on what mode you select.If you play the killer you're in a 1v4 and the 4 survivors need to do 5 generators to open the exit gates and escape. You as the killer need to prevent that. You chase survivors down them with your killer powers and hang them on a hook to die. The game ends when all survivors are killed or survivors are escaped.If you play survivor you're in a 4v1 and need to work together to finish all 5 generators to open the exit gates. You as a survivor need to fix generators rescue people off hooks and distract the killer when your team needs it.It's multi player so every match will be different and it'll stay fresh. The community isn't the best at times there are very toxic people but if you ignore the post chat and just move on you won't notice it that much.After 20 30 hours the 'horror' and 'scare' effect will dissapear but that won't make it less fun.It's my 2nd/3rd most played Steam game. And that for a low price of 20.Please note there are DLCs however you are not forced to buy them. The maps are free to everyone only a new killer/survivor is locked behind money. However they've recently started a new in game way to earn stuff like DLC and Skins in game totally for free. It'll take some grinding but atleast this game uses a healthy MTX system.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-23,0,0,144,False,Recommended,Not gonna lie i've had some issues with this game. At one point my entire game decided to randomly erase itself and all my hardwork in it and the devs after being messaged several times refused to do anything about it which i am still displeased about. But the game itself is fun i enjoy playing it with friends most of all. I do feel that the player community can be a bit difficult at times players often troll or camp in games which can ruin the fun but all games suffer that stuff. I love the variety on the killers each feel unique (except for Leatherface he feels pretty similar to the Hillbilly imo) but i do wish the survivors felt more varied. Each comes with their own unqiue abilities but on survivors they general don't fell unique until ur a higher lvl and u've unlocked their personal perks but by that point u've generally probably unlocked those unique perks for the other survivors anyways (a concept i do enjoy though btw). All in all though i greatly enjoy playing it and look forward to each new killer that comes out and hope that a survivor that brings someone truly unique to the game arrives as well.On another note there are several issues with the game itself. A big one that ppl mention is the community is toxic but honestly who really cares. u have very limited interaction with others so u can ignore players in chat but on the other hand u will often find urself being left to die by selfish teammates who jsut want to survive on their own and let the killer be distracted by their teammates. Camping is bloody heavy in this game. Seriously 2 out of like 3 killers seem to be campers its a really annoying experience that ruins a fun match. Not sure what its called really but the match making system is rather Starting out the game as a tier 20 (lowest tier) lvl like 3 killer and i go against a full team of prestige 3 (u can tell because their entire body is bloody) survs is bs. its no fun. Its easy for good players to cheat the system by letting their tier fall down to 20 while farming bloodpoints then just going against lower tier killers/survs and just wrecking them. It can also be annoying to be a lvl 20 or so tiered surv/killer and see urself put against players who are lvl 10 tiered. a game where u dont even get to play bc ur against a killer with hundreds of hours or survs with the same is pretty irratating. Compared to when the game first launched back when i originally played it the net connection is much better i rarely see survivors dc any more. On the other hand since i started playing again ive had killers dc on me more games than not which sucks. but still much better than before.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,51,False,Recommended,I would like to play with friends but the only way I can is if it is a private match which means 1 of your friends has to be the killer.

2016-06-19,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of potential. Its got a great atmosphere and it can be very scary at times. Im not a fan of the Rank/perk system at all though. Instead it should have been more RNG in game where you find items laying around and start with a random perk to mix this up. Right now people with more time can easily farm up perks and items and stomp players who can only do 1 ot 2 games a day but thats ok i guess. There should have been 2 different ways to queue up. a Ranked mode that is basically the current Quick join and a Play with friends mode where you grp up with your friends against a random killer. and balance it by only rewarded 50% xp To the grouped team but 100% to the killer since he is alone.The survivors need more things to do. Like causing distractions or laying a trap to slow the killer. Also Private games need settings. If im playing with 2 friends and im the killer i want to make it easier for them with game settings by reducing the time it takes to start a generator Stuff like that. Pros Great Atmosphere Scary Fun with 4 other friends Has potential for alot more.Cons Only 1 game mode. Perk system is confusing Not enough character customization Badly optimized (for me anyway) No way to play in Quick game lobby with friends. Private games dont have game settings I have hope for this game and i will recommend it only if you have friends to play with. Otherwise in its current state its too easy to cheat and exploit bad game mechanics to win.,Dead by Daylight

Killers gotta put work in to find these people just to have them dc when they hit the hook. Not fair to us. But that same guy will be sitting at the exit doing the halo dance is we didn't find them.

2016-06-15,0,0,512,False,Recommended,this game is amazing. the only problem with it at the moment is that you can't play with your friends (only private match) and that trying to play as the killer takes litterally more than 30 mins i still havnt played as one and i have 8 hrs of play. they need to fix this issue asap. Also the ranking system is almost as bad as Leauge of Legends where it takes 50yrs to rank up because you will lose your rank from dcing laggy games dying by lag or your team leaves/rage quits which makes you be alone and then you die to a killer which makes you lose your rank.

2016-06-21,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Great game with a lot of suspense and hilarious moments.One of the bigger issues with the game however is that if you play in public games as the killer survivors will disconnect if they feel like they're going to die. This saves them time but screws the killer out of points and there's also a certain bug where you literally won't be able to move as the killer any more if they disconnect while you carry them. That basically makes it pointless to play public games as the killer.If you have 4 friends to play it with though then I recommend it 100%.,Dead by Daylight

(Saw some Let's Plays of DBD before).But the game as it is now (for me) had some really heavy issues. It worked for me to actually join and play a game for only 2 times of 10 tries. Sometimes it just says ""waiting"" when trying to find a lobby and nothing else happens for minutes. In this state you can't even go back to main menu to maybe retry or something. You can just hit ""Alt+F4"". One time when it actually worked for me to find a lobby but I had an infinite loading screen before getting in the game (After 15 min I gave up).This is just not acceptable! If DBD was a free early access game it would be kind of OK but this thing is considered as ""final""and even has some DLCs!!! If I compare this to ""Evolve Stage 2"" which ""finished"" in Beta Status and is freetoplay now this is absolutely ridicolous.

2016-12-17,0,0,82,False,Recommended,Fun game I love the concept of the killers there are some very creepy and well executed designs. Overall game play can be fun when the killer knows what he's doing and doesn't camp survivors. However the game is played with a match making bug that makes it a nightmare to play with your friends. Lobbies kicking everyone or only kicking one of your group members out. You'd think fixing that would be their biggest priority but it isn't. I also feel like some of the newer killers are a little unbalanced like the hag and michael myers. The hag is frustrating because she gets 10 traps unlike the trapper where you have to walk around the map and pick up the traps she spawns with all of them. It's also very annoying not being able to disarm her traps. It is impossible to take the last couple generators with her as the killer because of her stupid traps. Michael myers is also a bit overpowered my only gripe with him right now is how fast he is at his first level. He can get to a max of 3 levels by stalking people its creepy as when you catch him at level 3 he's so god damn fast its insane. All in all its a good game if they fixed the match making bug and balanced the game a little better I would be happy. In my oppinion the only reason they haven't balanced the killers is because they want people to purchase them.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-17,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Playing as the killer is more fun for one reason above all others The killer is the host. If you're going to try to play as survivor you'll be spending time connecting to the host. How much time? Infinity time in some cases. Anyone who's played PayDay 2 will know about how in the planning phase if everyone readies up the game sometimes just won't start. At least in PayDay 2 you can quit out of that host. Not so in Dead by Daylight as once the game readies up a person can be stuck on that loading screen for forever forcing a task manager closing of it.Furthermore as survivor a person can't tell what their ping is to the host. One would think if there's no apparent grouping by locale at least let me know if my connection to the host is garbage so I can find another host. There's no reason to hide such relevant information from me.The lack of information and hours lost to the P2P system being a turd means that half the game (survivor) is going to be locked to anyone without the patience of Job. Being able to play the game is pretty important to me and it should be important to anyone. Pass on it until these issues are fixed.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-17,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,"I have over 200 games on Steam and literally have never written a review.I love the concept of this game. The one time out of six I got to play this game during the free weekend it seemed like it would be a lot of fun. Pretty exciting stuff especially for a horror fan junkie like me.Now for the other five times the game simply hard froze on ""Waiting"" or ""Loading"" screens. I would let it sit for minutes frozen. It should be known the one time it worked it started fast and loaded fast. These issues appear to have nothing to do with my computer (I5 SSD Nvidia 970). I wonder if maybe to many people are trying it on the free weekend and it isn't ready. In any event it such a let down. If I had purchased this game it would have certainly been returned based upon having to use Ctrl Alt Delete more times than I use it typically in months of computing. I would understand more if this was an early access release however I hate buggy problems and do not buy those games for that reason.Maybe this can be perfected in the future.

2016-12-17,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,My computer Windows 10FX 6300 at 3.5 Ghz8GB RAMGTX 750 Ti 2 GBCaveat I only tried it during the free weekend but based on that I'm not a fan of this game. The game balance is skewed heavily in favor of the Monster. Furthermore if a survivor player dies in a match there is no way to respawn so the player is forced to sit out the rest of the match. It's especailly furstrating because Level One survivors have no way to actually attack or fight back against he monsters aside from a few environmental context actions that are very unreliable. The game also fails to disable the Windows Key which means if it's accidentally pressed in one of the game's many frantic quick time events survivors are almost sure to lose. There's a fun core idea in here but it needs a lot of refinement and that's before the technical issues come into play.Credit where it's due the game runs very on my computer even in Ultra settings when it initially launches. But on subsequent attempts the game fails to launch getting stuck and never fully starting up. This would only be a minor annoyance but when the games fails to launch in this way it also prevents Task Manager from starting so I can't kill the process and it it even prevents the computer from fully shutting down or restarting meaning turning the power off and back on is the only way to launch the game again. I don't know if the game has a specific hang up on my machine or if there's just some broken code but at the bare minimum that needs to be ironed out before I'd say the game is worth a purchase.,Dead by Daylight

This game does not appear to have any documented fixes searching for the case of possible network ports only reveals the Steam standard ports which have been fixed on my network for quite some time.It might be the load on the servers from the free weekend. Don't really know. Just know I did not get a chance to experience the actual game and that the issues were enough for me to be frustrated and leave a review that the game has a chance of not working. I'd mark this as a cautious purchase for anyone as it'd really suck to have spent 20$ or more on this only to have it not work. Only saving grace is to remember for those that are purchasing (and not playing on free weekend like me) to remember that as long as you don't about for 2 hours trying to get it working you can refund the game.Immediately after writing this I tried again and was able to play once before the same symptoms showed up again. Any time it fails to join a game the entire UI itself and doesn't allow you to go further.

2016-08-19,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,Dead by daylight is a great idea but failed in execution. There are too many loopholes for both killers and survivors varied on when they buff and nerf each side. It takes a long time to get into games especially when new content is released. After a few weeks of matches the game becomes too repetitive and becomes stale. I would wait for a hard sale to dive into this game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,60,False,Recommended,First of all I'd like to say that I really love this game. It's something I'd been hoping would be created for a while and after it's release I fell in love with the game.As a fan of the horror genre since the early days of Resident Evil 1 Silent Hill and Amnesia I think it's a fun twist to put another human being as the killer as a player with actual thoughts and ideas is much more terrifying than an AI.For people who have been throwing bad reviews to this game sure it has some downsides but every game does. Rather than tossing down a gauntlet and challenging people to internet flame wars as most 'hate posts' do Ignore them. I've yet to see a constructive negative review most people either have a grudge against the publisher or just dislike the game.This game is a must have especially if you enjoy horror and if you have friends who'd like to join in as well.There are a few issues I've been having lately and I know some of them have been addressed in the 'Developers Addressing Major Issues' post but there are somethings that I think may be sort of overlooked.Matchmaking Time to Full Lobby Perhaps it's just my location or maybe just bad luck but often times I find myself waiting anywhere from 5 10 minutes to get a game sometimes up to 10 15 if I feel like playing the killer. I know part of the problem is the current issue of 'Lobby Hopping' since there is no implemented ranked party system at the moment but it seems like a bit more of an issue than that. As a survivor I often am brought to the loading screen and kicked right back to the lobby failing to find a match which tends to increase the time to wait.Lack of Survivor Communication in GameMaybe gestures or maybe proximity voice chat that can be heard by both the hunter and the hunted. I feel like the game ends up being 1v 1 1 1 1 instead of 1v4 because there is a lack of communication and cooperation between players. Simply spinning in circles and crouching down/standing up isn't quite enough to communicate your plans and ideas to your fellow survivors.'Puppy Guards'Ever jumped into a game got hunted down or watched someone else get caught and then watch as the killer stands by them and hits them repeatedly until they're sacrificed? It's a problem currently. Sure you can go grab the generators while he's doing this but it ruins the game for that one person who has to sit there on the hook. Perhaps lower the rate at which the sacrifice ticks down while the killer is nearby or give a lower score to killers who sit within a few meters of the hook. It's not a serious problem per se as there can be ways to deal with it or you can just escape while he's doing this to another survivor but it does ruin the game for the one guy unless they just struggle and let themselves get killed to leave for another game but doing that gives the killer exactly what they want easy points with no downside and allows them to go after another survivor to hang up and sit by for more points. Wash Rinse Repeat.Pick Me Up with Med KitI think there should be a (SLOW) way to pick yourself up if you have access to a medkit. As much as this should be a team game with cooperation without a party matchmaking system currently no one every seems to care about the other players or the coop aspect of the game. You typically have to fend for yourself but once you're downed like that there's nothing to really do except exit the game. Perhaps offer a 'Quick Way Out' to downed survivors so they don't have to DC and lose what points they gathered through the game if a pick yourself up function won't be added.DING DONG DING DONG DING DONGThere are certain spots in the maps where the wraith(And other killers can but it's much harder) can press themselves up against you to trap you there with no way out sort of like corner trapping in older FPS games. Sort of the same issue with Puppy Guarding. The wraith goes invisible sneaks up on you and instead of killing you traps you in a corner in a building and stands there while doing nothing. It's a problem when said player ends up being the only one left and just has to sit there until they get bored and DC or the killer DCs because there's no way around and no way out.These are just a couple issues I found through playing. Great game great concept and great design and I know things are getting fixed up properly. For those of you still questioning whether or not you would like to purchase this game you can always wait to see if some of the issues are fixed in a future patch but I strongly suggest you start playing now as you're missing out on some quality content.Thanks for providing such a captivating and entertaining game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-29,0,0,132,False,Recommended,I am not sure if the devs of this game even read this but this game is great and all until you meet someone who just sits at a window and jump back and forth it as a survivor because there is no possible way the killer can catch them. What the devs need to impliment for survivors is some sort of energy I would love to see someone try to jump through a window 50 times and not get tired. The energy could be used to where if they use it all up they become slower than the killer at performing such things such as the window. The window speed difference was set as an advantage to get out of range of the killer and get away not sit there and watch the killer walk back and forth helplessly trying to get somebody while the rest get objectives. If the killer leaves that survivor then they will just grab the closest generator since the windows are usually next to them. This would give a better balance between killer and survivor. I do recommend this game because when people actually play the game how it is meant to be played it is one of the most enjoyable games out there though.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-29,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Honestly this game has a lot of potential but playing as the killer can be somewhat frustating if a survivor takes advantage of window cheesing.

2018-03-12,0,0,224,False,Recommended,"Dead by daylight is a strange game to review. It has so many problems but is ultimately still an extremely fun game.DBD is an assymetrical competitve experience it involves 4 survivors stuck in a map with 7 generators in order to escape they must completely repair 5 of them which takes around 80 seconds and then open 1 of 2 escape doors to survive. The killer on the other hand needs to hit survivors twice to put them into the dying state basically incapacitated like on left 4 dead. He/she must then pick up the survivor and put them on a meat hook hooking the same survivor 3 times or until the timer runs out will result in a kill. On first glance the basis of the game is simple which is one of the great things it's very easy to pick up and play regardless of previous game experience. However there over time and at higher ranks the game becomes alot more involved for both killer and survivor. This unfortunately is a double edged sword. While it keeps the game interesting and makes for intense chases stand offs and mind games it brings with it some of the greatest issues. It is generally accepted by the majority of the community that the game is suprisingly very survivor biased although I don't believe this becomes particularly noticable until higher ranks. Personally I don't belive the game itself is too unbalanced in its own right. The major inbalances come from the perks and the different killers. Currently there are 12 killers in the game the issue is that many are simply not viable against adept survivors. What makes a killer good? generally speaking is two things the ability to end a chase early i.e a very powerful killing orientated killer or a very mobile killer that has large map control. An example of this would be the nurse now nurse actually moves more slowly than survivors but has a double blink ability after which she can take a swing and become exhausted for a few seconds unable to act. Her ability is not great at finding hiding survivors but is extremely powerful in a chase being able to phase through walls and pallets (survivors drop pallets in the map to stun/block the killer if the killer breaks these they are permanently unusable) this makes it difficult for survivors to lose the nurse once she's found them. Doctor on the other hand is abit of an opposite he makes survivors descend into maddness over time causing them to hallucinate and scream revealing their location he is great and tracking survivors and keeping up constant pressure.Now for the bad part wraith is an example of a ""useless"" killer to many. He has the ability to ring a bell and become kind of invivisble? but you can still pretty much see him he takes 3 seconds to ring his bell and uncloak before he can attack this gives survivors ample time to run away to safety and his ability gives him no way to help in the chase itself so the survivor wastes your time while their team mates rush the generators.And ultimately that is what dbd is a game of time management as a killer for example you have to ask yourself the question do I follow this survivor into a pallet heavy area and risk their team mates completing gens or do I let them go and backtrack to the generators.The other issue is simply the perks most killers/survivors can choose from I think it's over 50 perks. But for some reason only the same lets be generouse and say 8 perks keep coming up that's because they are simply so much better than the others. lets compare 2 on killer for example ( a highly used perk) BBQ &amp chilli vs (a never used perk) monstrous shrine.BBQ and chilli basically does this when the killer hooks a survivor if their team mates are more than 40 or so meters away he can see them through the wall allowing him to easily begin another chase or if no one appears it means that the team mates are close by trying to save their team mate great perk. Then we have monstrous shrine this pretty much decreases the time it takes for survivors to die on basement hooks ONLY by 4%... seriously look at the difference between these 2 perks it's insane and there are so many perks that are like this for survivor as well not just killer.We need more balancing not necessarily nerfs right now more buffs for extremely underused perks for both survivor and killer to make things viable. Monstrous shrine for example why not decrease the time it takes for them to die by idk maybe 15%? something actually noticable.Another small issue I have is that on the 13th of every month ranks roll back. Basically the lowest rank is 20 and the highest is 1 on the 13th these ranks roll back more or less 8 ranks I think so a rank 12 killer is now playing at rank 20 against many new rank 20 players and kicking their vica versa for survivors skilled survivors are destroying new killers this rank reset is just so uneeded I don't understand why it's even there honestly it just discourages new players because the devs seem to forget challenge is fun getting steam rolled is not.One final poke at this game is simply the offering/addons. Addons affect killers abilities i.e increasing the charging speed of the chainsaw or survivor equipment i.e making tool boxes repair faster. Offerings are 1 time use before the game begins some of which are just stupid. A competitive game in my eyes can't have such game alterating things like this. I will talk about 2 things specifically. First for survivor is the brand new part. This is a 1 time use addon that pretty much allows the survivor to repair a generator in as low as 20 seconds compared to 80 seconds and for a game that's based on playing against the clock this is simply insane. Killer has ebony moris this mean that if the killer hooks a survivor once then catches them again he can insta kill them. That's it instead of 3 hooks you need 1 hook and 1 more down that's it. Things like this should not exist simply because they alter the game far too much imo and are apparently far too common at the top ranks.Despite all the issues with the game I would still recommend it simply because although it isn't perfect now it's heading in the right direction with every update. Just recently this removed this thing called the pallet vaccum remember how I said survivors can drop pallets to block off the killer well before the survivor could start the drop on one side and teleport to the other side basically teleporting them to safety away from the killer when they you should have taken a hit. This was removed last update a brilliant fix abit slow granted people were asking for this for ages but still.",Dead by Daylight

2018-06-17,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,"I can't recommend this game anymore. It's just not fair for the killer. Playing killer which is the only reason I cared about this game at all you are on the backfoot the entire game. There is nothing you can do. Let me lay out how a game will go.You will spend probably around 30 seconds looking for survivors.You'll find someone.They'll run sprint burst when you get close then loop you 3 times then drop a pallet.From there they'll immediately go from the first loop to the second one.They'll loop you 3 times again drop another pallet.If you're lucky there won't be another pallet in time and you'll get a hit in.As you get one hit on the survivor 3 generators (out of 5) will immediately finish.They'll get a speed burst and you'll have to choose to chase them down or try to stop more gens.You'll patrol gens another gen will pop by the time you find someone.You'll hit them last gen will pop doors are now active.You'll down them hook them door will be open.Now you can facecamp to get one kill or you can try to get other people to no avail.They'll get him off the hook teabag you at the exit then leave comments on your steam profile about what a killer you are.The ONLY way around this is to run top tier perks. That means either A. Suffering through hundreds of games and waiting months for Hex Ruin or something to be teachable then grind a ton of bloodpoints level up your killer of choice until it pops up get that perk to level 3 then finally stand some kind of chance. or B. Buy The Hag play through massive amounts of t for hundreds of games getting no bloodpoints and grinding for hours on end to level up a killer you're never going to play because she's godawful then get her perk teachable in order to level another killer in order to get the perk on your killer of choice. Or C. Play as survivor and become as much of a as everyone else.A ton of things that absolutely need to change with this game A. Make pallet locations random. Everyone has memorized where each pallet is and can easily run from loop spot to loop spot. Without something like Huntress Billy or Nurse you're never going to catch them and you're just going to waste all of your time. They need to make pallets random so the survivors have to at least FIND the loop spots not go from loop to loop.B. Buff the underpowered killers. The only 3 killers who are even considered good are Huntress Nurse and Billy. Meanwhile there's killers like Wraith Trapper Hag Pig and Nightmare that are basically godawful.C. Add in a casual mode. Nothing is more annoying than the fact that people who are just trying to farm bloodpoints and level up their killers are matched with people who are genuinely trying to rank up. These two people are different and play differently. And it's not fair that you'll get a daily to play Wraith and go ""Oh well guess I'll lose a rank for bloodpoints"" or when someone who plays mostly killer gets a survivor daily and ruins a game for other survivors trying to rank up. Why isn't there a casual mode? And I don't mean Kill With Friends. That's not the same thing.D. Remove Survive With Friends from Ranked when you add Casual. A killer going against 4 people on coms is impossible. Between body blocking calling out locations of the killer and working together on gens it's literally impossible for the killer to get a single kill without running absolutely t builds like Instakill Myers with infinite level 3 or Nurse or something. Ranked should be about your individual skill.E. Lessen the grind. Make easier to share between your characters. If you make a perk teachable don't make someone level another character up to 30 35 in order to get the perk to level 3. If you have offerings like extra bloodpoints let me use them on other characters. The way the game is now you have to focus on individually leveling each person up whether survivor or killer. And that generally means in order to level other people up you're forced to play just one person the entire time. It takes 100s of hours in the game to level all the killers and the survivors are even worst.D. Slow down gens. With how long killers have to chase people it should take longer for people to do gens. Killers shouldn't have to rely on a perk in order to have a fair game. It should be a level playing field with perks altering the gameplay not an unlevel playing field with perks being the only thing that makes it level.E. Let killers place their own totems. Nothing is worse than a survivor happening to spawn in front of the only thing keeping the playing field level and destroying it in the first 30 seconds of the game. That's before you even see one survivor most of the time. And there's nothing you can do about it now it's just an empty perk slot. While you should probably restrict the basement from having totems placed in it you should let killers place their totems and hide them. That way they have a chance to have some use before they're even destroyed.F. Change flashlight animation blinding. In this game if you're in an animation you can't turn your camera. That means every time you kick a gen kick a pallet pick up a survivor vault through a window place a trap or hook a survivor someone with a flashlight can get a free blind on you. And there is literally nothing you can do about it. Not to mention flashlights have a limited amount of use which can be extended by add ons but literally 0 cooldown. So if they miss a flashlight hell they can just try again. Why not? They can make you constantly have to turn your camera every single time you go around a corner. It's painfully unfair.I bought most of the DLC for this game and bought the game at full price. I don't recommend anyone else does the same until the devs fix some of the t in the game. I haven't mentioned Decisive Strike because that's in bound to get nerfed but the rest of this crap needs to be fixed. Unless you're playing top tier killers you feel completely powerless. And no one has any honor at all. You will be teabagged insulted called every name in the book and ridiculed because the only reason is because ""you're bad"". But it's not all your fault. Not when a ""competitive"" game is as unbalanced as this currently is.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-17,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Edit after some research I've found out that they have no dedicated servers and the killer is the host. The match making is trying to set people up with who ever is closer to them and it means I end up with mostly the same people from my country over and over again. This also explains why are disconnects so frequent since it depends on players hosting it themselves and I don't know many people around here with a good enough connection.Over all the game is great but it feels under budged almost like an Early Access title.When I do manage to play a round of this game it's really fun it's a good concept and it is rewarding but..Too many times I see a player disconnect either a killer or a survivor and I really doubt it's the players fault. Too frequent.I get this bug where it is just stuck on waiting and has the loading screen logo flashing but you cannot exit it. I tried for 5 mins to see if it'll either pass or get me into a match in vain. I had to close the game via task manager since the back botton was not responding and alt+f4 did nothing. I'm playing on a free weekend and there is bearly any players. I can't imagine how will it look after the free weekend.It seems fun but so far I have not been able to finish a round due to players dissconecting.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-18,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Not a big fan of horror gore and so on. So I'm not sure why I decided to give this game a try. As soon as I had it installed I jumped in and played the monster without a lick of understanding of how the game worked. I didn't catch or kill a single victim. But I was hooked (yeah) anyway. I watched the tutorials after my first game and tried again as the monster. I got two victims. The psychosis was sinking in. Played again. Whack! Whack! Whack! Three down so fast and easy. Almost had the last victim but he slipped through my hands just before I could sacrifice him and found the exit. So much more for me to figure out and savor. I plan to play my own version of the game at the family Christmas party. I'll give 'em a few minutes head start. Maybe. Awesome game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-18,0,0,538,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I played Dead by Daylight durring this free event. It is a very fun game this is comming from a horror junkie. Played survivor and was pretty bad at it. Played killer and no one could escape from The Wraith and his sexy legs! Playing a killer definitely helped me play a survivor. Leveling up seemed wonky though. You GAIN killer/survivor points to get a LOWER level (backwards from 20 to 1 which I think is weird but okay ). When I wanted to play survivor joining a lobby was a pain. I couldn't load in all the time and had to exit the game. Didn't see this problem when I made the lobby as a killer. Had a fun time playing it and enjoyed being the only survivor left and looking for that hatch and making it. Heart was pounding as well. 9.5/10,Dead by Daylight

I'm glad that I gave this game another chance. I have been playing more recently and it is much more balanced and provides a longer match than the previous updates did. This makes it much more interesting to play and slightly easier for the killer. There have been enough buffs for the survivors as well to make sure that they can still win. I thoroughly enjoy this game now and I suggest it to any friends that enjoy horror or survival games.,Dead by Daylight

Vault over waist high objects jump off balconies break ankles and disrespect the seeker for not doing his/her objective. Find joy in their failure and make a meme out of it. Then regret as there are no more unique players being the seeker and you always match up with the one that actually knows how to get you.Okay jokes aside this game is $20 unoftenly on sale for 25 50% and highly replayable.The game had a pretty rough start with frustrating bugs but it's definitely getting more and more endurable for long durations of gaming.The community is actually fairly decent for an competitive online game everyone who is nice will reveal it only if you're nice.7/10 grab it on sale tbh,Dead by Daylight

The bugs lag and time it can take to enter a game can easily put you over the 2 hour refund mark. I submitted a refund at 3 hours and only played a solid 15 minutes if that. Don't get me wrong the concept is exciting and heart pounding at times but the problems above extinguished the gameplay. If I get the refund I'll be sure to keep an eye on the game and maybe repurchase later on when bugs are fixed and things are updated.

I waited 10 minutes to play a game and watched at least 15 people join and leave the game repeatedly. Every single game I played was like this except for 2 times where I actually got to play as killer. This is in 64 minutes of played time. You do the math.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,12,False,Recommended,"Finally a worthy horror film simulator. Seriously this game is really horrifying. And that's all the fun. Sure there are some bugs right now and may be some desired features but the DEVs are on it. I love this game. Played the BETA and now the full game.There is a thrill hiding from the killers that no other game I have played has ever invoked. For a long time games were fun but not ""huge grin on your face while listening to your heart beat race as a phyco killer is bearing down on you"" fun.Play this game you will not regret it it. The forums are full of whinners. Screw them. Buy the game take some time to learn it and enjoy a game that captures true horror online gaming.",Dead by Daylight
2016-06-14,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"I was worried about this game when I saw it was being published by Starbreeze aka the people who completely ruined Payday 2 but after having played it for a little bit it's actually quite an enjoyable game. The mechanics feel very fleshed out and to me at least playing as a helpless survivor was fun too. I'll just get to the ""TL DR Buy"" recommendation now because the biggest issue with this game is a lack of players.I was curious how well the ""start generator exit level"" mechanic would work. The catch with the generators is that at random intervals you will need to time a button press or else the generator will make a loud noise and alert the hunter to your position. So while you're basically just sitting there listening for the hunter indicator to go off you're also paranoid about when the prompt will pop up and be able to react to it. I'm not too big a fan of the quick time events but they work well enough.I was also worried that it would be a bad balance between hunter and the hunted but I think it works fairly well. Checking closets for victims takes a good 5 or so seconds so if you're chasing someone and you stop to check a closet they may end up losing you (which is easy to do) or if you decide to follow the way you think they went they can slip out of the closet you decided not to check ... or from behind some rocks you didn't even notice. As a ""victim"" with the maps being randomized to a extent (of course it's so dark that you couldn't really tell anyway) it's all about thinking on your feet. Even though you can't fightThere's still a couple of things that need to be worked on for this to be a solid recommendation. One thing would be steamworks integration so I can invite people to a public match. Another would DEFINITELY be a re evaluation of the item system you apparently lose items you unlock through the skill tree if you die (which as a victim is likely) and without a more outlined way to get them back again it just seems like a waste of skill points and ultimately a waste of a skill system. The biggest problem the game has right now is a lack of playerbase and waiting for a full server can be a serious waiting game (and disappointment when you FINALLY have a full match and then someone leaves)Overall though there is a lot to like here. The mechanics are simple enough though some of the more specific nuances of the mechanics (like the above mentioned generator QTE or how your skill tree items can be simply gone because you died) are not explained. Still for $20 ($17.99 right now) it's a pretty good game. There's already room for expansions like more characters and hunters different clothing options and so on which I think could be cool but again being a Starbreeze published game I'm scared they may push it down the same path to DLC Hell. However as long as they can control themselves I think the devs have made something really nice here and proof that multiplayer CAN actually be a scary experience.TL DR Buy the game so we can have more players",Dead by Daylight

This game its not balanced at all not even by a long shot the community is poor and toxic. Its not a fun game at all. The game developers don't give a crap about the balancing and as a killer main its horrendous. Perks are terrible you have to grind them out to get anywhere and even then you're relying on RNG and praying you get something good every time you level a character. I don't have one bit of fun at all with this game. I only have 33 hours and this games matchmaking is making me go against people with 2000+ hours that have everything unlocked. I just cant play it anymore and enjoy it.I tried to give the game another chance and it just keeps getting worst every day it seems. The matchmaking is terrible and will even pit a newish killer against teams of four survivors which they dub ""Survive with Friends "" which adds to the difficulty a killer has to deal with. I would not recommend this game to anyone because of how unbalanced it and its community is towards new players.

And I have over 216 hours on it so I should just say I enjoyed it. I'm not going to give any pros or cons cause that just takes up too much time to do.If you hate toxic survivors or toxic killers don't get this game. I have ran into killers who will camp you just so they can get an easy win. Survivors can be as much toxic as that but they like to run the killer around for as long as they can before time runs out and the killer has competed NONE of the tasks.Some people from YouTube videos I've seen they have seen glitches in the game which aren't game breaking they're just really weird. If you are new to this game and you're just starting out it will take a while for you to get into a match because of your rank. Level 1 survivor or killer may take you a while to find a lobby. This game does have custom clothing you can buy but you have to purchas it by paying real money to get the in game cash to buy such clothing. Really isn't much else to say other than if you wanna try this game out go for it. If you aren't a fan of games like this don't get it. Or if you've seen other reviews that have told you how BAD this game is wait for a steam sale and then buy it. I rate this game 10/10 for ME cause I personally find it fun if you're bored or have nothing to do or whatever your reason IS. Game does have mixed reviews and Mostly positive but those mixed reviews just tell you what the other players have experienced that isn't good to them. Most are complaining of issues or campers or Pallet loopers etc. Put this game on your wish list if you aren't sure if you should buy it or NOT! ...Think on it cause some of the reviews are literally half and half.

This is probably he most importanat thing I look at when I buy a game. Well DBD is not only a multiplayer game DBD is a game that makes you want to play it more from your first entrace. It is well made. And in my opinion the graphics are amazing. I mean it is a detailed game just look at that fog. Also if you take a look at the characters in the game you will see how much their look says about their personality. As well I absolutely love the games which have characters with background stories. I mean if you go to the wikia of the game and take a look at them you are going to look at Dead By Daylight another way. This makes the games totally amazing. I also enjoy playing it beacause of the mode of gameplay. It is totally diffrent that other games. I like when developers have a brand new perspetive to the games and make them new very enjoyable.

This is my old review. I regret wirting it. If you bought it because of my review im so sorry.A lot of new players are ragging on this game for bugs and lobby issues. Yes they were bad before but since the last patch (8/21/2016) there has been a SIGNIFICANT improvement. From the first release this game has only gotten better taking leaps and bounds into the right direction. The devs are fixing the issues as they come up and for a $20 game its working exactly as i expected it to. I don't understand the negative reviews from new players. Its almost frustrating when you've seen the game improve and new players are still giving it hell. They don't know what it WAS like. They don't understand how far its come. The game was released pretty buggy yes but as it stands right now i think its worth it.I'm happy with my purchase and I'm 100% faithful that the devs will keep up with the game and improvements.,Dead by Daylight

It is unique and engaging but the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. And yes I ""liked"" the game but I still say it's a negative buy until they fix the core issues.PROS Again totally unique. Great idea and the game has had a lot of good going for it. The rounds are quick and fun. You stay entertained thw whole time. The developers also include a lot of content which is good for a game like this. Which sadly leads to the cons. Wait times for matches are decent although killer's control when you play which is BS.CONS A game should focus on its core before it focuses on content. The fact that you rely on the killer's ""hosting"" ability is very archaic. That should never be a thing for a PvP game. In some instances it ruins the game as the killer's internet causes you to lag like a MoFo. As well people should suffer greater penalties from leaving a game mid game. It hurts the killer's score and affects the teammates of the survivors. For the amount of time this has been out these simple core mistakes that make the game aggravating should have been dealt with.All in all this game is beautiful and I have had it since a few weeks after release. Yet they have prioritizes pumping out content over stabilizing the game. Some killers are rarely even used. So what the is the point of releasing them? Anyway I'm hoping the devs see this and maybe look back into the core of the game. The cons should not be an issue.",Dead by Daylight

It's really oppressivePros Need more content (number of perks items in a skill tree is OK but the rest need some more variety like maps.

It's easy to play but hard to be great at. Different killers using different strategies or different survivors using different strategies depending on which side you are on makes it a very unpredictable game. The fact the killer is stuck in a first person view helps the survivors hide while their speed advantage makes it easier for them to catch. Only advice I can give for a survivor is1. Never panic. Ever.2. Think about what the killer will do next and with that knowledge try to stay away from him.3. Cry softly as you get hooked.4. Spider is love Spider is life,Dead by Daylight

Or Graphic issues in which i can see the Killer in high distance while the area around him is not rendered. Well... all that is pretty annoying.

But still the game is in huuuge favour of the survivors (and i am a survivor main just keep that in mind before thinking im just an upset killer) every 5 6 month the killerpalyer get a tiny buff to hold them by the game. Best example this ptb whats going on right now the survivors now have to stand on the side of the pallet where they want to be after they dropped it after 2 years should have been in the game from the start. The next good buff killer got this ptb (and that is actually a huge one) is to close the hatch an escapedoor on the ground that will open (under specific terms) after everyone but 1 survivor in the game died so survivors dont have to do their objectives anymore. If they found it they won. On the ptb killers could close it so survivors had to do their job and fixing generator. After 1 fixed it opens again. Cool idea but survivors dont want to do that so killers wont get that as soon as the patch hits live. Killer complaining for YEARS and get ONE buff survivors complain IN THE FIRST WEEK of the ptb over a killer buff and the buff wont go live untill changed (and that probably again) in favour of survivors. And the playstyle i was talking about is like playing catch with your little 3 year old brother/sister/cousin/whatever. Find survivor &gt survivor runs to a pallet &gt circles it 3 4 times &gt kilelr gets close &gt survivor dropps it so killer had to waste time breaking it &gt meanwhile survivor runs to another pallet &gt repeat. It is so booring to do as survivor to watch people do and to receive as killer. And if you dont bring one specific perk to slow down the gen progression of the survivor as killer you have lost anyway if your enemys arent total morons. So final verdictIf you like games like that or have a unhuman like resistence to frustration buy it and have fun. But i would wait a few month to see if the game will change and get proper balancing if not this game is doomed to die in his next year.,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-07,0,0,243,False,Recommended,I used to watch this game on YouTube and absolutley loved it so I decided to buy it for myself. This game is far more fun while playing it than watching it ever will be. Some may say it's a little repetitive with just the same killers and circumstances but I like the leveling up and prestiging constantly! I also kind of like it when everyone dies or disconnects because it's a challenge I win a lot so now I have to really try to escape!Overall really like this game! Would and have already recommend this game!! Lewi,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-30,0,0,315,False,Not Recommended,this game can be some of the most fun you'll ever have and with all of the playable characters and perks to unlock for both survivors and killers there's hundreds of hours of gametime here. however I can't recommend this game in its current state.if you were to get this game right now you probably wouldn't realize the issue even in your first 75 100 hours of playtime. the games would be balanced some games you'll win and some you'll lose. but once you start to really learn the ins and the outs of the game unlock the 'meta' perks learn strategies etc. it will become painfully obvious that this game is completely unbalanced. as it stands the survivors are the force to be reckoned with. not the killer that has a special power a weapon is more physically imposing etc. No the 4 little survivors are the OP ones and they will relentlessly bully the killers. There are so many crutches that the survivors have that the killer simply does not have. The killer doesn't rely on their skill rather the mistakes that the survivors make. So it doesn't matter how good you are as a killer if the survivor somewhat knows what they're doing and manages to not make any mistakes you're ed. from the absurd amounts of pallets and vaults that create brutal loops to the perks that make survivors actual gods to the harrassment the survivors dish out to the killers this game creates more of a stressful environment than anything for anyone who wants to play killer. If you want to play survivor then you're set it's all a breeze. but if you want to enjoy the other half of the game be ready to be pounded by 4 survivors for 5 10 minutes at a time.the devs are supposedly working on balancing the game out but survivor mains always find a way to whine about every good killer or killer perk/feature so the killer will be nerfed again and we'll be back to square one. it's already happened too many times. if the game does actually get balanced I will gladly change my review. but until then my review will be negative and I'll still waste my time playing the game and allowing myself to get way too stressed and frustrated for way too long,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-08,0,0,146,False,Recommended,so let me start by saying yes survivors do have a lot in there favor (little to much imo) how ever my problem is some killers are useless/unplayable/unnessarcy. the clown seems to be a fair and balnced killer along with balnced killers that work well are nurse and huntress. these 3 feel like a killer should with powerful control and rewarding play. not to say you couldnt be good with others but typical same or less play time required for less control and kill potential such as freddie and wraith who personal ive never lost to a freddie and only once to a wraith some are in the middle and require knowldge of being a killer in genral and relying on that over your powers such as trapper myers(when a.) you dont have 3 up or B.) dont have infinte 3 add on) are two good examples then you have ones that kinda just linger there and have good parts but just arnt enough to be as good as nurse clown billly huntress. so give freddie and wrath a buff devs please. also as a survivor main (roughly around 60 of the 69 hrs of play time) removes the ing flashlight only people i see running it are the same cancer 3 4 man swf claudettes/megs w/ self care decisive strike and sprint burst and a perk of there choice (mainly borrowed time) nerf self care like you nerfed freddie and bring freddie his orignal form back. The good is the varity of perks and possible builds for both sides (both have there meta set ups but it) the amount of time you can sink in and the fun of the game why i havent spent as much time here ive had more fun here then i ever did in dota2 (my most played game) and for that it outways the negatives of the disbalnce of most the killers,Dead by Daylight
2016-09-05,0,0,501,False,Not Recommended,I typed a huge review on this just for it all to be deleted and I really don't feel like typing it again so i'll sum it up.Killers get the short end of the stick at any level past killer rank 15 really.The game becomes frustrating unfair rage inducing even. So many people have spoken about how unbalanced the game is between killer and survivor yet DEV's do not seem to care about it the slightest? In fact one of the DEV's taunted the fact we were upset with how it was at one point in time?It's sad.I really enjoy playing killer it's always fun don't get me wrong but being endlessly pallet looped to the point 2/3 generators have been completed by the time I finally can kill the person really frustrates me and EVERY other decent killer in the game. There is literally nothing we can do about it. At all.Overall my review for this game is now negative despite the roughly 500 hours i've played (and don't get me wrong I have had LOADS of fun in this game.) but at this point with all the ridiculous perks the survivors have and how easy pallet looping is it's just not fun to play killer.Survivor is still fun especially with friends yes. But that doesn't change the fact there's a HUGE balance issue between the 2 that really needs to be sorted out before I even think about laying a finger on killer again.To those who can take that level of frustration daily I salute you it's sad how little the DEV's care about killers.Uninstalled hopefully to never return.Edit I'd like to direct everyone's attention to this video for a more in depth look at just how frustrating playing killer really can be.https //youtu.be/qnwdPlx9yR4I DO NOT OWN OR HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO THAT VIDEO.,Dead by Daylight

I'm not saying i hate this game at all in fact I love it. That being said I wish there'd be something ANYTHING to help with that little fluke. I wouldn't mind like AI taking control of them or a penalty to the killer or even allowing the generator count to go down since i'm the last one and ONLY one that connected.

2016-06-23,0,0,3,False,Recommended,I want to like this game really I do but there's just nothing to it. ALL of the maps are the same the only difference is placement of terrain all of the maps are a square and not a lot of terrain in the middle but A LOT of open space and you just look for the flood lights to find the generators and do some quick time events to fix them. This game has the potential to be on par with left 4 dead it just needs to craft a narative to help it. Some will disagree as playing hide and go seek is enough but frankly this game just has so much potential to be spectacular when it just comes off as something that I can really only play for a few rounds before I just get bored of winning. Also there should be a limit on who can be what character it makes it for a much more interesting experience IMO if each character has their own perks and they HAVE to work together and help each other out because if one of them dies that persons skill set is now gone too. Anyways good game going to recommend it because I do enjoy the game but I would love this game with a little more work.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-24,0,0,28,False,Recommended,I'm really loving this game. At first I think it's easy to think that it's very unbalanced and even though there can be some improvements with some obvious exploits (such as window hop looping) over all I feel like the balance is quite good. You're going to be pretty useless as a villain or survivor until you're at least level 5. However the game is amazing for quick pick up. One thing that's annoying are that many players leave the match lobby to look for friends so they'll need to fix this to punish people who constantly quit early. Overall recommend!,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-14,0,0,367,False,Recommended,The game is fun but the community at times can be... well a bit too competitive at times. Also the game's balance isn't too great (SWF groups are a bit infuriating to play against if you aren't the right killer or have the right perks to counter their ability to communicate with each other when they're on opposite sides of the map) but at least its playable. In my opinion Dead by Daylight is a great game but if you're feeling more stressed than enjoyment in the game I'd reccomend playing another game that's less stress inducing for a while.

2016-06-14,0,0,24,False,Recommended,This game is awesome. Being a fan of the slasher movie subgenre this is the kind of game I have been looking for. It is extremely fun and it looks abolutely stunning. I don't have a gaming computer so I had to turn the graphics down to the low setting but it runs fine and still looks pretty good. Overall a game that is very eerie and creepy very well thought out highly recommended. My only complaint would be that sometimes joining a match can be a bit of a chore but that's to be expected for a newly launched game because they all have bugs. Other than that this is a great game especially if you're like me and you have always wanted to play a slasher movie as a game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,"Meh edited I've preordered this game and when I could install it and play it felt like a regression to 2003. Graphics are too basic most of the scenary is repeated (for example a scenario featuring a corn plantation all corn plants look almost the same this is a common resource re using items instead of designing variations. There is no option to turn down the music there's only one volume setting... Points system is hard if you are a low level items are expensive and you may need to play qute a few times in order to use/purchase any item. Beware because if you get caught during the game those items you have been carrying get lost. If you get caught you wont live even if you keep clicking your mouse button as instructed when it reaches 99% wont allow you to get up and scape so dont follow instructions. There is another annoying visual aspect to the game there are 5 players one being the hunter and the rest being ""victims"" and there are only 4 characters so you will mostly play with clones of your character because the game doesnt avoid that.Finishing my review I would like to state that since this morning multiplayer is down (comes and goes erraticly) its now saying that my steam app is offline the same app I'm using to post this review. So for now this game is unplayable.The game is very basic if a demo was available I wouldn't have bought this game.",Dead by Daylight

(watched from VUXXY's stream) So then I thought I was never going to buy it nor were my friends. Recently my friend bought it for me and holy I only have about 10 minutes into it and yes this game is amazing. Atmosphere is great really makes you feel like youre in the game also gives you a scary feeling when your heart beats faster which is a great little addition to let you know the killer is around. As of right now this game is a great game with friends especially and even if you don't have any to play with this game is still amazing to play with randoms because you still get that feeling of excitement.And not to mention I recently found out survivors can have items for survival (Real game just came out today out of Beta) and there is customization and a lot more for your loadoutAll in all I say get this game. Amazing with friends and just a really fun game to play in your spare time. Even if youre looking to get scared too.Recommended!!,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Game is kinda rough around the edges but its a great asymmetrical multiplayer game with fun mechanics and with a good sense of balance between the three killers and the four survivors. The unlock system is alright and not nearly as much of a grind as evolve IMO. Definitely needs some work particularly involving rage quitters the party system and just general glitches. 20$ is the right price for this kinda game in my opinion but if it doesn't get fixed up I'd say wait until its on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-06,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Really the reviewsystem needs to become more specific.Do I recommend this game Hell yes but... and there it is I would recommend this game without a second thought for the following reasons.1) The gameplay is fun.2) The balance between killers and survivors for now is OK.3) It keeps up the thrill. I played it befor I even had the game myself thanks to friends after watching and folling LPs over several month. The Devs fixed a lotHere is why still cannot fully recomment it without a but 1) Finding matching lobbies toghether with your friends is a pain in the You spend too much time waiting while you only wait for a few seconds while searching on your own either as survivor or killer.2) There are no custom servers!!! Really that already ruined most of current Call of Duty.3) Killers who are always host that are constantly quitting when they are about to lose are something that I encountert 4/10 times while playing which is unacceptable and needs to be punnished more drastically. Instead of punnishing the survivors for keep going until the end making them lose everything including the score and items.It's a damn fun game. It really deserves to be played and extended. Starbreeze has brought some memorable entries with the Riddick series and really should consider investing into this one to reward loayal players who are really keeping that thing up. The lobby situation for most should be a top priority and next more maps or the option of including costum created content for the game which would really add to the experience. In my oppinion this could be a league game if not ESL than an alternative one. It defenetly relies on teamplay and skill likewise and having a horrorgame within a league would really add some fresh wind to the same old.If you're a fan of classic slasher movies and of survival game concepts you should defenetly buy it without a doubt. The rest of us that already owns it should continue to heavy petition towards the devs to keep up changes and not just leaving us alone with the current additional content.See you dead by daylight!,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-22,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"Dead By Daylight is a 4vs1 multiplayer horror game where you play as either a survivor or a killer.Now I say ""horror game"" but in reality I doubt you'll find the game that scary except for a few jumpscares now and then.In this game your goal is to win by either fixing 5 generators in the map and escaping through the exit gate as survivors or killing all 4 survivors as killer. Let's go through the game.As a survivor you're able to choose from 5 different survivors (7 if you own both dlcs). These 5 survivors are not very different except for personalities and perks which are the game's way of progression. You see as a survivor you get points by fixing generators escaping helping your teammates and etc. These points are known as bloodpoints which you use in something called the Bloodweb to get items addons and perks. When you finish a Bloodweb you level up. Items These are items you get through the bloodweb or through hidden chests in the map (Note that you can only use that item from the chest if you escape with it.) these items include medkits to heal yourself or your team toolboxes to repair generators quicker or sabotage the killer's hooks so he can't use them and more. These can be good or bad as they have tiers like common and such.Addons These are things you can put in items or killer powers to empower them or make them better.Perks These are upgrades you can put on your survivor or killer every survivor and killer have different perks that do different things.Now let's talk about the killer. There are 4 killers (6 with dlcs). The killer's goal is to down every survivor by hitting them twice and carrying them to a hook in the map where the survivor will stay until a creature called ""The Entity"" comes down and kills them. Basically the survivors are a sacrifice from the killers to the Entity. Every killer has a ""power"" which helps them accomplish this things like putting down bear traps or becoming invisible. They can also attach addons to their powers to make them stronger.Now I know I'm missing a lot of stuff but I'll stop right there and talk about the actual game.Dead By Daylight is a fun game that can give you hours of entertainment but only if you can endure it's problems.Yes the game has many. For example finding a game as a killer can take a giant amount of time to some people (I once waited 25 minutes) the game requires you to get perks to do good in high levels but you're only allowed 1 perk until you get to level 15 where you unlock a second perk slot a third on level 20 and a fourth on level 25 but until you get there you'll only have one perk.There are things like hook camping perk exploits infinites and more that can destroy the fun of the game completely to some.In short Dead By Daylight is a great game with many problems that the developers are taking a while to fix.If you can get past them you'll find a fun multiplayer game to play alone or with friends if you don't you will not last long before you stop playing completely.Before I end the review I should mention that The sound design is alright not bad but not great The graphics are fine for what they are trying to accomplish Matches can last around 5 10 20 30 minutes or even longer it all depends on the killer and the survivors. Yes teamwork is a thing but without communication (The game doesn't have voice communication or a chat system so you'll need to talk to friends with a program) it can be very tough to make it work.Do I reccomend this game? Yes because I believe you'll enjoy it if you can get past the problems I've mentioned. If not do not bother with Dead By Daylight but if you do have an itch for a game like this look into Friday The 13th The Game.",Dead by Daylight

Now it's more of a chore to play because of the Devs tendancy to ignore their own community.Recently they've even taken a step further and now silence any that is critical of their product. You can still find enjoyment in this game be beware of what you're purchasing.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,778,False,Recommended,"Now when people ask ""What is your favorite hobby?"" I can reply that I enjoy being a mass murdering serial killer who's only goal is to sacrifice young adults/teens to the evil entity above.I don't have friends so i don't have to get my jimmys all rustled over ""No co op que ("" keep in mind i did buy a copy for myself and someone else still a great game i missed out on ONE experience this doesn't make the entire game bad. I mean the other person im sure is more appreciative to have a free game in their library and WHEN there IS co op que then HEY it's a good thing i bought the game afterall and waited patiently not throw the game into a fire and i'm the one that actually spent the money not the other person.Be warned 1) The Wraith is by far the hardest of the killers to win against its not impossible just extrodinary unfair. His bell's cloak/invisibility abillity is really distinguished amongst the 3 secondary weapons but it allows him to capture survivors easily yes yes he can't do anything while cloaked but considering the Killers are naturally faster than survivors he doesnt have to stay un cloaked long to wack you cloak and run to you un cloak and do it again and hang you out to dry from how soaked you are from your nervous sweat salty tears and the 20 pints of blood you have spewing out of you (thats a lot of blood FYI). But when you successfully survive against him it's the greatest feeling in the world. (ProTip Use Teamwork to GTFO &lt not from a real pro).2) There are mass amounts of people just joining the lobby and leaving because they want to play with friends but 15 minute for one game just to que? that's extreme and kinda exaggerated. Theres tons of people playing this game right now and it take 3 10 seconds for someone new to join and not everyone (like myself) is gonna let ""No co op que ("" ruin a perfectly good game (also i spent $15.99 each for this GOD DAMN IT! IM GONNA PLAY IT AND SCREAM LIKE A LITTLE GIRL IN THE COMFORT AND CONFINEMENT OF MY HOME!)3) Actual gameplay related stuff not just the lobby section and perks/abilities there are a few glitches and they arent the kind you can brush off. They don't happen everytime but you're bound to run into them. I'm actually gonna ""go out there and make a difference"" and summarize the ones I (me myself and I alone!) have encountered feel free to add on. A) Falling through the world your character will yell and fall through the gound repeatively. along with the glitch in (C). Edit http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 703987045 B) You gain the ability to hover above the ground It's not a T pose its like a contorted Y pose used for the falling animation. You can still take damage run and die but your screen will be distorted as hell and crouching isn't a thing neither is interacting with the world. Edit http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 703986336http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 703987070 C) Unable to interact with the enviroment self explanitory this means EVERYTHING. People items objectives. This particular glitch pairs with the first glitch above. Vise Versa people can interact with you though. D) i don't really think this is a glitch just a game mechanic but there is a delay in the little mini game (skill tester) that pops up when you heal someone or repair an engine/motor. You get use to it real fast you have no choice but to with all the adrenaline flowing through your veins it becomes the last of your worries. (Escpecially &lt good job stupid spelled it wrong when the heartbeat is going just as crazy as your own)Conclusion Sorry it's long i don't write reviews often I would recommend this **** i bought it for someone else regardless if i can play with them or not because it's just that fun of a game and i knew they would enjoy it. It's intense thrilling challenging and sorta cliche but the good kind the kind you reminisce about. Try it yourself and expect more to come this game clearly has potential and good fortune coming it's way. Let's all support the Dev's and pray to the gods of video game heaven that this doesn't become a Pay to Win cause i notice it is possible unlikely but possible. Second prayer for the Dev's to listen to the community's feedback not saying they don't fingers cross that they do. Unlike some devs (those who shall not be named) because there is always room for improvement and i would hate for this game to fall before reaching glory or fall at all it has good momentum. Edit After reviewing my post i notice i didn't mention anything over the top in the ""Good"" department mostly the bad. One when you buy a game you want to know the catches first what random t to expect i'm saying it how it is the game isnt perfect (none are) but it's enjoyable. Second if i can tell you all the bad AND STILL say this game is glorious then theres some kind of element i cannot spoil for you that overrides everything else it's an experience you must have on your own terms. Besides what do you want? The Game description? it's a freaking survival horror man! The dev's spelled it out for us already.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,While it looks to be a very fun and exciting game it seems many people ()Including me) have issues with connecting to servers and random crashing within the game. After looking for solutions all over the internet I realized there is nothing I can do. I havent played a single game and spent 17 bucks on it. If you are looking to buy I would say take your chances. If it works for you good on you! But if it doesn't you are sh*t out of luck. Better hope the devs release a patch to fix this issue because there is nothing you can do about it.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,TL DR Would recommend if there was friendly queue for normal games. Game is fun when you get in with friends.. At time of writing I have played 4 hours of this game. About 80% of that was spent in Lobby searching for friends as there is no Friendly Queue.Scenario 1 Assuming you have 3 friends 2 of them get into lobby. Then the hunter dodges. And queue jumping begins again.Or Scenario 2 You and a friend get into a lobby other team has a hunter and survivor and request that you leave.Queue jumping begins again.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-16,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Before I get into anything to big let me get this out of the way if you want to understand this games flaws look at the comment by The Sacred Voice. That being said I love this game even with the flaws it has maybe that isnt because I havent logged enough time into it yet but the flaws and the marginally toxic community cannot really get to you if you play with a 4 stack of friends and go at it but one thing that I can complain about a little is the match making system. Nothing sucks more than just starting dead by daylight and going up against a killer who is running some of the best perks in the game while you a lowly level 5 Claudette only have the perk slippery meat. However if you can see past all of the flaws you can see a game that the dev's actually put time and effort into crafting for a fun long running gaming experience. So if you find this comment even remotely persuasive I say give the game a shot and if you dont enjoy the game then refund it and buy somthing else. At the end of the day I know its your money so just do what you want.,Dead by Daylight

Ever since the update has arrived it is more focused on killer than the surrvivors it was perfect the way it was as both killer and surviviors were easy to play and fair on both side. Now it is not. However for those who do want to play the game and give it a try the game it self has a good concept to it. I hope that someday the devolpers of this game actually fix this.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,168,False,Recommended,Enormously fun. A bit bare bones to be honest so don't expect a huge amount in terms of variety but it has very solid core gameplay that more can be built onto. There are a few issues As other reviews have said there is no way to play a match with friends unless you can fill the full five men. You can't choose your host and so it's up to the will of the gods as to whether or not you'll get one with decent ping. There are a few bugs and exploits that are running crazy right now including things like disconnections not being counted by the ranked system and therefore high level players are disconnecting at the slightest hint of losing. Finally the survivors are a bit broken. Though the maps are randomly generated anyone who plays them a few times will come to know the sections where a survivor can abuse their wall jumping speed to constantly hop back and forth over the same wall. A pursuing killer would then either have to run back and forth hoping that they mess up or give up and hunt other prey. Luckily this is going to be patched but hasn't yet. So yeah it is not perfect but it's fun. Ludicrous terrifying exhilirating fun. 8/10 would buy again.,Dead by Daylight
2018-04-11,0,0,307,False,Recommended,"Used to be a good game. New Emblem system is s**t though. Reward survivors for altruism ""evading"" escaping and repairs generators basically. So nowadays survivors are essentially forced to to be altruistic and save people from the hook that's not to say it's a bad thing to do and people didn't do it anyway. However killers now play on this knowing that in order for a survivor to pip/double pip they HAVE to be altruistic. ALAS MY FRIENDS this is no issue for killers cause now they can facecamp/soft camp ALL they want and NOW (get ready for the best part) SURVIVORS COME STRAIGHT TO THEM. So they can camp AND get even newer kills. God almighty isn't that wonderful? And I mean who doesn't love a game in which the moment emblems are released killers finally realise that ""OH F**K I CAN CAMP THE WEAKEST/FIRST SURVIVOR I FIND AND THEN THE REST WILL COME TO ME!"". All in all though would recommend cause this game makes me scream more than any man ever has and will continue to do so whether they are screams of terror or screams of anger. Please ing fix the emblem system though. Finally after all this time of the game being out please for the love of god penalise killers for camping.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-24,0,0,473,False,Not Recommended,This game is full of bug patch after patch and i start to feel disgusting for a game i loved. No hatchery spawn in 2 games with the new patch (confirmed by killer twice)Now the meta has changed and what the game want for you staying hiding the whole game doing gen rush instead of being chase or doing sabo/totems for earning pip. this game really.Moreover it's impossible to do 2 pip for survi with the new system it's only made for deranking or winning 1 pip. I used to do at least 20k points every game and winning 2 pip for saving chasin and repairing now my last game i've done 22K points and i've taken listen carefuly 0 pip. So what the point to do alternative objectives now 000000000000000000000000 and loosing ur rank. Now when u get downed u loose point even if ure protecting someone at the exit gate but be careful u still win Bloodpoints for protection total non senseI used to play as killer too nothing has changed for them still infinite pallets on map 1 only viable killer if you want make 4 kills every game (nurse).

2016-06-26,0,0,89,False,Not Recommended,Love playing this game by myself. I had loads of fun climbing the ranks by myself and learning new tricks. Then I decided I would get some friends to buy the game so that i could finally chat with fellow survivors. No party are allowed. Matchmaking drops out here and there. Some killer wait times are so long that you lose interest before you find a game. Some people find games as killer within minutes me on the other hand I waited for 56 minutes (i timed it) before the first person joined my game as the killer. He left shortly after and I closed the game out of anger. My suggestion is wait until the game has haad more patches and more updates. It is not ready yet in my opinion. So TL DR fun in game terribble and time consuming to find a game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-26,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a great idea but this game is poorly balanced as of writing this review. The matchmaking is poor. People can leave when ever they want with no consequences. You can not be a lobby with friends unless you the friend are lucky enough to get into a lobby with them the only way to be in a match with them is to create a private match. Because of this people lobby hop a lot and its very annoying. How the servers are set up. They are Peer to Peer servers which means that a player is hosting the server and that can cause poor connections. My main issue is balancing between the survivors and killer. The survivors can get really overpowered perks and the killer does not but that really does not matter when it is literately impossible to get away from the killer unless you have a flashlight a board to block him or if you are lucky a window to jump through but that is extremely slow but other then that you can not out run him at all no matter what you do. A killer you can choose from is called the wraith and he can become invisable and he can barely be seen with only a bell toll to tell if hes cloaking or uncloaking which is very broken because if he put someone on a hook and cloak and uncloak repeatedly and that makes it impossible for anyone to unhook the person. The killer has a attack range much larger then he should and can hit you much farther then he should and he can hit you through a window when you are not even close to the window. This game is a mess of bugs as well for the survivors and killer. The developers have not updated the game to fix issues like these for sometime which is a disappointment. Unless the developers fix these bugs and issues and it is well known that they are fixed. I would not recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-02,0,0,83,False,Recommended,For a game that came out to the light recently and suddenly it is... Awesome! Of course there are several bugs but just look at version of the game. Dead by Daylight IS going to be developed in the future but for now it perfoms itself great. The concept is interesting and simple at the same time 4 survivors try to escape when 1 tough buddy whistles around to get a chance to kill them all. Actually there are 3 types of the maniac that makes the game even more interesting. Every single character has its own features. Along with that creators did not get lazy and created a pre history to each of them. Gameplay is convenient and quite balanced for now. There are not so much buttons to push that is pretty nice so that you are not going to learn all the controls for long. Also there are tutorials that makes learning easy.I recommend just to try this game. If you do not like it what I doubt about anyway you can refund it. BUT This Game IS MustToTry.,Dead by Daylight

One of the best ones I have played actually so I am not going to start listing every single reason why this game is good instead I am going to list all the flaws. Becomes not so much fun after 1 2 hours of gameplay (without friends). Has very limited game types. You can not actually play with your friend in a public match where you are the killer and your friend survivor. Needs some offerings add ons perks and characters to be stabilize. Lack of options in Graphics setting. Inability to obtain skins for all the characters.And I must say that ranking system is straight up copied from hearthstone's. And recently I got this error occuring ''DX 11.0 level required to run the engine''. I have fully compitable graphics card and I had played the game even before the error. I have been waiting for updates to kill the issue but no luck so far.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-19,0,0,697,False,Not Recommended,I love this game it is addicting but there is a lot wrong with it. From toxic players to bugs to rage inducing moments like that should have hit as a killer and that shouldn't have hit as a survivor. Overall though like being said it is addiciting they are always adding cool stuff but not fixing the old but they are always TRYING to keep the game balanced. I know I am saying a no recommendation but I would recommend to buy when the new update comes out because you are able to purchase new/dlc killers and survivors with shrines a currency obtained through the game instead of buying with real money.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-30,0,0,18,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. From what I played on the free weekend. The game is immensly fun but as with any asymetric (4v1) game it can feel totally unfair when your opponent(s) just seem to be way more skilled than you. As a Killer you'll get survivors who know every loop trick and stunt in the game and will lead you in circles the entire match. As a Survivor you'll pull your hair out in frustration as The Pig traps all your allies and nobody can find the Hex Ruin totem(a special perk for the killer that makes it nearly impossible for survivors to complete their generators until they destroy the totem) .However the game isn't so much skill based as it is luck based. The maps are semi randomly generated so you could turn a corner at the start of the match while running from the killer and find yourself at a dead end. Flipside the map can generate tons of loops pallets and windows for survivors to lead you around with.Still if you just want to play for the thrill of hiding from a Killer or murdering helpless survivors you can 100% get that experiance in your first 10 hours before any kind of ""meta"" sinks into your head.",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-02,0,0,143,False,Recommended,Hey community personally I'd recommend this great lan game online multiplayer. Decent community better on the killer side of things because they don't teabag quit dc even if they don't get what they want. Survivor community however is 50/50. Survive with friends by far most toxic community. I'm a killer main and I've gone against a 4 man group who did nothing but play like Climb the rank and I'm sure you'll find out what I mean. TLDR game is great aside my two concerns. I'd recommend picking it up really cheap too on sale! But this review is to at least help the community see what it has become since the DLC release.Anyway my main two issues with the game is the unbalanced DLC and the somewhat garbage customer service First off I can attest to the DLC being completely unbalanced. I'm a killer main but I play with a friend and boy those Freddy matches were horrible. Yes Freddy might be the best Killer for SWF groups but it's not fun for duo or solo players. The dude's got xray vision on you if you're out of his terror range and this is without having to use a perk. He speeds up as more generators get finished with a perk. He also blocks the exit gates with another. Like man did they think about counter play when they made this guy? Flashlights are rendered ineffective because most likely you can't see his face. He's outdoing the Wraith's invisibility and Michael Myers jumpscare capability. In the dream world there is no way to wake up other than have another player with you or fail skill checks which by the way still reveals your position. Even after that he can still put you back to sleep. Some balancing ideas let the survivors have a wake up mechanic similar to the snap out of it with the doctor.Or incorporate levels of sleep ie drowsy sleep deep sleep (unable to wake).Or survivors wake up when they get tagged. Or sleep has a timer.Or sleep has a short cooldown before being able to put someone back to sleep immediately after waking up.Or remove the aura reading from Freddy if he pulls someone into the dreamworld but hearing is amplified (this can separate great Freddys to decent ones).Or increase the number of skill checks when you're asleep. Or remove being able to see survivors outside terror radius I feel like this one broke it the most. Or as my friend suggested make Freddy an event Killer (availability only during certain events).Second line of issue everybody knows this and I'm not the only one. They have garbage customer services. Bots answering for them and telling you they're working on it. But days weeks months later nothing. I lost my progress twice now. Once on a level 15 Nurse and level 15 Jake. I actually didn't mind when this happened because I thought that's how rank resets worked. But then it happened again Level 30 something David and Level 45+ Huntress all down the drain. This is where I almost quit the game. It is super frustrating I was on a crappy connection but I didn't think that was supposed to be an issue though. I know people have had it worse and have not had their things returned for months. Mine's ongoing for nearly a month now but yeah 60+ hours just disappears that easily.,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-08,0,0,573,False,Not Recommended,This used to be a negative review then it became positive and now it is negative again.Dead By Daylight where to start?Plenty of game breaking bugs lack of anti cheat system or cheater reporting mechanics and then banning people for giving liks to cheater profiles really?New game features are all very nice and such except in some cases they push the players to certain boring tactics. Left alone against the killer with Ruin and a bunch of traps around the generators? Just hide and play for time even if he catches you in 15 minutes or so you get Iridiscent Evader and a pip.And now instead of fixing their old stuff and streamlining gameplay they add microtransactions and even MORE content? (which is in fact a new map new killer and survivor) New cash only currency also happens to be non tradeable between players. Bravo! Greed wins common sense loses.The drive to make things unlockable via gameplay is commendable but it turns out you can only do so for very few characters which kinda ruins whole idea. Why did I buy the Doctor DLC back then so that other people may unlock it without spending cash now?I used to be happy to play this game and even more so when they fixed bugs but I got nothing for this game or devs now but contempt.If it weren't for my friend who's a huge fan of the franchise I'd remove the game from my hard drive right now. And I regret spending money on this game too I would rather give them to DE in Warframe they at least fix game breaking bugs overnight instead of taking months to do it.The game is dying it needs love not money.

2016-11-28,0,0,20,False,Recommended,I won't give this a bad review because this game is extremely fun when you get in a balanced match with no lag. Some matches can get really intense and it's an all around exhilarating experience. Othertimes you get matches that are too lop sided and you either get killed right away escape without any trouble kill everyone with no struggle or kill no one.And that's just when the game's working correctly. There are other much more severe problems. You have disconnects that happen at least 60% of the time in my experience. You have lag that will completely ruin the game. You have infinite loading screens that require task manager to exit you have loading screens that take minutes to load likely because the game is waiting for a response from someone who disconnected. You have random game crashes (This is rare) or random disconnects and instant victories or defeats. Even if that all works there are clipping glitches and other issues in the game itself that has nothing to do with latency.All in all they really really really need to fix this game. Fix the networking issues and fix the matchmaking and this is a 9/10 game. In its current state though I'd give it a 6/10 because of how inconsistent the matches are.,Dead by Daylight

There's a lot of problems with this game but it is still a LOT of fun to play. There isn't much for skins in my opinion and there will hopefully be more choices to change looks of your character in the future. Overall great game should still be considered ALPHA in my opinion as well. I hope they can fix these changes for the better and not implement the wrong changes to ruin the game. A lot of discussions about changes to the game (respawning or infinite hooks for example) would most likely ruin the game and render more perks basically useless unless they make a good number of other major changes to the gameplay and dynamics. 10/10 in my book because it's fun and is kind of neat to see the glitches until they happen so often you don't want to even think about this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-17,0,0,498,False,Not Recommended,Salted eggs are normally brined duck eggs. Chinese people use them to make moon cakes 月餅 glutinous rice dumplings (粽子) and many other dishes. Some families I know like to steam salted eggs that go with congee for breakfast.In my good old days salted duck eggs are often sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. Nowadays the producers might know how to do marketing and give the humble salted eggs a nicer presentation. The salted duck eggs I come across here recently almost have the salted paste removed wrapped in plastic or vacuum packed. The best salted eggs should have a briny aroma translucent egg white with the yolk bright orange red in colour. The yolk that releases oil after being cooked is considered as a high quality product.Sadly here in Australia it s quite hard to find fresh duck eggs yet it s much easier to get some cooked ones. Weird isn t it? If any fresh duck eggs put on rack for sale in any Asian grocery stores they would be gone very quickly.As I have been missing and craving this homey food very much I brined a dozen and then cooked several traditional Chinese dishes with the salted eggs. Would you like to know what dishes I cooked? I'll post them in a series later on.I was glad to hear that Penny of Addictive and Consuming and Trix of Tasty Trix would host an International Egg Incident Party. Lucky enough I can manage myself to participate this time. Here in this post I share an easy way to make salted eggs at home. This time I used chicken eggs. If you can find fresh duck eggs that s even better. But I found the end result of using chicken eggs was very satisfied. This recipe was tested for many times. Not long before I shared this recipe with my Chinese readers all salted egg lovers were fascinated and many of them tried it on the next day they read my recipe with satisfied outcomes. Here s a picture of my fan's salted egg. She shared her joy with me when she successfully made some delicious salted eggs.Homemade Salted Eggs Ingredients 12 duck eggs (or chicken eggs)1 cup sea salt (or rock salt)4 cups water1 tbsp Shaoxing wine1 star anise2 tsp Sichuan peppercornsMethod Rinse the eggs and drain well. Set aside.Put water and salt in a saucepan. Add star anise and Szechwan peppercorns. Bring it to a boil. Once the salt completely dissolves turn off the heat. Let cool completely.Pour in the wine and stir well.Use a clean glass container carefully arrange the eggs in the container. (Note check every egg to make sure there are no cracks on it.) Pour salted water into the container and cover the eggs. You ll notice some eggs above would float to the surface so place something like a little sauce plate on top of the eggs. The basic idea is to get all eggs submerse completely in the brine. Tightly cover the container and place at room temperature. The brining process normally takes 30 to 40 days. Label the start and finish dates on the container to remind yourself. (I used google calendar to set an email alert to myself.) After 30 days take one egg out to cook and see if its taste is salty enough. If not let the rest to brine for a few days more. If you re satisfied drain all eggs out and wipe dry. Keep them in an egg carton and place in fridge. The salted eggs can be kept for a few weeks in fridge.Notes Before placing the eggs in the container do make sure all the eggs are not broken or have any cracks.If you don t have star anise and Sichuan peppercorns you can replace with any tea leaves you like when cooking the salted water. The egg shells would look darker infused by the fragrance of the tea you used.The egg yolks would turn orange red beautifully because of the effect of adding Shaoxing wine.,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-19,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,"My feelings on this game are love/hate and I've installed and uninstalled it several times. It's great at reeling you in with it's unique premise but ends up being an overly frustrating and often toxic experience.The core idea of this game is so solid which is what always ends up drawing me back. Asymmetrical pvp is always a interesting concept and expanding on that by having a singular killer and several survivors makes for a really fun mix.The problems arise as the initial excitement ends and you get into the meat of the game First the grinding in this game is unbelievable for a game that isn't somehow F2P/P2W. It's achingly slow and doesn't carry over between characters in any meaningful way. However your rank (used for matchmaking purposes) remains between characters so good luck trying to play a new killer with no items and no perks matched up against four top tier survivors. To be clear I appreciate a good progression system. But this is so needlessly grindy that it's not fun. Every game has cheesy mechanics. Things that work in a way that seemingly go against the way the game was designed but work (albeit generally not that well). They're generally good for a laugh often catching the other players by surprise but not much more than that. This game is built on cheese. It's an underground base in a moon made of cheese. The most effective mechanics are completely contrary to the theme of the game. I realize that this approaches dangerous territory in regards to how the game ""should"" be played. But when the best tactics for survivors involve standing in front of the survivor so he can't move around (body blocking) running in circles where the killer can't follow effectively (pallet loops) and other similar tactics you have to wonder if that was really the intention when this game was conceived. Survivors can't even hide effectively with one of the newer killers he literally just creates an AOE as he walks around that pings everyone. It's not completely without fun but it's definitely not anything like what I expected.The nail in the coffin is always the toxicity for me. Everyone thinks you should play the game in a certain way and you will get flamed post match at least 1/3 of the time if not more often. Should you just shrug this off and enjoy the game? Yes. But does it make you want to come back and continue playing? Not particularly.",Dead by Daylight

2018-04-19,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun and boring at the same time. I say boring because of the campers. You start up a game maybe start to repair a gen then there's the killer get chased down hooked. You think the killer is gonna leave to catch everyone else but nope just stands there.... camping. It's like the killer saying well you cant play anymore. But all of this usually happens at low ranks ranking up does help but there are a few that still do which sucks becasue it's no fun.Now the new emblems ranking makes things harder when you have been playing for almost 300hrs and need to change your play style. it makes things harder to rank up so you are stuck with the low rank cmapers so you need to work extra hard espesially after season reset.I love the style and idea of the game but I feel like the developers need to listen to their community and fix a few things.I think I have to leave the not recommend until something is done.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-02,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,It's hard to recommend this game to friends...Especially when I can't join a lobby with them. At the moment the game seems unfinished and grasping on the hopes of people's expectations for them to add a working party system. The problem with this is I can't review parts of a game that have not been released so...As for now I will do the pro's and con's list of the released portions of the game PRO'S Fun multiplayer Expansive perk/loot system Rewarded for working with teammates Challanging and refreshing gameplay experience. Instant matches as a SurvivorCONS Lack of a party system Lack of a matchmaking balancing system Problematic for new players to be anywhere close to the same level as experienced players. What I mean by this is that of course you will have an advantage by playing the game more but in this game the disadvantage is far too great to make it fun for a new player. Toxic Community. Again during my 3 4 hours played I experienced some of the most hateful and mean people I've ever played with. Be prepared to be called 'baddie' or 'scrub' for simply not being a level 5+ character or above. Leveling individual characters. I can understand leveling Killers and leveling survivors but each character in each category? This is simply to add more of a grind feeling to the game and it actually distances me from the game. Wait times as a Killer. I've tried the killer 3 times and it took me 10+ minutes for each time I played. This is unacceptable in a game released in 2016.THE VERDICT While this game exemplifies some amazing and refreshing new gameplay the problems with it's matchmaking and balancing simply make the game unenjoyable past the first hour of the game.,Dead by Daylight

But it's a so delicious and addictive that soon you will be browsing the scat categories in adult websites just by influence of this game.The game is broken in so many ways.

Some matches will disconnect and you'll be wondering why the hell you spent your money in a game with no polish at all. But then you'll remember that in a long time you haven't had this amount of fun in any other game. You'll remember the matches you and your friends laugh the hell out your chests making the killer hella salty in the lobby after the game. Remember that time you found a famous streamer playing as killer and you and your friends put 4 brand new parts and made the streamer curse the game and almost cry LIVE in front of 2000 viewers laughing at him. You'll remember that awesome match when you and your buddies played the perfect game running saving unhooking banging the killer all the way. You'll remember his cry and that will made you love this game. You'll love this game besides those horrible things i said in the beginning of this review because this game is SO MUCH FUN. These things i've said in the beginning are what make this game so good. Please devs. Don't fix this game. We love this game as it is. We want infinities!

2016-09-04,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,My girlfriend loves this game and I liked the look of it also. I gave it a try and enjoyed the gameplay with the thrill of chasing down your intended victims. I immediately lost heart when i began to encounter the vast swathes of cheaters. They seem to possess abilities that enable them to unhook themselves as soon as placed take 3 hits from a weapon with no signs of damage or even slowing down. They have to address this issue and perhaps I will play the game again in the future.Perhaps a way to report cheaters would help this game. The anti cheat system that installed recently doesn't seem to have stopped them. Pros Game graphics improved optimisation interesting game mechanics big online populationCons easy for people to cheat slow load times but they are improving UI is overly simple (opinion not fact)I will change my review when the devs fixed my main issue.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-24,0,0,389,False,Recommended,This game has improved immensely since it's early days. It isn't lobby simulator anymore and most of the glitches we came to know and hate are gone. There are still a few though mostly animation glitches which can be hilarious. The new update looks to be a promising game changer also.Update 10/27/17 They broke it with Freddy (The Nightmare) can't recommend it anymore. Like who thought this was a good idea? Did they even beta test him? This character sraight up kills on average 7 of the 4 (and yes you read that right) people per match without perks. I am literally using him to farm my other characters right now because every match lasts about 5 minutes and I make 46k points.Update 4/21/18 All is good again. This is a very enjoyable game. I'm going to miss it when the new game comes out.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-18,0,0,772,False,Not Recommended,This game is pure trash. I have 700 hours and still as a killer I am ed over by stupid perks toxic players or flashlights. This game is repetitive too there is the same objective every game sure it is fun first 100 hours but after this is garbage. Devs do not care about killers it only caters to new survivors. Do not buy this game as it screws over killers play this game as a survivor but don't be toxic as that what kills most players of over the older players. Survivors are too ing overpowered as gens are too ing fast.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-04,0,0,766,False,Not Recommended,Dead by daylight is r*tarded.If you wanna enjoy the game have some fun or tension you have to have some basic knowledge. As a survivor you should know how to chase with killer and as a killer you should have some tactics to kill all survivors ( I don't mean camping). In short you need to be good to it enjoy it.But the problem is if you're good the game f*cks with you. If you're a good survivor you'll get camped and tunneled. And if you're a very very good survivor that the killer can't even catch you you'll get banned (rip No0b3). If you're a good killer and you play him in the honest way (I mean not camping) survivors will troll you. All you have to do to succeed is to be low. A low survivor always have enought time to repair generators and escape while he's not helping his teammate who's tunneled or camped. A low killer ...... ahhhh..... as my 700 hrs experience says camping win whatever.The game is so toxic for me and yeah I didn't even mention bugs in it.Pls developer firx your game work on it new killers and maps aren't so important if your game is broken.

2017-06-20,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,A perfect example of a good idea ruined by horrible decisions.Playing as the killer is fun in theory until you realize how unbalanced it is. Survivors have overwelming ability to chase the killer and completely destroy the dynamic of them being afraid of the threat.Mechanics of the game are lazy and embarrassing and to be perfectly honest seeing the whole game play out the way it does just makes you feel like an idiot while playing.Terrible game. Im 100% positive that the game having a mostly positive rating is a result of content creators making good videos for a bad game because there is no way this game could stand on its own.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-05,0,0,335,False,Not Recommended,The game is very fun and has a lot of potential. With that said the number of game crashes/graphics card crashes increases every patch and for that reason I cannot recommend this game. The devs need to tackle the countless bugs and crashes the game faces before adding new content but that doesn't seem to be their priority. Very unfortunate.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-05,0,0,59,False,Recommended,I enjoy this game overall. It can be fun to play but some of the bugs and issues do take away from this enjoyment. If the matchmaking system is fixed then I will probably enjoy it a lot more. Its not very fun to be a rank 20 survivor playing against a rank 1 killer. Noris it fun to play as a rank 20 level 1 killer against rank 1 survivors. The lag issue is also a problem. It would be nice if there was a display of the servers ping so that survivors could be avare of what they are getting into.But overall I do enjoy playing this game I just hope some of those issues get fixed.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-06,0,0,199,False,Recommended,I recommend this game to people who are looking for a somewhat new idea to play while keeping a competitive mindset while playing or even just normal play. Dead by Daylight definitely has its flaws but its still not finished and the developers actually listen to the community. It may seem like updates are coming out a bit slow but its hard work making a game. The game is very fun to play especially when playing with friends however sometimes playing with friends can be frustrating due to the matchmaking system being a flawed. It can be very hard playing as a survivor at first but thats what makes it fun trying to get better at the game and the same can be said about the killer however I find playing as the killer easier. Of course everyone has different opinions and such so if you actually are interested in the game watch gameplay and make sure this is a game youre willing to put $20 on before getting it and being disappointed. When I first played this game I was instantly addicted but again not everyone has the same experience.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-06,0,0,138,False,Recommended,"Overall it's a pretty fun game but here is the break down.Graphics 8/10 Looks pretty damn good not the most amazing in the world but overall better than a lot from other indie companies.Gameplay 9/10 and 2/10 9/10) This requires some explaining. Most matches are fun mostly fair and pretty intense but you usually do not feel cheated. Sometimes you're team fails you and just leaves you to die sometimes you do the same...which is all fine and good. 2/10) The matches that aren't good are...really really bad. You either end up with the wraith as the killer and it plays some intense levels of t and is extremely OP wouldn't be so bad if they either nerfed the Wraith's invisibility power made it take longer to attack after appearing or turned off collision with the Wraith (there have been times where I have been squeezed between a generator and the Wraith when it decides to appear right next to me and I cannot flee). The Other thing that makes some matches absolute horrible is...killers that puppy guard when you're on the hook. I get that it is a tactic but it should be a tactic they are punished for. Losing points etc etc because puppy guarding definitely does not please the ""Entity"" if hiding survivors annoy it (An update made it that if you hide too long the ""Entity"" does things to reveal your location). Basically this poor portion of the review would be negated if they punished killers for Guarding people on the hooks thus negating a large portion of the Alturism tree of points for survivors. And if the Wraith recieved a major nerf on it's invisibility options. The Hillbilly can run into walls and miss entirely with the chainsaw the Trapper's traps can be sabotaged but nothing can with the Wraith.Overall 9/10 IF they fix some of the problems in the future.Suggestions Nerf the Wraith Punish Puppy Guarding Killers with point loss or something. Or best idea of all implement a ban system like similar games have done where the other players can disallow specific Killers/Monsters that way newer players are not being absolutely destroyed by the Wraith. Also please for the love of all that is right make it easier to get off the hooks...in my whole time playing in the beta and the official I never once managed to get off the hook with my own power.",Dead by Daylight

Be it if they are a million miles across the world or simply due to their bad internet connection. From the makers calling camping a tactic and giving no real penalty toward the killers for doing so to spending a little too much time just to find a lobby with a decent ping. If by chance you manage to find one most of the killers bail out due to SWF. Game updates almost every two weeks just for another issue to arise.And to top it all off basement blocking. This game has been out for how long? When you make it so a killer can completely block you off on the stairs to the basement with no way of being able to get through....well then why even attempt at saving anyone down there.

2016-12-19,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Essentially Dead by Daylight is a 4v1 game in which survivors try to escape and the killer well of course tries to kill them. I saw gameplay of Dead by Daylight and was instantly interested as I'm sure most would be. However I thought it was a Halloween game based around Michael Myers. But it's not which is absolutely fine because I can still play as Michael Myers. There are several great things about this game and it seems to be updated often making me think that the developers intend to keep their game alive and well.I recommend this game to anybody looking for a smart thrilling game that provides urgency. I especially suggest horror film fans mostly of slashers purchase this game and its Halloween Chapter DLC. Of the time I've played I've had a blast and intend to play much more. I'm sure many people will thoroughly enjoy Dead By Daylight.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,969,False,Recommended,Its been over 2 years since this games first release... Tons of DLC being brought out Tons of new content and tons of reworked content.To be quite quick in this review yes this game is incredibly fun in fact I play it all the time. I don't see any reason to not have this. If you're wondering about the mixed reviews this game has now there was recently a patch that brought more power to the killer's side and took a lot of it away from the survivor. Being able to use really powerful perks twice in a row during a chase is not fun which is what the patch fixes.Also a very famous youtuber/streamer OchiDO got hardware banned because of his incredibly high amounts of toxicity and use of exploits. A good move on the Devs parts we were all pretty much waiting for it.Again this game is not abandoned. It's stil very much alive. Although theres some toxicity in it I still very rarely see it. Reddit is hilarious with the memes and the devs do try hard in order to make the game a fun and welcoming environment.,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-19,0,0,569,False,Recommended,update I love the mid chapter update. The negative reviews are from survivor mains who most likely ran around teabagging the killer and thinking they were actually good at video games. Now instead of running across the map using flashlights 24/7 and instantly repairing generators survivors will actually have to put on their thinking caps and perhaps hide from a killer much like if you were in a horror movie. I play survivor as well and most of the time the players are toxic while the devs have been working on combatting their behavior with a new emblem system and now making some of the perks more strategic. This game is constantly updated and always getting better. The Devs have a vlog where they address features and are very transparent when it comes to the game. It's been a while since there has been a multiplayer game I can simply lose hours in and this is that game. You can play as either the killer or the survivors. Survivors play in 3rd person and the killer plays in 1st person. Survivors and killers each get 3 unique perks and eventually you can teach the perks to other survivors. Each killer has a unique ability such as throwing hatchets or charging with your chainsaw. Prestiging cosmetics and events keep the game engaging and rewarding. Survivors run around the map activating generators to power the exit gate and escape while the killer has to hunt survivors down and hook them to win. It's hard to describe how much fun this is so go and do yourself a favor and buy this game.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-27,0,0,1032,False,Not Recommended,This game is not worth the full Price. Get it only if its like 5 Bucks. Massive bug and balance issues most toxic community i ever seen (worse than lol) no dedicated servers and devs.Game is poorly optimized so it runs poorly. A lot of hacking and Exploring. Random sometimes undeserved bans and no bans for obvious cheaters. Dont recomend.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-26,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Beware. It is dangerously addictive. I have uninstalled this game three times but I always come back. Expect constant balanced unbalance and toxicitiy among the higher ranks. There's plenty of low skill people in the high ranks because they camp and tunnel. Can be rewarding if you get good.,Dead by Daylight
2017-12-31,0,0,1880,False,Recommended,The game is kind of frustrating in its current state. But im still giving it a good review. Because all the recent negatives you will see are from peopel who are angry because the game is actually becoming balanced for once. The game is very fun and the devs are making steps in the right direction to a better game. Despite all the negative reviews you see just ignore them. They actuall ymean nothing. half of them have like only 100 hours or so. Give the game a try its very fun,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-23,0,0,1852,False,Recommended,This game is getting better and better. Been around since just after the huntress I look up exact %'s of items to make sure it's what I want I can spend ages thinking of a fun or interesting build. This game is starting to get alot better ESPECIALLY since the exhaustion change. I'm not going to miss the people who are talking about in killin themselves because they're not able to loop a killer for days anymore. It is a shame it's gotten a massive hit in reviews since then.The game is fun. It's the disgusting 'community' that ruin it.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,894,False,Recommended,Fantastic game with tons of variety in killers. Some minor issues but worth the asking price,Dead by Daylight
2016-10-31,0,0,91,False,Recommended,I have been following the game for a little time. I have watched streams about it so I finally picked it up. It was kinda balance and fun to play. Not all things felt balanced but I learned to deal with the small issues.The game has four survivors which objective is to repair the generators open the exit door to escape. The killer's objective is to kill the survivors and make sure they don't get out. Killers of cause have some tools to make sure the survivors doesn't escape with ez mode.The recent patch made alot of survivors rage and go riot. I don't understand that behavior since it's so small change. Exhaustion perks got a nerf hit which it is not a big deal. Just use it with caution. To survive is SUPPOST to be a challenge.Two killers got a buff to which is needed because now you got a chance to face other than Hillbilly and Nurse all the time. Is it so bad? In my opinion this is the right step the devs has taken and I look forward to see what else they have planned.Beware the community can be really toxic my suggestion is just ignore the toxic players. Pay them no mind.It will remain recommend it for now since devs finally are trying to balance the game. Have fun the fog.Sorry for my English. It's not my first language.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-30,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"just don'tnow when i got it it seemed like a FANTASTIC game that i could play oh it was such a interesting change from what i normally did! a 4v1 to help me get over evolve actually getting that whole feel of adrenaline or whatever else came with the game that had the word ""horror"" stamped on itgodi was a complete jackass now the problem is with all this is simply that there's one core element to this game that drives the whole reason why we play it and of course why its failing horribly the killers. or lack thereof. now as a killer your gonna spend more time screaming ""WHAT THE "" and wondering why in gods name you spent your money on this sinking ship that looked seaworthy but ran into an iceberg rather than having this maniacal look as you chop down survivors and sacrifice them to your hardly explained god now fair warning this is a opinion fueled by the bad times with this game and the fact that the steam refund system sucksstarting with the fact that no one wants to play killer""but why don't people wan't to play as the killers! they're powerful or whatever can't they whack those peons where they show??"" yeaaaah but here's the thing you can have more fun playing as a monster in evolve (fun fact game that is no longer being updated is much more fun than this) than you do playing killer now you have 5 killers to pick from but since i have spent so little time with this i only played 3. the only thing really setting these people apart are movement speed and abilities and by god you need to be about as inescapable as the Blair witch to even stand a chance of WINNING as a killer to begin with which further supports why the que times suck. no one wants to play as a killer if its absolute hell to do so now when you do get to play it's honestly the most fun you'll oh did i say fun well fun if your a SURVIVORas a killer it makes learning how to play as one hell since the survivors are either A invisible or hidden far too well to be seenB turning engines on and disappearing into oh so magical mists as soon as you investigateC waiting at the exit to taunt you one last time as you hit them because apparently there's auto revive at the exit. joyous.its so mind numbing and aggravating to even start playing as a killer to even get the idea of playing it more after that. not to mention how most of the abilities don't seem to work for you hell a BLINK can fail you more times than once because the nurse apparently gets seizures from doing so and staggers as soon as she gets out of teleportation causing you to flail around like a moron yelling ""where is he! he was right there!!"". not to mention all those goddamned PALLETS. this is such a filthy and disgusting part of this poor excuse of a game that i cringe whenever i actually see one of these as a survivor. its a get out of jam free card and it is ALWAYS beneficial to use a pallet killer on your tail? PALLETkiller seen? RUN AROUND THE PALLET killer just doing anything in general? PALLETi'm amazed they dint make a function to chuck the damn things at the killers yet now as a SURVIVOR on the other hand this game is somewhat enjoyable that is of course your a troll who loves nothing more than ing about with the many issues of this game rather than actually playing the game the way its oh whats that?that's how all survivors play?well damn to be honest as a survivor at a high enough rank its not very challenging. the killer is normally almost always on tilt flailing about as you slink away without a problem pallets always have your back the killer is always further on tilt since you freed a survivor from the clutches of a hook 4 times already you have a back up hatch for when the time calls and you of course always look forward to waiting at the exit to say ""MISSED ME JACKASS"" as the killer lets a rage fueled charge for you as you run into the mist as the killer is given a disgraceful defeat this is the gamethis is ALL you ever do and nothing morethat's my basic honest to god opinion on the game anyway. waiting sucks no one wants to play the class that people bought the game for anyway and your gonna end up being a survivor main now go ahead and spend your 20 bucks if you have any faith left in this or the developers which i have lost long agoorrrrrrrrrr spend it on this instead http //store.steampowered.com/app/481510/now i know what your thinking ""is this a link to night in the woods?""yes it isdo i expect you to get the game?of course not just offering a better use of 20 dollarsanyways have fun.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-02,0,0,324,False,Recommended,Matchmaking system has to be improved killers and survivors have to be matched according to a short range between ranks. How is a ranked 1 killer matched against a bunch of ranked 20s survivors or vice versa fair? Survivors getting caught and intentional disconnecting resulting in a loss of points for the killers and killers disconnecting if he or she felt that the game is on a losing end for him eg. Better skilled survivors getting generators online faster than the killer could find them.When survivors searches for games in the lobby it always bugs out and players have to keep retrying to search for games and when we do we encounter killers that lags. No doubt it's a fairly new game bugs and glitches are understandable.After ranting so much I still recommend this game.Although the negative trumps over the positive but give the game a go it is still enjoyable to a extend. I will still continue playing Dead by Daylight I still see potential in this game becoming way better than it is in it's current state.Dead by Daylight is one of those games that you really hate and rant because of problems it has now but you just can't stop playing because in some sense it's really fun.Devs really has to address this common issues that majority players are having problems with.,Dead by Daylight

2018-05-25,0,0,84,False,Recommended,I was sceptical at first but it proved better than I thought. It combines both singleplayer elements and multiplayer without making it unbalanced in gameplay. I prefer singleplayer games which naturally makes me suitable to play as the killer where you only rely on yourself. If you are into co op you should consider playing as the survivors although I haven t yet played survivor I d imagine it is very similar to the left 4 dead . Which mean you sometimes partner up with people of different experience and that will be your downfall for your chances of surviving are considerably reduced if you lose one of your people. However a skilful team against a noob killer will make it very hard for the killer to capture them. Still calling on my experience as a GM it is enjoyable to be able to apply pressure to the players and make them work together. It is one of those games that enable you to meet people and add them to your friend list.,Dead by Daylight

And the survivor whose main job is to BM the killer with Tbagging and flashlight spam behind pallets Blind a killer as they break a pallet tbag eat a small meal then sprint burst away. I sadly cannot recommend this to anyone willing to play casually. If you do get 3 other friends and play Survive with friends cause solo is a death sentence.4/10 Getting more toxic as the days go by...UPDATE I can begin to recommend this game again as all the toxic elements are being worked away (telepallets D strike etc.) Plus toxic little people are begining to get banned.

Generally speaking the game features short (10 30) minute matches. You'll try to quietly find generators to repair whilst continuously looking over your shoulder for the proverbial (and litteral) axe to drop. This game is definitely dark as far as games go but the simplicity behind the game makes the mechanics that much more enjoyable.

Let your friends hang on a hook while you fix generators so you can escape!A very fun and unique game marred by several issues on launch. They did a great job patching all the issues from Beta and I'm sure they'll fix these new issues.Currently the major problem and the thing everyone is complaining about in reviews is that you can't join as groups. I think this was intended because the ability to coordinate outside of the game is extremely powerful. Therefore you can only play in a full private game or not at all. This has resulted in people joining lobbies checking for their friends and then leaving. Over. And over. And over. The side effect of this is that basically games take forever to start.I still recommend this game just don't get it yet if all you want to do is play with friends. Because you can't.

Games loses the spooky factor after 5 or 6 hours but doesnt lose the anxiety factor. They ARE making the party system which might be OP for killer but who knows in KYF they reduce difficulty based on survivor amount so it's not impossible for them to raise difficulty since you can communicate. But for my friends and I we are lobby hopping and weve played about 10 or 12 games together. Its fun solo or with friends. Definietly more scary/anxious without mates.

2016-08-09,0,0,14,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is certainly a lot of fun with friends. However when I play the game on my own I dont get even near the amount of enjoyment as I would playing the game with a friend. You can either pick to play as a survivor or a killer. When you are the survivor your job is to find and activate FIVE generators (depending on how many survivors there is the number of generators that you have to activate will decrease.) which will then alow you to open a giant gate so you can escape. Therefore winning the game. However if one survivor makes it out that does not mean the rest of the survivors make it out with you. The remaining survivors will have to find the gate that you have opened so they can escape also. However you dont necessary have to activate all FIVE generators. There is a trap door which is hidden in every map and if you find the trap door then you can escape immediately without having to activate any generators. However the downside is that the game developers have updated the game so every time you spawn into the map the trap door will never be in the same place. Making it of course very hard to find. The killers job is of course to try and stop the survivors from escaping by killing them. At the moment there are only 3 killers you can play as. Each killer has a diffrent ability that they can use to hunt the survivors. The first killer you can play as is called ""Trapper"" and his ability is to lay down bear traps. The killer himself can also get trapped in his own bear traps however he can escape in 3 seconds. The second killer is called ""Wraith"" and his special ability is to go invisable. Which of course makes it very hard for the survivors to see him until it is too late. The invisabilty also makes him also very quite and what I mean by that is this.....When you play as the survivor if a killer gets near you your heart beat increases and gets louder. Telling the player playing as the survivor to hide or otherwise your going to get ed by the killer and lose the game. But when you play as Wraith you can not attack survivors whilst invisable which means you have to decloak to kill. The last killer you can play as is the least popular one where his special ability is a chainsaw but it is very hard to control and use effectively to kill. Moving on now. Playing with 4 or less friends will mean its going to take forever for the bloody game to find a match. Most of the time when you are playing with 4 or less friends you just keep pressing the ready button because each time it cant find a match it resets everyone to ""not ready"". Its like the game doesnt even really try to find a match. The game says ""searching for match"" then less than 2 seconds later is says ""failed to find match"". Its like ""Come game put some ing effort into finding a match will ya!?"" This is the biggest flaw at the moment and hopefully in the next patch or two this will have been fixed. Because like I have said at the start of me writing this review. The game is most fun when playing with friends. So my verdict for this game at the moment is........6/10. This game does show real potential and is really good fun when it finds a bloody match. So the sooner they fix that issue the better.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-10,0,0,354,False,Recommended,Personally I love this game. It's one of my favourite games. (Yes I'm Canadian). Dead by Daylight is a horror game. It's a multiplayer versus game. How it works is that there is 4 survivors trying to escape from a killer. The killers objective is to sacrafice all 4 survivors. The survivors objective is to work together to escape the place you are stuck in. The objective is that you have to repair and fix 5 generators. Those generators will power the main gates which you will then half to open to actually escape. While you are doing this there is a killer that witnesses every mistake you do. Don't screw up. Work together. Stay alert Stay alive. I rate this game a solid 10/10 for it's huge creativity and caring updates.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-13,0,0,111,False,Recommended,"Honestly With the nerf to a certain set of perks (Exhaustion) The game is much more balanced then its ever been in my opnion and this comes from a survivor main. Ive played a decent ammount of killer and survivor and let me tell you that if someone tries to tell you that its heavily against one side then thats either old information or they are very biased. The gameplay itself is addictive as all hell and most definitly worth your money if youve ever played and enjoyed a game like it before. This game is what Friday the 13th should be but it doesnt just focus on the single killer like that game does. Each killer is fun maybe not on par with one another but still fun to play as all the same. The Devs do a Q&amp A on reddit every week and the reddit also has a ""No Stupid Questions"" day where theyll answer anything you could want to ask.

The people and the killer seem kinda weird to me (I am running on ultra) Perhaps the biggest There is no grouping up with friends for public matches which this game really needs. This game is such a social game and for groups of players that are less than 5 it I will imagine will get tiring hunting the same people.When they add this (because duh they will) this game is definitly worth the pricetag of 20 euros.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,2,False,Recommended,I have a couple of hours logged on this game now so I thought I would leave a first impressions review.This game is great. The concept is great and the delivery is great. It brings me to mind of all those 70s 80s and 90s horrors which are so copied today but never bettered. Friday the 13th is the most obvious example. In this game you play as either a survivor or a psycho killer. The job of the survivors is to activate generators which power an exit. Once enough of the generators are powered it becomes a mad rush to the exit before the killer picks you off. As the killer your job is simple. Incapacitate the survivors and sacrifice them to the sky portal on various hooks dotted around the world. I believe that the locations of the generators and the hooks are random each time but of that I am unsure. There are a few problems with this game which I noticed straight away and are mostly to do with balance. It is simply too easy as the Killer. You move faster than the survivors are able to hear them when they work on the generators (this is visually represented by an icon) and there are too many hooks around the world. These things overpower the Killer and not in a fun way. Yes the killer should be difficult but not to the point where it is unfun to play as the killer because it is simply a walk in the park. You want players to relish both otherwise there will come a point when being a survivors outnumber killers and finding a lobby will be even harder than it already is. My advice would be to remove some of the hooks maybe only leave the basement hooks so that the killer must return to his lair and protect it from survivors who make rescue attempts. At the moment it is far to easy for the killer to be mobile all over the place. He can down a survivor hang them on a hook and still have time to reach a generator before a survivor activates it. If hooks were not so close at hand it would also make the whole escape mechanic whereby you must wiggle LS in order to struggle free a worthwhile addition. At the moment it is impossible to escape unless the killer takes his sweet time on purpose. Another addition that is much needed is for there to be many more different types of hiding place. At present there are only out of place looking cupboards but trash cans dumpsters and whatnot would add some variety and force the killer into looking more. Those are just some suggestions. Other than that the game is great and I am sure more tweaks are coming.,Dead by Daylight

This game is great a breath of fresh air in the genre... i'm really looking forward to future dlc and content already,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This game just dropped coming out of beta and is a 4 v 1 slasher film type of game where you have 4 survivors taking on 1 killer each killer has their own quirks between the trapper who can user a knife and traps the wraith type who can vanish and be invisable but not attack until visable and the hillbilly with his brutalk chainsaw attack between the slashers and survivors you can upgrade their look as well as some perks and materials as you gain point through the game. If you are playing as the killer you must find the 4 people and kill them by slashing them and putting them on hooks until they die and preventing escape as the survivors you must find 5 engines to restart including a space bar QTE in order to open 2 gates to escape.Overall the game is alot of fun thus far but seems better with friends so you can communicate with each tother but even without i find it fun they just need to fix some bugs in the game still like getting stuck as the killer on a window.I say give it time and see some updates if your on the fence but if you really like 4 v 1 action this is some very fun action. you can check out my gameplay on my youtube channel herehttps //youtu.be/OT5z2Zmhs3A,Dead by Daylight

The ranking system doesnt matter as the higher you go the less likely you get games. Everyone wants you to play in a way that ""killer puts survivor on hook and goes waits across the map lets people save then chases again until they do all 5 gens and the survs escape"" that is what is expected of the killer every single game and if you dont play that way youre visciously harassed as a survivor all you do is run in a circle around each obstacle until you either make a mistake or there are no more obstacles... the only way to truly enjoy this game is to either be payed to play it or to play like a meme but if you do that it is probably their ONLY bannable offense... cheating isnt even reportable",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight ReviewOverviewDead by Daylight is a 4v1 Horror game. 4 survivors 1 killer. There are now 4 choosable killers from the 'last breath' free update. There are also 5 selectable survivors. Survivors are launched into the map in thirdperson while the killer is in first person. Each killer has a special skill. The Trapper has a bear trap that can be placed. The Wraith may turn invisible but has a bell sound turning it on and off. The Hillbilly has a deathly chainsaw charge. Finally the Nurse has a 'blink' ability allowing her to teleport in a straight line. Each survivor and killer has a unique upgrade system but I will not go too much into detail in this review. GameplayThe gameplay in Dead by Daylight is truely unique. When you spawn in as a survivor your objective is to escape the map. To do this you must find generators and turn them on. You must hold left click while having short timed moments where you must press space in the white. If you do this incorrectly a loud explosion occurs and it attracts other survivors and of course the killer. When all 4/5 generators are completed the 2 gate openings will open. This takes a while but opens a gate to escape. If you are the last survivor alive a trap door will open randomly on the map. You can quickly jump into this and escape. The killer as I said before is in first person giving him a slight disadvanage. To know if the killer is near a heartbeat soud effect will occur. The louder it is the closer the killer is to you. The only way the heartbeat sound does not take place is when The Wraith is invisible but you can see him and it takes around 4 seconds for him to become uninvisible. There are now 4 different maps in the game. Each map is different and takes time to learn. The killer needs 2 hits on you for you to go down. They will then pick you up and take you to a hook (You can wiggle out of his grasp if you are fast enough). A bar will then appear in your name which is your meter to live. Before the meter gets half drained you can attempt to escape. There is only a 10% chance of you escaping though. When the bar goes half down you must spam space to stay alive. Other survivors can save you from this hook. Items in the game can be found in crates or you can get them from upgrades in your survivor upgrade tree. The torch lasts 5 seconds by default and can immobolize the killer if they are holding another survivor (which will drop the survivor). The medkit can be used to heal teammates. The toolkit is used to sabotage hooks. There are other items but I don't know the full extent to them. Also around the map there are closets which you can hide in but they make a sound when you enter them so I wouldn't reccommend getting in them. There is also no communication between survivors so if your playing by yourself prepared to be frustrated worried and scared as hell.ConclusionDead by Daylight is a fun game for anyone out there. If your worried that the game is too scary it really isn't. If you have $20 to spare I would definetly reccomend this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,12,False,Recommended,Sort out the network coding and it'll be a fantastic game. Had alot of fun playing with friends. BUT But it's somewhat buggy at finding servers. I really hate the modern system of match making really I prefer it when there is a server list to pick from like the good old days. Why can't this clearly working method of finding mulitplayer games remain? Why force us to wait in a matchmaking system? Ridiculous. Aside from that multiplayer issue. The game itself is great very fun and I am finding being a survivor quite a tense experience and being the killer a thrill. Fantastic game great graphics bloody and could be made abit better with more execution methods more brutal deaths not only the meathooks.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,98,False,Recommended,"EDIT Community is great. Thou some may disagree.It's a truly fun game and one of the few I am actually good at.It's hilarious trying to outsmart your opponent.Some problems with the game is the overpowered survivor perks and overpowered killer perks. Not gonna go into details. Just know that starting new you are at a huge disadvantage but the effort pays off with time. DO NOT SWITCH CHARACTERS OFTEN!!!!!! Just learn to play one character at a time and level them up before you switch. It is 100 times easier to level up one character than have 10 low level characters in the same amount of time. A leveled up character wins more often.It is the only game I can say that the more you play the better it gets.One frustrating thing remains in that a killer that camps a survivor on a hook severly ruins game play. But that has become a rare occurance. And you'll see this is one of the few games ppl say ""GG"" and then wish you good luck in your next game. I love the community.",Dead by Daylight

2018-04-18,0,0,557,False,Recommended,I may come back to write more later but thought I'd just quickly put down a very strong recommendation for this game. There's a bunch of frustrating stuff in there to do with other players but there's also a lot of really great things and the game itself is brilliant.4 survivors vs 1 killer and they have to repair generators open the exit gates and escape while trying to be stealthy escaping the killer and helping each other out. The killer roams around kicking generators and cutting up survivors before sticking them on hooks to sacrifice them. Works pretty well! Loads of perks and items lots of maps and characters. The game is updated and gets new content lots and it has my favourite take on a skill tree.If you don't own it it's well worth a go even if you don't normally like horror games. I never thought I'd like this sort of game and mainly picked it up to play it with someone. I'm very glad I did as it's turned into one of my favourite games. You're missing out on a really great time if you don't try it.To youto!,Dead by Daylight

I just played over the free weekend but it did not grab me enough to purchase. Maybe create a discounted 5 pack to make it more of a group game instead of looking for lobby which during my time playing kicked me out of my party 6 times and we had to regroup. I will recommend this game because it is fun but make sure you have a full group to play it with.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-20,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is tons of fun! Im assuming a large sum of the people writing negative reviews have never even leveled their killer or survivor past level 25. I say this because that is when you unlock the fourth and last perk slot and perks help a ton in this game. The first two days of playing this game was very hard as a survivor with only one perk iron will 1 I found myself dying a lot as other survivors had premonition 3 speed burst 3 and other very helpfull/NEEDED perks kept escaping and winning the match. Starting this game as a survivor is very hard but if youre able to persevere through and past rank 25 you will find yourself escaping more often and youll also learn a lot on how to juke and hide from the killer. As for the killer its a whole different story as the first two days of playing this game I was able to become a rank 10 killer with only one perk Iron Grasp 1. I kept finding and killing all four survivors every match. However do not hook camp as youll easily lose the game and hopefully even a pip. Im glad the developers encouage you to keep looking for survivors and not just kill one after another however many rank 20 killers dont know this and proceed to hook camp and ruin the game for the survivors by not even giving them a chance. This is another reason why it is so hard to start as a survivor because youre likely to have a match with a hook camper with a 1/3 chance.Overall 9/10 game for me it was just a really rough start all bugs aside I would recommend this game only to people that are willing to play a game that requires you to play ALOT before you actually get good skill and perk wise.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-20,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Terrible matchmaking where the killer is the host.Waiting for people to ready up is cancer.Most of the time the killer camps you after they put you on a hook or they camp one of the exits to the map.Definitely not worth over 3 dollars for the insane lack of content much less the original $20 price.The upgrade and loadout system is precedurally generated. Ew.After your first game of winning as the survivor you've experienced basically everything you can as a survivior.Insanely long loading times sometimes.Trying to play in a lobby with 1 2 friends takes a long time.Overall not worth the buy.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-19,0,0,532,False,Recommended,I tell you...this game is just a masterpiece in my eyes. The concept of it just never gets old and there are various maps perks killers and survivors to unlock and level AND prestige (which comes with cool rewards). What makes this game so good is that every chase pallet stun 360 juke blind save close calls and everything possible can get your adrenaline pumping. Sure this game is hard to just buy and be good at it but I've had quite a bit of experience on my hands. What also makes it so great is if you hate surviving against an annoying killer then you can play that annoying killer and learn so much about ways to avoid that specific character. Or if you hate inifinites then play survivor. There are a variety of ways to play and win when it comes to this game (cough cough* unlike F13 The Game) it makes any match interesting.P.S I am still giving this game a good review even though my progress was resetP.P.S I got my progress back because of how great Behaviour is and was awarded 20 000 000 bps back,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-30,0,0,628,False,Recommended,"Before you buy this game answer this?Are you sure you are going to be playing with your friends majority of the time in swf? Or are you going to fly solo. This game with friends is indeed the better choice as you can have laugh rage all together about the killer camping majority of the time. If you decide to play survivor majority of the time get ready for salty killers? And if you intend to fly solo as a killer its the same thing. There is salt everywhere in this game. But with the power of teamwork you can overcome with even greater salt. However this game is all about grinding at the moment. You would see YouTubers who have tier 3 perks in all 4 slots. But when you play you're gonna be starting. (unless you do kyf but im talking about grinding). It should maybe take two or three days tops to get your suitable perks but damn it takes forever. I'm still trying to get two more characters to level 50 and i havent even gotten to any killer (except trapper yeah i know survivor main here). If you play salty games like League of Legends (this is just an example) then be prepared for the worst because it ain't very different. If you fly solo everyone is more or less is fending for themselves. ""oh but wait shiro what about flashlight saves and op medkits plays (ex syringe or stypic which is not op).""They are farming you. Getting points so they can ""help"" you out when in reality they are just trying to rank up. In conclusion if you start you better grind...hard. Because this game can be horrible when it comes to grinding and it becomes scary at first but just remember when you play over the course of the game your not gonna be scared like ""OH ITS A WRAITH!!!! RUN!!!!!"" Instead you are going to be like ""uh oh guys its the wraith easy match"" or ""ugh im getting tunneled again stupid baby killer"". You will hate this game at some point because devs are still fixing these issues but goodness it can be one sided these days.Anyways thats all i wanted to say thank you for reading and have a wonderful day or night )",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-01,0,0,142,False,Recommended,This game is the ultimate fantasy of every horror fan out there. I just can't wait for the Dead by Daylight film and hope they don't muck it up that's how good this game is. It 100% deserves a movie.Traditional run of the mill games (random example Skyrim) will have me gritting my teeth because some areas are just creepy (What a wuss right?) but Dead by Daylight has me eagerly putting my best 'offering' forward running for the next generator anxiously wondering who the killer is and whether he's gonna GIT me or not. It's all a rollercoaster of excitement even for someone who's as chicken as I always was before this game conditioned me into thoroughly enjoying the thrill of horror.Well fleshed out characters with just the right amount of information you'd like for each survivor. Each killer unique to DbD has their own well written story as well with the right amount of depth provided.Aesthetically everything in this game looks beautiful actually it's not all grit and gore. The Entity can actually be beautfiul and poetic looking (as angsty as that sounds) and the writing isn't cheesy or over the top. The characters look like everyday normal people and are given options that enforce their own personal style.The gameplay is fun and filled with heart pounding anticipation. It does have bugs and a rare glitch or two getting stuck between trees on Lampkin Lane is never fun but you may have a killer or teammates that may recognize and help or hinder. It's all in the sport of it and it's fun either way. There are times where campers can be cringey (hey it's a strategy...I guess) or that skip lag is working in someone's favor...but as far as mp/co games are concerned you'll definitely spend more time having fun than being tilted.The DLC they release is always innovative I always find myself surprised with each release and it entices users to play. Their updates are usually filled with bug fixes or improvements/new features/aesthetic additions which is great for the gameplay and visuals alike.The community is mostly good. I've run into some poor sports some jerks but that's unavoidable nowadays. Nothing you can't report and nothing the next great match with potentially fun players can't fix. )I could go on and on about this game. Get it! Totally worth it.,Dead by Daylight

After getting this on the free weekend I can say with certainty i did enjoy myself sure there are bugs and a lot of them but the onlly ones i ran into were around the main menu (couldn't join friends matches freezing etc which were all fixed by closing and reopening the game) ton of fun if you can grab three or four friends and pllay private matches or survive online together. Other than bugs the most annoying thing about this game was having to remake your friend lobbies after every match or leaving and creating a new lobby to switch who the killer is in your group.All in all a good game i could see myself paying the $15 dollar (Canadian) price for it.EDIT After coming back to the game from a long hiatus I remembered why i stopped playing in the first place the ridiculously over powered new killers. I don't want the game to be easy for survivors but it shouldnt be impossible. How is it fair as a survivor to have apparently infinite axes thrown across vast distances? Whats the point in pulling pallets down when they can just axe you from a distance. And why is it an option the kill the players with your weapon in the first place? That doesnt make the game fun for anyone it makes it one sided and ruins the rank of the survivors when they end the game with 2000 points.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Since this game was free at the time I had the opportunity to play the game as a ''trail.'' I started the game and played 2 games 1 as survivor and 1 as a killer. Both were intense and fun even for me who can't even sit on my own couch and watch a horror movie and hate jumpscares. I later found out my friend got home from work. I told him to download Dead by Daylight so he did. Once we both started the game up we had issues. We could not find a game and it was impossible to find one. After 10 minutes he just gave up. I tried right after he left it worked again. I played 3 games after that. 2 of the 3 I escaped successfully. To be honest this game has its ups and downs but for $20 I think it is totally worth it. If you are not into the horror scene this is a great starter introduction. For the gameplay it is VERY good. It is very well enjoyable if you are alone or if you have a full party of 5. The idea is unique and fun. Both sides survivor and killer are relatively equal. I would give this game a 8/10 for a great starting horror game. ),Dead by Daylight

Pros Multiple killers/survivors to suit your killing/surviving play style Interesting Level Progression Web (The Blood Web) that's infinate Music and sounds are amazing and give the game a great vibe to it Gives off a really creepy atmosphear on every map Plenty of maps to play Kill your friends mode! (sorry if you don't have enough friends they are adding a fix for this!) Skill checks are easy but keep players alert and actually doing something besides clicking and waiting. Haven't seen a single hacker since launch (day 12 now? Will update later if needed)Cons Buggy as hell I excpected a lot less bugs since this just went through alpha and beta just ended but that's okay... every game has bugs they just need to get fixed... Must have a group of 5 to play with if you're inviting friends for it to be any fun ( this is being added in the next major patch ) Window jumpers... ONLY annoying when they are the last alive. Laggy characters/servers at times Alt+F4 to save your rank. Why?

2018-07-07,0,0,78,False,Recommended,"What can I say about Dead by Daylight? I don't usually like horror games but this isn't your typical ""just jumpscare escape the AI"" type of horror game. The stories for each character really get you into their thoughts and feelings and you can customize each character you play based on your playstyle. Leveling up your survivor or killer is incredibly simple and can be rewarding. The game runs incredibly smoothly at least on my computer and has very eerie audio which makes you constantly on the edge of your seat. Usually you can find a lobby rather quickly to play with other people which is really nice and the community seems really friendly at least to me! Overall great purchase!Edit After a long time of playing the game it takes an incredibly long time at least for me to find a lobby when playing the Killer which turns me off from playing that side. There are also A LOT of connection issues to different lobbies when trying to find a game. However when you do find a game it is insanely fun! D",Dead by Daylight

2018-08-09,0,0,304,False,Recommended,Its really complicated to review this gameOkay let's start with a good thingDead by Daylight has a great and unique concept of a game where 4v1 survival game with objective to survive alive or to kill 4 people if you played as killer. This game have a good graphics and really interesting to play because every killer or item and perks you used have different skill and function and really helps your objective in some situation with a rarity too just like a rpg game. This game also require some teamplay and really interesting to play with friend. The feeling of horror will be felt when you first play the game and the feeling of become a slayer just like in the serial killer movie is very thrilling and felt so intense. Really recommended. But This game have a huge balance issue this issue caused by many things perks game mechanics map design and many more have a big problem. And sometimes you will feel stressed and have no fun to play because killer got bullied by 4 player or cant have your second chance alive as survivor because the killer really wants you to die so bad. This game also have a really really toxic community this endless debate from surv main and killer main caused by balance issue really stressful.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-21,0,0,62,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a great 4V1 game that is both challenging and strategic. It acts as a cat and mouse game on both the suvivours and killers sides with you trying to outwit and predict what the other will do. It's not without it's flaws like all prominantly online games but it's definately one that is worth playing.PRO Games are pretty quick to find due to a good number of people playing Each game is different with opponents teammates and the randomly generated maps. Every suvivour and killer has their own unique perks and abilities. Plenty of killers and survivours to choose from and well timed and decently priced DLC (which include new maps) Graphics are pretty nice and it runs well. Lots of crossovers into different horror franchises that works great such as Michael Myers from Halloween the Pig from Saw Freddy Keruger from Nightmare on Elm Street. Each game lasts roughly between 5 to 20 minutes depending on how well the players are doing which is a good length so it's not over too fast or you're getting bored. Ranking system and levelling gives the grind a good feel. As you level up and spend points on the bloodweb you gain new perks abilities and items that you can use in the games. The music and atmospheric sounds really add to the tense aura of the game and that's not even mentioning the heartbeat that plays when the killers are near. Events are held every so often which give special bonus' for in game events which are fun to go for. There is no forcing players to work together which is great if you prefer to play solo. It actualyl tells you that you can do either and it will have pros and cons it's about whichever works best for you. Survivours play in third person to give an advantage of a heightened sense of ""awareness"" while the killers play in first person which is a great design choice.CON No single player tutorial it's all just text. It's alright but there's a lot to cover. Players can sometimes be obnixious and quit before you're able to kill them. You get points but I don't think it's as much as it would be if you killed them nor is there much in the way of a punishment for that. At first there were special DLC outfits that you could buy for cheap but it seems that they have implemented an ""in game currency"" for that which you can only use real money to get (that I know of). It wouldn't be as bad but there is a very limited selection as of now eg plenty for survivours not as much for killers. Some players do enjoy running around the same thing over and over again so be prepared for a little frustration when vying to kill them.Dead by Daylight is a great game if you can get past the 1 in 10 games that's pretty bad due to some annoying or frustrating players. But from my experience most of the games ar ereally fun and tense with everyone taking part and playing their role. If you enjoy a game of strategic teamwork or a game of brutal bloody murder then give it a try.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-30,0,0,16,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely amazing I recommend it to everyone. The only down fall to this game is that their isn't any chat between players when you're actually in the game not the lobby. It would be nice to see some way of communication for the survivors either messaging or voice chat. I'd prefer voice chat. You can always Skype but when you are playing with a lobby full of random people it makes it hard. Overall I rate this game 10/10 definitely a must buy.

They need to fix that BS because the people flagged aren't even cheating. second there should be a ping reader because 30% of the games that I've joined are super laggy and not from my internet. there are a few other various things that are bad about the game but over both of those major issues I think the game is great.,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-23,0,0,252,False,Recommended,Overall 8/10This game is pretty good. It's definately the most fun when you play with friends though. Going into a match solo can be hard since you can't communicate with the other survivors on your team but i suppose that's the point. It's got good atmosphere and looks nice. It retains a spooky vibe that always lingers but it's not overbearing. I enjoy the gameplay as well simple but it can be challenging at times. The character designs are pretty cool and the system of ability building works out nicely. Addicting and not too hard to get the hang of.But actually getting into a game is the hard part. Their match system has some problems it can take like 30 minutes to get into a lobby. Another thing is that if the killer lives in a different country or something you're laggy af as a survivor and it makes the gameplay kind of irritating. There were also some problems where it'll glitch on the loading screen and you have to force quit. The glitches make it kind of annoying at times but the game itself is really fun and I would recommend getting it. The developers are working on solving some of the issues and whatnot so I have faith in it.,Dead by Daylight

After adding a reserved spot getting into matches is no longer a real pain anymore. At least for the solo que it seems fixed haven't tried the play with with friends recentlyFirst of I want to say that I really like the concepts of the game. Either being the killer hunting the survivors or trying to escape the killer are very fullfilling. The atmosphere is moody and dark which only is a big plus in the game. So far I only have encountered a single bug and with the recent patch this bug is already resolved.After the que fix I've been able to spend a lot of time playing as survivor sneaking around to get some precious generators. Only to find myself in situations where I suddenly encounter the killer getting mad for using his precious generators and using up all the gas in them. Apperently he wanted to use it for his chainsaw and his car. But no of course I had to start them making it impossible for him to go to the town next door to finally get his groceries.I have had great fun so far playing as a pesky survivor or playing as an angry killer who doesn't want his power being tapped. There are still some balancing issues/trolls/hackers out there but you will encounter them in every game.I would rate this game 8/10,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-08,0,0,142,False,Recommended,I really love this game ! It has a great concept and it's very easy to get addicted too. If you can by pass small glitches then you should get this game.

2018-07-08,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Is this game fun yes for me. If you enjoy playing games solo then the killer is the way you want to go. It is very fun and when you get good enough to make people rage quit you get this warm tingly feeling in certain places. If you enjoy playing with friends and work well with your friends then the survivor is for you. Once you got the survivor playstyle down you will make killers hate there lives and want to just quit so they can get on to the next game. There are a few balanceing issues but they only become apparent when someone skilled is useing them. The nurse for instance has the ability to teleport and is extremely hard to dodge/juke if they are really good at reading what you are going to do. She can tele through walls and past barricades which are the survivors main survival tool. Getting rid of the usefulness of that means that you have to rely on stealth and when they have the right perks it's very hard. Personally I am not a big fan of the survivor mostly because I suck at quicktime events and that basically the one thing you have to be really good at to win. But the killer is great if you enjoy working as a team and don't mind quicktimes events you will like this game. If you like hunting people down and outsmarting them you will also like this game. If you cry whenever you play a game that requires the slightest bit of skill probably best you move on.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-26,0,0,62,False,Recommended,So you've decided to consider Dead By Daylight for your steam library?Well pull up a chair grab your hot chocolate and let me give you the beatdown Whether you enjoy murdering and butchering people around you or love being chased by that kinda mob of people. You've chosen the right game to play. Dead by Daylight provides a player with the capability of becoming one of many survivors in a map with 3 other players against a single killer ranging with various skills and tricks. The aim of the survivor is to fix generators and escape the cold grasps of the killers before they're snatched and sacrificed!It's easy to hop in and play but after playing with more experienced players climbing down the ladder it becomes more clear that players really grow some common sense and awareness and begin to counter your attacks and make less errors whilst fixing or looting.Each Survivor and Killer have their own special skills which after leveling enough with bloodpoints scored after each round those skills can be adapted to other classes to make the perfect Hunter or Runner.It's easy to become very attached to saying one more round to either finish off on a good one or perhaps acquire the skill you've been hunting since. The game has an active community and still the developers provide content worth the wait.It's a game that i fully recommend and after not playing it for a while i thought this game deserves a review and a darn positive one at that. It has let me pour timeless hours into murdering my friends or Outwitting random players. It has become a treasure of mine and has earned a place on my shelf.

The ranking system seems flawed as well not matching people with similar skill/experience/character level.

2018-05-21,0,0,664,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a fun competitive and intense game where you can play as either a Survivor and complete generators to escape the killer's grasp or as the Killer chasing down survivors and impeding their progress. Matches tend to last around 10 15 minutes and gameplay is vastly different between each 'trial' you play. Decent variety of characters to play as for each survivor and killer roles though physically every survivor is the same while killer's movement speed differs between each. Plenty of unique and shared perks for survivor and killer altering gameplay depending on the perks used. This game features alot of bugs but the dedicated developer squad releases patches and updates regularly enough. My advice to new players would have to be Dont get discouraged by your first 50 or so trials this game takes alot of skill building and practice in order to become a good player. Chances are you have no idea what your doing your first times playing and thats okay the more you play the better you'll understand. And also pay attention to your surroundings.

I am currently at 12 hours and my survivor rank is 7...now before you think I'm a bad player (which I assure you I am not) I'll tell you a little about what you're getting into buying this game...If you don't have any steam friends that have this game and you will more often then not being playing by yourself then this game is absolutly fantastic and you're going to have a lot of fun.If you have 1 or more buddies you will be playing this game with well...I hope you guys have a lot to talk about because it goes from being a survival horror game in which you try to outrun a killer to a campfire simulator.""Oh Storm what do you mean a campfire simulator?""Well sexy one let me tell you...while you are trying to ready up multiple times for a lobby for it to say searching for a game for about 3 8 minutes only to cancel out and have to reready up (god forbid one of your heathen friends goes for a drink or a pee pee time because then you have to wait longer for him to come ready up as well) all of the survivors are just standing around this campfire waiting for a lobby to get into so they can take a knife to the face and run around boo hoo'ing and leaving a blood trail all the way up to a closet you think you're safe in.You want to play a killer! Well all be dang gum you just broke the game you'll get into gameplay instantly and frequently. Me personally I like playing as a survivor as I have more fun that way but it's come down to me and my buddy just playing as survivors in different games now. He has to listen to me talk about my game and all the fun and good times I am having and vice versa. It's ruining our friendship our bonding time and who we are as men. We will never be the same after this! I left him on a hook one time because I was so used to playing with random people ya imagine having to deal with that in teamspeak he didn't talk to me for like 15 minutes!But for real when myself kurk and tyler was all playing trying to play as three...in 2 and a half hours we got into 2 games...not kidding or being over dramatic at all...literally 2 games in close to 3 hours. On the brightside we got to know each other very well kurk is a real life friend and tyler is a buddy I've been gaming with for almost 7 years now. I found out tonight he is 6'6"" (holy sh!!

2016-08-24,0,0,135,False,Recommended,I absolutely love this game. There are still many bugs that need to be fixed and patched up but overall for a $20 game it is amazing. The team that developed the game is still very active and are producing add ons for the game that are well worth the amoung of bugs that are slowly but surely being taken care of. Everytime I get online and play it reminds me of why I bought it to begin with. I hope to see some more things fixed as this team does more work with their game but as it stands now it is well worth the purchase.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-30,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This is a very challenging game and not for the faint hearted either. I first played it today as a survivor on quick play and my hand was forced to cast lots with a useless not teamworking group. Got killed by the hillbilly very quickly! I then ventured into the boots of the evil wraith and jumpscared many with my predator style invisibility tricks. The only downside was the weak damage of my sharpened bone club and the pallettes the survivors kept dropping on me. I eventualy got better and avoided those and went around the path to get survivors eventually somehow injuring one gravely survivor to sacrifice her without doing it myself. Got another runner on a meathook cloaked and then watched as some girl helped him off and they waltzed into the sunset. This game is intense has a great progression system and also is a game where you can improve your skill at it just by playing it. On a side note however this game has issues with GTX 970 cards (you probably know about the 500MB running slower) I get about 24 30 FPS in game but its smooth so I don't care. I did actually do what someone suggested and use DDU to uninstall the nvidia drivers and do a clean install but that did not work. If you have a GTX 970 don't worry make sure the game is set to high for a bit more FPS but you will get a smooth experience out of it. Unfortunately I won't get to be on my pc for a week so I can't progress further but I will not give up on this game. It is ground breaking in the gameplay department and also choc full of horror and horros movie vibes. If you play this you probably will get scared and feel the atmosphere and claustrophobic enviroment working against you. Know your strengths and work as a team.If any of you want to play this game with me just add me.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-27,0,0,255,False,Recommended,I'm not usually one for horror games (I get scared really easily) and this was actually the first horror game I bought (don't judge lol). Because this game allows me to play as the killer too I could try out both sides and that was kind of a key in helping me get over some of that fear. Plus. remembering that every character is really another person helps. So for people who are kinda nervous about horror games I recommend this way of trying out the genre.The maps do switch around a little and this increases replay value. Think of it as hide and seek with some twists xDPlaying as a survivor Because the killer is not an AI it is fun and challenging to find new ways to clear the game. It's also cool to try out new perks and see how they affect gameplay. The killers seem scary when they're in sight because of the constant is he gonna get me feeling. Not to mention the music that comes with them. For people who aren't used to horror games just remember that it's another player and enjoy the thrill!Playing as a killer Survivors have all sorts of tricks to avoid being detected and for the first time I'm frustrated with a first person camera view (compared to the survivors which have a 3rd person view it feels handicapped!) because a glance in the wrong direction even for a moment would mean that the survivors can slip right under your nose. I've ever had an experience of walking right beside a killer who didn't detect me because I wasn't in the range of his red triangle vision of doom. Upon catching the survivors the primary attack has a very satisfying effect if it hits.I won't spoil the game with lots of details but it really is worth the time. Plus a new map killer and survivor have just been released in the DLC (free) so that adds even more to explore!,Dead by Daylight

If you like the thrill of being chased or playing as this maniac with a cleaver / chainsaw or a maniac that has special abilities to go invisible / teleport than this game is right for you. After a few hours playing this game you may realise how to actually out play this maniac and your mentality and focus becomes how can I survive this game with the consideration of my teammates.

2017-01-11,0,0,540,False,Not Recommended,if being new to the game its best to play killer cause you're gonna have a bad time playing surviour untill you figure things out cause killers can 4k because the game is more so balanced around if you've had lots of hours in the game so more hour as surviours the harder it is for killers but less time as surviours it can be a easy 4k and about 60% of killers camp and tunnel surviours so it makes it not so fun if you're not great at running or looping killers if you have friend to play online with makes it better cause you guys can figure how things are in game and they have a wiggle mechanic that is 95% of the time useless cause odds are there is 1 or the 25 hooks on the maps next to where they downed you at. so if you youre new to the game id say only play killer for the first little bit cause surviour is just gonna stress you out unless you figure out how to run and loop killers and the comunity is really toxic whether youre killer or surviour everyone is toxic.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-31,0,0,1037,False,Recommended,Let me start by saying that I am a Survivor main. All of the recent negative reviews are just pure garbage let me tell you why... A few days ago a recent patch came out that nerfed some meta perks for survivor. This has the lower/mid tier survivors extremely butthurt. Do not let the recent negative reviews deter you from picking the game up and giving it a try. The killers had good quality of life changes to some of their perks as well as The Trapper and Hag buff were both pretty necessary in order to make them more viable in higher ranks. The balance of this game is in a better state than it has ever been in my opinion. Killers SHOULD feel powerful and survivors SHOULD have to work every second in order to make it out of the trial alive. At the end of the day the Devs are doing everything they can to bring more balance into the game and they are listening to their players thoughts and opinions. The game is easy to learn and hard to master and just like all things the more you play/practice the better you'll become. Now this is not me saying that you won't run into some toxicity but for the most part I love the game as well as the community.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-23,0,0,433,False,Recommended,"I have had this game pretty much since it came out and have seen the game grow exponentially in that time.First of all I want to deal with the fact that the majority of the bad reviews relate to the ""toxic community"". Yeah there are some horrible people out there and yeah some of them will call you names but my friends is the internet. To blame that on the game is unreasonable. Personally I am to old to be getting into arguments with 11 year olds beyond a ""gg"" or ""wp"" after a game I don't get drawn into post game chat.The biggest problem for me is the number of people who d/c from the game because they are not doing as well as they would have liked. It leaves everyone else at an unfair disadvantage and I notice it is often the same players doing it. Anyone who has played a board game like Monopoly with a younger sibling who upended the board because they were losing knows how frustrating that can be.That said I concede that the SWF (Survive With Friends) alters the game's balance considerably against the killer and does make being ""toxic"" that bit easier for those who wish to be so. But hey... again that's the internet for you.Anyhow the game. The game is great fun. People clock up hundreds and thousands of hours on it because it is a great game with a long term learning curve lots of different characters with different skills and different play styles too.The game runs well 99% of the time (rare glitches are often hilarious) the graphics look very smart and the sound is atmospheric and (although you eventually do get used to it) pretty terrifying.The level of updates has been generally very good with rebalances (and all the inevitable applause/anger that they can bring) and new content appearing regularly. The events such as Haloween Chinese New Year and Summer BBQ add another flavour to the game from time to time and Double Bloodpoints Events get everyone excited.The ranking system is not perfect but it does work by and large. A new player should in theory be matched with other lower rank players so you won't spend your first few games matched against a hardcore streamer who has matered the game over 18 hour streams for the last 2 years. The new tutorial is a nice addition too however I imagine most people will pick up the basic by watching YouTubers such as Hybrid Panda Noob3 Monto and whoever else.I do recommend this game to people but like any game if you're not prepared to lose don't play!

2016-09-20,0,0,8,False,Recommended,A good mix of competitive gameplay co operative gameplay and freaking jummpscares.Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric multiplayer game meaning the teams aren't split up equally. One player controls a horrible looking killer and on the other team 4 players control survivors. The goal is pretty obvious Killer has to kill Survivors have to escape.In order to escape the survivors have to start 5 generators to power up the exit. While doing so they have to try to avoid the killer.This isn't always easy as the killer has some special abilities like invisibility traps and teleports. Anyways you get the gist of it.The game is really fun addicting and surprisingly well polished for an early access title. New content is periodically being added for free. You can level up survivors and killers rank up to show you're the best and all that. Basically your typical competitive gameplay stuff.The game is definitely worth the prize. Every round is tense and I still get jumpy sometimes when the killer surprises me.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-24,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,"This is not a bad game. The concept is original and when the stars align fun. What irritates me is the whole character progression system un fun options being the best options and the infrequency of bug fixes.Personally I think this game would have been better without the ""growing characters"". Every survivor is the same starting out you have to spend hours upon hours in game to get anything that makes them unique. New players have no tools outside of fundamental gameplay that lets them contribute meaningfully.Killers on the other hand can either be a joke or a terror based entirely on how much time the player has invested.As far as I have been able to tell camping a survivor as the killer is your best strategy especially as the game's best killer Trapper. Survivors have no way of offensively threatening the Killer or communicating with random players so incoming help usually does little but change who's dying. Conversely the best strategy for a survivor is to leave the dying player alone due to the above. There is no being a hero unless your killer also wants to have fun.The dev team doesn't seem particularly interested in fixing the multitude of bugs plaguing DbD many of which have no reason to exist. One example springs to mind where a killer's facial model will clip into first person view interfering with vision based on which killer is dealing with it.

2016-07-15,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,This game is incredibly glitchy. I had to leave a match as a killer because a survivor manage to glitch into a meathook post and refused to quit the game. In another instance I played as a survivor and got stuck in a magic mime box at the bottom of a hill. Later the killer got stuck in that same box and we won the game with no deaths and no worries. The dev's really need to go through and fix issues with the game BEFORE they release it. So until they do what they should have done MONTHS AGO don't buy their product.Edit All if not most of the bugs that existed when this game was released has been patched and the developers are incredibly customer focused and frequently release patches and tweak the game. Recently they released a patch that fixed severe mathcmaking issues making the game hundreds of times more playable. They listened to the concerns of the public and addressed them. While I stand by my statement that these bugs should have been fixed before the release of the game they are fixed now. While it took time for the game to be user friendly and playable it now is. If you're interested go for it. Add to cart.Second Edit Wow. After the release of the HALLOWEEN dlc this game went from playable to frustrating in about ten seconds. The community has just become incredibly more hostile and the game mechanics are all shot to hell. I/ll be back IF it's fixed.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-31,0,0,623,False,Recommended,This is a game for those who like suspense and thrills. With the new Halloween chapter it's made it even more fun with Micheal's Evil Within Weapon. Especially when I'm just sitting there minding my own business then BAM! He's right there behind me. However with the recent updates it seems to have gotten harder for survivors to win. I'm not sure if it's just me but it seems as if the generators take longer to repair. Also there are the killers in the game who like to camp the hook making it nearly inpossible to help your teammate off the hook. On the other side it makes it so you have to coordinate with another player to distract the killer while you/someone else rescue the hooked player. Then there are the killers who watch you while you crawl around dying and waste your time. This makes it incredibly frustrating. If you manage to get into a gmae with friends this changes everything. The game becomes incredibly easier as the people you are playing with can be in a chat program such as discord with you and coordinating what to do and what's going on with the killer. Or you can kill your friends and have a good laugh. Overall the game is still a working progress and I think it needs to add some form of talk system for the survivors. The perks make it so the killer/player can be unstoppable (if they know what they're doing with them). I reccomend this game for those who like coordinating and like to get their adrenaline pumping.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-29,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Great game Great concept Great atmosphere very enjoyable. Obviously a game like this (asymetrical Horror) is going to have its issues with glitches bugs lag etc. as do all this game is no different. THis game though strives past its issues. It creates a sense of dread and excitement (if you are a survivor) and power and it feeling of imposing your will (as a Killer). All in all this game gives you exactly what you pay for and then some and with its updates and dlc's it comes as no surprise I would recommend this game to any horror fan!,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-29,0,0,174,False,Recommended,It's really fun game for both side.In Survivor side we could get fun from horor escape matching skill.They also have to get the teamplay. (Sometimes not)In Killer side you can relieve the stress also you can show your inner cruel.Of course it's little bit hard game to people who can play less than 10games but after you got a skill and the rules and many situation you will proud of you that you bought this game.(In my view point blance isn't that bad cuz is up to Killer or map)Most important thing is this game isn't need that much of your computer spec that much.Also this game is less than 5GB. lol (Not sure about GB. Might be less than that)정말 재미있는 게임입니다. 생존자에서 하시던 살인마 역활을 하시던간에 즐거움을 느낄수 있습니다.생존자측에서 플레이 하실경우에 팀플레이와 공포를 느끼시며 게임을 즐기실수 있으며때때로 팀원을 버리는 과감한 선택이 필요하기도 합니다.살인마를 플레이 하실경우 물론 공포감은 없지만 생존자들을 줄여나갈때의 쾌감과 승리를 만끽할수 있는 좋은 게임입니다. 비슷한 게임으로 이볼브가 있지만 이볼브처럼 큰 용량을 필요료 하지도 않으며 속칭 '조선컴'에서도 돌어갈만한 괜찮은 게임입니다.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-29,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,All the bugs in this game make it extremely frustrating. It would be tons of fun if everything worked but every patch introduces new issues. It's hard to get into a game to begin with and then you get laggy killers disconnecting teammates killers with auto aim broken mechanics. Right now there is a bug that results in getting no points after you finish the match. Bah.It's also not beginner friendly at all since there is a complete lack of match making. 4 rank 20 survivors against a rank 1 killer. You pretty much have no chance. Wish I hadn't bought it tbh. It's too much money for so little fun. I played it a couple of times but almost always left frustrated.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-21,0,0,315,False,Recommended,"Do not think this review is bashing the game because it is not i loved the game up until the recent updates this august. I do have 100+ hours played in the game &amp i am by no means a noob my highest rank on survivor writing this review is level 4 with 1 pip. Also do not go ahead thinking the only reason i got to this rank was infinite glitches because i have never used one nor do i know about them but i do watch people stream on twitch and hear a lot of talk in chat about them.This game was fun until the recent game update in august the killers are way too overpowered now. Perks that are overpowered &amp all killers use ""Spies from the shadows iron grasp deer stalker no one escapes from death"" are too overpowered and need a nerf or the killers perks need to start having a cooldown like survivors do. On top of it most of them carry the four perks i mentioned above which just makes them overpowered.Problems with killers They hit you with their weapon after you have already jumped through a window there weapon goes through the window and hits you puts you down on the ground after hitting you for the second time of course. The killer walks way to fast &amp catches up to you in very little time. This gives you no time to escape at all. The killers speed should be nerfed i am not saying all killers but certain classes should walk slower in this game which i will list in each killers review. Every killer in the game has auto aim which is terrible according to dead by daybreak ""it s a bug"". I would say 75% of the time when i hit a killer with the pallet i end up getting hit by them. Then they end up on the same side of the pallet as me as well. Their attack range also needs a nerf all too many times i get hit when i am so far away from the killer which is crap.Problems with killer s items The Trapper His traps are to overpowered now since you can no longer sabotage them unless you disarm them first &amp by the time you do that he already notices that you have disarmed the trap and heads towards your direction giving you no time to sabotage the trap meaning the only traps you will be able to get rid of are the ones he has not picked up and set on the ground. They need to reduce the speed that the trapper runs to give you more of a chance in the game or reduce the time it takes to disarm a trap &amp sabotage it. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers. The trapper should not be able to place traps underneth people on the hook it is to overpowered and does not give you team member enough time to disarm and take the person off the hook.Hill Billy His chainsaw lets him run halfway across the map or more it is also a one hit kill once he hit you you are instantly down on the ground waiting to be hooked. Because not only can he run really fast plus far with his chainsaw he can walk fast and catch up to you quick even if he misses. This would not be such a big issue if his walking speed was nerfed to something more reasonable.Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers.Nurse Her teleport is to accurate mixed with the auto aim attack for the killers she is way overpowered i would have to say she is the worst person to play against you do not want to play in a match against her at all let's just say your team is like an insta kill. She is broken &amp needs a nerf. They need to take the auto aim off and reduce the range of her attack also make her slower she walks to fast. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers.Wraith He is not really overpowered a pain to play against but he is most likely the easiest to play against this patch. He deserves the extra speed since he does not have any killer items like traps teleport or a chainsaw that lets you run super far at a fast pace. i do not have much to say about the wraith except for his attack range is pretty out there and might need some small tweaking. Also they need to take the auto aim off the killers. Problems with surviving in the game The only escape from the killer that you have in the game is hitting them directly with a pallet to stun them which is pretty close to impossible since this game is player to player based and the connection is always the killers so he has the advantage in every single game. Example ""lag is a survivor killer &amp the killer never has that problem"". The flash light is useless if anything in the game deserves an auto aim this because it never works when you shine it in their eyes to begin with they just walk right up to you and hit you. Besides the pallets being risky and the flash light being useless this game needs to come up with more ways to get away from the killer.About Survivor perks I do not find the survivor perks to be overpowered although there is a lot of discussion about them not being teachable to other classes because people would rather them be unique to each class.Bugs in the game for survivor When a survivor on your team is on the floor bleeding out in the game there highlighted body will disappear &amp you will no longer be able to see where they are which is annoying when you are trying to help your team member this bug will also happen when your team member is on the hook. i am not sure if this is a bug but its annoying when you think your team member is hit once only to find out he is thrown on top of a killers shoulder being carried to a hook. Killers still glitches through pallets and hitting you. Dead by daylight needs to fix healing when you are bleeding out on the floor if your whole team is on the floor and the killer is leaving you there to heal up all the way you should be able to heal up the rest of the way so you can contunie playing the game it is pointless to heal up all the way if no one is left to help you. To many times have i laid on the ground as the last person to bleed out and die with no help no way to get up this needs to be fixed. I think this wraps up my review on Dead by Daylight. if you can put up with all the bugs &amp glitches and the unbalanced gameplay Dead By Daylight is still a good game but it needs a lot of work before it is completely finished. I hope this helps before you decide to purchase the game.",Dead by Daylight

I find it hard to play cuz this computer I have...well it cant really support games as this unless its on really really low graphics. I so find it a fu game...I just wish I could play it properly without lagging. DX I dont reccomend this game if you have a computer but if your computer can handle this game then I completely recommend you try it and have a blast! (NOTE I am a little chcken when I play as a survivor cuz all I did was squeal and run away. DON'T JUDGE ME! DX),Dead by Daylight
2016-08-29,0,0,206,False,Recommended,"First off...The game has its quirks and clearly not perfect. Although addicting it seems to be attracting more negative feedback rather than positive. I for one approve of this game and would recommed or buy it for a friend. The Killer?I'm not a good killer and I've ran into a few games (where not all games are like this mind you) where survivors boast 'surviving' when they successfully escape. I know the point of the game is to kill all the survivors but I also enjoy the entertainment and thrill the game brings. Reaching 10k for a pip is a win to me regardless if all 4 survivors escape. I'm also not one to ""patrol"" or ""camp"" unless it's blatantly obvious that survivors are around me (i.e. seeing scratch marks or just finding one behind a tree). I enjoy the rush of preventing the generators being popped and if I see someone using infinites I just move on to the next guy or ultimately let them escape. No point in boosting someones ego for using a spot a killer can't counter (unless you're the trapper).The survivor?I'm a rank one survivor and although I've put in 200+ hours into this game I have to say that the thrill of hiding from killers is amazing especially if they don't see you in plain sight. I admit that camping killers are a massive downside to this game however I also firmly believe that the developers are working to counter any patrol or camping that is done to prevent altruism. I hate infinites although necessary to avoid getting captured by the killer I also understand why they're put into the game (i.e. random map spawns with blimp window blocked but now tractor has pile of hay which could ultimately be used as an infinite (although I have seen killers counter this fairly easily)). ...surviving?It boils down to how well you know to keep yourself hidden from a first person camera. The killer has a lot of advantages when it comes to spotting a survivor such as scratch marks or even breathing. However the survivor has great advantages as well to counter that such as premonition spine chill and iron will which are amazing indicators and techniques to quiet your character. Is this fair to a Level 50 killer who somehow stays Rank 20 and plays with new Rank 20 survivors? Of course not because the killer would have unfair advantages and perks at his grasp but it is also likewise. I know survive with friends is an amazing feature but does bring some disadvantages but again boils down to how good you are at finding a survivor or hiding from a killer (I would know as I have had rank 20 killers fresh with no perks take me down).Tl drI approve of the game and what the developers are accomplishing. It seems equally balanced unless you get players who play 24x7 and know how to operate a killer such as the Nurse. Other tid bits...The matchmaking seems fixed to an extent. I have had to press 'Ready' several times just to be returned to the lobby which is really annoying 08/29/2016 . I've seen more than 4 survivors join an already started game a lot more recently now than I have in the past. The anti cheat system needs to develop and learn quicker (my personal rant). And finally the lag problem needs to be fixed. There's too many Koreans playing on U.S. download regions (or that's what it feels like). I do agree that they need to get a beefy server and host it that way (my opinion have survivors join and would wait for a killer or vice versa so the matchmaking process isn't so borked).",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-29,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,I can't stop playing this game but in no right can I recommend it to other players. This is by far one of the buggiest games I've ever touched. Maybe if the Developers focused more on fixing their mathcmaking and other bugs in the game instead of creating new content it would be a different story. Constantly I pull pallets down on killers to have them appear on the other side. Trying to dodge through a window you better be 50 feet on the other side or else they can still hit you. Last but definitely not least. How are we still playing on a host system? With the amount of sales this game has had they should have dedicated servers. Instead your entire game experience is dependent on whether the killer has a good network connection.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-16,0,0,484,False,Not Recommended,Horror in games (and films) is too often characterised by jump scares shocking startling events designed to trigger a fight or flight response. Dead by Daylight to its credit eschews these in favour of real horror a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakeable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it.Dead by Daylight features two teams four survivors and one killer and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve rattling sweat inducing terrifying experience.After queuing into a game with three other survivors Dead by Daylight puts you in one of several eerie horror environments a dilapidated farm a run down manor a rickety junkyard and tells you very simply to fix the generators to escape. When you find the generators you then need to repair them a painstakingly slow process where you hold the left mouse button down while crouching in front of it. If you're alone repairing the generator can take more than a minute. As you crouch next to the very noisy generator the game will throw skill tests at you by way of a rotating bar if you fail the QTE the generator will backfire. This creates a noisy explosion and the killer is visually alerted to the location of the backfire turning you into a target.If the killer does find you (and he probably will) your options are limited. If you have a flashlight you can blind him temporarily but your best bet is to run away. The killer moves faster than you can run maintaining the traditional horror movie 'ominous walk' but you can slow him down by leaping through windows or pushing down pallets to block his path. You want to put as many of these obstacles in between the two of you as possible as you flee for your life.Fortunately for the survivors a sixth sense mechanic alerts them to the presence of a nearby killer the closer the killer is the faster your survivor's heart beats. Unfortunately the sound is obscured by generator revving as you repair it. When 90% repaired the generator nearly drowns out the heartbeat entirely forcing you to rely solely on your eyes to see the killer.When you play as the killer you're able to see all the map's generators at all times allowing you to patrol them. If any of them are making noise you know at least one survivor has been working on it and you can hunt for signs that the others are nearby. Panicked survivors will sprint away leaving scratches on nearby walls and breaks in the grass and you can follow these markings to find your prey. Once you find your prey you chop them down pick them up and put them on a hook sacrificing them to your god after 60 seconds.The scoring system initially encourages players to create exciting gameplay opportunities by rewarding risky play. Survivors who engage in lengthy drawn out chases escaping the killer will earn more points for their boldness and you can rack up the points by rescuing other survivors who have been captured but not yet sacrificed. As a killer you're rewarded for killing more of the survivors although a single sacrifice is counted as a victory. Inevitably though this scoring system leads to immersion breaking actions like exploiting the killer's slow movement past obstacles as survivors earn huge points by taunting their hunter. Another problem for Dead by Daylight is its matchmaking system. The game is entirely peer to peer hosted with the killer hosting the survivors at all times. Unfortunately there's no way to tell where in the world the killer is or whether they're capable of hosting five people in a game until you're playing. There's no ping indicator and no regional matchmaking so you have to roll the dice each time you join a new server and if you crap out you'll warp around the game world barely able to work out what's going on. Further there's no group based matchmaking so you can't queue with friends. This results in players lobby hopping until they are grouped with friends which is a terrible experience for all involved.Dead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well but only to a point. As players become more familiar with both roles the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The poor matchmaking and the highly exploitable scoring system make Dead by Daylight less competitive than it should be resulting in gameplay which doesn't resemble the horror experience it sets out to be.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-26,0,0,403,False,Recommended,I want to weight in on the recent changes. I bought this game at the end of October 2017 and quickly put almost 300 hours from that point until February 12th where I decided that the game was to broken unbalanced and horribly in favor of a bunch of toxic survivors. I decided I would wait 6 months to see where the game itself was at and judge it. I came back after the recent patch and it's been wonderful I have more fun playing survivor I can play my killer the Trapper again without having ruining my day from 1 game. It's perfect. The game has a lot less bugs now they implemented a proper crash report system and things are really moving a positive direction for the entire experience. Dead By Daylight is finally leaving a state of junk towards something greater and part of this path is nerfing the survivors BMing tools in the game. The result of these negative reviews are 100% survivors complaining that they are no longer able to spend an entire game taunting and bullying the killer they are upset that the game requires them to actually play optimally. The review bombing is being used as a threat to the devs if they don't get what they want not to actually inform buyers of what the game is like. Right now the game is just okay it's improving the devs seem to be managing this game a lot better after they split from their publisher earlier this year and they have a lot of healthy changes planned in the future in regards to reworking the maps some killers and changing around a lot of perks. Their are a couple things survivors have a geniune reason to be upset about currently only 1 of them is gamebreaking. A perk is currently broken that sometimes removes a killers terror radius (a way to track them through sound) this is already been fixed and being pushed to the next hotfix that should come out within a week. The other complaints are in regards to pallets and the hitbox on a killer called the Huntress and her thrown hatchets. Pallets for the longest time worked differently they made another healthier changed that made it so survivors don't get sucked through the pallets when they push it down avoiding a hit from a killer that should have landed. This resulted in a lot of weirdness with timing it still feels slightly off but it's not a huge issue and pallet stuns still consistently work. The hatchet hitboxes are just slightly larger than they should be they aren't that small and precise as the ingame model suggests. This means dodging them is a bit more difficult if you go purely by visuals it isn't gamebreaking just keep it in mind. Take the negatives regarding killers being overpowered with a grain of salt if you're hesistant to purchase the game you rightfully should be look into what they have planned for the future updates and poke around a bit the game is a lot of fun currently and it's only going to get better.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-07,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Asymmetrical multiplayer games are becoming much more popular lately and this is probaly my favorite. Whether playing as killer or survivor the game doesn't feel one sided. While the survivors have the advantage early due to numbers as the match goes on surviving becomes much more difficult as you become a target. The only problems I found with the game are perks and skill based match making. Perks are either obtained by leveling your charecter or drops starting the game with none a new player is possibly at a disadvantage based on luck though I feel perks don't usually determine a match. As with skill based match making there is none. A new player can be easily intimidated by a level 20 hunter as players are thrown in a first come first served basis. Other than that the game feels very balanced and makes a great time either playing with randoms or friends.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-19,0,0,326,False,Not Recommended,this game is trash they put you against people that are rank 2 when you are 11 as a killer its bullcrap they need to balance this game no one even friend should be able to team up if they aren't close to the same rank it is unfair to the killer that is just trying to learn the game and get better if he/she isn't ready to face rank 2 he/she shouldn't have to put something in the game to stop this from happening. it is a fun game if you are going against your rank but when it comes down to the infinite spots on the map and the rank system i can not recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a balanced game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-28,0,0,197,False,Recommended,Firstly i would like to state that i think the game is priced correctly it does exactly what a game like this should do it should be engaging intense and addictive.There are a few things that could be balanced out in the game eg a nerf for the Wraith to make him less apealing to play etc. And there is something that i personally don't like about the ranking system. One you can be put in a lobby with such a varity of player levels. Secondly the pip system is a bit harsh i mean one bad game and you have basically de ranked.But as a noob coming into the game the tutorials where very helpfull and kind of preped you for online gameplay but becuse of the varied leveld players can be frustrating losing over and over agian.Overall a soild game can wait for more updates keep em coming devs.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,38,False,Recommended,They should implement voice communication for the survivors and have proximity chat for the killer. This way when you are the killer you can scare the out of people.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,179,False,Recommended,"It can be very fun I enjoy having the killer run right past me as I hide in the grass. Or actually surviving (Which sadly doesn't happen that much). Joining a match can sometimes take awhile but recently its gotten a lot better. I love that the survivors are in third person and the killer is in first person. It helps survivors a lot but when I'm the killer I tend to get a headache after three or four rounds because I'm squinting since it's very blurry. I can still see the hiding survivors though and that's the point. Not to make it too easy to see them.I extremely dislike being the last survivor because the killer ends up toying with you. Then I'm forced to leave and I don't get all those points I tried getting. Or if you get caught and get hung on a hook you kinda shrug and give up because the killer will camp you. So why bother trying to survive? We all know the killer camps because if they can get at least one kill they win even if a few survivors still escape.Now when I win instead of ""Yay I finally did it!"" I feel ""Finally. After ten losses we won.""",Dead by Daylight
2016-06-28,0,0,212,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is an assymetrical Survival/Horror game Where 4 survivors face off against the killer who will try to down them with two hits (one with hillbilly's chainsaw) then sacrifice them on a meat hook to The Entity.The Survivors are by far more agile than the killer but in a straight grund race they will lose So survivors must throw down barriers and hop windows to escape the killer. the Survivors must also power 5/7 generators throughout the map Team work is almost always essential to your survival so be a team palyer. After 5/7 generators are powered the survivors must power any number of two doors to escape or if you're the last survivor you may escape through a secret hatch hidden somewhere in the level after at least 2/7 generators are powered.The killer is faster as previously stated and they have map contol abilities such as traps and speed boosts but they must stay on their toes as their view is limited by first person while the survivors have the added power of third person view.Pros Great Gameplay Scary at times Makes your heart race all the time Easy To learn Hard To master Fun to Play Decent price made better by summer sale and even more so if you own PayDay 2 Gorgeous Graphics Can have some really intense moments Hard but not punishing Level up system is fun and makes you Think about your choicesCons Has some game breaking glitches(falling out of map etc..) No Party system for quick play Trying to get yourself a hook is usually in vain and will just waste your time no voice chat for survivors Window Looping Alt+f4 Glitch(losses don't count against you) Killers have to host (crap killer internet Crappy round) No Cd on wraiths bell Hatches are to easy to findOther than that i enjoy this game alot and highly recommend it to any one who enjoys survival horror games.Overall i give Dead By Daylight (DbD) an 8.5/10 score in my opinion.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-24,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,"First off let me say that I never review games. But this game... hot damn I'm throwing in my 'thumbs down' for this one!Started off buying this game during the recent sale. I thought ""Wtf why not? For $16 this game looks hella fun!"" At first it was... I could live with the glaring bugs (my killer got stuck in a plank once and couldn't move... AT ALL... imagine how fun that was!) the occasional &amp incredibly one sided matchmaking and the gery of the general populace that plays games like these. Surprisingly despite all of those things the game was still actually a blast to play!But then two days later a patch hits. And it literally changes everything.Let's get something straight the game was enjoyable but it's like... meeting someone with a seductive voice wearing a paper bag over their face. Eventually the mystery bores you and you rip off the bag only to let out an ear piercing shriek that would make even Jamie Lee Curtis proud.If you buy this game here is what you can expect You will start off totally new at Rank 20 and every character at Level 1 (derp). You will waste hours upon hours in a Korean like MMO MF'ing grind fest to get perks (all of your perks are RANDOMIZED!!! You can go MANY levels and get nothing but tastic perks over and over again)! You WILL DEFINITELY be paired up against Rank 1 10 players whose characters are Level 60+ with 4 Very Rare Perks that will either gut and skin you like a one eyed GDMF'ing doe or they will run 3x faster than GDMF'ing Usain Bolt YOU WILL NEVER CATCH THEM. There are glaring balance issues on both sides of the coin but none of that matters when you're facing people who have sunk 300+ hours into this game and have abilities that will DESTROY you. Failing all this BS if you want to play a Killer the ONLY way you'll level up is by being a lame camper. This will lead to a few things 1) You being bored out of your GDMF'ing mind 2) People will whine and worse than fat pigs strung up by their puny corkscrew tails in post game chat about how you have no skill insulting your mother your heritage and just about everything else you can imagine (AKA entire community must play this game when they're not busy playing League of Legends or DOTA) 3) You will get jack for Bloodpoints (EXP) and it will take you hundreds of hours to level up before you can try ANY other kind of strategy. This game is obviously skewed towards players who want to sink 600+ hours into a game. Unless you're that ing dedicated towards a $20 game don't bother.Did I mention that EACH character/killer has their own level? Want to try someone new? Cool! You get to start that whole damn cycle all over again and suck for another hundred hours!!! BUUUUUGS! You find out quickly that the developers cannot seem to even remotely catch the majestical &amp mythical unicorn named 'Princess Balance.' Everything is skewed to high hell. After the excitement of buying a new game wears off you'll realize very quickly that this game is actually an Early Steam Release game disguised as a Full Release game and the quality is nowhere near what you expect from a fully developed/play tested game.Now is this game fun? It can be. But 70 80% of the time it really isn't whatsoever. Because of glaring bugs heavy back handed game changes and mind blowing matchmaking issues (the likes of which I have NEVER seen in ANY other game that even claims to have one) it's just not even worth the investment IMO.But hey why not just waste $20 and decide for yourself? Then you too can leave a review for this bug ridden game that has no semblance of actual matchmaking!Hey... I'm only pointing out that now you can't say that your wingman didn't warn you 3x over about taking the well endowed girl with a paper bag over her face home.Honestly... what did you really expect was under that bag anyway?(edit 8/24/16 NO matchmaking is NOT fixed.

2017-03-15,0,0,44,False,Recommended,To the uninitiated this is a multiplayer only horror/slasher game where 4 survivors are put up to the task to evade a single killer while trying to repair 5 generators so they can escape. If you're a horror junkie like me then this game is simply a must buy. It may not be the scariest game on the market but it is filled with tense moments that will without a doubt have you right on the edge of your seat. Whether you're working on a generator when you hear the killer right behind you or you're hiding in a closet and you see him walk by hoping your helpless whimpers don't give you away. Even playing the killer the game is packed with moments that get your heart pumping. There is nothing quite as satisfying as nabbing the last survivor as he tries to make a break for the exit or being that survivor and actually making it out. For the price this game is a STEAL! I put 17 hours in it so far and do not see myself stopping any time soon. The suspence satisfaction and perk and item progression will without a doubt leave you hooked for hours on end.With all the praise I give this game it isn't without it's flaws however. I've never had problems in the lobby I get into games in seconds most of the time but some people seem to be having problems with it from time to time taking too long to find a game. Most of it's balancing issues talked about in other reviews have been fixed from what I can see sure some perks are a little strong but you can develop strats around them and really it only makes you a better player. So that leaves us with the most glaring issue. The community. The Dead by Daylight community is a mixed bag I've played with people who have become my friends but I have also played with people who try their damnest to suck the fun out of the game. Be it by exploiting and infinite window loop as a survivor camping either the hooks or the trap door as a killer. Or disconnecting be it the killer ending the game causing people to lose their rank or a fellow survivor quitting creating a pretty big disadvantage. In order for anyone to have fun in the game the survivors have to work together otherwise it can get pretty aggravating at times for both killers and survivors. But do not let this deter you from getting the game it is still a blast to play and is getting better with every update.If you want to enjoy this game to it's max potential I'd suggest playing with headphones so you can hear cues telling you where people/the killer are. In a dimly lit or dark room and in a lobby with 4 of your friends. But it's definitely possible to have a really great time in a light room with speakers and playing with strangers which is how I normally play.I give this game an 8/10! A must buy for horror fans especially with the 20 dollar price tag.,Dead by Daylight

But it is one that has routinely gotten better as time has gone on and one that I always come back to.The developers have made some notable errors *cough* Freddy nerf *cough* but do seem to eventually figure out what to do if this most recent patch is any proof.Great game to play with friends great game for sacrificing Dwights to the entity.8/10,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-18,0,0,679,False,Recommended,* NEW EDIT FINALLY the game is taking the right direction. Survivors are not massively overpowerd anymore and the devs take a close look at the mechanics and killers to buff and rework them to finally give you another choice than nurse in high ranks. If they keep going in this direction I can fully recommend this game since it's a lot of fun (despite some idiots with massive egos in the community). *OLD REVIEW I wrote a positive review beforehands but at the moment I can't recommend the game anymore. There isn't any fun in high ranks anymore if you play killer. You feel more like a class clown than a scray killer slaughtering people. As well as the survivors being kind of in favor (perks buffs.) there are still some bugs around which still aren't fixed. I hope DBD will be better soon and the devs take a look at some core mechanics of the game.Edit It got better but is still very unbalanced in high ranks. It's really easy as a survivor at the moment and it's not even close to scary anymore which is really unfun as a survivors as well as a killer. The DLCs are good and the way the devs fix things got better but the problems still remain.Edit #2 The devs fixed some stuff and tried to balance things. DBD kinda turned into a scooby doo chasing game than a scary game. You won't be as rewarded for playing with stealth and brain but for running around like a headless chicken. Some perks and even killers are designed around the time wasting chase mechanics which is really sad. You're considered a good survivor if you waste a lot of the killers time by running around obstacles. It's still fun but the direction it went is not mine tbh and has nothing to do with a scary horror game anymore.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-29,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,And yet again the DBD devs show that they don't have a clue what balance is and that they want the game to be as killer sided as possible since most of the player base are killer mains.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-24,0,0,859,False,Not Recommended,Edit As of patch 2.1 they've introduced a whole host of game breaking issues along with radical balance changes that make this game very dangerous to new players. Good luck if you decide to buy...Pros Great game to play with your friends. Competitive af. Solid progression system. Game is still receiving significant updates and DLC.Cons Balance is really bad on both sides devs remain clueless about the majority of balance issues and instead fiddle constantly with things that aren't broken. As a survivor it's not uncommon to get camped by the killer which basically ruins the match for you. As a killer it's quite common to get pallet looped which is utterly frustrating. Disconnects mid game happen too often as the game can very often be far more frustrating than rewarding. There are a number of people who play solely to troll the killer and waste their time. Most killers don't have good counters to trolling techniques in this game. Overly frustrating matches are guaranteed on both sides. Community can be quite toxic.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-19,0,0,2232,False,Recommended,"I played this game a lot both as survivor and killer and I plan to keep playing it. Why? The artstyle is very unique and personal the sountrack is literally perfect the core gameplay is solid and has many layers and more depth than what it might seem the fight between survivors and killers is not only physical but even psicological and mindgames are a key to success. There is a deep layer of customization not only aesthetic but in gamestyles. You can play as a sneaky Myers jumpscaring survivors emerging from behind corners or as an oppressive mad Doctor that envelops the map in his madness you can play as a ""medic"" survivor always there to help others or as a sneaky one never seen by the killer and growing stronger as the others die. The high amount of perks contribute to the diversity in gamestyles allowing for a huge variety of builds.Most of the content (all the perks and 80% of the skins) is obtainable without spending additional money aside unluckily from licensed characters (because of licensing problems). Currently it is quite a bit grindy but I think in the future the grind will be eased.For a long time the game suffered from imbalances with survivors widely considered paradoxically the strongest role and some bad mechanics (I'm looking at you pallet vacuum) but since Behaviour bought the license from their publisher Starbreeze and are now independent the game is getting better and better at a good steady pace. Customization increased a lot with the introduction of the store and the constant addition of skins and the guaranteed big patches every 6 weeks bring amazing content and changes not counting the way more frequent PTBs (Public Test Build) where we're given the chance to try in advance new changes and give feedback about them.The devs seem more likely than ever to listen to players feedback and are more clear and transparent in their communication and I hope they won't stop because of the review bombing that's happening lately. Because that's what's happening this days. The last patch (2.1.0) brought a lot of good changes and is part of the process to make killers the power role as they are supposed to be but whiny survivors mains (because only someone that plays exclusively as survivor can't see how amazing the new changes are) can't adapt at all and rather review bomb in an attempt to spoil the game as they did to make devs nerf Freddy Krueger right after release and to stop them from delivering needed changes. But that was the Starbreeze era and hopefully that behaviour won't bring nothing to them now.In conclusion the game is amazing under many aspects but more importantly it's still growing and getting better. The community is quite rough (in some cases plain toxic) but if you want a thrilling experience and can accept loosing as part of the game (and ignore or laugh about salty players when they loose and try to flame you because unfortunately this happens) this might be the game for you and hopefully we'll meet in the fog.",Dead by Daylight

2017-02-06,0,0,975,False,Recommended,So how can I start? I love this game so much it's so fun especially with friends however if you ever decide to buy this game think about what you're getting yourself into this game is a roller coaster and a half.Pros This game is absolutely to die for this game will take over your Horror gaming for sure there's so many things to come from this game it is so fun playing alone playing with friends playing for yourself or playing as a team to escape or die you can choose every game you get yourself into you don't know what map it is who you're playing against every game you can be safe working around the killer fixing generators and escaping others you can just hide for a lot of the time and others you will have to run for your life all game as the killer can choose to either go for you only or spread the killing field you can choose from many characters perks add on things and offerings as a killer or a survivor you can change the game style by using specific offerings as it can change from how many things are in the level to how much mist is in the level to changing the map completely The game concept of a 4v1 Horror game is a very interesting for future online Horror games as this is a factor the execution is fabulous for a Horror game however it is very complicated to pull off with the balancing of the game play.Cons This game is a mixture of good and bad things this game runs flawlessly very fluid and very visualized and sound coded however many issues break these as there are a lot of lag spikes fps drops and glitched visuals until you get close to objects that have been glitched many of these can be fixed however can come back for a few examples cabinets will be black until you get closer and sometimes if you get picked up by the killer your character sometimes gets put on his shoulder other times the character will fly around the map/ screen.Negs This game has many many many bugs and loading times are ridiculous loading screens take for ever to load to not even load game can crash for no reason whatsoever the devs announced that they were going to fix the bugs when the game released they have not as each update comes along the bugs keep coming and ruining the game experience in which the game is practically rendered useless I don't know what else to say but this game is a range of thoughts and opinions I won't be able to choose which I want to pick if I do want to recommend this product or not you can decide what you want to choose for this game but my recommendation is going to be recommended but in fact I can't choose.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-07,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,"I'd recommend this game for friends to play together but not so much for playing with random players. Love the game very addictive and fun to play only when you get a fair killer and fair survivers. Best for actual friends to play with/against is the better choice as to not get harassed by rude players looking for reasons to bad mouth someone for whatever reason they can think of.The infinate loading screen is a real problem though mainly happens for me when trying to join as survivor so I don't get much of a chance to play that role. You will come across people/killers who will camp survivors who continuously jump over baracades windows run around obsticles non stop. Being able to take down the hooks should be limited to a few and not all that aren't in the basement because players will continuously run to the far end of the map and create an endless game of back and forth until someone decides to disconnect or the killer gives up their rightful win. Some will camp the hook when they catch players taking down hooks and I was harrased by another player for that reason alone for their past experiences and accused me of playing unfair/cheating even though I had barely played as a survivor because of previously explained loading issues. Players lose tempers when singled out as survivor for any given reasons. Going for a player knowing they can be killed is not unfair survival of the fittest the weak are reasonable to go after. When on the virge of escape going after a player again because you know you can kill them instead of the others is not unfair either.Will come across players who will accuse you of camping if you don't go to the other side of the map when hooking a survivor. Checking the immediate area for players is exceptable. Some players will disconnect when caught and ruin the games point of playing as a killer and survivors but there are points given to the killer because of quitters.Being harrassed by players/survivors for playing as you are supposed to as a killer and ""camping"" in their unfair perspective of not leaving the area even though you know players around and attemping a save kills any enjoyment of the game. Being harrassed by the player/killer for playing as a survivor fighting to survive is absolutely ridiculous and also kills any enjoyment of the game.There are a number of types of people named that will ruin the game for others and probably a number more that weren't named also.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-03,0,0,171,False,Recommended,You wake up in a dark and scary place knowing that you are have one job. Survive. Wondering what killer it is you attempt to start up a generator in hope of escaping only to cause a small explosion. From here you are given a choice to either run or cotinue working on the same generator you just blew up. Either choice dooms you if not executed properly. You decide to stay and work on the generator and eventually complete it further dooming yourself. You run and hide making sure that you weren't spotted and start work on the next gen. A chill goes down your spine as you attempt to balance your concentration on looking out for the killer and hitting skill checks. They appear and you run as fast as your legs can carry you. Miraculously the killer loses you and your only choice is to continue what you started. The game in general is not as scary as one takes it to be but if you become too immersed it becomes so. It is more intense rather than scary but it all depends on the perks and addons that the killer brings. Scenarios are based on skill but luck is a great part of the game as well.

2016-08-21,0,0,183,False,Recommended,It's Really Fun. My First Game as a Survivor i managed to survive Long enough for survivors and Monster to disconnect or ragequit. What happened was We unfortunetly let one of our people die and the 4th person disconnect at the start of the game putting us as a disadvantage. This mode was honestly horrifying to me yet thrilling at the same time. I decided to give the Killers a Go and i definetly Learned alot from the High Lvl Survivors. Even though Monsters can pick survivors up another survivor if brave enough can flash the light to temporary stun the Monster. Since the Monster is 1st person viewpoint he won't get to really see where they went except to corner of his/her eye perhaps and following the scratch marks survivors make from running. Also Even If the Monster Hangs one of the survivors the more bold and veteran players WILL risk their lives to save their comrades. I had the weird experience of having one taken off and i swing at the savior and hang him instead while the one that escaped got away. Another time i managed to attack the savior b4 he/she got to get the one I hanged off. At this point there was 1 survivor left and she was a high lvl that had some sprint perk and managed to escape. normally when you have 1 person hanging and about to hang the other one there is a chance the other survivors will save that hanged person. Even though i sometimes lose to high lvl players I at least sacrifice 1 person which earns me blood points. I also learn from these other survivors how to be Very good cooperative survivors. I wish i could say the Wraith is OP because of the ability to cloak but that bell ringing when he needs to phase in and out of invisibility just to hit a survivor is a dead give away and they end up running when they hear it. This is gonna be a fun year for me. 10/10 7/9/18In my most recent match as the killer the survivors happened to be a 4 man survive with friends. maybe even a 3 man. I knew this because during the game the 3 players were messing around with me and were hiding poorly. They thought I was some casual killer (I actually am too perhaps even a baby killer) But I've watched enough videos and use my ears to hear my surroundings too. They were too altriustic so they kept saving each other and were always close by. Once one of them did the tea bag while I was breaking the pallet out of being over confident I started to tunnel. Managed to sacrifice all 3 of them and then I Freeze. so I take this moment to take a break and come back to find it was a Crash. I know Dead by Daylight doesn't do this it was more likely the player might have ddos or intentionally crashed the game so I wouldn't get anything out of it and because they were salty. I log back in to try to find their profiles via Shift+Tab and find their names don't show up as if they didn't exist. It might be time to bring in some A.I. Killers and A.I. Survivors because apparently people get salty when they lose to other players and go so far as to greif/hack and sabotage gameplay for killers and probably survivors alike. I like this game alot too but then I find I lost my offering which wasn't a big loss but it was still an item I earned with my time and effort and apparently that match still counted enough for me to lose it while the crybabies got a free pass to keep being toxic. PRETTYGOODJOBSOFAR! 7/25/18RecommendedI was mad before but with patience and just playing the game as it is I realized I just gotta enjoy it whenever I can and brush off the negatives. but all in all this is still a fun game to play. Just gotta be a sportsman and take defeat like a real player and also figure out ways to beat the killer when he camps or just try to escape. in killer perspective if they gen rush to 3 or less quickly they figure it's time to camp and start killing people ASAP. depends really though. most of us just play killer ofr the rituals yet continue to play as survivors or we're killers and play survivors casually.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-08,0,0,1084,False,Recommended,Product received for free. If you don't know what dead by daylight is it is an asymmetrical horror game where four survivors have to repair five generators and open a door to escape. All the while evading a killer which tries to kill all four survivors before they can escape. Seems thrilling doesn't it? Well you're only half right.This game has it's own perk system in addition to an item addon and offering system to spice up the gameplay. But instead of being supplements to the gameplay some are complete crutches that take no skill to use leading to feeling cheated out of a kill not because the survivor good at surviving but because he just equipped something pre game. Granted there are killer crutch perks but one can be countered before it is able to be used and only is able to be used when the exit gates are open and one is only usable when an exit gate is open and you hook a survivor. Not to mention that 90% of games survivors will only use the same few crutch perks as the perk balance is completely skewed. Some of their bonuses as both killer and survivor are completely negligible or are very situational. However recently the developers have been tackling these imbalances and are going to be reworking one of them I believe in the next patch.Let me touch on the characters. The survivors have no special ability or anything that makes them unique from eachother other than teachable perks and skins. On the killer side the killers do have special abilities that change their playstyle yet only a few killers are viable at high ranks. The huntress nurse hillbilly hag and maybe the doctor.Let me discuss the maps for a little bit every map is practically the same but with a different layout except for a few landmarks (though haddonfield and lerys will feel completely different than the other maps) and the shape of the map. Just to clarify there is no side objectives or different main objectives at any point in time. Leading to a very repetitive experience of repairing five generators a game. Granted I had no issues with boredom playing for 900 hours but I don't think everyone will feel the same.Other than these gripes I really enjoy the game. If you can get past these issues you will get an enjoyable experience worth many hours (or even days) of fun.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-03,0,0,661,False,Recommended,Edit 7/25/18So over the last few months we have seen a massive increase in balance work from the devs &amp while the community is still toxic at times their ability to troll was reduced significantly in the last few patches. The devs are trying to strike a balance for sure at this point &amp its noticeable even if its slowly &amp gradually. Playing with friends this is still a great game so I can say that the changes have made me start playing this regularly again. Edit 5/22/18Playerbase is getting worse I'll come back to play for a bit then quit again as they get more toxic over &amp over. No matter how many times I try to give this game a chance the devs dont seem to want to fix the bugs glitches &amp imbalances that ruin the expierence. After playing a very frustrating match to try &amp get a Kill a Survivor as Huntress daily today having 2 people quit only having one mori to do so with on her &amp then finally getting it.......only for this piece of trash game to just crash on me due to some half server error because the Devs wont make dedicated servers for the game (yet they make us put our saves there no because they couldnt fix the damned loss of progress glitch)......I'm just done for a long time with this game. I want to love it but its just nothing but frustration game after game. Edit 11/8/17While I did enjoy this game theres a large amount of problems that dont seem to be addressed by the game developers. All 4 survivors running 3 perks like decisive strike(skill check to escape killers grasp) borrowed time(get hit but have a timer to keep running instead of falling to ground) &amp self heal make games repeatitive &amp not enjoyable as killer. Also pallet looping(running in circles around pallets which can be used to stun the killer &amp moving onto the next pallet) hasnt been addressed &amp with some killers is impossible to counter(myers freddy). Survivors are also constantly getting new perks &amp while there is some new stuff for killers(faster generator damage animation) its not enough.Being a killer in this game is a chore &amp leaves alot to be desired with the theme. If they dont fix these problems then in the long term you will have a player base that moves onto other games. I'm already starting to spend my time doing so. I will alter this review if changes occur. I want changes to occur. I want to enjoy killer. But in its current incarnation its not that fun. Previous ReviewSo first the concept behind DBD is really awesome. I love horror movies. I have multiple signed prints by actors directors &amp writers of horror. I got it specifically because of this concept of playing the killer in a slasher 80s film. But there are defintely some hits &amp misses.Pros Atmosphere is very on target very strong horror vibe Lots of killers to choose from even without DLCs 3 Licensed movie killers(leatherface michael myers &amp freddy krueger as of this writing) Lots of replay value from the killer side since each one has uniquely different strategies Scares the living crap out of you when you switch to survivor for the first timeCons Extremely toxic community. This is true of most online games but I find many players to act like immature children &amp keyboard warriors. This is largely ignorable if you want to play with friends or turn off chat. Paid killer DLCs are nerfed within weeks of being released. Obvious bias towards survivor meta from developers. Survive with friends is the biggest culprit of this as it matches random killers up with groups of 2 4 survivors who are likly using team speak voice chatting and thats a huge advantage over killers Match making system is broken &amp doesnt work Some of the daily tasks are near impossible to get like the hag killer teleport dailyOverall I'm still giving this game a shot but theres defintely work that needs to be done on the development teams part to fix the issues. If they continue to push a survivor focused meta then killers which is what I bought the game to do will become impossible to enjoy. Grab it on sale for $10 dont buy DLC &amp enjoy it with some friends. You will scare the crap out of each other.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-26,0,0,647,False,Not Recommended,"Alright at long last I'm revisiting my review of Dead By Daylight which was originally written back in Nov 2017.Quite a lot of things have changed that have evened out a lot of the balance. However most of the things I hated in the original review are still present game changing perks on both sides severely unbalanced killers and overwhelmingly oppressive mechanics. It's still incredibly hard to recommend this game to a NEW player and half of that reason is because of the ridiculous rank reset every single month.As a new killer you'll get absolutely made fun of and talked by survivors that have hundreds to even a couple thousand hours. The rank reset constantly throws these people back down to destroy people still learning.As a survivor you'll get bodied over and over without a chance by a Prestige 3 killer with hundreds to a couple thousand hours.The problem is that while you struggle without good perks/addons you won't really understand the balance as players with all of these things and experience can run circles around you on both sides. This doesn't even scratch the surface of actual problems for veterans.For starters killer balance hasn't actually changed at all. As of this review Hag and Trapper are getting buffs. The former barely needed any and the latter's buffs are actually pretty nice. Also upcoming are the nerfs to Brand New Parts which are pretty game breaking against the killer when more than one is used and even then it's pretty overwhelming for even a top end killer to deal with if the survivors are good.Since my last review the pallet vacuum has been removed and so have instant blinds. These are huge nerfs to survivors especially at the top end which is good. However...None of the BS mechanics or perks of killers have been nerfed. While it's true the Doctor is technically only a ""good"" killer he easily demolishes people with his ludicrously oppressive and difficult (sometimes impossible) to counter mechanics. New and veteran players frequently disconnect/leave the match against him and I can't blame them. He's awful to play against and so are a couple other killers. From his stupidly high range on his power to the disgusting synergy he gets with some perks it's almost not even worth playing against him if you aren't with good friends.Nurse and Hillbilly remain the two ""best"" killers since one ignores collision and the other ignores distance (and also the need to hit people twice to down them). I'm still basically waiting for nerfs on them. Hillbilly is still completely busted with the Barbeque &amp Chili perk which every single one has and runs. Almost every killer runs that damn perk but he's the only one that uses it to game breaking effect so have fun with that.Sadly Decisive Strike still hasn't received any nerfs yet as of this re review and Ruin is still mandatory for most serious killers.Camping is still awful but it's hard to say it's any different than before. I see a lot less Leatherface campers these days during the middle of the match and less Insidious in general. I would say I see more killer variety now than before whereas I took a 3+ month break because it was Hillbilly almost every single game intermixed with Doctor and a rare Nurse.If you end up invested in the game especially on the killer side you'll probably wind up dropping some money here or there to get a killer or faster access to their perks. The Shrine of Secrets rotates 2 survivor and killer perks every week so it's also only a matter of time to earn them otherwise. However you cannot purchase licensed survivors or killers with in game currency they're buy only.Given that this game is $20 ($10 on sale) it's pretty high value. Ever since Behaviour Interactive bought back the rights to the game updates seem to be more frequent and larger. While the dev streams themselves might not always hype you it's good to see what they're working on or looking at in the future if you have some minutes to throw at them.I still can't recommend this game to most. The barrier for new players can be very high especially when certain killers are just so ludicrously oppressive (such as the Doctor). As a killer it's really hard to deal with survivors that are stuffed with full perk and item loadouts with hundreds of hours of experience while you're just learning maps and how to kill people.I highly recommend watching some video guides for both sides and then eventually playing both sides. You cannot be a good survivor without playing and understanding the killer and how their first person view is and vice versa with how survivors operate.",Dead by Daylight

It still has issues relating to balance but the good news is that the devs are listening and are finally starting to right the ship The community is very divided. A lot of toxicity mostly from Survivor mains. But if you can get past rage messages in post game chat rage invites and in game tea bagging then it can be a very fun game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-03,0,0,344,False,Recommended,One of the best survival games out there Dead by Daylight lets you play as a killer to hunt down and kill all four players in the map or as a survivor to work with other survivors to escape from the killer alive. The game is like hide and seek its repetitive at times but is also really a fun adrenaline rushing experience that will make you want to play again. The only negative issue about the game in my opinion is the match finding system. Most of the time it cancels finding a match that you'll have to start looking for it again so it may take awhile getting into a game. But once your in the game the fun begins. Dead by Daylight is an intense horror game that will keep your heart racing trying to survive or kill them all. 8/10,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-02,0,0,189,False,Recommended,"Excellent concept spot on gameplay that's easy to learn nice graphics and fun maps... all ruined by horrible matchmaking (you can't play with one or two friends you need five whole people or you're forced to play with an entire team of randoms) and a complete lack of in game communication (a co op game without in game commuinication... great idea!). If they fix the matchmaking and add in game communication between survivors I will change my review.Edit to add weeks later and my negative recommendation still stands. The matchmaking is horrible (it takes several minutes just to find a game) it does not match you with people like your rank (nothing quite like being a low level survivor matched with a top ranked killer and vice versa) you cannot play with your friends (the game simply does not allow it to work) there are several game breaking issues (such as ring around the rosies created by chokepoints) and the latency on servers is caused by the poor P2P choice. To cherry on top is that anyone who voices these legitimate complaints to the community are met with verbal abuse about how they should just ""git gud.""Final edit they fixed the matchmatching ended the problem of people leaving all the time by hiding levels and ranks from other players and solved a lot of the match dropping. Not to mention that you are able to play with friends now it finally works. I'm a happy camper now.",Dead by Daylight

It fun and sometimes scary as a survivor because there are certain things you have to worry about in the game like making to much noise and being chase by the killer. Killer on the other hand have to look around and listen which in my opinion is fun because when the survivors screw up its time to kill! Plus you have a level tree in this game and different clothes for the survivors and different weapons for the killers.

However I encountered a game with players that went out of their way to make sure I would have a bad time. I was put into a position that by the games own mechanics I didn't have a chance to win.

2018-08-23,0,0,61,False,Recommended,TL DR I recommend I get hooked on 5 10 games then don't play in a whileAfter playing 60hrs in game I've decided to write a review based on how the game is as of now. I played it around it's release time and much has changed which I wont go in to.I play this as a break between tactical shooters as one of the best survival games out their right now with L4D and hopefully GTFO coming soonThis is more to give my opinion as I see it as it seems for every forum saying the survivors are OP there is also a forum for killers being OP.In my time playing I would say this is quite a well balanced game. No killer is too tough (though I would like them to be a bit tougher this is a survival game after all) and neither are they too weak.I've sacrafised all 4 survivors with a 'plain unperked level 1' killer and also survived as the same with a survivor. Whilst all the perks do make it easier it's not nessasary to live/killEach game is a fresh start (think L4d/R6) so newer players are not at a noticable disadvantage again as i see the perks as nice but non essential.Plenty of survivors/killers to choose from so read the bias and find the right one for youThe comments on the toxic community are sadly true I've died in games put my GG WP only to see the insults go towards the killer equally if you survive and another died he'll be on you with the insults. It's a shame but this only effects the post game screen as their is no chat in game.Too many people put their views on how to play when their is no right/wrong if a killer wishes to stay at the hook to ensure death (I personally dont) then it's their choice they shouldn't be insulted after as their giving others more free time to escape. Equally if a survivor opens the gates and doesnt come back for you that's their choice.I personally am a team player up untill the gate opens then only come back for people who have helped me,Dead by Daylight

I no longer have real friends as I murdered them all over and over again. I really only play killer at this moment but I have played as a survivor as well. They're two completely different ends of the playability spectrum as they vary in difficulty. I will definitely play more of each ""class"" when I can. Until then I feel like it's a good buy. The only thing I have an issue with right now is the server load time when you try to join a game as a survivor. You don't really get that issue though as a killer because you actually create the lobby and people join in on you. When you're a survior though it can be a bit tedious to find a game and all I can suggest is that if you're adamant on playing as a survivor just keep trying. Eventually you're going to find a game and hopefully the killer is a good guy in regards to not camping.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,181,False,Recommended,I wasn't sure about this game in the beggining. It's sort of out of my norm RTS play. That said I have become totally addicted to it. There were problems in the beginning with lobby and small stuff but now that more people are playing it takes less time to wait for a game. It's a very well balanced game from the killer and survivor perspective. I would seriously recommend using headphones to play well as a lot of the queus are audible and need paying attention to in order to be good at this and up your rank. I also suggest playing a killer and survivor at different times so you can learn more about how to be good at both. All in all I think it is an ecxellent game with even greater potential for future DLC.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-11,0,0,325,False,Recommended,Well I was sceptical when I first saw this game. Running around as either survivor or a somewhat supernatural killer? Being a survivor was okay for me but playing as a serial killer? So I watched video after video about this game and thought that maybe I should try it. I heard that the community was dying out and that there weren't enough people playing it. I think it is because this game is pretty intense and you can have a really tough time......Playing as a survivor isn't easy at all. You have to outsmart the killer run away hide help your mates use tools be careful about every step you take. If you are good at playing as a team you can do it until the end and escape. But if you're not a good teamplayer or don't like others then play as a killer. Being a survivor is tough many people just care about themselves and do their own thing which in fact doesn't work. And then there are the people who just can't lose. Calling the killer and his teammates things you don't want to hear. What do you think? That a killer wouldn't camp around his prey? Tactical waiting isn't a crime and you would do it yourself and you know it.Playing as a killer isn't easy either. Your abilities and the fact that you can't die are your only plus. Most of the time you're slow and you take your time for every action you take. The fact that you are alone isn't much of a help either. If you are playing against people that are smart work as a team and know what they're doing you can get into real trouble. Protect generators follow your prey protect a trap door that you can't see protect the escape points find the survivors..... It can be a hell of a nerve wrecking game. And if you actually win by killing everyone you are the biggest as***** on the planet. Being a killer and wait for others to save their friends and jumping out to attack them is often seen as unfair. But let me ask you Would a killer care? Guess what? Guess not!All in all after letting out my frustration about teenagers and ragers it is still a good game. And people like that are part of the community. Even you and I lose our temper at a certain point. It is all tactics and strategy in this game nothing else. And you can see it as a somewhat bloody game of cat and mouse.,Dead by Daylight

After playing a few hours during the free weekend you realize there is a huge amount of teamwork that goes into it.. Playing with friends is an insane blast and if you are solo playing as the killer is fun as hell as well.. There is MUCH more to the progression than I ever realized and you get quite a bit of bloodcoins (used for progression) acquired every match.. All in all I think the game is great and I'm glad the free to play weekend got me into it otherwise I would have never given it a chance.. THERE was an issue with the matchmaking but they fixed most of the issues and I'm sure will furthermore improve on it.. I'll be purchasing it and with the price tag at $17 til tomorrow it's a steal in my opinion..,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-21,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Played the free weekend trial and heres my initial impression of the game after one matchI played as the killer well because im to much of a to want to be hunted down. Anywho the games premise is great and i think its well executed especially for a game thats under 20 bucks. Thats not to say there arent any issues with the game because im sure theres plenty of bugs and servers issues i just didnt run into any in my first match. Now as for the gameplay itself it feels intuitive and relatively smooth. My only complaint is that the killer just seems to be way over powered while i was playing him i just felt unstoppable and not once to i feel these survivors were a threat in any way shape or form. Now i know in horror movies Jason isnt going to feel threated by the teens or freddy is going to his pants because the survivors are fighting back but i just kinda wish the killer was toned down or the survivors were given more options to fight back. My first match i won decisively and that was my very first game i just didnt feel challenged at all which for me in particular is a problem. It was fun chopping these survivors to pieces but just wish while theres more than 2 people alive still the odds are a little more evened out. Overall the game is fun and with a few tweeks this game could really take off. I give this game 7/10 Decapitated heads,Dead by Daylight

This game is one of the first of it's kind and one of the best as well and it only improves as time goes on. There's still a lot to really be done in the name of performance and game balance Survive with Friends crippled this game's balance forever and having 2 console versions definitely stretches them thin on optimizing the game but the devs continue to make great strides towards good gameplay balance despite what the community will say (performance may vary but i've had no problems running it on my mid tier computer so it shouldn't take much to run it).If the idea of 1 vs 4 horror themed death hide and seek sounds fun to you and if you're a big slasher movie film fan (this game has Micheal Myers Leatherface Freddy Krueger and a SAW themed character) then this game is the game for you.

It made me sick many times over and they're lucky I didn't get anything worse or I'd have sued. It's as simple as putting a warning then I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on an unplayable game. Not to mention no settings for the colorblind. It really seems like the team doesn't care about the players in the least and care only about how much they make not to mention how trashy and glitchy the game is.

2016-06-21,0,0,44,False,Recommended,I have changed my opinion on this game as the Developer has listened to the players and given us survive with friends and fixed many bugs. The game is now very enjoyable and most complaints I had in my review below have been dealt with. Pretty sweet game now. EDITED OLD REVIEW NOT LONGER CURRENT OPINION.Great concept of a game but it's nothing new nor has it been QA'ed properly. Game crashed frequently for me ruining some fun games I actually did have while learning. Some random small bugs but nothing game breaking bigger problem was connection problems making game pretty laggy at times. Damned a game with a very very similar concept and gameplay also suffered connection issues but never crashed for me and was much more spoopy. This game is definitely horror themed but is more frantic/thriller rather than horror. To compare in movies Damned is The Ring and Dead by Daylight is Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Final Verdict Fun game during the times it did not crash for me but barely got to finish most games because of those crashes. Sure i could look up solutions but i shouldn't need to do that for something i'm purchasing. Not worth the money so I refunded it. Purchase Damned instead for this sort of game which has little bugs no crashes custom lobbies to play with your friends without a need to dodge queues constantly and much more spoopy gameplay with the same concept get objectives and escape the area.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-30,0,0,3,False,Recommended,A solid asymmetric multiplayer game. It's refreshing for a game to feature NO way to fight back as the survivors which makes for a much tenser game than Friday the 13th. The game play out as a polished and more elaborate version of the schoolyard cops and robbers.Pros Lots of unique killers. Movement is pretty smooth. Teamwork is highly encouraged. Visuals and themeing is excellent (and haunting).Cons Can sometimes feel frustrating as escaping once a killer sees you is incredibly difficult (killers have high movement speed). Some killers feel much stronger than others (slow ones just plain suck). Some arenas feel fairly samey.Overall I agree with metacritic and give it a solid 7/10,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-26,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,My Experience Playing Dead By Daylight... Progress is constantly lost. Killers facecamp/hover over Hooked Survivors. Sabotaging is Useless. After leaving a match your Friends Lobby is disbanded forcing you to Re invite everyone again. Hooks are too close together for perks like 'Boil Over' and 'Decisive Strike' to be used efficiently. Multitude of Survivor Perks are useless i.e No Mither This Is Not Happening Ace In the Hole Unbreakable Bad internet connection in lobbies makes the game virtually unplayable. Effectively avoiding the killer as the survivor in a match results in less bloodpoints earned.Dispite these issues I've had a blast playing this game and leveling my Survivors. Earning teachable perks and progressing other survivors for their superior perks has kept me hooked in this game for a long time. Playing as both survivors and killers can be extremely fun but there are issues in the game currently that really rip my urge to play to shreds. In its current state I can't recommend that many people go and purchase Dead By Daylight. I hope that some of these issues get resolved or at least balanced efficiently soon.5/10 FeelsEhMan,Dead by Daylight

This is pc after all... (controls audio graphics etc) Can now configure controls (M&amp K and controller) and some basic settings skill based ranking system is heavily stacked against survivors even more so with the 1.0.2 patch skill based ranking system is challenging but the fairest it's ever been as per the 1.1 patch What needs to be done group pre lobbying (for friends) in game and lobby voice chat (lobby can be exclusive to survivors while in game can be proximity for fairness) If anyone leaves (before they are killed) they should be penalized even killers make it so the survivors can counter (2 sec stun from behind or something) for killers camping ""hooked"" survivors regular updates for bug fixing balancing between survivors and killers and lobby system (adjusting the skill based ranking system would be one thing) they are working on this and doing a better job to bootupdate 1 I want this game to succeed but more care needs to be taken into account if this game is going to survive the night. This may include re examining the initial goal of what this game is supposed to accomplish. Focus on gameplay that heavily rewards those who assist their team rather than selfish gameplay would increase the player base and make this game more rewarding for all parties.update 2 Would reccomend this for players who game in groups. If you prefer to lone wolf this game (without chatting) it will seem cruel for newcomers. Most players will not be able to take on or avoid the killer single handedly unless the killer is atrocious. Personally even with all the downsides the game is quite fun. If your not ready to suffer for enjoyment you might want to holdout until the game is fixed.update 3 As per 1.1 1.1.1 the game is quite balanced and I can notice alot more survivors ranking up. Players are rewarded for playing intelligently such as distracting the killer and assisting team mates. This actually gets you more points than rushing the objective 100% of the time.

2016-06-15,0,0,83,False,Not Recommended,"Opening with bad stuffI really like this game and feel like it does not deserve all the hate but it does deserve some of the hate. Let's talk about the hate it deserves. One of the few things that some people have complained about that I actually think is legit is the settings like for a modern game 2k16 you would think that the devs would give you the option to change your settings for quality a little more than low medium high etc. I mean it does not really bother me but I think that it is an option that is needed. Another thing that needs to be addressed is the connection to steam a lot of people have been dcd from the game because it says that steam is offline (myself included) but most of the time steam is still up. There is a lot more things that are legit to complain about but let's talk about the things that I really hate that people are complaining about. And that is the ""You can't que with your friends"" the thing is if you can que with your friends it will put the killer at a disadvantage but the devs have already said that they are working on it. And the whole que with friends if you only want to que with friends and don't really care for other players then go play ""Kill your friends"" if you are only playing the game to be able to play with your friends does your rank/lvl really matter?Good stuffNow let's talk about the good things about the game. I've always liked the horror genre and was really excited when I saw this game. I just love the feeling as you run for your life hoping you will get away or that someone will distract the killer so you could survive. The game has a *v1 concept and the survivors need to turn on generators in order to escape while the killer will try to hinder them at any costs. I really love this concept it both builds on teamwork and betrayal. I've had my fair deal of teammates trying to save me and my fair deal of teammates luring the killer to me or just blocking my path with wooden objects _ . Game stuffThe lobby layout is fairly simple you click join lobby(sometimes a lot because you can't connect or something) then you wait for the whole lobby to fill out in the meantime you change your loadout to make it easier for you to survive(med kits flashlights add ons sacrifices and perks) and check out the other teammates lvl/rank it's a shame that you can't see the killers rank or level anywhere(well you can see his rank after the game is done but that isn't enough) and I think that is a shame because you would not know if you are meeting an experienced player or a completely beginner so you can't really adapt your playstyle(You can kinda it puts you with kind of the same rank but still). Then in game you start of fairly close to your teammates while the killer is pretty close himself so you could easily get caught within the first 10 20 seconds if you aren't careful. If you are caught the killer will most likely guard you while you are sitting on a hook and that will give your team two choices. Either 1 save you (Which will be the more risky choice and someone will most likely be killed instead of you or with you) or 2. Turn on the generators while you are struggling (This is the more obviously choice since you barely get any rewards saving your teammates which is a shame) after all the generators have been turned on you try to open the exit and escape or if you are alone left you can find the escape hatch and ditch the others.EndI really love the concept of being in an old horror movie and trying to survive but I think it would make the game better if they added some sort of VON/VOIP 3D broadcast to the game it would benefit the survivors but the killer would be able to hear them as well.Currently I would rate the game 7/10 just because of the missing things and some balancing issues.UPDATENow that I have more hours into the game I feel like I can point out some more things.The devs have added a mode called Survive with friends which is basically a mode that lets you play with your friends online and that is great if it wasn't for the fact that you need to spend on average 30 40 minutes in the fricking lobby pressing ""READY"" over and over again. This is a way of treating your ""Customers"" by letting them wait for hours only to have the host (aka the killer) leave and you will feel robbed of your time. They have also added a feature which gives killers points in case a survivor leaves but not vice versa????? I mean like if the killer gets something if someone rage quits shouldn't the survivors get something if the killer rage quits?? I just want to say one thing after this ed up development and that is the Developers are bloody stupid like common why do they keep buffing killers all the time when it's not even needed....I just feel like they don't even care about the fans but only about the money they have already gotten. Until they fix a lot of bugs (Did not mention the bugs) and still balancing issues then I can't recommend this game to people.",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-02,0,0,142,False,Recommended,This game is fantastic. A lot of votes for it are for problems that have been fixed already in recent patches. Hours of fun for only $20. Extremely fun if you've got 4 other friends to play with just as good with fewer IMO. People complain about balance issues but really this game feels plenty balanced to me with maybe the killers having a slightly higher advantage (but only slightly). Even so I have loads of fun with this game. I've sunk over 50 hours into the game now and you might too. It's not for everyone but it's damn good fun.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-02,0,0,43,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game and I do think it's worth what they're asking for. Yes its very rough around the edges but I have faith in the devs that a lot of the problems that are in the game will eventually be fixed.If you're unwilling to work around the bugs and try and live with them until they're fixed pass this game up. Otherwise it's definately a great purchase.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-02,0,0,453,False,Recommended,Excellent game very intense and the procedural generation makes the game feel new enough and different that it doesn't get stale fast. As the devs add more maps killers and survivors the game will only get better.Of course at the moment there are some bugs but in my opinion the good far outweighs the bad here. Game well worth the full price of $20.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-02,0,0,112,False,Recommended,"When I got this game I was pretty excited. One of the coolest concepts I have ever seen sorta like a mature L4D promising actual adrenaline and the thrill of an invincible murderer. This was also like Amnesia where survivors' hopes in escaping is poisoned with how powerful the killer is.Reality was actually how I thought it would be. There were many chases and scenes period of times where my (real life) heart beat as fast avatar's in the game.I recommend this game because despite the bugs and the current unbalanced state it's still damn fun. Now my warning. It IS buggy. The game is like a really handsome/sexy individual you wanna date. Only thing is he or she has like an IQ of 80. Perhaps you are just gunning for the looks department here so I guess you might want to date him or her anyway.Dead by Daylight is like that. There are going to be some of you looking for a fully optimised game like Overwatch. Even if the game has a cool concept maybe you ain't gonna have fun as long as the game is still buggy. That's totally fine. For people who haven't yet BOUGHT the game I am just gonna list the current MAJOR bugs/annoyance. I hope it will help in making your decision. PROS It's sorta like a multiplayer Amnesia. You can't fight off the killer so you escape you hide. This concept of being in a hopeless horror game IS ING FUN. The thrill is amazing. All the dopamine and adrenaline like a drug that gets me high. And you live and die then right to the next game where you can do it again. The perks you can get(passive abilities) also really changes the game so it gets really fun when you get them. You feel the significance of it helping you really aiding and changing YOUR STYLE of escaping the killer.You wanna be a team helping aura survivor? Sure. Someone that can sabotaged the killer's stuff? Why not? How about someone more individualistic. You ain't gonna help anyone so your perks are just for you to move faster and quieter? Hell yeah. There are many styles and perks. It's fun to actually experiment with them. Have the killer caught someone? You have to make a choice now do you want to risk your live saving the nimcompoop or just try selfishly by yourself to make an escape? It's your life your choice. And you will be scared while making that choice. CONS It's damn buggy. Some minor some major. You know how you click a button ONCE in other games to queue? Then you sit back relax and wait till you enter a game? Ain't like that here. You gotta click it a couple of times. It will still only take you a couple of clicks but there might be time periods where you gotta click more. So yeah you click to queue. And then after awhile you might have to CLICK again. And again. There are exploits to be used I guess this is a subset of buggyness but I am just gonna explain as another point. You can still win as survivors and killers but there ARE exploits. To me I feel they ain't being abused that much so it's still alright. Mods are also trying to fix them every patch and since the game came out it's WAAAY better. Still if you hate the very concept and don't have much tolerance for them then yeah okay maaaaaybe not your thing. Might feel the game is a tad unbalanced. As every patch nerfs and buffs the killers and survivors there is a meta. Where a certain killer/survivor is OP and everyone uses them. Yeah this exist. But honestly most games have this ""meta complain"".In conclusion I still advise you guys to get it. The raw fun I get is too damn great. And I am sure the game will improve into a more optimised state(give the mods some time they are a pretty small studio).",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-20,0,0,118,False,Recommended,"I tried this game a few months ago and refunded but then I played it again for a free weekend and I got hooked. The game took a turn for the better definetely. Being a survivor is atmospheric intense and in every way thrilling. You have to outsmart the killer knocking down boards hiding vaulting over things and even escaping his grasp. But don't get me wrong survivors are pretty weak and its easy to get caught by the killer(SKILL CHECKS!) Or you can play as the big scary Wraith Nurse Trapper and others. Even though it may seem ""easy"" to be a killer you can be slowed easily and its hard to focus on getting all 4 people while they are trying their guts out (literally and figuratively) to LIVE! However the killers are very strong and can easily overcome all 4 survivors if skilled enough. Either role killer or survivor the game is great and should be played. I can't say much about flaws yet because I haven't played the game enough. Anyway RECOMMENDED! However there is a glaring flaw I have noticed with more time played which is queueing for a match. It can be a bit annoying at times when it takes 10 or so minutes to find a match(only on occasion) but when that happens it sometimes just kicks you out of the lobby because of an impatient host or something. Which is fine its just somedays ill be trying for like 20 to 30 minutes to find a match and I simply won't find a match! Other days it goes smoothly and I find a match pretty quickly. But in the end its a minor flaw and it doesnt hinder my enjoyment of the game. Only one time I have waited for a match for 10 or so minutes I was in the middle of loading screen with the tally marks before the game actually started and boom the game crashed. But that was the only time that ever happened and I would still definetely recommend this great game.Edit I have only played 2 games with this new ranking system however I do NOT like it. I preferred the old ranking system and honestly do not understand why they changed it.Edit 2 They have changed the ranking system but to a modified form of what it originally was but I like it.

After both of those goals are reached the only way you can enjoy this game is by playing with friends or even playing Kill Your Friends. Also don't expect to have many bug fixes and even if they fix a bug ten more bugs appear.

2018-07-20,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,This game is not one of the games that im proud of buying half of the killers (which are the people who host the game so your using there connection) have some of the worst internets ive seen it starts off fine then it lags more and more as the game moves on. The entire point of the game is to run in hide in third person which makes it not scary at all But oh wait it gets even better the killer is in first person but besides that stupid concept the graphics are scarier that the actual game itself (in other words there gross looking) the killers are completly stupid they started off decent then they turned very bad theres one killer that you cant see the entire time but once you do see him its more than likley to late because you will allready be downed and on a hook the player base is a mix theres some people that are pretty cool people and the other half will lead the killer to you not pick you up when your down wont get you off the hook blame everything on you and did i mention that there is absolutly no voice chat or text chat this game besides on the start and finish of the game (the menu) and this game requires you to have as much team cordination as you can because without it you wont see who the killer is unless you see them yourself for an example and you could say ill just get my friends to buy the game or meet some people on there. trust me you wont and your friends wouldnt want to waste the money on this ever so fast dying game the maps are very small crowded with objects and sometimes almost pitch black. over all i would rate this game a 3/10.i wouldnt waste the money its fun for 3 hours maximum.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-23,0,0,236,False,Recommended,"The game is pretty fun MOST of the time. The objective is simple enough for whoever you decide to play. If you are a survivor you try to fix the generators and survive until the doors open which you then proceed to escape. As a killer you try to hunt down the killers and sacrifice them on hooks to the ALMIGHTY SPIDER GOD (AKA The Entity).I can recommend this game if there is someone who wants to have a horror themed kind of game with a cooperative and competitive mix of gameplay its pretty simple and fun. Different survivors killers and perks relating to each one can give you different kinds of builds and strategies depending on what you build.The downsides are...pretty bad at least right now. The major problem is that there are only a few INCREDIBLY GOOD MUST HAVE perks that you will see majority of players running while other perks are okay situational or outright useless. Another problem which is pretty much the fault of the players who do this killers who will camp hooks and ruin another player's game. This problem is countered with ""Yeah but the other survivors can just work on generators and get an easy win "" BUT this doesn't excuse the fact one survivor is still having his game ruined by someone who wants to be garbage to someone. Finally this is a personal complaint (And some people will disagree which is fine) but I feel using the Mori killer offerings (Or anyway to instantly kill survivors without hook) are just too easy of a way to get an edge on the survivors.Despite my complaints I still have fun with the game most of the time and would recommend checking it out.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-19,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. At first look it is a fine and entertaining horror multiplayer game but when you start playing it it does not make any sense gets boring too early and there are some major bugs and gameplay glitches which makes the game painful. The small deficiencies give the feeling that the game is still in the development or early access stage. It is good for a free weekend fun but it gets repetitive and boring after a few hours so I do not recommend it for a long run.Purpose background charactersThe game has a pretty simple concept a monster is hunting down 4 survivors who have to start 5 generators to escape from the area. But the game has a lack of proper back story and a has a fair concept. I know a mulitplayer game does not need a decent background but it depends on the genre and the content which in this case a must have. Who are these survivors? Who should I pick? Why are they separated? Why can't they communicate each other? Why can't they fight back? Why they have to start N generators? Does everyone have a master degree in engineering? What is the purpose of destroying totems on the level besides gathering ""blood points""? Why should I play this game for hours? I didn't find any motivation at all.MonstersThe only good part of this game is the concept of the killer. Each monster has a unique skill and play style which is quite entertaining. The look of the monster is terrifying the survivors really get the creep when it appears out of nowhere. But the killing machine has only one flaw killing the humans. The monster just cannot kill the survivors with its bare hands (or weapons). No matter how hard it strikes with a giant axe or with a sharp scythe or a massive chaisaw they just getting hurt a bit but remains alive. So the monster has to wound them first then it has to bring them to a magical hook where an unholy spider appears and gathers them? What is the back story of this nonsense? Was it really necessary to mix a typical B movie monster with a deeper supernatural setting? The answer is no.Loading ScreenThe worst part of all. The players have absolutely no idea what's happening in the loading screen. After a few minutes waiting the player has a feeling that something went off and the game stopped or something so closes the game. The fact is the game starts only when all players are connected and loaded the map but there is no indication for that. If a player has connection issues the waiting time gets longer and the loser who waits the end of the loading screen gets only a game over screen because everyone left. Totally worth it.Sounds CommunicationThe music in the main menu is absolutely fantastic. It gives the players a pretty good atmosphere for the game they getting the horror feeling already. The in game heartbeat effect is a good concept for the survivors to indicate the presence of the killer. But the environmental sound effects don't tell the players what's happening around them. They cannot hear any footsteps or cracking twigs. The monster can't make frightening sound effects to scare the survivors to death. The players can't communicate each other via text or speech or any special messages emotes or signs. Considering it is a public game with 4 strangers players it's not a good design. Game SettingsOnly one option for changing graphics quality Graphics quality LOW MEDIUM HIGH ULTRA. Can't even change the resolution. A true horroristic game.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-19,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I decided to download the game with it being free this past weekend. The game was actually pretty fun when I got to play. The graphics were actually decent and the game ran smoothly without any problems. The only problem was that 90% of the time me and my friends couldn't connect to a server or the game would randomly crash. We only got to play 1 2 games so I can't go into a lot of details on how everything in the game was setup. All I know is I'm glad we didn't spend money on it since connections to servers are total crap.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,738,False,Not Recommended,EDIT Everything below is from months ago. I have since grown completely frustrated from the lack of communication and support from the dev team to the playerbase. If the dev team ever fixes the game and listens to their paying playerbase this review will be readjusted.I do recommend this game but read before you assume it is all positive. I have put a lot of hours into this game and I am speaking from a high rank perspective.TL DR A very fun game where you might lose the next several months of your life. Just don't expect the most balanced competitive game ever created.This game has a lot of ups and downs and almost all of it is from the nature of the game itself. The game was designed to be asymetrical and that makes it very hard to balance. At high ranks the game is extremely survivor favored and at low ranks the game is extremely killer favored. This will always be the case for as long as chases are mostly based on the skill of the survivor. The devs saw this and tried to make an extreme change they made a killer where the length of the chase was mostly based on the skill of the killer (The Nurse). There was an extreme backlash from the community because the survivors had a much smaller influence in the outcome of the chase. This means we will probably never see the parabolic curve of advantage change because the devs do not seem to understand how to implement incremental change.This does not mean the game is bad by any means. The game is extremely enjoyable and you will have to sink over a hundred hours to get a full build. You probably won't even notice the time you lose as you sink hours and hours of your life into this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-07,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,I must admit the devs. really care about their game they have put alot of time and energy into this title. However I have never in my life played a game that frustrates the hell out of me any more than this game does. The insane amout of time I wait to start a session that only takes me right back to the point of waiting yet again for a friggin session to start is the beginning of my frustration. On the off chance that you do make it into a multiplayer session you will now begin to contend with 9/10 times the toxic community of players who are just well bad friggin people.

Blood was pumping through my veins and my heart was racing as I buried my axe into my first victim. I put him over my shoulder as the victim tried to wiggle away and drop down from my shoulders to run away. Just before he managed to succeed at it I lifted him and thrust his left shoulder through a massive meat hook on the edge of my corn field. ""Nobody ain't stealin' me corn"" I said to myself. On the edge of my eye I saw another person running with corns in their pockets. I proceeded towards the thief with my giant axe leaned over my shoulder. The person was going to run away so I took one of my trusty hatchets and threw it at the person. It buried itself into her back knocking her down and the corn she was holding. I walked over to her and grabbed her. She moaned as I put her on my shoulder and started walking towards my other meat hook in middle of the cornfield. ""These are me foking corns m8 and nobody steals my foking corn m8"" I kept telling myself as I thrust her shoulder through the meat hook.As time passed by I tracked down 2 more thieves stealing my corn. I buried my axe and hatches into them and hooked them onto my meat hooks and offered them as sacrafices to the Great Entity of beyond knowing that it would watch over my cornfield as a thanks.It was done.

2018-08-01,0,0,521,False,Recommended,"When I first looked at footage for this game I was very skeptical on if I would enjoy it or not. The gameplay animations and even general concept looked very plastic and stale no matter how far deep I looked into it. I eventually bought this game on sale since Friday the 13th The Game (a game I love dearly) is bound to close down in the near future due to the halt of new income due to the F13 rights lawsuit. I didn't wanna stop playing these slasher titles so I decided to give it a try. ""If I don't like it I just won't play it. Plain and simple."" I told myself.After clocking about 16 hours into the game now not too much but enough for me to get a good idea of the game I purchased I honestly really enjoy it! The gameplay isn't as boring when you're actually involved in the experience and one with the atmosphere. I've already purchased a good handful of DLC for the game now (all of the iconic horror characters for the sake of it) and I've enjoyed playing Freddy Krueger despite him being the most underpowered killer in the game. I intend on putting a lot of hours into Amanda Young and Michael Myers too. I can safely say that overall the game is a blast and I definitely see myself continuing to play it for a while now.A fair warning to all new people who intend to play this game on a free weekend or buy the game yourself straightaway the community is very toxic. This is likely because of the direction they took in terms of online play only supporting ranked matches aside from friend only lobbies. If you've been involved in any competitive gaming before or you've been involved with any tryhards on CS GO you know how people love to stroke their egos by getting super high ranks and t bagging their opponents any chance they get. That being said I have met quite a few nice people on this game! Good sports who don't do everything in their power to taunt you but individuals who just play to play. You'll likely see more toxicity the higher you get in ranked so enjoy the nice people while you can. I'm writing this review right out of a match where people in chat were yelling stuff like ""GET GUD"" like they're a hardcore competitive gamer from 2013.Overall I personally give the game itself an 8/10 as it has really nice and addicting gameplay that's sure to get any horror fanatic thrill seeker and even action enthusiast rooting for more. However the toxicity of the community brings the online experiences down to about a 6/10 and since this game is 100% online with no offline AI...well buckle up.Behaviour Interactive and Starbreeze Studios you have made a wonderful game that houses an incredibly toxic community but your work is still very much appreciated and I hope you continue to pour the same passion you did here into future updates and also future games.",Dead by Daylight

No matter how far you are they eventually catch up with you. A little advise never run in a straight line. ) Maps knowledge are very crucial.Dev should slow down the speed and movement for killers (atleast at the speed of survivor). Buy it if you're a casual player and don't by it if you are a sore loser.

2018-09-13,0,0,832,False,Recommended,"This game is alright I've been playing it for a long time and when it first came out goddamn did I love it.TL DR the community is a spread of really annoying trolls buzzkills and normal players. Be prepared to have a game out of your few that isn't fun at ALL. Updates consistently break and fix things then fix those things they broke and subsequently break something else. DLC is fun but sometimes pay to win faster. Gameplay can get repetitive strategy wise its in this rut where you need a certain kit to win. The game is fun overall but buy it only if you're certain you can handle these things. Otherwise you'll regret your purchase.Obviously as per every game there's an interesting community. There's a lot of irritating survivors and killers out there the real pissy or real trolling kind but there's also a handful of pretty good ones out there too. Within your first few games you'll probably get the latter since rank 20 (the base rank) is kinda a mixed group of newbies who are genuinely trying their best and people who know what they're doing and just got their rank reset. Killer wise you'll most likely get people who either kinda know how to play the game or campers/tunnelers who don't know better. Basically there's people occasionally ruining your fun for a game and others who are either newbies or decent. the community is kinda like CS GO in that aspect i guess.Oh yeah there's farm bots too and I'm not sure they've ever been banned.Update wise it's not awful. There have been a few features updates and bugs that have ruined the game for a while. Freddy's first kit the Killer's pickup stun interaction rework the Nurse bugging out on a certain map making her literally unplayable hook blocking if you've played the game you'd know what I'm talking about. But they've all been fixed within a few months and the devs are actually not that bad when it comes to dealing with this stuff. Sure their patches aren't perfect when they come out (even when it comes to bug fixes) but things get resolved. Plus they're still adding DLC which is pretty neat. I don't know about their ban system however since I've seen people say that they were banned despite never having hacked and I've seen people cheating/hacking/botting and I don't think they were ever banned. There's no real way of knowing as far as I can tell.The most important thing is the gameplay though. First and foremost servers. There are NO DEDICATED SERVERS. This means that every killer hosts their own game making it susceptible to lag and lagswitching. Plus depending on your wifi and where you live finding or hosting a decent game will be really friggin hard. The gameplay itself isn't too bad and things can get pretty repetitive especially if you're unlucky like me and get the same goddamn map for three games. When you first start it's pretty fun and even scary when the killer is after you. After a while though the game stops being ""hide and seek"" and more ""run for as long as possible."" If you know how to run fast and evade damage you win. Anything else you lose. This kinda forces survivors to use a specific kind of kit that their opponent can't beat unless they're a certain killer and even then it depends on the map setup and luck. Your best chance of living is to have a certain kit and knowing how to run off of youtube and your best chance of killing is to be on a certain map be a certain killer and/or a certain kit.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-06,0,0,9,False,Recommended,"While i do reccomend the game. here are a run down of my pros/cons. Cons first! literally spent my first 6 matches with the game crashing every time i did any action. Why? because i simply had a controller plugged in. Regardless a not a BIG problem more of a huge annoyance when I have to specifically unplug my external devices just for one game.despite a semi active game matches can take upwards of a few moments at times to matchmake.teaming with your friends for fun can be a slight pain if you don't have enough players for a private match. Unless you have less then 4 players then you're stuck match making with the above issue.Pros Your not stuck to just one character or ""killer"".Both sides get ""skill trees""Not one character is better then the other.The killers all get their own play style which is nice.only about 4 hours on record so far but quite enjoyable when you and a buddy are trying to survive a crazed psychopath.",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-09,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Played the game since release. It was good at launch. It was good after a few weeks. But then in August it went down hill when all the nerfs and changes happened. First they made the killers op af. And then nerfed them slightly so they got salty. Now it's almost impossible to find a game. It's getting slightly better every day. But Behavior Digital needs to get their priorities straight. Don't release stupid DLC like the Nurse and 80's suitcase. Just fix the match making and balance issues. Still by far my favorite multiplayer game in my library.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,"QUICK REVIEW The game looses it's ""horror"" aspect after a few hours of gameplay and by then becomes a crappy game of Hide and Seek Killer Edition. Matchmaking times are long and laoding game times are even longer (a majority of my hours was probably spent waiting). VERY BUGGY AND UNSTABLE! There are constant crashes and laggy moments that not only ruin the immersion and what horror is left in the game but also makes it nearly impossible to play. FULL DETAILED REVIEW Every * means how poor is that given section. ***GAMEPLAY If you manage to play in a unbuggy/laggy server than you will find yourself playing a watered down game of basically hide &amp seek with some changes. The killer will go around hunting the players with some perks that allow him/her to detect the players easier (this feature allows the killer have easy tabs on all the players) and the survivors have perks as well that range from healing yourself or breaking the killer's hooks. The ""Horror"" aspect of the game fades away after a day or two of gameplay and by then you will be able to avoid the killer even under pressure. Some of the perks of course are unbalanced and the horror tag of the game quickly poofs away after you play a lot and become a true pro.****IMMERSION The graphics are rather fine and actually some what acceptable yet it becomes rather tiresome after a few hours of game play as you constantly are forced to look at the same trees with the same buildings with the same brick walls and so on. Audio of the game gets extremely annoying as you are constantly chased by the killer to hear this loud pounding music that just becomes a great annoyance after you play for a day or so.*****BUG &amp GLITCHES Some glitches have still remained from the close beta and are still ruining the gameplay. You will find yourself as the survior teleporting around as the killer confusingly watches you walk past him while your screen sends you to some sort of break in time (then you die). The crashes occur in fair amounts and will simply ruin your game as you are tossed out of the match to give the killer a ""Rage Quitter Bonus"". The Immersion of the game is then also ruined due to the constant teleportation and glitches of player models.***FUTURE PLANS The devs right now have been releasing patches but for the wrong things and issues. They recently came out with dlc to add more clothes for glitchy player models + had added another killer to the large stew of bugs and crashes. This halloween they plan to possibly add another killer from a movie film along with it's given surviors which in turn will only make the game have even more glitches. The devs road map is going all over the places and lightly counters the on going issues that many players are facing. OVERALL I would only reccomend this game to anyone who is okay playing a water down version of hide and seek with the powers of laggy teleportation. Otherwise wait for the game to come out with more patches that will hopefully fix this game. I give Dead by Daylight 3/10 Teleporting Megans",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-05,0,0,528,False,Recommended,10/10 would get camped have killeres that lag left behind first (85% of the time) and left to die while teammates complete dailies over saving you every day Just to have one of the 1 out of 100 games that actually is fun and seems like both sides are enjoying themselves.Just to have one game where people actually care that you are on the hook and all 3 teammates try to save you.To have a killer that knows how to legit play and know when they lost and is a good sport about it.To have survivors that don't have issues with good killers.Yes I will take every rage inducing game. Every single painful loss. Every single depip and derank. Just to have a game that I can enjoy with me and my friends.If you are reading this and are part of the problem. Do go yourself.

2016-08-21,0,0,3403,False,Recommended,Pros * Very simple and fun game design. It's pretty easy to learn but very hard to master.* Addictive. There is a strange feeling where you'll want to play more even when things are not going to well. * Bloodpoints/Bloodweb. The rewarding system is very good. You get rewarded based on your actions not matter the game result. You can lose and still be nicely rewarded so you are not so dependent on your team to have a good result. Of course winning is always better.* It will take you some time until you have played through all content so the value for the price of the game is pretty good.* This game is even better with friends. If you have no friends you can always go killer and slaughter everyone.Cons * No dedicated servers. The hosting is done by the killer. This creates lag and a lot of problems joinnig a game. This also creates a feeling of distrust since killer can abuse the fact that he is the server.* Bad matchmaking. Matchmaking is kinda random. Be ready to learn how to play the game against seasonal players in your first matches the game makes a very bad job trying to pair players of equal level of experience/skill which can be very frustrating in the beginning.It's really up to you to decide if the pros overcome the cons. I guess it will depend on each person.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-23,0,0,39,False,Recommended,A very fun game you can work together with your randomly assigned buddies to hopfully escape and claim a victory or you can get facecamped before a single generator is up both are completly dependant on who you get matched with and against and playing the objective is manditory if you want to win however that puts you in the crosshairs of the killer and that is never where you want to be. Lesson for new survivors here constantly play the objective you may be the first to die but this is what you need to do sure there may be games where you repair 5 gens and your team has done literally nothing but hiding constantly will not help you it help your survivability in the short term but you need the generators to win. I personly ave not spent much time on this game and this is just what I learned in the first 5 6 hours there are much better qualified people than me and I would highly reccomend watching a tutorial before you hop into the game your new teamates will thank you not in chat of course that would never happen.for all the new killers out there good luck. From your first match you'll be in games with people that have max level characters people in premade teams (thanks to the survive with friends feature) but I hope you'll stick with it and finally crimb the ranks rising like a star before your rank is reset next month. as much as I hate saying this play to win and never play fair and use whatever perk work for you as long as you're having fun of course. that's something I don't see enough killers playing to have fun I don't know maybe they are tired of losing maybe they just happen to enjoy those perks I shouldn't judge.look even with all of this negativity I'm spewing out dead by daylight is certainly with the money and I hope I'll see you one day in the evening fog a hook through your chest.....,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-01,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"In a nut shell...Survivors have to wait ages due to lack of killers playingSurvivors will constantly troll the killer (like me a rank 20 and only played a few hours) to get more points even after all generators are done. They will spend 10 minutes destroying all the hooks and just loitering around the entrance running back and forth rather than ending the game. Devs keep nerfing killers like in the latest patch especiallyKillers stop playing killers due to the above... this means less killersSurvivors complain about Qs but still do the above to discourage killers and annoy them.Update So i been playing for 2 weeks about 15 hours and felt my first bit of toxicity from survivors... so they won i had 2 DCs which happened after i hooked them (maybe salty who knows) the last 2 then spammed the end game chat with ""EZ"" and called me the lamest trapper ever.... i have never understood this kind of gloating they won it was easy for them i am clearly new with only 1 perk... i guess low self worth makes them feel better when they abuse random people.

2016-09-18,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,As much as i love this game the matchmaing system is ed. it puts me up against those who have all ultra rare perks and offerings while i have no perks. Also devs have yet to fix the tractor spot in Coldwind Farm that people use to infinitely outrun the killer (i emailed the issue to them no response).On the other hand the thrill of being either survivor or killer is great atmosphere really comes through as well. Skill checks add to that stress to put you on edge adds to the thrill. Overall a great game its just the players that often times end up being s ruining some of the fun. Additionally devs wont respond to emails about bugs..... dissapointing that communication is lacking. With the devs and community working together we could end all the glitches and exploits as well as add remove or alter existing features for the better (ex nurse should be able to cancel her teleport should be able to attack while charging up),Dead by Daylight

There are lots of high risk high reward points in the game that make it very tense and give the game a livelyness that other games dont have. The game is very balanced with the killer moving slightly faster than the victims while still giving them a chance to escape with corners vault spots pallets closets and tall grass. The game has a different style to most of the games that have been coming out lately which gives it an edge when you are running away from an 8 foot tall beast and being screamed at by drums and orchestra.Although the game does have a few faults such as A poor matchmaking system where instead of searching on its own when everyone is ready the search runs in pulses and wastes a lot of time and attention Occasionally getting stuck in a meat hook pole after being saved No team communication at all.I would still definitely recommend this game though,Dead by Daylight

Killer mains can expect 1. Being looped for 10 minutes a game.2. Having the survivor tear through space and time to pull a pallet down right when you're about to hit them.3. Be BM'ed and bullied.4. Catch one and camp them for their bad manners.5. Be called the worst names and told to kill yourself for securing your kill.6.

2016-10-28,0,0,71,False,Recommended,Okay here's the deal. 4v1 games like this are always a risk but I feel like this game is a good investment. I started playing during the free weekend in August and I've been hooked (ahaha ow) ever since. For me the game never goes stale. I've had amazing games where I escape by the skin of my teeth. I've had games that have left me screaming with frustration. The matches have been mostly positive though there are always going to be issues with other people. Camping killers are an issue but what can you do? That's just people being people. Yelling at them just encourages them so don't waste your time. Cheaters are around too but I've only encountered one or two in the months I've been playing. I may just be lucky on that part. The controls can be a little weird especially the quick time stuff but it just takes a few rounds to get used to. I've had issues with parts of the map not quite loading but those are usually fixed with the updates.I don't mean to rattle on but this is one of the most addicting games I've played in a long time. If you're looking for a spooky game that keeps you on your toes and you don't mind playing with people (who may or may not be jerks) then this is the game for you. But if you don't like losing matches or getting mad when altruism isn't at its highest you might be better off looking somewhere else. Good luck!,Dead by Daylight

Meyers is a really really cool update to the game. The only thing they ""could"" do is that maybe he could jump back to evil within 1 or maybe shorten the evil within 3 time from 60 to 30/40 sec. . I witnessed a few people that havent figured him out yet because they camp at palats which is a huge mistake against meyers but in a couple of weeks i think most of the players will work it out and then all the hate will be probably gone at least lets hope so.have fun and happy slaughtering",Dead by Daylight

After you play it a few times it's not really scary rather its more if you and your squad can make it out alive because 8 times outta 10 you gonna die. Can be very difficult to escape. Still buggy and some players can be ***holes for a lack of a better word. After a while it becomes a little frustrating because all you want to do is survive but will always be just as difficult even with a high leveled charater.I think thats great because you will always have a challenge so the fun never ends!!,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-19,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game is pretty fun imo especially with friends. PROS Nice graphics little glitch. Atmosphere is nice Gameplay runs smooth Nice daily challenges/Things to help levelingCONS Random chase music when the killer isn't near Awful lag in some games NO CHAT during gameplay no voice chat. (If theres an issue on how to mute others then make a damn muting button) Can be frustrating for NEW players at firstThe game is incredibly fun as it is with few balancing issues and minor glitching issues. However in my opinion the devs should bring back voicechat WITH a muting button or put in a in game chat. It helps to tell the other survivors ""hey hes camping me don't bother."" or ""hey the killer is gone!"". It would make being a survivor worth while. I've seen some statements about how it ""breaks the immersion"". It's a game theres only so much you can immerse yourself in. Games like Deceit do very well with voice chat and in game chat and I'm sure this one will fare better if it had one. Another thing would be the killers while I am a new player I've gotten the hang of it and have won quite a bit. Although that said I've also lost my share of games as well. But my honest opinion on them? The killers are way too fast. I play as Meg and still they somehow catch up to me. Killers like the doctor Michael and Jason can be incredibly frustrating to go against so I feel as though there should be a ""Ban"" button. Something every survivor can vote on before a match. Kind of like how League of Legends has bans. I don't ever expect this in the game but it would be nice to get rid of the same two killers that everyone plays. That being said I do enjoy this game but it needs to have some type of chatting system for teamwork. Also! It helps making friends and having more people to play with which obviously in turn means more fun.",Dead by Daylight
2017-03-10,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,I have played the game now for over a year and here's what i think. At first the game is awesome. However the more you play and the more involved you get the more you see the problems this game has. The Devs really make very little attempt at making this game good. Their is soooooo much wrong with this game and it seems to only get worse. I'm sure you can find the laundry list of problems if you look for it.The community has become VERY TOXIC! If you try to explain your point of view about the game you will be trolled and blasted. I have never seen a community so toxic. Several times i have tried to point out what's wrong with the game thinking the devs will listen and make some sort of attempt at fixing it. But they don't! Bugs connection issues random problems and soooooo much more.The balance between killer and survivor is just plain stupid. It isn't fair and the devs and community don't care. The killers get the short end while almost every asttempt at making the survivors better is addressed. I'm sure the game will be just as fun for the survivors when all the killers are gone )Making the killer host the game is probably the most thing i have ever seen. What if the killer has a bad connection? Well now it's worse because you are hosting 4 other players. The devs spend their time releasing more content for you to purchase and 0 time trying to repair the game.In short i just want to say that fater spending the amount of time and money on the game that i did...i wish i could take it all back. This company will never get another dime from me.If you don't believe me...purchase the game and see for yourself. Be sure to check the community out to...no toxic people there...noooooo,Dead by Daylight
2018-02-19,0,0,316,False,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun with friends. If you don't particularly care for progression grab 4 of your friends and play a custom game with each of you rotating through the killer role. If you have voice comms it can be a lot of fun bragging about how you escaped/sacrificed one of your friends.The minor downside that I've come across is people disconnecting as survivors. I had 3 games just today where I ended up being the only survivor to not disconnect. In those games I must say that the killer was friendly and didn't kill me off. They let me get the 2 generators active in order to open the escaped hatch and each time they led me to the hatch. They were understanding in the post game chat and overall friendly. It turns an otherwise fun game into a chore for both the lone survivor and the killer.There needs to be some sort of penalty (apart from downranking) for people who disconnect.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-19,0,0,129,False,Recommended,"Pretty great better than I thought it would be. Games with objectives like this are usually a disadvantage for the players being hunted *cough cough Aliens vs predator cough* But this game actually has really great balance to it if you play a survivor and you're smart and plan ahead you'll get very far this game has a progression system that lets you get new skills and perks for both survivors and the killers. Regardless of what few people say about how the killers might always win that's actually not always the case you just have to use stealth correctly and always plan ahead. I would rate this game a 8/10 only an 8 because I wish there with more maps or a vote map ability and I wish there were more bug fixes I notice a lot of people seem to be having issues with however. People claiming ""This game is terrible don't buy it."" Because of the ""campers"" is a silly childish fit for people who don't strategize correctly this is a PvP game. Players will use any tactic they can to win even if it seems somewhat cheap you can still counter that always. I've played both survivor and killer multiple times and to be truly real with anyone reading this.. They are both balanced sometimes I run into a really good killer other times I run into very intelligent survivors this game is strictly PvP but I like that about this game.. Sometimes I run into children who whine because they didn't get an easy win but a lot of times I'm running into friendly players who often tell me gg (good game) and it's an interesting community to have not a lot of games have fair sportsmanship players I do like to see that in this game it's really quite the opposite of league of legends' toxic community or World of Warcraft or Call of Duty's whine and cry so and so is too strong fest. All aside from my community experience if there was a vote map option and a lot of bug fixes.. this game would be crazy popular. Most likely a 10/10 for most veteran PvP gamers.",Dead by Daylight

2018-01-02,0,0,815,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight that depressing and addictive game at the same time ...You can play whether with friends or not it really doesn't matter at all because I asure you will have a nice time as long as you know the basics of the game and how to act in certain situations instead of your pants ). At the beginning is a pain in the learning how to play (99% of the time you will be crouching behind a tree each time you hear the heartbeat of the killer) because for example If you play killer you will have to pay attention to everything arround you to catch those filthy survivors so you just have to get used to it and watch the tutorial vids inside the game menu that will clear you some things up.I have to say that sometimes you MUST have a lot of patience with people who play this game especially if you play killer because this game is one of the most toxic games I've ever seen and played. Eventually survivors will blame at you just for stupid things Well If you camped the whole ing game then it's normal hehe also If you are new to the game you will probably get bullied by them so that's why I highly recommend to play first Survivor a bit and then Killer because you will see more or less how things works for both sides.Pros There are a lot of differents perks to play with which makes the game different everytime whether for the killer or the survivors 200 hours of playtime guaranteed Constant tension atmosphere Maps are generated randomly that means that you don't really know where you will play until you just get in the match DLC characters are soooo fun to play with Really addictive gameCons There are some kind of playstyles which literally ruins the game P2P game Sometimes the game feels monotonousThis game used to have A LOT of bugs even though It wasn't in beta status anymore Which at the beginning made me think about refunding it.

2016-10-25,0,0,942,False,Recommended,"Alright its a good nearly 400 hours later and I'm still playing this game so I thought I'd revisit all the points I originally made in this review as well as share my overall opinion of the game since now vs then.Cons 1.Community is toxic as f**k anytime you complain about hook camping body blocking or cheap vault spots or any other cheap game tactic nearly everyone will insult you or tell you to ""Git gud"" or stop whining. This game is VERY unwelcoming to new players who most likely will find the game hard as hell until they get the hang of it.*This point is one the few points that is still very true. This game's community will rival league of legends and dota 2 for most toxic community. But if you like me and play a decent amount of killer just bath in their salt or close end game chat. You'll be doing yourself a favor.I'd also like to mention how gamers who even play the slightest amount of killer on xbox one are having their reps destroyed by salty gamers which punishes them in alot of online games. There's ways to up your rep to circumvent this but its still a testament to this game's toxic community.2. Killer for alot of people is a very frustrating experience I've checked alot of the negative reviews for this game and nearly all of them complained about how people don't fear the killer and will often teabag and taunt the killer. So many players have the same overpowered perks of Saboteur 3 Self care 3 and Sprint Burst 3. WIth the 4th one being the only one that's differnent for alot of people. For example when you realize they disabled ALL of your hooks and just have to rely on downing people cause you can't reach the basement without them wiggling out is a prime example of some of the bs you will deal with as killer. Killers need a major buff to make survivors fear the killer again and counter the cheap perks of the survivors.*This point is half true. Self care 3 and sprint burst 3 are still very meta perks hundreds of hours later. Although saboteur 3 is no longer meta and getting all your hooks disabled is no longer an issue as hardly anyone sabos anymore. That said killer can still be a very frustrating experience but its alot easier than it was back then. Even though the survivors now have even more crutch perks such as decisive strike dead hard and borrowed time. The killers (excluding nurse) are heavily underpowered compared to the survivors and their many crutch perks. Especially if you're playing against swf which massively shifts the balance in their favor. Not to mention in my opinion the introduction of pallet looping since this review has made winning as killer significantly harder. Like sure we had some infinite back in the day. But pallet has down right made enjoying killer alot harder as the devs refuse to do anything about it. Even though it would be an easy fix.3. The ranking system is total horse crap. Some of the more no life players who reach rank 1 like its nothing will just tell you its easy and for you to get better. And that may not be too hard for someone who has the damn time to do so. But if you're like me and have a job and can only play this game a few times a week at most you'll find reaching rank 1 a pipe dream. Hell even when I REALLY commited to getting my rank up I only got to rank 13 before they reset the rank season and I was back to rank 17. They honestly reset the seasons WAY too quick. Plus they don't tell you at all the length of the season such as September 1st 15th or something like that. If they did that at least I'd know how much time I'd have left to reach those high ranks and get the achievements for them.*This point also rings half true. I actually managed to get up to survivor rank 3 before the rank reset. They should say resets happen in game instead of just on their website. Its still a little frustatrating. But the length is always a month with the reset happening every 13th of a month I believe. Its also alot harder to rank up as killer now since the victory cube which doesn't help the situation.4. This is sorta of an add on to previous points but you have to have a level head if you play this game. There's 2 situations in this game that have made me rage to the point that my blood was practically boiling. First situation which I've had just a few today where the killer either spawns nears you or finds you instantly and practically insta downs you and then when you're on the hook he either camps you or no one even attempts to save you. The other big one is as a killer to have survivors teabag and taunt you at the same cheap spots over and over with the same overpowered perks basically aquates to trying your hardest to win only for EVERYONE to get away. Either of these situations you will be very tempted to rage quit which I have at times. Do NOT play this game if you have anger problems like I do.*I don't even remember why I made this point. I think its cause I was and frustrated when I made this review. Is it still anger inducing sometimes? Sure what game isn't but this issue relates more with killer I find than playing survivor5. This one is a small one but this game isn't exactly Crysis levels of good looking graphics yet it is one the most poorly optimized games ever. Do NOT buy if you have a crappy PC.*This point is still true its very poorly optimized. I still play the pc verson despite running it on low graphics. Which is why I ended up buying it on xbox aswell for a smoother experience. If you suffer from a crap pc on this game I recommened buying the console version instead.Now onto pros 1. This game is amazing to play with friends if you got 1 or 2 buddies its great to work together. You can have some truly memorable experiences when playing this with a bud. But good luck finding a game with 4 people. If you have more than 4 people then kill your friends is a great and at times hilarious mode to play to scare the absolute S**t outta your ""Friends""*The load times since the original review have VASTLY improved. It used take 30 60 minutes to game into a game as swf but now it only takes 5 minutes thankfully. At the same time this is almost a con as the survive with friends mode provides too many advantages to survivors against killers that it upsets the balance of this game.2. Perk system is great gives you something to work towards and you get really cool abilities that will overall make the game easier for you as you progress.*Still a great point. The perks are why this game is such a time sink as you'll level so many people or killers just to get that perfect build that let's you surive way more or absolutely destroy survivors.3. Gameplay is very fun engaging has alot of replayablity no 2 matches are ever the same. Will definately get your adrenaline pumping at times.*The core gameplay loop has only improved over time with 10 different killers (soon to be 11) giving the game massive variety in matches. This along with all the different maps perk loadouts items and add ons. No 2 matches are alike.As you can see Con list is nearly twice as big as the pro list. That said I got my money's worth when it comes to hours I bought their dlc and I'm still gonna play it. If you got a couple friends to play this with and can stomach the toxic community and what at times will be a very frustrating experience as killer or survivor ESPECIALLY if you manage to reach rank 10 or higher. Then by all means buy it and you will love it just like I do as it's definately worth the $20 price tag for the 50 100+ hours of playtime you're probably gonna get outta this.*In this game I main survivor 60% verus killer 40%. Yet I still find myself siding with the killers in this game. I'm still playing 400 hours later. I'm still buying their dlc (although freddy was a big regret). But this game unless they seriously buff killers fix swf balance issues and fix pallet looping. There will be no killers soon and this game WILL die.",Dead by Daylight

2017-04-20,0,0,166,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a lot of fun to play with friends. Playing it by yourself is a lot of fun too although I prefer playing with friends. The graphics are nice and although there are still quite a few bugs reappearing now and then they make this game somehow a lot more funnier. The developers invest a lot of time and energy to create new things and fix bugs. I don't quite like the community though. A lot of people seem to be spoiled by Triple A games and don't see the work that's behind the game. There's a lot of hate and misbehaving trolling people who can sometimes destroy your game experience. Nevertheless I really like playing it every now and then because every game is different and even players with less experience can turn out to be real talents and make your game quite hard.I would recommend it if you don't expect everything to be fixed in a few minutes. I remember times where you waited for an hour to join a game with friends. Now it's much better. So there is progress and that's all that matters.,Dead by Daylight

The Devs do hear and work to fix bugs regardless of what some online may say. Not another game I've found like this it's got me hooked! Plenty of intense moments and good for a quick round.

2017-07-20,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,Dead by daylight is a very interusting game and can certainly be a lot of fun but it also has a lot of issues rangeing from bugs to just being blationly unbalnced. Dead by Daylight favors the survivers with perks like Sprint burst and Self care. There are far to many pallets in most maps. Survive with friends breaks the game in so many ways and not much is being done about most of the issues in the game. I do however view Dead by Daylight as a decent game but one with too many flaws to really recommend to anyone.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-13,0,0,82,False,Recommended,I have a love/hate relationship with this game. When it works it's probably one of the top multiplayer experiences I've ever encountered. When it doesn't it makes you want to kick your cat across the room.ProsAtmosphere Top notch horror feel. The maps are well designed and for the first 10 20 hours as a survivor you will feel that gut jump when you turn a corner and the killer is right there. Very well done with the graphics and music integrating into a tense and enjoyable experience.Variety of Builds the developers go to great lengths to keep things balanced as best they can (always a chore in competative multiplayer). Overall I think they've done a stellar job and a multitude of play styles can be achieved by switching up builds. There is of course always the meta but it doesn't mean other builds arent just as effective or viable.Killers The insane amount of killers available is fantastic. Each has a unique style and for the most part can be effective. Certain ones don't do well in the higher ranks (Freddy damn you) but the unique list and the ability to capture the iconic killers abilities is something that shows how much the developers care about their product.The Grind and Events the grind is real in this game. When you talk about unlocking abilities or even pushing toward prestige ranks for certain survivors/killers you will put in the time. Luckily BEhavior isnt overly stingy with double blood point events and such so it helps take away the pain a little.ConsMulitplayer this is a competative multiplayer game. If you've ever played one before you know the crowd it attracts. While for the most part the community has been fairly polite there are groups of mouthbreathing cesspool salt bodies who will take any loss/hook/kill/escape like you just dropped a huge dump on their bed and rubbed their moms face in it. From the rage quits stupid teabaggin because they happened to complete a simple evasion or the ultimate rage of a killer because he got flashlighted (which can be annoying...lol) the preschool like behavior will be on full display. Nothing pisses you off more as a killer then burning high quality add ons to have 2 people rage quit on their first downs. Balancing I just praised their balancing but sometimes its not all fanatastic. As in all multi games meta rules. Which means that some people will never deviate from it because their enjoyment is tied solely to their K/D ratio. Which means some cool and interesting build can be forgotten about to collect dust. It also means that there is almost zero variety once you get into the higher ranks. Everyone knows what they need to run by then and due to the cutthroat nature of the genre if they didn't they'd be hamstringing themselves. Alot of DLC Now I'm not gonna harp on the DLC so much in this game. For this genre I feel it fits really well and I have yet to see a crappy one from BEhavior. But it can be expensive for first time buyers. I paid $80 for the game and DLC (the clown had just released) when I got it and that was on sale. It can hit you in the pocketbook abit.Matchmaking System When I say mathcmaking I'm not talking about higher level players versus lower. The largest gap I've seen has been 3 4 rank levels. Which isnt alot. But the matchmaking system trying to balance survive with friends groups and lone players is kind of wonky. You could spend 10 minutes waiting for a match then 5 minutes later get an instant que. It's weird and hard to predict which can make those random 'I have half an hour to play' moments not even worth attempting.Survive with Friends This only really pertains to when you're the killer but dammit is it a pain in the The game is designed around the idea that the survivors can't talk to each other. Hence no in game voice chat. The addition of a 3rd party VOIP can at times really break the game. This is just one more thing that the developers try to account for in balancing but when you get a four man group of survivors all on discord together it's gonna be an uphill battle. Doesn't mean you can't win but the greatly increased tracking ability due to every survivor being able to relay your position to the others means you better be on your toes. It is hugely satisfying to smash these groups into the ground though. So I guess that can be a positive as well.Overall this is a great game if you like the whole 1v4 (Evolve) genre of game. I've had a good time with it and recommend it to anyone who enjoys competative multiplayer or LF4D and Dying Light's PvP modes.,Dead by Daylight

From great chases to sneaky tactics this game will bring it all when you step into your first trial. It offers a variety of killers with a variety of different clothes/perks/offerings and add ons to your gear. Where there is variety for the killers there is the same amount for the survivors. This game is great and if you play with friends it's even better. The only complaint I would give them is the peer to peer connection for games.

There are a lot of problems with this game but there are also a lot of really interesting aspects to it as well. I think for the base price of $20 the game is well worth the money. I'll go ahead and list some pros and cons to the game as a whole. Pros Interesting characters and plot (excluding The Shape of course).Procedurally generated environment.Decent Atmosphere.Devoted Developers. Addicting if you get into it at all. Relatively balanced gameplay.Overall draws a lot of good aspects from horror movies/games. Cons Lots of bugs.Horrible community for the most part.Exploits and Survivor Infinites.Facecamping Killers. Bad matchmaking system (host based).Survive With Friends.Isn t really that scary after a few hours (but it can get your heart racing at times).Not Immersive. I know I ve listed more cons to this game than I have pros but frankly for the price of the game it s still worth playing especially if you are a horror fan.

Though i stand by much of what I said in my previous review. We'll see if they fix the problemsThis game has an AMAZING concept and really needs to be better. I love the gameplay. When it works. WAY too many bugs. I will change my review and sing the games praises if the creators put more energy into fixing bugs. This game was NOT worth the price I paid for it considering how often it simply doesn't work. Buttons sometimes don't register. I've healed people who have already exited and survived. I've fallen through the floor of the map and died. COUNTLESS times I have been sitting waiting at the loading screen until I realize I need to force close the program. You have to make a new party when you want to change who the killer is. Only killer can be host. Garbage. Your core gameplay is really good and the game deserves to not be soffocated by having broken bells and whistles. Fix the game and I'll fix the review.,Dead by Daylight

The game does have flaws for sure. It's not great to look at and the servers are not always super reliable. A lot of killers will camp which is incredibly frustrating.

2018-07-23,0,0,646,False,Recommended,"Game is fun and interesting for both killers and survivors. However at even a mediocore levels Ranks 15+ the game is HORRIBLY UNBLANCED IN THE SURVIOVERS FAVOR. The ""Killer"" is useless against even 1 2 good players constatnt body blocking and constant flashlights and other perks makes the killers job of even killing 1 person a night mare and is extreamly unfun. This forces killers to ""Camp"" a hooked survivor just so they get a kill to start the game. This is boreing in my opinion and dosent make the game stable from a balanced perspective. This game is on pair with League of Legends toxic community. The developers need to take a serious look at their game before i plan to invest in it any more. The game should not be balanced around rank 20 scrubs like it is when people just start out. BUFF THE KILLERS SO THEY CAND DO THEIR JOBS AND KILL SURVIVORS.",Dead by Daylight
2018-10-25,0,0,513,False,Recommended,"Well. This game has provided me with the most fun I've had in recent years. The gameplay was unique and it was a fresh look for a video game at the time and it pretty much is still the only game of this type that isn't a garbage chinese remake.Other than that ever since the clowns release up until now the game has gone to complete for survivors. don't get me wrong they were ruining things before the clown was released but it was a more subtle destruction as opposed to just throwing malotovs piles of c4 like they're doing now. As of right now survivors are getting nerfed into the ground with every patch. I'm not getting into specifics about the patches. you can google ""dead by daylight patch notes"" and find them easily. typing out specific patch note changes will just upset me further.Basically the developers don't know how to balance the game even when the people who've played this game for 1k 5k hours tell them how to do it they think differently always. It was literally within the last month the DEVS of this game stated on a live stream that they were ""going to start taking player feedback more seriously and start considering it for implementations in game."" i don't remember the exact quote but that's insane. you should be listening to the community the entire time. there has also been a situation on live stream where the head honcho of the whole shabang (Matthieu Cote') told all of the live viewers if they weren't happy with the game that we should go play something else. He said that on live stream. He mentioned to go play civilation 6 specifically. another team member looked at him as if he were insane. THEN you can hear HIS BOSS tell him HE CANT say that on live stream. This man still runs the game to this day. He has not been fired. HOW?!The dev's also don't play their own game very often and when they do they are pure garbage at it honestly. Another reason they don't know how to balance this game properly. With that in mind let's go back to balancing. They balance this game for new players. They release things and people complain they're op (in all actuality they're not but these noobs think they are because they don't know to play) then they nerf it into oblivion. Now that newly introduced ""whatever it was"" that just came into the game be it a new killer perk etc is now no longer fun at all to use or play against because babies got it nerfed into the ground.They also keep buffing killers because they all cry because they cant kill survivors fast enough. they're mad ethe generators get done before they can kill everyone. Now instead of the devs reworking generator timings mechanics etc they instead release perks that give aura reading abilities to killers insta downs buffing low tier perks to make them insta down like their top tier version they create perks that destroy the ability to heal yourself. they nerf the time it takes to heal in general by 12 16 seconds. they introduce perks to block off windows they introducs perks to make healing slower they buff a perk that now gives an effect that makes your healing speed reduced by half. etcThe problem with the game balance is this and many veterans have said it. it's the time it takes to do generators. did the devs listen and try to balance it? ONE TIME! they added like 10 seconds in total to how long it takes to complete a generator. well that didnt work of course it didnt. its 4 survivors vs 1 killer. 10 seconds isnt alot if you spread it out to 4 people especially if they work on a generator together. Did the devs try tweaking/reworking the MAIN OBJECTIVE of the game after that? no. they gave up and said adding time to the gens didnt work. basically they said they suck and theyre too dumb to fix the issue. you know all those perks etc i mentioned in the paragraph above? thats what they started doing after their generator fix failed. and oh my god that paragraph up there is nowhere near all of the bandaids theyve attempted to put on. Bugs/Glitches galoreNo dedicated server and the killer is the host. automatic advantage to the killer whenever he wants.The dev's wont FIX anything and keep applying fake bandaids to problems that aren't even the problem instead of fixing the main one which is generator completion timing.On top of not fixing things nerfing into the ground and overall ruining everyones fun do you know what they're doing?They're releasing new cosmetics multiple times a month. guess how much a whole outfit USUALLY costs unless its a recolor. it costs 10usd for 1 outfit. a head piece shirt and pants. or head pants and weapon if you're a killer.Keep that last one in mind the most before you buy this game. These trash developers would rather release cosmetics than provide dedicated servers and fix bugs that've been complained about for years. They don't listen to the experienced players and they cater to the noobs. I'm pretty sure the veterans were the ones who stuck around from the beginning and gave you that money you earned in order to continue your development of the game.....but ok.I haven't just uninstalled this game I've completely removed it from my account. this game and it's developers.",Dead by Daylight

They're too busy adding dlcs and banning random people for little to no reason that all these new exploits are being used. I have atleast 5 exploits to get me into a place the killer can't hit me in. I can't believe this game is still alive and I wish it died because nothing new is being added like the devs said a year ago! It sucks being apart of this game for so long and having so much fun to see it become so bad. The community is so much worse because of how many things are being added that are just disgusting. I can bully most of the killers I play against and who cares. I'm extremely toxic and no ban for me but with the big streamers they get banned for nothing. This game is terrible now.

2016-12-12,0,0,4,False,Recommended,This game is like whack a mole except you use only the power of your mind. It's simple but only a true master of the mystic arts can win. You choose a Killer make a lobby and then humans (the moles) appear around a camp fire. The aim of the game is to make them disappear by whacking them back into the floor. You have no buttons to press and no mallet but if you concentrate really hard you can make the humans vanish back into the ground with nothing but pure focused willpower. If you can make all the humans vanish you win. I'm not sure what you win yet but I guess it's awesome. On the other hand if you get fed up of whacking the same moles over and over you can leave the lobby but if you do that means you suck and are a loser. 10/10 Best mind controlled game ever.,Dead by Daylight

Recommend this! 9/10!Basic Minors It's missing party system so the server/lobby system is horrible people want to play with their friends. You can but it's real hard to get matched with your buddy. Points needs to be calibrated for both survivors and killers. Fixing generators takes way to long to fix for the map size. Needs better hiding in grass/environment. Survivors need something more to get away from the killer. Want more characters/killers/customizationPositive +++So fun to play!!

2016-06-16,0,0,175,False,Recommended,Great game so far. Overall the concept is great. The feeling of being in a Friday the 13th esque game will make this a must for when anyone busts out their horror movie and game binge in October. The tutorials covered very basic subjects about the game and seemed to have missed an opportunity to explain the strategy required for higher levels in the bloodweb. Although it has a manual that links you to a more informative webpage it seems a more thorough coverage of all the mechanics in the game with well flushed vids.The lobby still needs tweaking due to all the players that drop and cause the lobby to break. It has been known to just sit in a lobby and have people pop in and out over a 10 15min wait. Not sure if this is due to very impatient people or unstable server connections.Not sure how I feel about the bloodpoint mechanics yet. Some games there is a real challenge between teams and you can score a good chunk of change sometimes roughly evenly for everyone. In some other games I would be able to catch 2 3 players and hook them within 2 5 mins of the game play cat and mouse with the 3rd or last man just to have them camp the hatch and end up with a lemons worth of points while the last survivor leaves loaded.I really like the character progression and ranking system so much so that it was rough to continue playing in the beta due to the lvl 6 cap. Which tells me that even if i were to reach an amazing rank i would not see the benefit so much if this resets every month. At that point you would really need other friends to play this to continue on. I feel that this is the problem with the 4v1 game genre as no one dev team that i know of really apply a solo campaign. Its nice that they left some lore on their webpage and in bits and pieces throughout the bloodweb but where is the emersion in that? Seems to be the games greatest strength &amp weakness.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-26,0,0,218,False,Recommended,Please see edits below the video(s) for my latest opinion on the direction of the game. The following is my opinions Just after update 2.0 (Clown killer) was released.Killer rank 20 10 Easy and fun games except for the occasional survive with friend toxic group.Killer rank 10 1 Incredibly stressful and nervewracking games *when played against competent survivors. If i grinded enough i could make it to rank 1 but that would be very unfun and would be very stressful.(Ended up doing that stockpiled lots of good addons to make my games a lil easier) that I play video games to have fun this one is fun for the first 10 ranks but as you keep playing and playing (until the monthly rank reset) you'll move past 10 and be very sweaty after every game.If someone plays games competitively This game is still not fun for you. Horribly favors survivors in 97% of any possible scenario when survivors know what they are doing and that's not even with Survive with friends Playing with your friends over discord gives you a massive advantage. Even with no perks.Marth88 a godlike player at this game has done 300 matches under 3 different scenarios and guess what in every single one Killer's are ing dominated. Go on watch these games and tell me killer is balanced.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v CEB9Rh6AtbI&amp list PLoJokCjX7gozpIVDM1qjmXSC7M1SXSP3C (No perks but voice chat. Killers won 12 out of 100 matches.)https //www.youtube.com/watch?v QeWJcSWe _0&amp list PLoJokCjX7goxDLKGgKtbSAz81yIpy9Vr4 (Best perks but no voice chat. Killers won 5 out of 100 matches.)https //www.youtube.com/watch?v F6Nb66nPbMY&amp list PLoJokCjX7goy1osh2j5jW2bepe1iZAxBU (Best perks and voice chat. Killers won 2 out of 100 matches.)Just find another competitive game to dump your spare time into.EDIT 07/24/18 New mid chapter patch is bringing better balance nerfing survivors and buffing some of the killers but survivor mains are review bombing this game with negative reviews because they dont want to learn to play differently from their established meta unlike killers when they constantly get nerfed or reworked. Entitled little want a free escape every game unlike me when i play as killer i dont mind if all 4 people escape i just want the game to be fun and there to not be any toxicity.EDIT 10/05/18 The latest patch and soon to be new mid balance patch are finally giving killers the breathing space they needed. Fast vaults nerfed small reduction in hook time survivors take more time to heal balanced out by having their recovery bar cap at 95% instead of 85% to make slugging harder. The game is going in a great direction now. This game will be actually perfect once they nerf Decisive strike as well as give killers bonus rewards for facing Survive with friends IMO playing against SWF should not consume your killer addons if you are facing 3 or more survivors grouped up in Survive with friends. After all they get to bring their best items and competent survive with friends players like marth and his depip squad shown above and by surviving get to keep their items. Killers never keep theirs so with this idea killers can actually stack their own addons against the survivors items without having to grind another bloodweb to get more addons for their killer.,Dead by Daylight
2017-05-18,0,0,424,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a 4 v 1 game in which a Killer has to hunt down and kill 4 Survivors roaming the randomly picked Map. The Survivors have to activate 5 Generators to open the Exit Gates and escape while the Killer has to kill them all by hitting them picking them up and hanging them on meat hooks where they slowly get consumed by an Entity. They can be saved from this state will however die automatically if hooked 3 times. Dead by Daylight focuses on teamwork on the Survivor side and individual skill on the Killer side. It is alot more fun played together. Can however make you rage more than Super Meat Boy and Flappy Bird combined.Pros Horror Multiplayer Game Steep but satisfying learning curve skill based rarely Luck better together or play alone as the Killer Very Satisfying wins Winning is based on Points earned in 4 Categories you don't have to do everything and can specialize in some Both sides can win in the same match if both earn enough points Close to no Hackers Variety in Character Play Not Pay2Win the DLCs are not necessary to play well or have fun ""meta"" leans towards Free CharactersCons Incredibly Toxic Community that cries 24/7 Slow development Sometimes Buggy Sometimes laggy Incredibly Punishing if bad team or badly played7 Killers (3 DLC) 9 Survivors (3 DLC) (DLCs include 1 Killer and 1 Survivor so there are only 3 Character DLCs) 18 Maps.

2016-08-18,0,0,989,False,Recommended,I do recommend this game I enjoy playing it. The goal of the game depends on the role you take killer or survivor. I have chosen to dedicate most of my time into the survivors because to level them up you must put bloodpoints into their bloodweb. So yes this game does not save the same data on all the charaters . This makes even more time to put countless hours into playing the game. The objective of the game if you are survivor is to escape as for killer it is to make sure the four survivors don't make it out alive. You will turn on generators search chests help each other and unlock many perks and items. Now it is up to you to figure out how to play well how to gather new items and most importantly not get hooked. No matter how many people complain about bugs I know the developers are trying to fix them and we just have to be patient. So many reviews say this game has too many bugs and it may have quite a few but it is not like the devs aren't trying to fix them while trying to do at least five other things. The devs are only getting better at patching it and making DLC and what not. Sure they don't get it right every time with each update but I've seen progess beyond belief.,Dead by Daylight

As a survivor you need to team up with the other three survivors and fix five generators and then escape and even be careful so the killer doesn t attack you and hang you on the hook.As a killer you basically just obstruct the survivors from fixing the generators and escape.The graphics is good and even well optimized.,Dead by Daylight

Who doesn't love taunting the guy who just spent the last 10 minutes trying to kill you and failing?

2016-08-12,0,0,487,False,Recommended,I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time. A horror game that you can play with friends. The killers are cool the survivors are well designed. The sounds cues and sountrack is great. The game has (right now anyway) kind of hidden lore but the stuff shown is quite interesting. The gameplay as a survivour is fun and intense as hell (If you don't get camped or cheese.) And playing as the killer really makes you bring out your hunter side. (Unless someone just cheeses infinites.) But personally I love this game then again I'm a sucker for horror. The game right now is very early on and the developers have talked about much more content being released including killers survivours and maps. Also the perks really surprised me. The survivours and killers all have their own unique perks you can use in game and you get xp (bloodpoints) to spend on perks and items. I enjoy this game a lot a recommend it to people who love quick thrils in the horror genre.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-12,0,0,134,False,Recommended,A fantastic breath of life in the asymmetrical PvP genre. Both sides of the fight are enjoyable in their own right be it hunting the survivors or hiding from the killer. The developers have shown to really care about the product and have been publishing multiple patches to fix glaring issues with gameplay with greater changes on the horizon. Higher rank play gets a little dicey with players using unsportsman like strategies to win. All things considered it's best to go in with the mindset to have fun and not care about your match making rank.,Dead by Daylight

Unfortunatly having 3 kids at home allowing to play this game only at night in headphones with lights turned off...but this is the beauty of such games.Possitive definatelly emotions. It's realistic feel of danger and reliefe of successful escape. gameplay is very simple to understand. I would even recoment to play first one without watching tutorials. It gives you even more dramatic feeling of frustration...Negative difficuly to find players even while free weekend (a lot of other ppl should have been joined). as a result of the first 'issue' it even more difficult to play as a hunter.Anyway game worth it's money.

2016-07-01,0,0,1012,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. This game is supposed to be ""hide and seek with killers"" But the problem is that they don't have any proper game mechanics to make the game that way. If you want meta perk builds you have this game. The ranking in the game means nothing..It's just a number as of now. The devs cater towards the killers rather than the survivors. The survivors feel more like a useless paper weight than anything else. The kids over at Friday the 13th's the game Crystal Lake feel more like actual people than these emotionless piles of rendered garbage they call ""survivors"". Even Bill from left 4 Dead looks worse now than what he did back in the original left 4 dead game. How do you mess that up? You are using the unreal engine one of the greatest enegines to make visually stunning games on But I digress. I don't like rating a game based on visuals alone but however... For this game I will have to rate it on visuals. They said (the devs) that they wanted to make the enviroments as ""spooky/ scary"" as possible. The visuals do not help with that at all.. If the game looked better and had better textures that would definitly help sell that even more. A good comparison to look at is the trailers for this game. The actual trailers look better than the actual product itself. Some of the trailers are actually scarier than the actual game! But that's not the only reason to not ""like"" this game. On another note let's talk about the developers They have changed a lot since when I first started playing which was the day of release. It appears the devs at this current point in time only care about filling up their pockets with cash and the once buring passion they once had is now gone. They only seem to care about adding movie killers that already have their own lore and everything I can understand where they are coming from about this Dead By Daylight + getting a movie killer profit/ new customers. I can understand that. But devs.. There are starting to litter up the game. The killers and survivors you guys put out are very unique in their own different ways. And that's what makes them special. When I want to think about Dead By Daylight I would want people to think about The Trapper. Not ""that Michael Myers game"" and so on. I once gave this game a very positive review I really did. But in the current state of the game you wil get frustrated at a lot of things. And if you don't take my word on it Buy the game for youself and try it. I'm currently in a love hate relationship with this game and I really hope it really does improve for the better. But as of now I can not recommend this game as much as I hate to say it.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,72,False,Recommended,"For this game I recommend drinking a 2016 Trader Joe's Charles Shaw Chardonnay. The Charles Shaw boasts organically grown grapes or something. To be honest I wasn't really paying attention to the back of the label while I was using that McDonald's toilet. This ""organically grown"" stuff tastes as about as complex as a wet dish clothe and as natural as synethic motor oil. As such it will contrast and compliment the complexity of this game.It's weird. Such a simple premise. People being hunted by killers in a closed map. The victims need to repair generators or invest in bitcoin in order to escape. The killers have to capture and hook the victims. But then you have all these witchcraft offerings and whatnot being given to some guy or god or whoever possibly Santa. These offerings will hopefully help the offerer. I know that if i was a guy or a god or a Santa I'd want cookies and/or cake for my offerings.What was more painful than being skewered on a hook was having all of my favourite perks nerfed. It's like they want the killers to win or something. It won't seem so bad but its a real seesaw of opponents. You'll face the same pro three times in a row and then meet some noob who will tank harder than the bitcoin the victims invested in.Lastly I must say that I've never liked a game which will bring out a hundred different DLCs. DLC prices should have a cap of something like $2 across all games.In conclusion I'd like to say that its important to stay hydrated.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-20,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,"The idea of this game is awesome but god damn does is this game garbage. The ONLY way you can have fun playing this game is to either play a custom game with friends or play as a killer. Playing as a survivor is basically the worst unless the killer is terrible. Most of the time you are grouped with a high ranked killer with OP perks. Making you usless. I tried playing it for multiple hours but after having to wait about 10 20 minutes waiting for a game to start which has been a problem from the beggining then starting a game right next to the killer then having him camp until I die it makes this game frustrating and unplayable. I dont want to have to wait so long for a game for it to finish in 5 minutes! I understand people may say ""Get gud"" but if you're playing againt Micheal Myers who is COMPLETELY broken then you're basically screwed. I just wish they did something about the camping wait times survivor weakness and just overall gameplay. I reccomend you play this game for 2 hours then getting a refund",Dead by Daylight
2016-11-21,0,0,703,False,Recommended,All in all the game concept is pretty fun. Deliver a good hunt as a killer or (don't) risk your life for your friends or strangers as a survivor. A skilled killer combined with good teamwork among the survivors can create a very tense game that makes you smash that spectate button immediately after dying cheering for your mates.Unfortunately the game experience can be ruined e.g. by camping killers which take away the challenge of getting out alive as a survivor if you or a team mate get camped hard there is not much you can do except for rushing through the game. This spoils the tension of sneaky hiding (that moment when the killer walks right past you...) as well as escaping the killer or rescuing your hooked / downed teammates.The devs are more and more adressing greater issues like matchmaking. Unlike in the past waiting times in order to find a game are not much of a problem by now as well as imbalances in the matched players' ranks. On the other hand some bugs are merely replaced by new ones. I'm loving the new content but in some cases I would also like previously released content to be extended before delivering new one. For example further DLC map variations There is only one asylum and Haddonfield map whereas other locations offer more variations.Overall the DBD team is working on giving us a better game experience so I recommend getting the game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-26,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a fun game. However it runs TERRIBLY. The graphics themselves are pretty decent but definently not something my computer shouldn't be able to run on the lowest setting. I know it says 8gb ram and a whole bunch of other specs my computer doesn't have but I can still play the game (as a survivor) with a small amount of lag setting my resolution to render to 0% my resolution to 800x600 and playing on low (obviously.) If they do ever fix the lag and make it playable without having to do a bunch of extra things I will change over. However since this basically stops people from playing it deserves a no. It's also worth noting people with higher specs also have issues playing so that's something devs really need to work on.,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-21,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,Great game love it so much a lot of fun. But I'm done there are too many bot killers that people are using to power level which means that the multiplayer is super unballanced because you have poeple cheating to higher levels and perks. The last six rounds I did were all bot killer games so I'm done if there is a way to report poeple for this I couldn't recomend this anymore but at the moment you are more than likely going to be in matches with poeple who power leveled. Also either the match making is ed to begin with or them doing that has ed the match making I picked this up a few weeks ago and have been in one to two matches with other poeple with only one perk every one else has four.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,37,False,Recommended,"I still highly recommend this game but when devs are banning killers from camping hooks and the entire matchmaking mechanic of the game is a little screwy It makes me want to...not recommend this game. I get it that killers literally sitting at a hook watching a player as he dies is a little annoying but that should most definately not be a bannable offense. It makes no sense at all. I'm currently studying to be a game designer and I have played this game since there were glitches with players floating around the map and I have loved the entire concept of this game. The machanics work smoothly and it's a fun and sometimes scary game to play with your friends. But forcing players to play your game the way you want them to is breaking almost every ""rule"" (I use this term lightly) about making a game. You should allow the players to play a game however they want. If they camp a hook then the rest of the survivors can easily get the rest of the generators back on before the first person even dies. If a player wants to camp a hook let them they're just hurting themselves but they are still playing how they want to play. The next problem I have with the game is the matchmaking mechanic. I've notice a lot after playing time and time again that even when I am ranked 20 I still get matched up with rank 1 killers. That doesn't make sense to me. Yes it would be hard to differentiate between players who are skilled that just want to stay at low ranks to get blood points but there must be other ways to fix this other than allowing rank 1 killers to demolish rank 20 survivors. Once again I really love this game and want it to succeed to the point of reffering everyone I know to get the game and let me kill them! But it's getting hard with some of the aspects of the game that could be deal breakers for some of my friends.",Dead by Daylight

Playing alone as a survivor is okay but doesnt show the game's full potential of fun compared to surviving with friends. Playing as killer which if you're playing online you're forced to play alone is somewhat fun. It really depends on what kind of game you want. If you're into objective based hide and seek play survivor. If you enjoy hunting down people and keeping them in a jail type system play killer. Just don't face camp ),Dead by Daylight

Constantly updated and the devs have come a long way in communication and game balancing new characters are being added fairly regularly and each one brings new life to the game even if you've played for hundreds of hours. Each killer is unique and original whose abilities are creative and force different tactics for the survivers. The survivors are one of my major problems with the game as each survivor is nothing but a reskin and a set of teachables. Their gameplay however is just as fun as the killers. It captures the essense of survival most of the time however there are occasionally higher level players who will understand the game enough to run you around for about 5 hours. As the game progresses though it continually becomes more and more balanced and fun to play.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-19,0,0,24,False,Recommended,"I played this game when it was free around half a year ago. It had potential and was a lot of fun but there were many issues I had with it that I couldn't ignore. I kept it on my list of games to keep an eye on and I'm quite thankful I did.The game is super fun to play and it creates that fast ending yet strong bond between the other survivors and yourself. The framerate has improved quite a bit since last time I played and overall the movement feels smoother.I wish they could make a different way to explain the inventory system instead of the current ""tutorial"".I will definitely play this game a lot more in the future as a quick refresher since playing the same type of game can get quite exhausting.I do have some minor complaints though. The character models feel very strange I guess it's because they're all supposed teens? Some pants and head features look kinda gross Bills beard has a weird see through effect there's not as much character customization as I'd hope and overall these characters look off.This doesn't affect gameplay at all though so no worries. Everybody just feels a bit skeleton esque.I hope to see further improvements in the future this game still has a lot of untapped potential.",Dead by Daylight

2017-08-19,0,0,70,False,Recommended,LAST UPDATE I ing love to hate this game. It is beyong aggravating however victory is soooo sweet! It takes about 10 15 levels before you start performing better due to perks items and addons. The game is not very intuitive so it takes a lot of failure to become successful. After 14 hours I am now winning more than losing but I still have some rough runs. The community in this game is dope and if you have friends who play I would highly recommend utilizing discord. My only gripe now is that the Doctor is OP as . Doesn't change how awesome this game is!1st Update After another 4 hours of game play I'm still extremely frustrated with this game. The art is amazing the controls are okay but there is no balance whatsoever. In a coop game like this that has to be the most important thing. Right now the survivors seem to have a major edge. To name just a few major issues 1) NO ING CHAT IN A COOPERATIVE GAME. You will play against people who are on discord and can coordinate better. This is giving a major boost to those who have friends who play this. I have a couple folks who play and we demolish everytime because of this.2) As a monster when you hit a survior they get boosted away from you AND you have about a 3 second delay where you savor the attack. It needs to be one or the other not both. This gives the survivors way too much of a chance to get away.3) Excape attempts from hooks only provide a 4% success rate. This should be around 10 15% considering it speeds up the process of the entity hooking you.***If you are going to play I would suggest going to the help/tutorial section. The game should start with the tutorial but they just throw you into it making it a bit frustrating at first.***1st POST Meh... there is no balance. My first run I started up 3 generators and escaped with little trouble. The next 2 rounds I died within 2 minutes of start. I was hoping for a horror game like this but with more of a challenge on both ends and no stacking against one or the other. As it stands now I'm not liking the game. Visually it is dope. The mechanics are not to my liking. You get out run by the monsters it isn't hard for them to search for you like the hints say and the meter to struggle out of their grasps is insanely long. Needs more work. I might revisit. As of now I paid $20 and feel like I wasted $15 of it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-16,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight embodies what it truly means to 'survive the nightmare'. A highly addictive multiplayer game makes this a great entry to any horror gamer's library. But please be aware that is all this game is multiplayer. Characters are fleshed out a little in their backstories you can read however there is no single player plot.Instead the aim of the game is to simply a) escape the killing ground as a survivor by powering up generators to open the gates or b) as the killer put the survivors in the dying state and then 'hook' them onto sacrificial meat hooks for the entity. Every character has their own perks that you can choose along with individual items which will enhance your character. While the objectives sound simple every game changes based on the random teammates you have player experience level as that killer items attached/perks active etc. etc. While I recommend this game this game is not for the faint of heart or anyone squeamish towards blood. It will leave you chilled at times after seeing fellow survivors sacrificed or the killer hunting relentlessly for you. Both being the killer and survivor offer their own unique expereince that encourages high replay value of this title to perfect your approach with each character. The variety of characters environments and varying conditions for each game are simply amazing. Hunt on my friends and watch out the entity knows you're here.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-05,0,0,107,False,Recommended,Ok I now have almost 100 hours in this game and feel like this is a good time to give my review. Firstly this game is great fun with friends. If you have 4 friends or less then you can play Kill with your friends and take it in turn being killer which is very fun. The survive with friends option is also great fun but only when it works! Half the time it takes over 5 min to find a game or when you do find a game the game might kick you out of the lobby anyway. It is also bad that if the killer disconnects straight away and you escape then you never get enough blood points and will actually derank from escaping which makes no sense and should not be possible.

2017-11-22,0,0,871,False,Recommended,Horror in games (and films) is too often characterised by jump scares shocking startling events designed to trigger a fight or flight response. Dead by Daylight to its credit eschews these in favour of real horror a gradual increase in tension resulting from the unshakeable sense of impending doom. That it manages to do this in an asymmetrical competitive action game is what is truly impressive about it.Dead by Daylight features two teams four survivors and one killer and pits them against one another in a battle for all the marbles The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods. The odds are skewed heavily in favour of the invincible killer and as a result playing Dead by Daylight as a survivor can be a nerve rattling sweat inducing terrifying experience.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-19,0,0,15,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. I really like the concept of this game but I still want to believe that this game should be early acces somehow. It feels really beta and somewhat unfinished even though that doesn't mean they're not working on this game. There is always new updates and thank god they're free I like to see when the devs are working on their games. In my oppinion this game is fun and if you're a horror freak like me I recommend this game. There is a competitive side of this game I do not like the ranking system but hey that's just a minor complaint. Besides all that I have one big issue with the game that actually makes me feel annoyed. Which is the ""failed to join lobby."" message you get eachtime you want to play as survivor. I have been sitting here so long till I finally can join a lobby most of the time I just play as a killer because of this.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-28,0,0,154,False,Recommended,This game is pretty fun and has a really cool premise. However there are multiple things that make it unoptimized. For starters if you're brand new you may still go up against either a Killer or Survivors that should be &lt 10 in level. The 'season refreshes' make this even worse a lot of the times. Once things are done to make sense like changing unhook/disarm from the same button this game could be great.

Anyone crying about balance issues and only caring about leveling up miss the entire point of the experience in this game I feel.When you are the killer sure it's about killing the survivors and ranking up but is it entirely? I personally find joy in others joy and that means creating a real life experience of terror! If at the end of the game they are saying wow that was terrifying then I feel it was a win even if I lost and didn't level up. The devs want you to give the survivors a thrilling experience! that's why it's setup the way it is for leveling the killer. If you are even on the fence about this game............JUST BUY NOW!

2017-03-19,0,0,259,False,Recommended,"This is an amazing game concept that I would love to see more co op horror games incorporate. Even though right now there are a lot of bugs (yes there are more than a handful) this game is honestly one of the most addictive games I've run across in a long while. There's a decent amount of content that gets added onto every few months so the devs haven't completely abandoned their players (though they could use a boot to get them to fix the Survive with Friends queue).Now as someone who's put a decent number of hours into this game I will say that the community is very hit or miss. People get super salty over the little things and that leads to poor gameplay for everyone. If you cannot handle other people making mistakes then this game is not for you. If you have the tendency to rage quit or will turn on your team (if you're a survivor) this game is not for you. This game is filled to the brim with trolls and derps alike so either you suck it up buttercup or you should go find a game where you can release your anger elsewhere. I've noticed that most people in this community go with the general rule of ""don't be a d*ck"" and it works really well. )For survivors it is your goal to work together (&lt that's the magic word here) to get the f*ck out of the match. Each survivor has their own set of unique perks that make each one worth leveling them to make the ultimate perk build. Many builds can be created to benefit yourself or others (or a mix of both). Communication before the match is key to good team work but most people simply go into the match planning to do their own thing. All in all try to do your best and help your team as best you can because that's all anyone really asks for.For killers you gotta be on your toes. I've just recently started playing killer and now I understand why killers do some of the things they do (except camping and slugging 'cause it's pointless and no fun at all). Killer gameplay is fastpaced and because of each of the different killers' abilities each one plays completely different than the next. Each killer also has their own set of perks that are beneficial to other killers so try to max them out and figure out what works best for you.TLDR The game is great even with its bugs and glitches but that's to be expected of a game that's still moderately a work in progress. Each survivor and killer are unique and there's plenty of fun to be had either way.May the Entity favor you in the Fog !",Dead by Daylight

After finishing the current game I would see previous game results.Also there needs to be some balancing for both killers and survivorsWraith is fine.Hillbilly I feel like he should have a limited distance when traveling with his chainsaw because his mobility is way better than Wraith which is why I probably encounter Billy more than Wraith.Nurse is fine. Extremely hard to deal with especially if it's a good killer.Michael Idk but he's just pretty damn strong atmTrapper he shouldn't be allowed to cancel his traps and fake out.Game does have some pros and consPros Survive with friends fast leveling (recently added) fun grinding game variety of killers and survivors.Cons Camping glitches killer hosting internet a good amount of useless perks.Honestly I'm very neutral on this game but I recommend it because it's a unique game that everyone should give a try and if they don't like refund it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-25,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun and interesting but playing as a survivor just isn't rewarding at all. like everything is against you even the devs of the game don't like you. they try so much to make the killers experience enjoyable that they just forgot about the survivors and said you s for wanting to play our game. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future they decide to remove survive with friends because the killers are always complaining about how its unfair.The killers have auto aim and host advantage plus most of them are from the asian region so everyone ends up having a bad time because some asian wants to be a and ruin the fun for everyone with their ping and you can't even avoid them at all because you aren't allowed to see who the killer is in the lobby unless you do some steam glitch. they say the game is out of beta but this game is buggy and yeah most of them are fixed but they don't seem to care much about the killer's bugs. For some reason looks like it came from a ps2. sometimes its blurry for no reason and the maps sometimes doesn't even load in. I remember when they said they fixed a problem where there were killers who were bots to boost survivors but the first game i played after that I found a bot and in the forum a dev was actually in there scolding the survivors for not leaving the boosted lobbies whenver we had no choice since we would lose all of our items and get punished for it.I would not recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game. Please save your money this is just another game where the devs add in cosmetics and dlc rather than actually making the game enjoyable and fun for everyone.,Dead by Daylight

I find it to be more exhilirating to be the survivor more than the killer. I find it extremely difficult to be the latter. The dev must've nerfed it a tad too much. I would like the attack range to be a little more than what it is now.I also find the connection to be a major issue. I keep getting kicked out of the lobby characters would lag in gameplay and sometimes they aren't anybody to play with. Kindly get the server up and running please.Dead By Daylight is definitely in my Top Games of 2016 list. Great job dev team!,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-08,0,0,101,False,Recommended,"I already love this game. Playing for survivors is kinda dull and easy at least on lower ranks (20 15) probably because they were buffed recently as other review say. But killers is a whole other story.You try it once and see four little ****twits teabagging you teasing waiting at the gate or near the hatch like ""I'm here but you ain't gonna do **** about it"". You play a few more games and slowly start to sympathise with the killers. And then you get gud and start winning. Ah the satisfaction of smacking a teabagging scumbag and putting him on a hook. The glory of getting a third sacrifice thanks to ""No one escapes death"" when they thought they already won and were taunting you. This is the greatest feeling I've ever had in a game. Mind me the killers are the good guys cleaning this world of filthy trolls and making them suffer while at it.

I have hard time writing this because I really wanted to like this game / I wasn't hyped or anything just liked the idea.I have played during the free weekned and couldn't join any lobby for about 30 minutes.

Playing alone as a surviver is an excercise in frustration. No in game communication (is proximity chat so hard to implement?) most of the time you feel like playing alone and it is hard to find someone who actually wants to team play and not only care about his score...Graphics are nice to look but could use some work to help set the atmosphere.

2016-08-29,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,When playing with friends this game is cool challenging and awarding.As a surviver I'm always on edge. When escaped or saved I can get a good feeling of acomplishment.However.The match making system was less than random. It's functional but thats it. You are counting on your luck even before the game can start.The killers are nearly breaking the game except the nurse. Especially the traper he's too OP and can use two trap to nearly glitch a surviver to an infinte trap marathon in order to gain a huge amount of blood points. When you are the one getting marathon ed it's beyond annoying and agonizing.Overall 6 out of 10. Slightly above average it's fun it's kinda new thrilling with too many problems at current state. Patching speed is not satisfying to say at least.I do not recommend it now. When it's patched properly I will update this review and gladly recommend it.I'm updating this review.Sadly the match making is still barely functional. I got matched to 3 rank 1 survivor when rank 20 and level 1 as the killer May I ask how I'm going to deal with them?There's something else that I found in this game...CheatersThey are smart actually they just twitch the speed to slightly faster than the killer that you almost got them but can't. Even when I catch them(with luck) I put them down they still make the boom sound and they can move instantly.Please do something about it.Update agian.Ok guys Michael Myers. Halloween trademark killer. I'm stunned he looks and plays nearly just like the movie. I lost words here I've been waiting for him to be in a game for an eternity. Well done indeed.Well...He's...really really OP. Seriously too powerful.Why nerf the already most balanced killer the nurse? Weird decision.Survivors are having more hard times its getting really difficult to escape.Haddonfield map was welcomed but a little small and too crowded.BUT I think they patched the damn match making system FINALLY.This game is still unbalanced but now I can recommend it. At least on sale and with Michael Myers. I mean c'mon play as Michael Myers and Laurei Strode. C'mon.Have to make another update.My killer rank is 11 now.Wow the cheaters. Every two or three matches I can encounter two to three speed hacks each match. Some of them were actually pretty high ranked. I've played against high rank survivors thery are good and I can feel it. It's the strategy they use and they can hide under your nose pretty quickly.Speed hackers are mostly trolls. They diliberately stop to wait for you to catch on and start running with the speed of burst instantly. They mostly run in a straight line but trust me you can't get them. Not with play with your food. This is aggravating. I believe every killer will have this kind of problems sooner or later.So keep this in mind.Update.No good enough bug fix and I'm getting punished by decent strategy. This game is encouraging douchey play and dirty tactics now you'll need a mind set that don't care about win or lose to play a competetive game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-07,0,0,429,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. This is a survival horror game. You can play as survivors or as the killer (4 vs. 1).Survivors Find generators and fix them (there will be a ""skill check"" mini game where you have to press the space bar in the allowed section) Failing skill checks will alert the killer of which generator is being tampered Hide in lockers behind objects in tall grass pull down pallets (can vault over pallets that are already pulled down) Have perks (like in Call of Duty) to help you run away or give you skills to alert you of the killer Save your pals if they are being carried to or on a hook already Find and open exits after required number of generators are powered up (usually 1 more than the number of survivors. Example 3 survivors v 1 killer 4 Generator's required) Hear music when killer is near (unless killer is the invisible Wraith in that case you will hear bells) Third person view (which makes it considerably easier) Save your buddies if they are hooked Very small chance of unhooking yourself if your buddies can't save you (you'll bleed out faster each failed attempt to escape the hook) Find tools/items to help your escape Escape the killer's grasp if he has not hooked you before you can wiggle out Can heal their injured friends so they stop moaning in pain and leaving a blood trailKiller Find survivors carry them and hang them on hooks to sacrifice them to kill them Has the locations of all generators Has perks aswell Will be alerted if survivor fails skill checks Can see a ""trail of scratches"" of recent survivors who were running (can still be difficult to follow mind you) Ghost dude who can turn invisible trap dude who can set traps in certain locations and chainsaw dude who gets a speed and attack boost when he uses the chainsaw Can destory or go around pulled down pallets First person view (you could walk past a survivor who's hiding behind a tree and not notice it) Attacks have a long cooldown and heavily slows the killer Survivors makes noise and bleed if they are injured Will out run survivors if they don't use their surroundings Can hit hooked survivors to hear their cries if killer is a sadist (doesn't really do anything ingame but it's kinda funny) Can be blinded and drop a survivor if another survivor shines a flashlight to his faceThis game is fun but there seems to be some balancing issues if you read other reviews. There's some obvious choppy ness in game wheather you're climbing over a window or fixing a generator. The devs should fix these. There may also be some balancing issues if you're playing as the killer. It's actually quite hard to play as the killer. You're in first person view so your vision is limited. You have to find the survivors in a sandbox map which is somewhat big all while patrolling and keeping track of the generators. My experience as the killer is actually limited though so take this with a grain of salt. The bigges downfall of the game is that you cannot party up with friends. YOU CANNOT PARTY UP WITH FRIENDS (WTF WERE THE DEVS THINKING). You can play a private game with them yes but not a public game. You do not get experience when you play a private match. So if you and a friend or 2 friends perhaps bought this game to play it together good luck trying to enter the same lobby.There are obviously flaws to the game but it doesn't mean this game isn't fun at all. I only recommend the game on a discount. For $20 dollars I should be able to play with friends. If I could it would be worth that $20. But since we all cannot play with our friends wait for a sale.EDIT I have been playing as the killer a little bit more. I do not feel that it is completely imbalanced. However there are times where the game will frustrate you. Some areas of the map are exploitable by survivors making them impossible to catch just by simply vaulting the same areas over and over again or repeatidly going over the same path because the killer maneuvers over these areas slowly (I have abused this myself as a survivor).They did impliment a party system that allows you to survive with friends but they shortly took it out because of bugs. The devs say they are on this issue according to the news. Be aware that I did not get the chance to use this feature. This game will get my recommendation as soon as they impliment the party system again.Edit 2 They have added a party system now. But let me tell you it sucks. Queing up with 2 people is barely operational takes dozens of tries/reque's and most of the time you won't find a game. Now queing up with 3 people is and close to impossible as pigs flying. Me and my friends got tired of waiting and requeing for a game every 5 seconds so we just decided to play another game DEdit 3 (1/10/2018) Game has been fixed a lot since my last edit. Playing with friends is now possible. Many of the windows that were previously there have been blocked if there is another window nearby so makes it so survivors cannot abuse the same 2 windows forever. Even then if a survivor abuses even just 1 window ""The Entity"" (idk how to explain it other than the killers work for it/them) will block the windows. New killers and survivors and map help make the experience better. Michael Meyers and Freddy Kruger are in there aswell. The game has had some good changes and with that I can recommend this game if you're looking to play with friends.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-24,0,0,150,False,Recommended,A great game. The learning curve is a bit steep for new survivors but it's a fun experience that keeps me coming back for more. Playing survive with friends is lots of fun. However the game is balanced around total lack of communication between survivors so groups of friends have a much easier time than random groups do.While the game itself is fairly simple there are a lot of little naunces to learn and master. At low ranks the game tends to be very killer sided but as survivors begin to unlock perks and learn how to properly drag out chases that changes rapidly. There is a ridiculous amount grind involved to get all of the perks unlocked (at 86 hours I'm just getting started) but the next patch promises to reduce that significantly.Don't listen to the people with hundreds of hours complaining like the sky is falling. The game has its share of problems and bugs but its still fun to play regardless. The devs are listening to feedback and actively trying to make the game better.,Dead by Daylight

I was hoping the game would work seamlessly and thought I'd have fun playing this with friends however I was horribly wrong. This game barely has any options and while I understand that grass and fog have to be the same for everyone to avoid an unfair advantage I'm about not being able to tune the antialiasing method or motion blur as this game appears to use either TAA which I hate or a terrible FXAA that makes everything slightly blurry even on the highest graphical settings. Not only that but I found out that keybinding options are lackluster to say the least and in a game that requires stealth there's no option for crouch toggle meaning I have to hold down a key for minutes on end without any other option around it. Worse devs had promised they would address the terrible control options on June DURING 2016. It's been more than one year and after several paid dlc they haven't fixed any of the issues I've mentioned. I'm awfully disappointed with both the game and the developers and will be sharing my experience with my peers.,Dead by Daylight

From the proceduraly created maps to the different hunters I could see myself playing this for awhile but only if the developers keep adding content like new killers/ survivors/ map types/ game modes. For 20 dollars I would say take a STAB at it. I have already got my 20 bucks worth and I am still pulling back the the skin of this dark little diamond in the rugh.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-28,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,I certainly got my $10 worth out of this game but the initial appeal has been entirely lost at this point. At its core Dead by Daylight is a really fun sometimes scary game. Survivors scramble to repair generators hide from the killer and to escape with their lives and as many friends as possible. Killers brutally hunt for and chase down helpless survivors as they try to prevent any of the widely spread out generators from being repaired while hopefully continuing to hook survivors to sacrifice them.Unfortunately you do not have to play for long for this game to stop being fun. Survivors easily obtain a plethora of tools through the game's perk system that allows them to evade escape and sometimes troll the killer. The party system allows survivors of higher ranks to work together and abuse the killer. Killers are given tools as well but they are largely focused on finding the survivors not on helping chase and kill them. What DbD eventually becomes is a game that is very easy for survivors and often unfair for killers.The way that you play this game (within the rules and with the tools given to you) completely guts the spirit of Dead by Daylight. It no longer becomes a game about being hunted. It is a game where survivors actively sprint around and beckon to the killer begging to be chased so that they can begin an endless series of pallet looping and flashlight stunning. Survivors want to use their sprint bursts to waste more of the killer's time. They want to use their dead hard perk so that the killer's hit does no damage. They want to use decisive strike so that they can stun the killer and run away after he downs them. They want to use Borrowed Time so that when the survivors is unhooked the killer's attacks do no damage.This game has technical flaws and glitches but at least in the beginning it outweighs those negatives with sheer fun factor. However in a way that no other game that I had enjoyed so much ever has Dead by Daylight so quickly sucked all of that fun away and just left me feeling disappointed.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-25,0,0,3,False,Recommended,"This is a must have for any horror fan who grew up with Michael Myers Jason &amp Leatherface. Hearing a chainsaw rev up right behind you is jarring every time. Pros it is just fun...it's a sadistic spin on hide and go seek and both roles are a blast to play. Addictive ""Ok just one more match"" feeling on both the killer's side &amp the victims' side Leveling system that rewards perks even after only a few matches. Great atmosphere Most online games when you get killed there is a reaction of ""Dang...he got me"". With this game it is more like (while running from chainsaw wielding hillbilly) ""crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap....AAAAAAARRGGGHHHH!!!!"" Then you get hung on a hook.Cons I could see it getting a bit repetitious after dozens of hours in the same environments. The game could definitely benefit from more than just the single ""Fix generator hang on hook...wait for rescue"" formula...even if that variation is only a variety of new animations. The environments are good looking...but feel very similar to one another.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-24,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game.The negative points are Lobby system sucks If you are in group you have to wait until you get old before you can join a game. Unbalanced Some killers like to sit and drink tea in front of the hooked survivor. They just stay there watching the survivor died slowly. This may be one of play styles but I don't think it's good. Dev should add a penalty. Dev are active Active? Why bad? It's because they focus on events about how to get more people playing this game but not on improving. (At least say something that you are improving it.)The positive points are New style of playing Well... you never play a game that stress you so much even though you already know that the killer is human too. High replay value You can play it and you can enjoy it. I think the procedure generator of this game did quite a good job. Sometimes you will be placed in the same map but you still get confused.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-04,0,0,228,False,Recommended,Asymmetrical games have been popping up more frequently ever since Evolve tanked it and Dead by Daylight is one of those games that does the genre proud. It's not perfect but nothing is. The sooner you learn to accept that fact the easier your life will be. This game does a really good job of balancing risk and reward as well as critical thinking and understanding. It's not just about survival it's about weighing your options. Is it worth it to risk your life to save your teammate? Is it worth his to save yours? What do you value more your dignity or your skin? The killer plays the game in first person perspective while the survivors are given a third person perspective and this spearpoint of a mechanic sets the tone for the entire game. As the killer your greatest weapon(besides a jagged machete and rusty beartrap) is thinking like your prey. Knowing where they'll run where they'll hide how they'll react to the actions you take. As a survivor there are two things that will get you killed faster than anything else. 1) Panic. 2) Movement. By abusing blind spots vision cones and the most basic forms of camoflouge and deception survivors can evade or escape the killer to live another day. The question remains... Will you be dead by doorknobs?*cough I mean daylight. Seriously though it's a very fun game.,Dead by Daylight

This would definitely be great to play with friends and the devs are adding more content almost every other week.

The only times these are questionable are when it works in my favour. Eitherway nice change of pace from all the other multiplayers.,Dead by Daylight
2017-08-15,0,0,597,False,Recommended,I love this game it is fun to play with friends and also be triggered cause their facecampers everywhere. Nah but thats not the reason why i dont like this game i really love this game but their is an issue with losing all progress which is starting to grow more and more. people will have 400 hours on this game then lose all of their progress. I had so much progress and lost it all. I think i know how you may have lost your progress (unless differently) from the way i lost my progress was getting a license agreement for the game in game at the main menu or backing out of a match and getting it btw tell me if you lost your progress and how? I have not only once lost my progress but twice and yes it sucked after getting my teachable perks back. Contacting devs wont help you unless you want to wait 1 2 months getting a response and by the time they respond to you and give you your bloodpoints expect to lose all progress again unless you of course backup your file game saves but for me i haved backed up my progress and is corrupted. If you are intrested in this game i suggest you do buy it but i highly recommend you backup your save files unless you want to start from the beggining but until this problem is fixed i wouldn't play it cause i dont think i can handle a 3rd time losing all my progress (P S if you read this all i congrat you will a cookie its in your kitchen waiting for you),Dead by Daylight

2017-06-27,0,0,1304,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an engaging asymmetrical survival horror game that pits four survivors against one killer. I purchased this title in mid 2017 and quickly accumulated several hundred hours in it. The gameplay is always fresh and exciting albeit quite tense and stressful at times which is the perfect storm for competitive junkies like me.Unfortunately I do have a major issue with this game that can't go unmentioned. There is a very persistent and apparently unfixable glitch in this game where sometimes it will fail to sync with the Steam Cloud and you'll lose all of your in game progress. I lost all of my progress at around 306 hours and had to start from scratch re leveling up all my characters. I contacted the game's customer support team via email for assistance however after literally months of no response I finally gave up. Unfortunately in order to preserve your progress in this game you must regularly backup your profile save in the game's files. It is an inconvenience but there's no end in sight for this irreconcilable glitch and that's just the way it is.The game IS still playable even if you lose your progress. You don't need any of the perks items or offerings you earn from leveling up to play well but they certainly help and it is frustrating to lose everything.Overall while I definitely enjoy this game and highly recommend it it is not without its faults. The threat of losing all your in game progress is always looming over you and the customer support team is useless. Please take these factors into consideration before spending money on this title.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-20,0,0,721,False,Recommended,Awesome game except there is this ''No Network connection'' Quit game? Every time you try to ''Survive with friends'' Hope this will get fixed.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-20,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This game is terrific it has a few flaws with the barriers but overall I love playing this game as the Killer. The game keeps getting new killers and survivors and some free DLC I don't have that much to complain about I'd give it a 9/10.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-26,0,0,76,False,Recommended,Awesome Game. Addictive Fun Replayable Everything a game like this needs. The community can be a bit rough sometimes and the game has bugs here and there but content is constantly being added and there is enough there already to keep anyone busy for many many hours. The killers and survivors are unique they are able to be customized have their own perks and items. Perks are unique too there are many of them and this allows people to play in many ways resulting in a new experience each time you play.Being a Killer is very difficult at the start unless you've seen many videos on how to play them. However after 2 or 3 matches playing as a single killer you will start to get the hang of it. As a survivor some killers can be terrifying. They will patrol areas often and make the game incredibly tense and suspenseful. To wrap up this review The game is 100% worth your money as a survivor you feel that rush in almost every game. That rush could happen while you are hiding while the killer walks incredibly close to you but doesn't see you or during a chase. As a killer getting kills is very satisfying and rewarding. The game is buggy sometimes but far less buggy then Friday The 13th The Game at the moment. The only downside to some people is that after 10 or 15 matches games get far less scary however they do still remain suspensful in my opinion that feeling will never go away when playing this game. The procedual generation also helps putting you in random and unknown environments each time you play.100% recommended you will not regret it. Take a chance if you're unsure remember if you do dislike it you can always refund it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-27,0,0,181,False,Recommended,"As a disclaimer I came to this game a little late (June of 2017) and therefore did not have to contend with all of the early major bugs. I also adore horror so I am totally biased in that department HOWEVER this game has sucked me in. I'm addicted. I'm primarily a solo RPG gamer so this was a huge shift from my comfort zone. Here's what impressed me *The maps are procedually generated to a certain degree so that every game feels slightly foreign. *The tension of the game is fantastic from both the Killer and Survivor perspectives and keeps the horror element alive throughout each match.*It doesn't shy away from the gore.*Great game to play with random people but it really shines if you play ""Survive with Friends"" mode as it adds an extra layer of comaraderie.*When playing as the killer if another player is greifing you you just murder them. It's fun you should try it. What annoyed me *While the bugs do not break the game it does make certian matches grueling when pallets and such don't respond as they should. *The matchmaking system is a little flawed. Don't be surprised if you end up facing an OP expereinced opponent while you're still new. *Finally you have to patient in the lobby sometimes while waiting on a game. I keep my sociology textbook at my desk so I can study while waiting. Seriously read a book knit a scarf learn another language in the downtime. You'll be impressed by what you accomplish. I would recommend this game 100%. The free DLC that are released on a semi regular basis is nice and the paid DLC are not that over priced either.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-09,0,0,123,False,Recommended,"EDIT Gameplay wise it's still fun but can be improved. Wraith is still broken but it can be worked around.What really gets frustrating is when the huge amount of bugs gets in the way.When starting a match there's a 50 50% chance you wont get to look around your surroundings before you start playing. If you dont you get 50 50 of either having the camera annoyingly misplaced on your weapons viewmodel (as a killer) or not being able to control your character at all thus losing your rank offerings and addons which will cost you a huge amount of luck to get back.I've had some matches where I collide with something on the map and my character just phases right though the ground breaking the game.""Survive with friends"" mode doesnt leave you on a queue until it finds a suitable lobby It searches for 5 10 seconds and then requires you to search for a game again and again. But when none of that happens its a really fun game to play with friends.Once you get the hang of being the killer and learn how survivors try to avoid you having the power over the other players and catching them feels really rewarding especially when you get all 4 survivors.Making teams as survivors and being capable to best the killer's plans is really rewarding as well.At some point the game stops being scary but the suspense lingers a lot more then.I feel like this game should have stayed a bit more under beta. Some bugs make the game frustrating and even unplayable. But when things work it proves to be a really awesome game.",Dead by Daylight

Playing as a survivor gets really tense and playing as the killer desiding weither to stay at a hook so the other survivors won't get to the one on the hook or patroling the genarators to look for more victims it's great.

Here you really find teamwork not like ""solofortress2"" (TF2) Here you can do a standalone run if any victim is likely to help (some time is everyone in they own) Good designs for the maps and characters Camping hunters is like real live killers. (They watch the prey die a slow dead)cons Sadly no campaign to understand the background story unless the bios for every character and some tapes? (Dint get that). Camping hunters. (Why me and not that dude that pass in front of you HELP HELP *DEAD*) The BUG that everyone is talking about. I don t mind starting again but is a bad programing thing ( The dam jump scar that nurse killer do as she blinks in front of you gives a heart attack.Mostly this game have all the potential to be a great game the thing is the community hate frustration like everyone in this world how don t have a freaking killer standing in front of you only to secure that no one ells save you (I happened to come across to this situation but the other 3 victims lured him out of sight and one of them save me so stop putting Camping killer . You can easily scape if you do teamwork) surviving is pretty easy if you know what to do and the things you come across in the way the best part Is gaining points for doing extra things. Well finally is that I have a lot of fun in only 4 hours and it worth all the money I spent in this game + dlc.Pls do more stories or background story that activates is you do something in game or buy a combination of items maybe a crafting option is you find peaces of scrap and broken story items for more story .",Dead by Daylight

It is actually quite good. With friends it's excellent. I usually sit and play it until I feel my eyes will fall out from my head and then I go and do something else while thinking about playing it and then when I am done I go and play some more. The only con not really related to the game itself Blocking system needs to be fixed.

2016-06-15,0,0,14,False,Recommended,I played many hours of the beta and after a couple hours play there are a couple glaring problems I'd wait to be addressed.The MAJOR cons Can't party with friends(as a result people contsantly leave lobbies) If Monster disconnects/rage quits the match ends and you can lose rank because of it Settings/Options are extremely limtedThere are other issues as well I'm sure other reviewers will go into much greater detail of the bugs and balancing issues. But these are the main ones I think people would want to maybe wait to be included before purchasing. All in all it's a fantastically fun game with a lot of promise. Intesnse gameplay at its best. If the partying issue doesn't bother you playing solo is still a lot of fun but having 4 other friends is an absolute blast. Some of the most fun I've had goofing around in a game in a long time.Will also review positive as soon as a friend and I can party together they're not very clear on that in the description and I'm sure a lot of people (myself included) would be a bit miffed only to realize this after purchasing.,Dead by Daylight

If your looking for a solo multiplayer game thats spooky buy this game.BUT if your like me and my friends looking for a good 2 3 multiplayer spook fest avoid this at least for now. Im writing this at the time the Play with Friends ladder has been RE RELEASED. It takes roughly 20 minutes of re quing over and over and over to get into a lobby. And I do mean Re quing every 3 seconds so its not like you can even do anything while you wait. It occasionaly does the ""Cant find game"" thing in solo player also (why?) but its to a forgivable extent. TL DR wait until you see the ""Play With Friends"" function working at 100% to buy this with que times under 20 mins (for JUST 2 people 3 is unplayable) or buy it on a sale with low expecations.

2016-11-26,0,0,249,False,Recommended,Very spooky and fun to play with friends.Though... there are some problems.Most of the time the game works fine but I have to have it on the lowest quality graphics and resolution to be able to play it and even then sometimes the lag is unbearable. I really would like to be able to see the full quality of the maps while still being able to play the game.On the topic of maps there are not very many but I can tell that more are slowly being added!Hopefully there are more maps that are just as fun to play as Haddonfield. (It's my favorite the other ones seem too similar tbh.) Also more room for character customization would be nice. _ My biggest problem though is that after i've finished playing the game and have closed it Steam says that it is still running. This causes me to not be able to play any other games or close Steam so I eventually have to go into Task Manager and end it manually. Another problem with bugs is that when I try to use the Survive With Friends mode the party moves to the main lobby but all players wind up being kicked out. It's very weird and has happened frequently.There has also been problems where the killer is stuck in place throughout the entire round causing survivors to take advantage of it. It really takes me out of the horror mood when this happens. Over all I truly love this game and would reccomend it ... but these things DO NEED FIXED!!! I've seen other reviews talk about this as well as countless discussion posts so I hope this helps get the point across.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-26,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I'm really happy to revisit this game and see how it's progressed. It had a rocky start but the developers believed in what they made and stuck to it and it's paid off in dividends. My initial review was a thumbs down but it hurt me to do it because the potential was so high. I'm happy to say this game has worked out many (if not all) of the bugs that plagued it at the onset.No matter the role you play you will have fun with this game. The only time you might not is if as the survivor you get caught early or as the killer you just really struggle with catching a survivor/get outplayed. That's really all I currently find to be a con of the game in it's current state. The fact that it's just one game mode can and will be a turn off to some but I think the game shines here because even if it only does one thing it does it extremely well. It's the kind of game you pick up and play and if you get tired of it you play something else for a while but you know you'll come back for more.A big shout out to Behaviour Interactive for sticking to their product that you could tell by watching any videos on them and this game that they cared deeply for. They live and breathe this game and it shows and I think that's awesome.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-17,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,"Fun in theory. In reality boring as hell. I don't know why really. Seems like a great set up for a game but its basically sitting with a mouse clicked to start a generator and looking around hoping to not get killed. Over and over. That's the whole game. The elements are cool many interesting pieces are there but the gameplay itself is just nothing. Survivors play in third person the killer in first so you don't really get into the world of the game to actually feel terror. You just think ""Hmm... can the guy playing the killer see me in 1st person right now?"" and if they do you run away for a bit maybe hide then go hold your mouse down again on a generator until you either A) start all the generators and leave or B) get impaled on a spike and fed to a spider demon.

When he is online we play as the survivors and have had a few heart seizing moments and when I'm alone I like to play as the killer.

I play both sides but mostly survivor. When you play survivor you strategize with teammates and eventually get out. but personally i am a lone wolf. and that is how i like to play and that is ok.

2016-07-26,0,0,301,False,Not Recommended,"I love the game. It is a ton of fun to play the Wraith. Saying that I also have to mention that I have lost rank three times now for getting stuck while trying to pick someone up. The other survivors even try shining a flashlight at me after noticing that I am stuck and I continue to sit there until I just leave the game.EDIT I figured I would give it a second try. I have had to leave a game twice today due to getting stuck while trying to pick someone off the ground. I also just had to leave the game because I had hung two people and the ""entity"" did not take them into the sky. I am getting very disheartened with how this game is performing currently. Simple parts of the game that should have been solved before it even got released are becoming a common issue with my playing of this game. I have the feeling of buyer's remorse due to the lack of faith I have in this game going further.It is now 02 16 2017. A new patch has come out that will make killer more fun to play. I try to log on to the game and it says launch error. I try to re open it through steam and I get the same response. After opening and closing the game multiple times I have almost given up. The game is fun. It also ruins my nights. If I am in a surviving mood I have to wait until I hopefully get someone that isn't lagging and not a bot. If I want to kill I have to hope that all 4 survivors get in the game so that I don't have to ""be a good sport"" and let everyone pip. Steadily losing faith. The game is a great concept. I cannot recommend a friend buy it with everything that I have experienced with it.07/08/2017 update I have tried updating drivers installing the new windows update went through the command prompt on my computer to fix corrupted files and again to try to fix the easyanticheat error I was receiving. this game. the developers. I have tried e mailing for help and received none. New update? DLC. Bug fixes? Next time. It has been nearly a year since I have played this game and I still cannot. Fun game and I am trying to remain patient with the hopes that a fix will eventually come. I now consider my library on steam one less because of this game. I've put 30$ into this game put +300$ into updating my graphics card and power supply JUST TO PLAY THIS GAME and now I cannot.

2016-12-11,0,0,418,False,Recommended,"Edit This game added a ping indicator as a survivor before entering a game. That's all that we ever needed. This is a great game that was plagued by a faulty infrastructure. We've gotten some updates and fixes as well as some additions to help cope with it. It's playable now.This is a really fun game. Great concept great replayability. I can't in good conscience recommend it to people in general though. The peer to peer hosting is just atrocious. Game constantly hangs at loading screens requiring a force end task people disconnect from 45% of your games game immediately kicks you to the survivor menu as soon as you enter a lobby or you rubber band everywhere if you even manage to get into a game. They want to make this game competitive they need to front the money for some good dedicated servers for match hosting. One quick solution to avoid these issues is to just play as a killer. I get wonderful games when I do nobody dcs everyone is having a good old time. Unfortunately the sole determination as to who you are matched against is rank not your character's level. So once you start winning some games as a killer it will begin to match you with people with maxed out survivor levels making it nigh impossible to ever catch and find them. I'm not sure why this game needs a ranked matchmaking system it is certainly not a very competitive game insofar as being considered an esport. So many lame mechanics that people can abuse. Just another way esport/twitch are fundamentally ruining potentially wonderful games by making developers feel like they need to make their games ""esport MLG competitive.""Fix the hosting problems and this game is great regardless of the matchmaking issues.",Dead by Daylight

One thing I feel would be cool though would be a clown killer maybe something based off of an abandoned carnival. One idea that has stuck with me for the ""superpower"" would be him running around with his barbed wire bat (Lucille kinda thing) and braking pallets before they were even thrown down by survivors and on top of that maybe even spawning closer to survivors than any other killer! And then for the new survivor maybe some teenage hooligan that would go around the carnival after hours and brake things!

2016-06-17,0,0,214,False,Recommended,"*The original review is lower down*13 09 2017 The game is now much more stable in terms of grind and playthrough and with the shrine system it makes it easier for players to get an upper hand if they get the needed gems it's once again worth a buy.AS OF 1.1.0 The developers keep pushing onward in polishing their game and giving it a proper shine and even granted us a FREE DLC for The Nurse and Nea characters there's a lot I like about how the game is right now from playing and customizing your own characters with a good assortment of perks and now includingly one that shows the entire team if someone is being a Lazy susan and isn't trying to help unhook someone.HOWEVER I will now touch PERSISTING PROBLEMS 1 The matchmaking is still just ""Press Join"" and await for an open room and hoping you get one without lag.2 The GRINDING. Oh boy bittersweet word that may be grinding is now harder in the game and even more so it feels very slow the higher levels you reach it'll take you nearly a month if not a ""cave dweller"" to get 3 characters all to level 30 wich is in the game truly starts taking a new shape so far I feel there should be timed boosters during the weekends or during certain weeks and these could be announced therefore dragging more players back into playing 'cause ""Oh I get TRIPLE the points!?"" or at the very least let us risk BUYING Blood Point boosters as DLC there isn't much wrong to it the game is still played and whoever levels faster will eventually land with players of either equal skill or levels offer a mask or something with it just as an excuse Payday 2 did it for a good while and people ended up enjoying a good handful of the DLC's even when they just added more cosmetics and minor accessory tweaks.For short the game continues to deliver good times but it does go from a nicely paced jog to a slog and crawl through the later parts of it. I think something like the timed ""à la MGS V"" BP boosts or ""Shark Card"" DLC's could be beneficial! ( Original Review written in version 1.0.1)The survivors are granted more chances of succeeding than a killer over the fact you can vault windowsills without these being on a cooldown like for example if the window came down and prevented that hole to be used or the fact since the killer cant climb over chest high obstacles a survivor can theoretically run around a tank tread in the farmstead per say indefinitely thus turning what could be an interesting chase into a joke this isn't me being salty it's seeing a proof of read actually being applied in the game itself.The game is good so far it's VERY cathartic to be able to overcome odds in this game but as it stands the survivors are of 1.0.1 have the upper hand but am looking forward to further balances in the next updates.ONE. STRONG. POINT I WILL TOUCH. The game has people abusing already of things such as speed hacks (this luckily so far being rare you'll mostly find foreign eastern players doing this) they're not unkillable just they jitter around constantly so play it smart and there WILL BE a good time to get them.

2017-09-12,0,0,5,False,Recommended,Unfortunately the game is hard to balance for all. The game at lower ranks is very heavy for survivors. You will need a lot of time to understand how and where to run from the maniac. For the maniac to start playing it will be easier harder just have to learn to play the nurse and hillbilly. I recommend to start playing for the Ghost playing for him you will quickly understand how to find the survivors and understand about the place of their spawn.When you begin to play for the maniac at high grades prepare validol. Play party is a great stress every second counts and any mistake is generator. If you play really well you need about 2 minutes to find catch and hang the first victim. By this time you will have 2 of the 5 generators. This is provided if your victim won't jump at you from the shoulder with perk or his friend won't blind you with a flashlight. Let nature take its course. If the survivors are smart you two run to start the remaining generators and the third using the perk which gives invulnerability will go to save the victim. Together they will come running to open the gate already and the remaining friends will have to block your body to keep you wounded. Well prepare yourself that after the game no matter how you played you poured a bucket of gomno in 70% of cases. The appropriate people rarely meet and this community what to do. Play against randomness are different there is as lucky or you SARSAT generators for 5 minutes or gets a team of altruists and the game will be more interesting. Without perks at the maniac slows treatment and repairing generators do nothing.The game for the survivors is a simulator of repairing the generators. If you want to play stealth and a maniac in General you will not see the entire game. Or you can be altruistic to save everyone to be substituted under blows of a maniac and run him around the Board in a circle.The game is about surviving which always aching from patch to patch give more and more Goodies. To kill you maniac need to hang you 3 times on the hook. For the game by selecting a certain set of perks you can get up from the ground as being in a dying condition and even in two ways. Also you can jump from the shoulder of the maniac there's a perk which you can use sadunaite hit maniac self sprint invulnerability which is triggered after you or you're off the hook and more. But! If playing a maniac who took advantage of giving fanshot which is tied to the totem triggered after repairing the five generators you learn a lot about himself and his family after the game. There are also individuals who take rare offerings and items and Lebanon if they were caught. And at the same time you have against all this play and their Liv you points not get but they're all items will remain and will continue playing. And for that they will be nothing.You can also talk about finding the game. If you decide to play with a friend or friends you'll have to be patient. The game will look a long time and when you find it many maniacs will establish from the lobby if they do not like it. And the search will have to resume. Unfortunately the game has many insecure maniacs. And again blame the survivors who don't respect killers having his face generators Crouch in front of the Board zoom flashlight write a bunch of insults. Many just clog and stop playing maniacs. And these same people are then in the lobby and are looking for a game for 15 minutes. For maniac game takes place in a moment.Also in the game you can stumble upon various bugs but constantly working on it )Despite all of the above this game start play is a lot of interesting sensations for you. And again! Be patient because need to spend a lot of time to learn to play well. I recommend to play as the survivors and all the maniacs to know the game and understand both sides.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-24,0,0,445,False,Recommended,"This game has the potential to be the single best game that anyone in their right mind has ever played. Unfortunately it has been ruined by a man who by his own admission sniffs underwear both used and unused all day. His partner in crime for this gruesome debacle of which a likeness has never before been seen is another man who gets second dibs on said underwear. While engaging in perverse debauchery they dream up ideas that a Pre School Nursery class tutored by dogs and graded by the UK Office for Standards in Education Children's Services and Skills as ""Excessively Deficient"" would take one look at and produce the large red ""Denied"" stamp before applying said stamp to the skull of these clowns.Their idea for creating ""a Killer who will be so OP"" could not have been further from the intended had it been designed by Ben Brode himself with the exception of an extremely overpowered bugged farming tool which was patched out a week later thus making said OP pick only slightly less and current bottom tiered Wraith. Meanwhile they allow other killers to go with balance akin to that of a fully armed Trident Nuclear Missile versus a Shepherd armed only with a handful of leaves and a bent twig.You'd assume that with a rival around the corner that you would be doing everything in your power to ensure that your product was top of the line the highest grade the best around. Instead they seem to have heavily banked on the idea that because their game is so it will have scared away not only the competitors of such games but also the playerbase thus creating a self depricating monopoly whereby the only userbase they have left are those who have not yet perfected the art of pepperoni nipples for their Deviantart pornography page.All in all the approach to bugfixing in this game appears to be ""HAHA WHAT BUGS?!"". There is no real Anti Cheat making it a simple case of turning off the Steam Cloud to avoid Easy Anti Cheat bans and due to the lack of dedicated servers you can only be matched with someone on the surface of the moon. Therefore making it easily the best game I have ever played.

2016-06-26,0,0,502,False,Recommended,"*edit 3* June 2017They unlocked everything for kill your friends mode (a mode that lets you have private matches with people on your friends list).With this you dont have to worry about grinding for the right perks and equiptment to do well against your friends.In my oppinion this feature solidifys this game into the category of timeless classic.because of its peer to peer connection and this feature it is future proof.Ill enjoy playing this for many years with my friends.*edit 2* December 2016If there is one thing any game played online with random people have in common its that the games themselves are great its people that are the real buzzkills.I still say this game is better enjoyed with friends only because friends generally wont attack you because they lost. friends generally treat eachother with at least some level of respect.If you dont mind or even enjoy the bitter comments from random people then online play is perfect for you. Im pretty sure only league of legends and the great salt lake rivals the amount of salt generated from this game's players.A lot of the infinites have been fixed and they even added a mechanic to stop it completely by giving windows a cooldown if used often closing them temporarily by the spider god.As of right now the devs are working on camping.Despite the unpleasable fanbase the devs have been working quite persistently to fix the problems introduced and discovered by players themselves.A large enough sample size will always make the flaws stand out more.Overall its still a fantastic game. There really are only 3 other games like it and they wont even come out until next october (2017)*edit*The salt content in this game is deliciously high.It doesnt matter which side you are on someone is going to be salty about something.Its a fantastic game.It reminds me a lot of a party game people would play on early fps games called ""Jason""Besides a couple of issues that will be fixed next patch I find this game to be really well balanced.The worst part is people though because people are generally terrible and selfish they dont like working together.As killer my only complaint is the window hoping (which will be fixed next patch).My main complaint as survivor is people and you cant change people.Next patch is also going to bring in the ""survive with friends"" feature which the lack of is the cause of most of the negative reviews. Every rare while you run into an honorable opponent and this game really shines through its flaws.Its a fantastic game and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of game.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-24,0,0,87,False,Recommended,2017 REVIEW The game is now MUCH more playable than when I first reviewed the game and the developers have fixed most of the issues I ever had especially the stupid ready up problem that everyone used to have only problem I stil have is the incredible unbalanced matchmaking in the game. This is the only remaining issue I think that still exists but apart from this small hiccup the game is now really enjoyable. The constantly readying up is not much of an issue anymore. I can finally recommend this game to my friends and be able to sleep at night.OLD REVIEW TL DR Ready up simulator 2016Great game but the amount of glitches and bugs ruin it. Needs some reworking with the characters and perks. Dwhite needs a huge buff because lets face it he's absolutely worthless. Also matchmaking in this game is T TOTALLY TERRIBLE. Yesterday (July 25 2016) I literally spent 3 hours total trying to find games yesterday. And when I did find a game against a killer it would be a killer of much higher rank or lower. It is VERY rare to find a game against an even opponent. I cannot recommend a game that I spent more time hitting the ready up button than playing the actual game. (No there is no queue to finding a game so you have to press ready up after every 5 seconds because there's never any matches found when playing with friends) so basically you need to macro an auto clicker to click ready up for you if you want to try to play with 4 friends.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-21,0,0,252,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an extremely fun multiplayer horror survival game. The mechanics of the game are well thought out and puts an interesting twist on survival games. That being said many of this games beautiful features are demolished by it's crippling bugs and exploits. Many times if you are queueing up with more than yourself you are going to have to wait for over 5 minutes to find a match. Once you do find a match there is a fifty fifty chance the host which is the killer has very bad internet speed or lives too far away from you to make the match enjoyable. Also some of the very mechanics that I applauded the creators on end up being broken. An example being jumping over a window many times results in the killer getting a free hit or sometimes two on your character. I conclude that this game has great potential and exciting gameplay for both killer and survivor and I am willing to to look past many of the flaws it contains. I will continue to play this game as a murderous hunter or as the terrified survivor. 7/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-11,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Mixed once again fun to play with friends and can be scary if you aren't lag jumping place to place and rubberbanding back into the sight of the killer. Two of the killers are actually scary though one is Michael Myers with his dead silent heart beats and obession perks and the other is the freaky Hag she sets straps and has the creepest run cycle. Sometimes I will think that she is one of the survivors at a quick glance but then realise that I won't be able to repair the generator in time. Repairing is also one of the most unfair things in this game the skill checks will pop out and make you do it in a split second and if you fail the killer as been notified of your location being the killer is a whole different side of the game instead of being hunted you are hunting and instead of being scared you are getting aggravated wondering where those stupid kiddos went and where to hang them.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-09,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Update Been playing the game again as I heard there was performance updates. Here is the state of the game currently. I kept the Old review posted below so you can see how they've updated the gameCurrent Review (20170912) Recommend if you are interested in the genre.First off this game is very repetitive. Despite all the killers and randonmly generated maps there is little on offer to keep me coming back. I don't believe it is a lack of content as much as it is due to metagaming. That said I still come back as it is a nice time killer. Pretty much need to just grind one survivor/killler at a time and then move on to the next one once you max out their perks.Not too grindy it is of acceptable length. Old Review Not recommendedIt's a great concept but the devs seem more interested in adding content than making the game run well or even at all.Last patch I couldn't get into a session with any number of friends. Now the game doesn't launch a second time (some file keeps getting deleted and I have to verify cache everytime for it to fix it).Until the devs show they are serious about making it run WELL I can't recommend this as it will be just another dead title by the end of 2017.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-16,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"It only took me two hours to see that at present this game is simply not fun. It appears that much of what I hated comes from recent changes so this may (hopefully) change in the future.The core issue is that Killers aren't scary and they aren't fun to play. They've been de fanged to the point where seasoned players dance around them in the game and there's little that the Killer can do. I only played 3 games as the Killer the whole reason I bought this game was to play the Killer and in every game there were players taking advantage of cheap tactics over powered Survivor bonus items and the Killer's absolutely tiny hitbox.For me at least the fact that the Killers aren't scary means that playing as a Survivor isn't any fun either. I play to win but the challenge is what I want and there simply isn't much challenge unless you the player restrict yourself to 'fairness' when you play as a Survivor. I thought my games as a Survivor went well because everyone was new to the game so the Killers I faced didn't know what was going on. Then I switched to Killer and I realized that it was because playing the Killer is lame and any half decent Survivor can spit in your face dance around your body and then skip away after you swing and miss.Until Dead by Daylight puts the ""kill' back in Killer I suggest you avoid this.

2017-07-05,0,0,92,False,Recommended,I only have a few hours logged into the game so far but I can honestly say this has become my current favorite game and is usually what I load up to both begin and end my day with (hopefully not dead). With that said there's a few things I'd like to see fixed myself.1. Matchmaking can be horrendous at times. When queing for a game constantly get the no network found error and it closes the game completely. If you do connect you get kicked from your party and sent back to the home lobby about 10% of the time.2. Keep consistent groupings. One thing I dislike is having to send invites after every game to friends I play with on the regular. If I play 20 games in a day I have to make 60+ or so groups (due to the above as its not just me these problems affect but my group mates also)3. Latest patch penalizes Disconnects heavily. Usually that would be a good thing but I had a game as a survivor earlier today where the killer disconnected almost instantly and we got the escape status screen. We got points for escaping but I lost a rank pip due to not reaching a certain score. So if Salty Killers really wanted to just troll a group of survivors they could just exit the game at the start and possibly cause them to lose rank. Maybe they dont like some of the offerings or survivor choices who knows the mind of a killer?And just as a preference maybe a few emotes to communicate with your team. Currently the community has adapted a crouch spam as a way of getting attention and such. Maybe even a proximity voice ... and to balance it out a bit you could make it so that proximity voice / emotes can be heard by proximity killers.I'd also like the ability to be able to have a group que as survivors and killers in the matchmaking. Randomize the killer if multiple people choose the role. Sometimes I want to be able to kill my friends (im such a good buddy) but dislike the idea of having to 1v1.,Dead by Daylight

When the developers are doing a patch looks like they dont improve the game sadly they broke it even more .And yes i tried to reinstall the game(4 times) the steam verify files thing didnt worked at all (saying no file filed and all were validated) i reinstalled my video card driver restared my pc couple of times only to get this ... game working.This game doesnt worth 20$ by the way the graphics are pretty... not soo good but somehow you still need a good pc to run this game at full settings there are a lot of glitches and when i say a lot i mean A LOT i never get a good ping and i live in middle EU always the ping is over 90 100 even 150 for 20 bucks you still need to buy DLC's to unlock some characters like... rlly ?

2016-11-26,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Great game to relax on tons of fun and actually has a high learning curve. The killers are OP and the survivors with the best teamwork will win. Lots of teamwork and playing with eachother makes funny and rewarding wins. The game is actually super in depth which is great lots of stuff to learn. Takes a lot of time to be good and even longer to be the best. The ranking system is a up hill battle which makes it hard and rewarding. The perks and leveling of characters takes a lot of time also.P.S. Michael Myers is Sweet!!! Also very scary and fun to play and play against best killer so far.The game is cheap and worth every penny anyone who likes multiplayer teamwork games like csgo or c.o.d etc etc I know they may seem far apart but if you like those games youll love this.

2017-05-11,0,0,134,False,Recommended,so yes i overal liiked this game but in all honesty and knowlege of plaing the killer ans surviver its a bit unfair. the survivers get so many thing that can make the game one sided. for example taking out every hook they can. and theres so mutch hate in this game like when a someone is new to the game and they dont follow the unwritten rule wich is camping. in my experence people may post thing on ur steam page to be trolls. so to sum it up its a great game but be ready for COD behaviers and needs a little more work making things fair,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-11,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Short Review Pros Fun scary gameplay! The devs know how to make good first and third person contolls and animations. The most terrifying experience ever! (For the first 2 3 hours you play it.) Fun to play as both humans and killers/monsters!Cons Issues connecting to lobbys with players in them LOTS OF THEM! (But when you finaly get into a game the game plays fine.) After the first 2 4 hours of gameplay the scares slowly start to ware off. (Though with all games the scares will ware off sometime.)Final Score 7.5Long detailed review Ok I dont know what I should do give it a recommended score for amazing fun pvp gameplay or not recommended for alot of the time being unable to get into a game. When I get into a game it gives me as many cant connect to server messages as possible or it works but no one ever joins even though I know there are alot of other people playing and some one should connect. And then I go to play as monster and people join in 5 seconds. Its always either no one joins when you play as monster or no one joins when you play is human. And they never both work. Its one or the other. This games lobby is your enemy!Buy my god it is fun to play the days when it works! The third person (when you play as human) and first person (when you play as monster) cameras work great. The controlls are easy too. And playing as humans and monsters/killers is really fun.The only other thing is that I wish being in first person or third person should be a server setting that the lobby creator sets so that depending on what the lobby creator wants the humans and monsters can be in first or third person. And then players and search for what the players want being in third or first person. But all in all I think that they should just make all of that kind of stuff server options.Final score 7.5/10If and when they fix networking issues I think you should get this game for around maybe 15 dollars but if you have an itch for a game like this then get it on sale for now 10 bucks. Untill they fix the networking issues its not worth more than ten bucks again even still it should only be something like 15 bucks.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-07,0,0,275,False,Recommended,This could be a really great game to play with friends but they need to fix the survive with friends feature. The Lobby is really bad where you will have to keep constantly presing ready and searching and ready and searching for people because it keeps saying no matches found. This could go on for a long time and gets tedious. Wish I could play with my friends but its a mood killer dealing with this.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-06,0,0,570,False,Recommended,As far as a competitive asymmetric game goes this by far is one of the best games I've played in that regard. It uses enough mechanics to allow a deadly game of cat and mouse between a killer and 4 victims who have no means to fight back directly other then distract juke blind or stun the killer.The killer starts the game with the hardest or easiest task chasing down each survivor which gets easier up until the last person alive provided some generators have been completed. The killer uses their abilities to hunt the survivors down and knock them to the ground so they can be picked up and offered as a sacrfice to the entity on a hook. What often is hard for the survivors is to remain hidden and elude the killer which becomes harder to do as the match progresses on. Each generator completed makes one less generator to work on and activate to escape which involves less patrolling for the killer themselves to maintain. The game goes into a deeper gameplay when one of the survivors is caught because then it becomes a struggle of rescuing the person or leaving them to die which gives you one less person to depend on for your escape.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-06,0,0,231,False,Recommended,"I think the killer ""Hag"" is supposed to be weakened because of its trap.I mean you can touch off a clip trap only with hand and can easily see it when focused. But we almost cant discover or distroy a trap of Hag without a torch.Obviously its impossible for player to bring torch in each game just because of a low possibility that they meet a Hag. This results in the invincibility of an invisible trap.And Hag can even move to its trap when necessary which makes saving and repairing more difficult . Both of hag and nurse can move in distance but nurse still need to find survivor herself but hag's trap will tell it the location of survivors and move suddenly.Although the the distance of trap is limited hag can still know the location and go there thats too easy for killlerplayers.Its tooooo unfair for other killer or players.Compared to other killers i think hag is much more powerful and agressive . when most players find the ability of hag so strong and the ability can bring them victory easily the balance of dead by daylight will be broken soon.I write so much because i like this game and want it to be better. When i play a survivor who was killed by killer i will say the killer plays well. But when the killer is hag I only feel that the game was destroyed totally. Maybe the player is good too but the killer itself is so disguisting.",Dead by Daylight
2017-07-06,0,0,281,False,Recommended,This is a really good game and totally worth the money and will defenatly rival or even go past a newer very similar horror game its has its tense moments when the killer is closing in or you make to much noise and it is looking for you i think its Awesome. the only problem with this game is getting into a match with mates is soooo annoying when you finally get in one it is fine but it is a battle to get in one as the killer hosts the game no sever to go into the killer is the host to the other 4 players and when you mate invites you it kickes you out or times out it needs to be fixed to make this game even greater,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-16,0,0,402,False,Recommended,OK so when i frist played this game there where bugs.there still are bugs but there fixing it as fast as they can they now have join friends as witch is nice the object is to get the 4 generators escape and play again the killers job is to well kill you there are 3 classes right now trapper hillybilly wraiththey all have storys the killers and the survivors look on wiki for there story's but the survivors are basicly in purgtory so they have to escape with out getting cought what a living hell.any way this game scared me becuase you never know when you get hooked. lets just say team work is key but not every one likes to be you're friend.they are coming out with new killers the witch will be the next one other then some of the bugs check this game out not much money and a hell of alot of fun.,Dead by Daylight

Ranking system so you play with/against people with relatively the same skill level as you. Can get VERY intense. Jukes. Terrifyingly hilarious glitches.Cons Killer is host (P2P connection) so if he has crap internet it's GG. Lose items if Killer leaves as a match starts. Lots of disconnects. Killers camp a lot. Game gets glitchy from time to time. TERRIBLY OPTIMIZED. Sometimes takes forever to find a match. Matchmaking sucks a** most of the time. Rage quitters. If one survivor leaves early game it can ruin the whole game.OverallI really enjoy this game despite the bugs connection issues and unoptimized graphics.

2017-07-16,0,0,22,False,Recommended,"A really fun game both alone and with friends. But though I haven't been playing all that much yet there seems to be one flaw that might damage it in the long run the lack of killers. When I play survivor alone I get a queue time sometimes over 10 mins if I get to a lobby at all. As killer I get a match within ten seconds.There are probably many reasons for this problem but the biggest one imo is the community. Firstly when you get into a match as a new(b) killer the first thing you notice in the after game lobby screen is that all the survivors are 15+ most of them lvl 25. This gives the survivors an unfair experience advantage both in perks and knowledge about the game.Secondly the survivors can be toxic as . Just today after one match I've heard words like ""autistic"" ""retard"" ""not bad. really ing bad"" and so on. And these are the 25+ players. Sure when you lose you can write stuff like "" ing camper"" and so on but at least you are kicking up. Kicking down on a player that has lost is just untasteful and ruins any potential for new killers. I've also noticed that the killers are a lot nicer than the survivors. Writing stuff like ""gg"" and ""thx for the game"" and ""well played"" and doing things like helping you if you're new by letting new players finish generators and escape or guide/carry the newb to the hatch.All in all good game.

When i first saw this game i thought for sure this game was going to be filled with hackers and just general cheaters I was very pleasntly surprised when I havent come across any cheating as of yet. This game is very fun and honestly I think is what the dev set out to create. The only two problems I have with this game are that loading screens can be a bit long as well as joining games can be buggy and one of the killers has an invisibility feature that is very overpowered.EDIT After putting about 30 hours on the game i can no longer recomend the game. I am very unhappy with the direction the game is going massive buffed perks to the killers and nerfing the survivors perks. If you want to play with a friend forget about it. This is how my current DBD exprience is right now. Get in game invite friend to friends sesh hit ready button about 200 times disconect while joing a game remake friend sesh hit ready button about 200 more times finally get in a game get into game after long load its against wraith he somehow finds me and hit me twice from other side of map takes me to hook camps me and kills my team turns out he has iron grasp and deer stalk... shocker.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-21,0,0,435,False,Recommended,I really felt the need to review this game as I see so many people commenting about how they think it's unbalanced and all for the killer... Dead by Daylight is a horror movie simulation essencially you have a killer and 4 survivors who have to make a choice to work together or save themselves. The scenarios are so endless in this game and while you may have a few games as a survivor where you lose because of whatever reason it's never the same. If you're new to the game I recommend playing with as many friends as possible especially when playing a survivor. You have no way to communicate in the game with survivors other than emotes and even then it's only 3 that you can do so voice chat with friends will really help you become a better survivor. The killer is the real land slide on which the game can go in either direction.Survivors and Killers have very different points of view in the game survivors have a third person camera that can move around freely while Killers have a first person camera which limits their FOV. In my opinion neither roll is easy or overly hard but there are aspects of the game that make each side hard and easy at the same time. The killer moves faster than the survivors that's a fact. The survivor has to use stealth to their advantage and quick wits. Think what the killer will do before he does it and use it to your advantage. Survivors fix generators to trigger doors to escape you spend about a minute on each one which in itself can be difficult but to keep you on your toes they have added skill checks. People find these really hard at first because they don't listen to the queue before the skill check happens. Before every skill check there is a clonk echo sound which means get ready put your thumb on that spacebar and stare into the middle of your screen and wait for it. It's meant to wake you up! I don't play much of the killer but I know how hard it is starting out as a survivor and it could be very frustrating at first but it's the visual and sound queues you need to listen for that make all the difference. I really recommend everyone give this game a chance at least 10 hours it's worth it when you learn how to play better. I promise. Its hard at first but it gets better.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-21,0,0,304,False,Recommended,Pros Fun multiplayer if you like survival horror Survivor is easily playable solo without voice chat or text chat (since there is none lmao) Randomly generated hook pallet and generator locations based on presets so they're usually balanced Good selection of survivors and killers to experiment with Gameplay is balanced for the most part Leveling your characters gives you a plethora of perks to mix and match up to a max of 4 equippedCons Killer is the lobby host so if the killer has a bad connection you won't have fun Randomly generated hook pallet and generator locations can end up on a map with all hooks on one side of the map or end up on a map with only six hooks on the top portion of the map. Can also end up on a map with pallets nowhere to be found. Bloodwebs are random which can lead to you not getting that one perk you want for a pretty long time. Fairly toxic community. Almost every lobby I play killer in has scrubs disconnecting after getting hooked before they die or even before the game even starts. I've been told to kill myself a good amount too. Also you'll get killers who will camp hooks making it near impossible to save a survivor. Almost every update is the developer forcing new DLC down our throats. DLC killers don't seem as balanced as base game killers Michael being a prime example with his almost non existant terror radius in stage 1.Fun game all in all great with friends make sure you use something like Discord to talk because there's no in game chat. A well co ordinated team can destroy a killer easily so work together.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-16,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. This is a good game but it has some issues to it like most games. I would suggest to play this however only with your friends if you want to be a survivor but if you want to play this solo then the killer is the role for you. Despite that this game tells you to play as a suvivor as either a team player or a solo player. I can tell you now with my experience of playing this 3 days now its not going to be fun. I have had soo many games now where I have played as a survivor solo and by doing so I have had the following things happen to me which might happen to you Team mates leading the monster into you Leaving you for dead despite being easily able to be saved You will encounter players much higher than yourself You will find losing ranks soo much quicker (Not telling anyone to get a friend to farm stuff as thats cheating just saying without a friend to more than likely help bail you out you will have a greater percentage at dieing early which will definietly lower your rank).Now this is my experience so its not exactly gonna be the same with you... I hope. So what other issues are there with this game other than solo play that you have encountered. Well sit your arses down because I'm gonna tell you. Despite the penalising of playing solo as a suvivor I have found which is my biggest gripe there are some technical issues with this game. Some of which feel fairly beta esque problems and need sorting. When you finish a game with a friend you want to go back into a lobby with them right? I mean its only natural... So heres the deal with this game. Once you enjoyed a fairly nice match of this with a friend you then join a ""after game"" lobby which is where you can see all the rewards you reaped in (Pun D ). But from this lobby you can only either go back to the main menu... Or... go into a solo lobby where you can upgrade and search for a game solo.... which is a bit of a pain in the Because from there you have to back out to then go to the main menu to then select a lobby to invite your friend into then once they are in and you have readied up and they have.... guess what?.... YOUR THEN ENTERED INTO ANOTHER LOBBY o . O B but there must surely be a reason to why they need a seperate lobby for the solo and the multiplayer one from the main menu right....??? NO THERE ISN'T! I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT D SEND HULP!? D Okay sorry moment aside there is two differences and two alone which does not warrant the need for a seperate lobby you can switch to play as a killer in solo and the invite button has disappeared..... Thats it? Yup.... thats it... There will be points where you join a lobby and if the host quits (Which is always the monster... We shall get onto this point soon....) Then it can bug out your game you then have to close it down and then reload it back up and deal with the lobbies again... yaaaaay... Earlier mentioned Killers being the hosts... yup they are... they always are.... But why? Well when you go to play as a killer you actually create a lobby and wait for people to join you... B but... what if they have bad connection?? ( AHAHAHA your in for a ride... Because heres the two likely situations Ever played the early GoW on the xbox?? Well your gonna have a whole lot of Deja'vu cause that killer is gonna shred through you as they won't really experience much of what your suffering as its their connection. Okay other situation?? Well if that delightful character disconnects before lets say 10 15mins into a game prepare to lose a rank. Cause the system is not fair and you will get penalised for it unless you so happen to get enough points in that time. Rage quiters... You will hate them even more.... I have lost ranks because a Killer has lost sight of the person they were chasing or because someone escaped from a hook early on... Which guess what.... penalises you again because they left because they were so tilted that you have a team that works together.... bad times. HIT BOXES... So you see some cover and you want to slide over it to get away? Sure... but you might die....wha?... Well if a killer strikes say when your at quarter of the cover... your hit... just like that. Oooor they grab you and your instantly down. I have done this by accident a few times as the Hill Billy and you feel like the worst human being in existance because you and the other player both know that you shouldn't have hit them. But downed players can't get up by themselves fully unless a perk lets them or if they have a med kit so you mayas well just hook them. NO TUTORIAL! Okay you can argue saying that there is lots of notes inside the game telling you objectives and how to play etc. But if your a gamer/learner like me you do best at doing. Not reading. So when you stick your little head into a lobby with experienced players... you mayas well be a headless chicken. I'm not saying this is the most needed thing but it would really do wonders for new players to go against some bots or to be put into lobbies full of new players too. Campers!?... You will hate this with a burning passion... Forget CoD forget any other game you know where you hate them... because this game will give you a new definition into hating them. Why? Lets put it this way... you have just started the game maybe about 5 10 mins into the match you get hooked and the killer is standing right next to you while your on the hook. Which is compltely unfair because if you stuggle on the hook you get a 3% chance of success... 3%... thats it... If by some miracle you get off it... guess what your going straight back on it... And if someone comes to try and rescue you... guess what... they are more than likely going to die too.... But if you fail to struggle your way off... guess what... You have just signed for your own death congrats because if you fail to do it 3 times or if the meter gets half way and you will die if you don't mash ""space bar"". Oh and the best part if someone by some miracle does get past the person camping you and un hooks you... if you then get caught again... you die!! This is made 10x worse if the killer is the worst camper of them all ""The Trapper"" as yes he places traps... he can make any attempt of rescue 100000% more difficult because he can trap all around you making for death to be certain. Mate... you okay?... Yes I like this game its a great game don't get me wrong. But there are some issues that need to be resolved instead of bringing out DLC which is what these developers keep on doing but only at these points do they fix errors. OR atleast thats how it feels. I love how the atmosphere is in this game its perfect for horror lovers espcially that of the old classic horrors. You will notice how some of the killers resemble that of old killers and monsters. For instanceone of the killers is based on Michael Myers with a very chilling music vibe to whenever he approaches. There also seems to be one that looks similar to Jason in some ways. Either way this game is keeping those memories of such iconic characters alive and it brings me so much joy. Just waiting on the developers to re create the beloved image of the classic horror ""Swamp Thing"". They have a perfect map for it and if they are reading this I hope you approve of that idea. D I love how the game makes you feel like a ""suvivor"" you feel like your hopeless against the odds but yet you have to fight on to escape. There is no way a suvivor can damage these creatures but they can for if the situation arrives hinder their assault on you. Or find a place of safety in a wardrobe should they need to duck into cover as a killer approaches. And when you get to play this with friends its just perfect as they also get to share in the same experience as you both fearing for when the killer approaches. This game while it strikes alot of boxes negatively it also does so positively. I can't recommend it yet but all In all 5/10 until fixed. )",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-03,0,0,84,False,Recommended,This is a tough game to recommend but since I'm still playing it I will. Honestly I think the game itself is a lot of fun if a little unbalanced. Mechanically playing as a victim doesn't inspire a lot of fear in me. Because it takes so long to actually die it doesn't feel like the stakes are very high. Once you get into the groove of the gameplay loop it can still be fun but requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (like most horror movies I guess). I mean having to impale survivors on hooks 3 times to get a kill seems a bit much. I think like the game would feel scarier if the consequences for getting caught out were more severe and maybe the victim count was higher to balance this.Playing as the killer feels better but comes with it's own share of problems. Due to the lack of a threat the victims feel from the killer I've had a lot of victims body blocking me while carrying victims to the hook. I don't mind victims being brave and trying to lure me into drawn out chases I think that's great. But exploiting pathing mechanics due to the lack of gravity a killer possesses really takes you out of the experience.The worst thing about this game by far though is the toxic community. Every second game I get somebody complaining about how I play killer. Apparently I'm a camper because I don't leave when I know there's a victim nearby trying to rescue their friend from the hook. Apparently I'm supposed to play in a way that's more entertaining to the survivors instead of trying to secure kills. Despite the fact that I'm securing 3 4 kills most matches I consistently get abused and berated by body blocking victims for my playstyle as a killer. I won't rant about why I think it's ok to camp but I will say that the way you treat somebody shouldn't be contingent on their playstyle. If someone isn't exploting a glitch or bug and you're raging over the gameplay then maybe you're just playing the wrong game. Is there something innately infatilising that draws emotionally stunted individuals to the horror genre? Is the desire to render oneself vulnerable and childlike that brings out the child in the playerbase?Yes. Yes it is.I realise I've focused on a lot of the negatives here but as I said at the start I'm still playing it. It has some fun game mechanics but I can see myself moving on to something else in a few weeks. If you can get it on sale go for it. I'm sure it will entertain you for a few hours if you can look past it's short comings. Just be aware that it may not be what you want it to be... o.o,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-28,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Bought this on Xbox One when it launched. Loved it that much I bought it on PC with all the DLC in the Steam Sale (though I wouldn't call it much of a sale they both ended up costing the same overall). Not much difference between the two other than a some extra content on PC (which is going to console soon too) and slightly better graphics (not much in the way of graphics settings on this for a game that came out on PC first) but well worth the purchase to at least be able to play it when the missus steals the Xbox. Plays nicely with a controller too as super precise aim just isn't required so good for those of you that want a break from keyboard and mouse after a day in the office.Better gameplay than Friday the 13th.

2017-07-01,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,"Incredibly Fun Gameplay Poor Preformance and Terrible Glitches.This game is absolutely incredible it's very fun has great sound and music unique mechanics FASCINATING killers and one hell of a back story for everything going on! I feel terrible saying anything bad about this game but dear god it needs to be said.If you like horror please keep on eye on this one and BUY IT when the reviews talk about the developers fix up the glitches.I actually really do love this game however the developers need to stop adding in all this extra content and work more on improving the quality of the game. I have a monster PC with 64 GB of RAM and a high end processor (can't remember which one exactly) and the loading screens can sometimes take up to over 10 minutes before putting me into a match and by then all the other players have left and I'm left with a ""Merciless Victory"" I usually play as the killer and when I do I've noticed I get slightly shifted from side to side a lot (and no I'm NOT carrying a survivor in the cases I'm talking about) One time while playing as Bill I had this very strange continious glitch that caused me to constantly be shifting about a foot to the left or right multiple times a second. Absolutely unplayable. But I also didn't want to go through another loading screen so I hoped it'd go away. I didn't last long as I glitched into the corner of a brick wall while running away from the killer. Everytime I launch the game it comes up behind all of my other windows in full screen mode with the bottom bar for my applications still showing. I can see and hear a cutscene playing but clicking on the game via the tab at the bottom or on the game screen itself does not only do nothing in terms of coming to the front of the other windows but the screen goes black and the cutscene disappears. There is no sound and the screen is black (but I can still see the in game curser) for a long time before the main window shows I assume this lasts for the amount of time the cutscene had left. Textures for characters take several seconds to render properly but the survivors seem to be much worse and sometimes their clothes never actually look quite right. Min's hair is the worst though has a terrible tendancy to glitch out especially her bun. I've also noticed Laurie's clothes have a tendancy not to render properly more then anyone else as well. For some reason the killers don't have the same issue as much. Although the killers have super interesting back stories some are definately more weak the Nurse and maybe even the Hag aren't as interesting as Carter or the Trapper. Also all the survivors are incredibly uninteresting and the expressions that are indefinately on a couple of them make them come across completely unlikable. The only 2 survivors I found myself liking were Bill and Laurie THE ONLY TWO SURVIVORS FROM OTHER FRANCHISES. This game has an awsome story surrounding it but the only reason I know ANY of it is because I read it on the Wikia I assume the developers made. I'm surprised there isn't a story mode and in the (distant) future thatwould be a total must for an update. Along with offline matches if you can't connect to the interenet. DLC does NOT have enough content for the $$$. Why can't I put Rochelle's shirt on anybody but the botanist? Why does the bloody sack (or whatever it's called) have so few items and only for less then half of the killers? The killers have unique gameplay mechanics so why can't the survivors have unique abilities as well that I don't HAVE to buy with in game currency?DEVELOPERS!!! If you read this review I'm going to advise you that you should STOP putting in all this DLC and extra content with more killers and focus on making the game preform better. Fix the bugs. Fix the long loading screens. This game would be sooooo much more popular if it weren't for the issues with the preformance.Also putting certain mechanics that belong to a certain killer in DLC is a BAD idea. I honestly regret buying Spark of Madness before properly looking at it.",Dead by Daylight

2017-05-29,0,0,57,False,Recommended,This game is awesome I have been very impressed so far with the game mechanics. It seems like any time there are any bugs they are fixed relatively quickly. I would say however I would love for there to be some kind of story mode like in Left for Dead. The game does at time feel repetitive but it s especially fun to enjoy with friends. At times some of the killers seem to be way over powered and the Haddonfield map is way too small especially when playing with an overpowered player. I would say the enjoyment of this game all depends on the players you are matched with. Some of the killers like to camp which make it impossible to save your allies so if you do start playing don't do that it just makes the game boring. I d also like to see a few other changes like a better chance to escape hooks.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-10,0,0,192,False,Recommended,I really want to like this game. It's such a fantastic idea and on the border of being great but it has just too many problems to recommend. If you're a low level killer you'll be paired up with undoubtedly several high level survivors and chances are they will win with little to no effort. If you're a survivor it'll take forever to find a match (if you even do) and then it's hit or miss on how well the game will perform which depends on the host's internet and the host seems to be the killer. Pretty massively unbalanced gameplay latency issues due to the lack of dedicated servers clunky mechanics (which I can overlook on their own but in combination with latency problems they become pretty unbearable) poor optimization and the few exploits in the game such as window spams make this game not worth my time. Maybe it'll be patched in the future and polished out to be fantastic but it just didn't there yet. Save your money for now and wait for improvement or another asymmetrical serial killer game. Update So it's been a full year or so since I wrote this recommendation and I have to say the game has improved a ton. You can still be paired against a person with significantly better perks than you which sucks but the lag issue has been somewhat handled glitches and other problems have been worked on substantially and there is a ton more content now in new killers maps and survivors. I recommend it whole heartedly now but just keep in mind that it isn't a perfect experience.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-01,0,0,1272,False,Not Recommended,Hi people of the fog (or whatever) since my last review (that i had to delete because you can only have one of the same game on your acc at a time) a lot has changed... many bugs have been fixed and some t has stopped but that does NOT mean that there isnt anything new i can complain about. my nerves are limited too so i figured its time for a little break for me. NEGATIVE THINGS camping oh boy where do i start. well dear killers you can call it patrolling or try to justify your t but we all know you arent leaving the hook because youre too incompetent to secure a kill otherwise. i dont say its easy to be the killer but its harder being a survivor most of the time because there are rarely any killers who dont camp and seriously online game developers shouldnt tollerate camping because it simply ruins all the fun. pallet looping survivors do it a lot but ive got to say its not as common as camping. its annoying when theres trolls who just run from pallet to pallet because it completely ruins the fun for the killer and that leads me to the next point facecamping due to bad behaviour when you use a game mechanic like sabotage you can bet that youll be facecamped (killer stands in front of the hook and waits for you to die) and that is completely ridiculous. you shouldnt be given a punishment for using a game mechanic. thats absolutely unacceptable and im sick and tired of this t. traps under hooks (1.4) of course it makes more sense that youre trapped when you step on them but when camping is such a big thing you cant just buff traps that hard. killer variety all i get in nearly every second match is the trapper. im seriously tired of this. unbalanced gameplay the perks completely ruin the game because some are way too overpowered. dear devs when you dont have any ideas what to implement think more instead of adding a horrible idea just to have more content (deerstalker whispers self care iron grasp) killer speed most killers are faster than driving cars and then they have this walking animation and are faster than running survivors (dafuq) matchmaking jesus i almost missed this point. when youre playing alone you can find a lobby relatively fast as a survivor but most killers just dodge the lobbies because you either have a certain item character etc. but you as a survivor cant see who the killer is. quitterbonus survivors have this sometimes when the killer disconnects BUT by far not everytime and when your allies leave you get NOTHING. survivors dont get enough points already so why the pls. this could be fixed easy as but i dont even know what the devs are doing the points killers get way more obviously because they cant die so theyre there the whole match and survivors cant really fill the survival category which makes no sense because you do anything to survive as a survivor so this is t. if you dont survive youre not going to pip that easily because its not rare that you die at the start of the match because as mentioned killers camp A LOT and btw the bloodweb is so big that after a match you can hardly buy 4 items and then theres like 15 more to buy until you reach the next level perks most of them are very strong and a must have like sprint burst and then theres some like the hex perks or hope that are straight up pointless. dlcs too expensive for the amount of content they bring with them (for example 80s dlc only cheap reskins with 8 pieces for three bucks (srsly what the devs i can do a better job with photoshop)GOOD THINGS the devs seem to care a little more than they did but of course they should make the main decisions bloodpoint weekends the time you get double points every match is needed because you dont get enough in a match free dlcs they might will happen more often which is great some community members most of them are absolutely cancerous and just insult everyone but from time to time you find really nice and flashy people but to be fair everyones a lot because this game can really make you upset so yeah. concept great but the way they did this... it was better when it came out characters mostly creative and unique fan service some animations and easter eggs you can see which horror movie theyve been picked out of fixes they come frequently and solve some problems but you see that the devs can care a lot if they want to i cant think of much more things that are either good or bad. as things are now you should definitely not buy the game. and btw if you are offended reading the complain points then so sorry but that just underlines that youre doing things that ruin the game and obviously i play more survivor and im not saying that only one side can be hard but some points are just that annoying that this game is slowly dying and need to stop. im sure that some people can relate to this so if you have any updates to the points or want to bring anything to my attention i have a lot of time on my hands at the moment.,Dead by Daylight

Hell I wouldn't even spend half that on it simpy because I don't think it's that great.The concept is okay of course but the game is repetitive the perk and item system seem clunky at best and serve to artifically keep people interested in the game. Think about it how fun is it when the only excuse for playing a game is to grind out something new? Some may see this as a positive of course but certainly not for me. The game also feels lackluster with the supposed horror atmosphere. Sure it's dark but there's nothing that really keeps you on edge unless you perhaps are facing someone who really knows how to screw with you. That's not to say that I hate everything about the game though some of the killers look spot on and have a great backstory. However it just feels like a bit of a letdown to have good monsters (at least lore wise) in a meh game. The lore behind what brought said killers there is also interesting for sure. I'll not spoil it here look into it elsewhere.Overall I'd give the game a 4/10. It could certainly be improved though I doubt the devs have the same thing in mind that I do.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-14,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,Firstly i have to start with saying that i do realy enjoy this game it is quite possibly the best think outside the box multiplayer game on steam and now also on the xbox one and the ps4........now hold that thought.I have been playing dead by daylight since almost its initial release on steam in fact it was the first game that i installed on my at the time newly built gaming rig the game game immedietly surprised me with just how different it was to anything else that had been on the market to date seeing the struggle from 2 real purspectives 1 being as the almost helpless survivor desperetly trying to survive and escape and then theres the killer hunting and scaring the living daylights out of the unsuspecting survivors.Now back to the differences that i have noticed between the pc version and console versions of the game and there are many !alot more time and care has been put into the console versions of the game and that is evident from just the graphics compared to the pc im running the game on ultra settings and on a 4k widscreen monitor so the game is pushed to as high as the pc can take it and it looks nowhere near as good as the ps4 version!!! with the amount of updates that this game gets you would think there would be a massive amount of content but i am yet to play any map other than the cornfield and the damaged building map im aware there are alot of other maps but they never cycle through i have sunk over 20 hours into this game and tried all possible setups to no prevail.since release there have been less than a handfull of new characters added and next to no new customization options whatsoever even though there are alot of empty slots that are clearly visible in the customization menu.In retrospect i am not slandering this game and telling you to avoid it like the black death however what i will say is there is still much that needs to be addressed with this game esspescially not that there are real alternatives in the market that come from a major motion picture franchise which from personal experience improves on every short coming of dead by daylight.This is well worth the money when on sale but at its present state i can only happily give Dead by daylight a 7/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-29,0,0,86,False,Recommended,This is a very fun and interactive game but once you get the basics down is incredibly fun! It took me at least 10 20 games to survive a full round as the survivor and get more than 2 kills as the killer but once you get used the the gameplay it becomes much easier. ost of the cons for the game were bugs. These have largley been fixed and are very seldom at least in my experience with only one or 2 actual game glitches that I can remember. This is after playing for a good amount and the game stays interesting with new maps and killers every couple of months. Highly recommend this game,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-19,0,0,564,False,Recommended,This game is mad fun when you can play. Many times I have been stuck at the lobby and had to end the program because of bugs/freezing/etc. It is extremely frustrating. On top of that many times you will find your allies have been disconnected and you end up being ed. On the alternate side you get a victory after only playing 5 minutes. Bugs need to be fixed before they continue to add more killers/survivors. I cant recommend this game until something has been done to make it run more efficiently. 5/29/17 update Survive with friends (SWF) has gotten better. There are still some issues but not as many as there was orginally. I'd reccomend getting this if it was on sale. At the current state I would not buy at full price. The mechanics of the game has been changed recently I am like 50/50 on the new updates. Not super happy but not super upset. Overall its a fun game but que. times are still pretty long (except during bloodhunts).,Dead by Daylight
2017-05-29,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Really fun to play but matchmaking is terrible takes forever to find a game if one can be found at all this is really an issue that needs to be fixed could possibly be fixed by allowing matchmaking to happen between multiple countires instead of within induvidual countries that way matchmaking would be much faster (though this may create extra lag).,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-14,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I did get to play this for free and am writing this review during the FREE to Play weekend 2017 Sept 14 so I only have a couple of hours invested the game so far. Its not one I'll be buying though! Its basically just a game of 'TAG' for adults. Mostly I spent MOST of my gameplay time sitting in the lobby waiting for enough players to join and then stop messing about going 'unready' and then changing their character etc. It might not seem like a lot but even just 3 minuts sat waiting for a game to start is a very long time when your leisure time is as valuable as mine is. (re having to work for a living)..!I am not good at playing it yet... But my first thoughts are... I don't think that the game is very well balanced as I played both as a killer and a survivor maybe its just not my kind of game but when I was running away from killers I could never move fast enough to escape yet playing as the same killer I could not catch the survivors at all. So how does that work? If all the other players are at about the same level as me then why can I not succeed with any aspect of the game?Its a little like those cop cars in GTA5 where on the whole 'when' you are driving them they are not super fast cars yet when you are being chased by them they can ram you up the A**** even though you are driving a lambo at 150mph.Out of balance...They should have a score board where everytime you evade a killer you earn 10 points after the killer has seen you but then loses you (they did this to some extent and I did score 250 I think for evasion of a killer)... But from the killers perspective you should gain poins for finding the target but then have them reduce by half if they evade and hide.If that is what is supposed to happen that was not what I experienced. People literally in front of me who I'd even managed to hack once then vanished from view.... What's that about.. Yet when I was hit by a killer I was always down for the count everytime... As the killer I stood over a target who was crouched and unaware I was even there. I struck him from behind and yet he was able to limp away even faster than I could go. Not any fun nor realistic.. (Not that I've chased and killed anyone for real (recently)! Not as far as I remember anyway...,Dead by Daylight

It's been out for over a year now and they still haven't fixed issus that have been present since day one. The game is a 4v1 experience with an incredible bias towards the ""1"" that being the killer.The core issue to the whole game is the fact that it's a pvp game that gives the killer full control to either be nice and let everyone have a fun match (I don't mean not killing just not camping/trolling) or they can absolutely ruin the whole experience for all 4 other players. Got some rare items? The killer can not only see them ahead of time by design but he can also disconnect at the start of the match or tamper with his connection to force you to disconnect (no dedicated servers) and force you to lose your stuff. They can literally single out one player and effectively remove them from the game the first time they catch them by face camping them on the hook STILL after over a year. You wanna let some random nobody online choose if you get to have fun with the game you purchased? I know that I don't.I haven't really played the game in a while but I had to write this review when I remembered how bad the devs keep crapping on it with every update.

It's about surviving against a killer and helping out your teammates. Escaping and leaving no one behind is the main objective of this game. I love the leveling up mechanics. It was such a clever way to gain more levels. The balance between the killer and survivors is fantastic. Killers aren't to OP to the point where survivors have no chance. It all depends on how you go about your strategy. In general this game is fantastic well scripted and needs to be given a lot of credit.

2016-12-25,0,0,466,False,Recommended,This game is hella fun WHEN IT WORKS! Most of the time you get stuck on the lobby loading screen and the only way to get out of it is shutting it down from Task Manager. It's no longer Early Access and they've YET to work on the bug that causes equipped items to be rendered useless which has been around since conception. Every time they update this game the old bugs are still there and new bugs are found yet they continue to add new monsters and survivors. GUYS! STOP! If you don't fix these bugs you are really going to lose your following. I know many who have given up on this game because of the bugs. Love this game but the issues make me give up when I can only successfully get into one match out of five or six attempts! Really gets annoying.Okay so since the time of the post they have made a lot of improvements on the mechanics of the game HOWEVER they have severely broken the survivor/killer balance. If you play games to be competitive or if you are a competitive player by nature DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME! They have built it so that you WILL die. If you're killer is leveled you are going to die. If you have a team that doesn't work together you are going to die. If your team is not on voice together you are going to die. They continually make it easier and easier for killers to kill you. They are encouraging killers to camp you (much like corpse camping so you can't rez/respawn). If you have friends who own the game though and you queue with them it is worth getting. Fun to hear your noob friends get salty (please be sure to be nice to them because you were there at one point too tell them to stop caring and shake it off). Play it like you're in a horror movie expect that you're going to die but have fun doing it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-21,0,0,78,False,Recommended,I was a little skeptical when it came to this game and what it was. However my opinion had a complete change after delving deep into the violent escapades of this great game. Playing as the killer makes you feel like a badass once you get the hang of how each of the unique killer plays. Each gratifying hit sacrifice and kill has you coming back for more. Using any of the survivors that are available have great perks that help you and your teammates thwart the killers attempts to sacrifice you all. Playing by yourself can be a bit frustrating in my opinion but if you bring along a couple of friends to play around with you'll have a lot more fun. I totally recommend giving this game a try if you haven't already. Bloody good time.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-05,0,0,669,False,Recommended,I really like the idea of this co op game four survivors trying to escape from the killer cool maps great music I also like the perks offerings and bloodweb system even tho it gets a while to understad how it works I enjoyed it so much at the start..BUT after some time i get sooo anoyed by this ing matchmaking system its the worst thing on this game.. sometimes you can play 5games in a row without huge problem but sometimes it takes so much ing time to get into a game so meanwhile i could complete whole Witcher 3 story. Last time i was waiting for 50mins to get into game it joined me into the lobby like 15 times but after few seconds i got kicked out every ing time I even tried to restart the game twice didnt help.. AND then when you get lucky and get through this ing matchmaking system into a game you can play for few minutes until you get caught by the killer and then he stands right next to you so other survivors cant get you out of the hook and after that you can wait another half hour.. so yeah camping killers are the second worst thing on the game + few more bugs but it dont bothers me so much.Still i would recommend this game sometimes you get really good matches with helpful cooperative teammates and non camping killer so it can be very enjoyable.. and i hope the matchmaking system will get fixed one day. 7/10 EDIT Okay so one day after i wrote this review i have to add one more thing that happpened to me just now and as i read the forum im not only one who had this problem..Today I just strated the game as casual and wanted to play some more of this loading simulator but suddenly all my progress is gone all character levels perks bloody clothes everything is lost... tried to restart steam and recover my save files but naah everything is gone....(got some bloodpoints as an apology from devs for loosing my characters after i wrote them email)I dont want to say this but i have to.. this game is ing trash it could by awesome game i like the idea so much as i said at the beginning but the devs ruined it so much i feel like they dont give a about this game anymore they adding more characters and killers but cant fix the main problems which been here for more then year as i have seen in the forum.. FeelsBadMan (UPDATE After half a year i started to play this game again and yay! matchmaking got fixed! + they added some more new stuff like new killers maps and few more thing so i guess i'll again fall into this game ) Keep it this way and you'll get awesome game!

2018-01-03,0,0,287,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is one of those games where you pick up and cry the first ten hours (this applies for both playing as survivor or killer). But then you get a hang of the game and start to enjoy actualy accomplishing tasks during a game. There is a bit of a grind due to the bloodpoints system but by the time you get a hang of the game you should have acquired enough bloodpoints to have decent perks to play with. In regards to balancing the devs do a subpar job. The updates come a bit later than they should but the devs do listen (sometimes a bit too much). The community obviously has the toxic bunch but there are also a lot of fun and humorous players that make it enjoyable in my opinion.Overall I rate Dead by Daylight 8/10 . I would suggest to look up a video or two to see how it actually plays out. If it interests you definitely give it a try. However if it doesn't then save the $20 or $10(if on sale). However personally I would say give it a try.Update (May 13th 2018) I changed my vote from a recommendation to a non recommendation. The devs are not doing enough to fix the game it's sad really such a pioneer of a game tossed into the dumpster because of the lack of effort and commitment from the devs. They just turned money hungry now and will only do what benefits them not the players and the community both survivor and killer mains. Don't buy the game it's not worth it anymore simple as that.,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-28,0,0,1647,False,Not Recommended,Date on review 12/2/2017. So this is edited because there was a few things that where updated and where pretty neat fixes so im still gonna say that I dont recommend it because it gets boring after playing it awhile played it since last year december and have 1300 hours on record as im typing this. So camping still a thing. Not as bad as before so C+. Autoaim is ok B . The Dead By Daylight Community D+. Some positives are that some recent updates seem to be making the game an improvement. Playable with a group of 4 people Fun sometimes rewards that you can exclusively get makes people have more to get in the game and gives more to offer. Fixed CampingNOTES 1. Could be boring after playing alot.2. Alot of toxic peeps.3. Kinda balanced4. Still think its a bit killer sided but not by much.Anyways just a short review (Would have put a thumbs up on this but its just not as fun for me since Ive played it for a good amount of time),Dead by Daylight

Hitboxes are really poor when using the killer 4. Nerf ALL killer perks as it makes it way too easy for the killers to win every game! 5. Move hooks more than 5m apart and give the survivors a fair chance at escaping the killer it has little bugs which is a plus but the overall game needs attention to balance the game for both killer and survivors.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-23,0,0,215,False,Recommended,The concept of the game looked very good the gameplay was simple but still very good. Pros + The experience of horror was executed well.+ Working together with friends was fun.+ The bonus items and perks were well developed.+ Price isn't that bad.Cons You couldn't play with friends in the start Trying to find a game could last hours (with friends you had to wait years to find a lobby) Too many bugs. (You could glitch in rocks 50% of the time you joined nothing ... ) Some things werent very balanced there were a lot of spots that could be easily abused. Camping a hook as killer isn't fun. Even though the killer has a disadvantage with doing that. Especially when you are playing with friends and they are being camped so you cant save them. Not fun for a killer and not fun for the survivor.Some of the big bugs have been fixed by now.

It really helped with the balance and some of the overall ""jankiness"" of the game. There are still issues but they're getting adressed.

Earlier review The worst netcode I've ever put up with.The game is pretty good but the delays to find a match to play in are inexcusable for a game that has been released for so long. If one of the survivors disconnects during match setup you get to strap in for a solid 2 minute wait while the horrible netcode decides that the missing player is indeed missing. Frustrating everyone else who is waiting to start a game.I'd love to recommend but whoever is responsible for this game's matchmaking and particularly for its netcode needs to be hung on a hook and left to die.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-18,0,0,961,False,Not Recommended,"Dead by Daylight. Ah. A very nice friendly creature. You open it and you are welcomed to a very nice intro aswell as background music with original characters such as the Trapper Wraith Hillbilly Doctor Nurse &amp the Hag. Along with famous horror film characters such as Freddy Krueger &amp Micheal Myers. 4 against 1 in a place no one has seen. In a very haunting Situation very scary game. Expect that all of the things I have described only occurs when you get the game and only have 0 10 hours maybe even shorter. The game is as repitivitve as it gets. Unfortunately the developers keep tricking players into buying killers that are used to make the game as unrepitivite as possible with maps survivors and new killers as well as perks and offerings to change the odds. However people only focus on the best for the survivor which is usually the most toxic. When I played as a noob I loved the game to my heart now having it uninstalled and out of my list of games. I had 998 hours or something due to being sucked into the DLCs. The game gets boring after finishing a lot of generators. Opening a lot of gates Camping a lot of survivors. The usual. The game reminds me of my uncle friendly nice and overall rich fun dad I wish I had. To having sexual intercourses under the bed in the tell it turns purple. Overwall rating 4.8 Gentlemens outta 10.

2017-07-02,0,0,82,False,Recommended,After a few hours of gameplay what i can say is that this game has a lot to offer but could use a bit of work here and there. I can say that it was one of the best experiences of my gaming life (also because i love this type of game like Friday the 13th The game) for my first 5 hours untill i noticed somethings that could be worked on. First thing's first the survivors i believe that the balance in between the task we have to acomplish as a survivor is quite at the level of what was expected it's challanging and it's fun at the same time exept when we are a unballanced level of players the matchmaking on this game is not the best. I at the time have 15 hours of gameplay and i already got to be in a game with people that played for 700 hours and i ended up by ruining their experience of the game i believe that we could use some ballance not only for the survivors but for the players in general what i mean is that the survivors and the killers should be at the same level of gameplay to ballance the games. Now killers there are a few killers they are not the best but we could say that they are decent but they are not scary enough the challange is allways the same and it's not scary after a while me on my personal opinion believe that the game could have something more scary a new scarier character or some jumpscares during the game for as much as i enjoy it during a game (but after i think that it could use a bit more of that) to be calm to focus on my task i would like to know allways that i am being hunted ant the killer is allways present during the game maybe you guys should consider putting an ingame enviroment music to keep the pressure. Now there's one specific killer that i would like to give a opinion that has bugging me from the begining the nurse is way too op.. i mean.. cmon.. she can tp eveywhere and it doesn't affect her.. whe allways get fuc*ed when a nurse is in the game.. Please consider lowering ther abilities and add a debuff or something to give us a shot to escape. One more thing.. if it's possible.. consider optimizing the game for people with lower pc builds are able to play..Concluding it's a great game and i love to play it but this things kinda trip me. I hope this game goes far and keeps on getting content (and also a new gamemode plz).,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-20,0,0,463,False,Recommended,"I've owned Dead by Daylight for about a year or so as of writing this review. Originally when I bought Dead by Daylight I wasn't so much into the game. There were plenty of bugs and it just wasn't appealing to me. I told myself I would just wait for a ""quality game"" ( i.e. Friday the 13th) to be released. Fast forward to that ""quality game"" being released and all the drama exploits/glitches and etc that followed it drove me away and I came back to Dead by Daylight to give it another chance. I'm glad I did. The game has really improved since I last had played it and it's really enjoyable playing with friends. On the topic of playing with friends as much fun as it is matchmaking with SWF (survive with friends) can take FOREVER. It's a shame when you're in a SWF wtih three in a party and the matchmaking takes anywhere from 20 40 minutes. It could take longer but I refused to wait and we ended up just playing a private match. I hope in time the developers do fix this issue perhaps making groups a priority in matchmaking but I don't know the answer to fix this issue. Besides that matter Dead by Daylight is super fun and enjoyable.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-22,0,0,11,False,Recommended,First Impressions Basically this game is all about surviving from the killer in which you need to activate generators to unlock the door to escape but there's a catch the killer is there to prevent your escape by killing all of you. Points are given for each objective met. You can play either as a killer or a survivor. Killer would have to host. If you do not like the concept or the game where you find it to be quite redundant then it is not the right one for you I suggest for you to search it up on youtube for its gameplay.I've never played the beta hence I do not know what are the problems then. Despite a few glitches here and there I can say that I'm satisfied with the game thus far. Those glitches do not hinder the gameplay too much but if they are fixed then it is much appreciated. Playing online is a gamble sometimes its silky smooth and sometimes its just plain laggy. The lobby matchmaking needs some revamp in terms of getting to play with your friends online in the same lobby and not always reshuffling to get into the same lobby with your friends (I see that a lot online). I really like how they cut off the communication in game online as to avoid cheating and also stripping away the fun from it. Honestly the ranking system is broke and it needs to be fixed but I'm a casual player so I don't really mind about it. From the games I've played so far there are two types of killer. One the killer would camp after hooking you up 2nd the killer would hunt for other survivors giving them chance to save those that are hooked. I definitely prefer the latter to spice up the gameplay. Sadly the mass majority camps at the hooked survivor and awaits for him/her to die which is kinda a kill joy. A way to counter this is to slowly die by the hands of the killer so that you can stall time for other survivors to fix the generators. Since this game is new I am more than happy to give the devs a chance to improve the game and also adding more content to it.If you're willing to look beyond the ugly side of this game then you're going to have heaps of fun playing it.I can easily recommend this game to anyone if you have the extra buck to go for it. Otherwise if you think that this game is not suitable for you you can do your wallet a favour by keeping it fat. Cheers D,Dead by Daylight

The only problem I have with this game is that it does have a lot of glitches! (and the matchmaking is stupid XD) but it's still really fun despite that. Good to play with friends and with strangers!EDIT They've fixed a lot of stuff now! The matchmaking is great and there are a few glitches now and then but nothing like it used to be!,Dead by Daylight

The devs are clueless have no idea on how to properly balance a game and overall just don't know how to make a good game. Being toxic is the only thing that keeps this game alive. Because it keeps people coming back to get payback on each other. Without people abusing game mechanics the game is boring. And the way the devs are pushing this game it's going to get even more boring.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-01,0,0,1067,False,Not Recommended,The idea and concept about this game is good and interesting. At first I love this game so much but played these much hours. The reason that I not that recommend this game. First fix those lagging and delay please seriously. Sometimes the ping show up just for looking or what? It still got in game when i run it just move back the location before and get hit by killers. And some of the killer still need to nerf example like the Doctor when get to level 2 punishment just have fake doctor but NOT TO SHOW THE LOCATION to the killer. Next is about the ranking system just let those similar rank player find each other please not let a rank 20 15 encounter those high rank like 1 10.This is make it more worst that can let a player quit this game. Honestly I hope official read about player's review and feedback.Please take action to make this game better and better. Don't let new players lost their faith and hope of this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,"Dead by Daylight also known as ""Murdered by Morning "" ""Slaughtered by Sunrise "" ""Annihilated by AM "" ""Culled by Cockedoodle "" and ""I'm Having Too Much Fun With This The Game "" is an asymmetrical player versus player murder simulator in which one player controls a friendly masked killer and four other players control superhuman mutes with the ability to sprint at supersonic speeds. Activate five generators to power the exit gates of a magical murder realm and skedaddle your way out to safety but beware for the killer is angry.Just angry.If you're looking to play with friends (even though the game was NEVER designed and is absolutely not balanced for people able to communicate over an outside VOIP client) and gleefully repair generators to the merry tune of people screaming on meathooks this game is for you a highly lethal and entertaining game of hide and seek.If you want to BE the masked psycho killer do NOT buy this game. The community hates you. The devs hate you. The balance of power is hideously skewed in the survivors' favor and it's NEVER going to change. You won't have very much fun after you rack up a level or two and the matchmaking system makes doing anything with your lower level killers nigh impossible as you'll be constantly matched against better skilled better coordinated players with a full set of overpowered standard perks. Any attempt at securing a kill will get you screamed at. Even if you're new expect to be teabagged infinitely looped and mocked in the after game chat.If you want to play as a survivor this is the game for you. If you want to play as a survivor with your friends you're cancer but this is still the game for you. If you want to play as a killer buckle up buttercup you're in for a wild ride of disappointment and frustration.",Dead by Daylight

2017-08-15,0,0,16,False,Recommended,I played this game when it first came out like around a year ago haven't really touched it ever since because I got other games on hand to finish. Generally speaking I would recommend this game.The gameplay is challenging on both sides perhaps more challenging if you're playing as the killer. The atmosphere is creepy the graphics the sound and the general feeling that you're being watched/you are the evil. The gameplay is fun on both sides. As a killer you have the evil fun of hunting people down you have to be smart set traps ambush or simply chase em down. As the survivor you have to be smart as well using surrounding enviornment to hide yourself fixing generators strategically and cooperate or not cooperate with your teammate.I can only think of two downsides of this game. First is the connection issue. The game is P2P based. I can see the reasoning behind the P2P mode since each gameplay requires only 5 people at most. However P2P can be really laggy and annoying sometimes. Also you can only host a game by being the killer and there are way more people who wanna be survivors than killers at least this was the situation when I played this game. As a result a lot of times when I wanted to be a survivor I ended up not finding a game in 3 4 mins (and around 1/3 of the times I joined a game there were connection issues thanks to P2P). The second downside is the upgrade mechanics the upgrade is something I was not really comfortable with even after around 8 hrs into the game. I don't think any intelligently designed leveling system should make a player feel this way. Many of the items are one time only use which is kind of upsetting consider you put so many bloodpoints to get the upgrade.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-05,0,0,34,False,Recommended,I did initially write a bad review for this game but they have fixed a lot of issues that plagued the game when it was released.The game is much better now the concept is good the atmosphere is creepy (initially obviously with all games that you play for a while the atmosphere of it wears off). The killers seem relatively balanced. The one thing they could change is that when you're against a rank 1 killer but you're a rank 20 survivor it'd be nice if they could somehow scale the perks so that it's more of a level playing field. If a killer has all the best perks and is against 4 level 20s with one bad perk it's going to be fairly easy for the killer to win.The DLCs add some freshness to the game and are worth picking up if you have some spare change just to keep the game feeling new.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-19,0,0,1304,False,Recommended,Love this game played it a lot and would play it a lot more with survive with friends but sadly the matchmaking issues/killer dodgers make this game very frustrating to play especially with how much of a grind it is to level up. I will gladly change this review to positive when this issue is resolved.EDIT Game is so much better now the main problem mentioned here has been fixed. Although matchmaking does need adjusting so survivors and killers are of similar rank (sometimes works sometimes doesn't) i have high expectations that the devs will fix this. As for the killer dodging survivors in lobbies they have now hidden all the survivors information so they can't differentiate people from each other.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-11,0,0,451,False,Recommended,This game is a blast. I've been playing since the beginning and I have to say this game has come quite a long way. First of all the diversity of the gameplay is incredible and because of that the replayability of this game is high. You can choose to gain expertise as a survivor role or a killing role as a myriad of survivors and killers all with their own unique detailed backstories. They are constantly adding update DLC's to the game and have incorporated killers from Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street among their own original killers. The game is extremely competitive and way more active than Friday the 13th The Game at a lower pricetag. Downsides are that competitive ranking does not result in any rewards and that servers are not dedicated so that killer hosts the server every time.8.5/10,Dead by Daylight

The game finally is in a playable state (It probably has been for at least a few months but I hadn't touched the game again until the release of The Huntress). It seems the game is more or less balanced at this point. I did not previously recommend the game but now I do. I will say that I am a bit dissapointed the developers are making more killers from Copyrighted work. Although it can be cool to see a killer from a movie you like I think the game should just focus more on original killers make something cool. It's not a big enough problem to hate the game and I am also happy that even though there are so many DLC killers and survivors the base/free survivors and killers is still all you need to compete.,Dead by Daylight

It has some bugs(not getting some achievements hair not appearing correctly etc) and as all games its irritating momments and its exciting momments. One major downside is that with every end of a season there is no Rank reward making the rank system kinda useless cause a lot of players prefer to derank and play with lower level survivor/killers than the high rank hardcores who might camp and tunel so they don't lose their rank! That is also what makes it kinda boring after a certain point at least for me. One last thing...Customer support who? what? when?

2018-01-04,0,0,210,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game because my friends are playing it. I've done a few survivor matches and a few killer matches. I've got to say it is fun. Sometimes. It makes your heart beat and if you're playing with friends it can be even more fun. Pros 1. It's fun to hear your friends scream as they get startled. 2. As the killer if you main him you can let off some steam. 3. It forces you to get REALLY good at map awareness. Cons 1. If you're like me and super late to the gaming scene THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU YET. It's got a VERY steep learning curve as is evidenced by the fact that I'm usually the first person murdered in every game. I'm mostly unlucky but I understand that I lack practice with basic controls. I've yet to get the hang of straffing and my ability to remember my surroundings for kiting purposes sucks. 2. The comunity is a mixed bag. As a brand new rank 20 killer I'm still trying to get the hang of what I'm supposed to be doing (Where are the tutorials?) and as a result you get people who taunt you a lot in game and then after game the sheer amount of toxicity is huge. Also being held hostage in a game is VERY real as players trying to get those last few blood points will sit around in the game hiding while you're struggling to look for them just so you can move on with your life. Then they tell you you're bad and should do other things. Or they call you a camper if you're just trying to get one person for some blood points. 3. There is no tutorial. Not really. It's a LOT of writing with interactable stuff but it doesn't REALLY teach you about game play. This is why the learning curve is kind of HUGE. 4. THE RANKING SYSTEMS SUCKS. Every month the 'ranks' reset. This means you have people who are a high rank mingling with the lower ranks. This isn't the worst. It means that you as a BRAND NEW PLAYER will now be pitted against people who have THOUSANDS of hours in this game. But wait there is more! They can STILL be rank 20 with maxed out perks and STILL PURPOSEFULLY be in the low ranks so that they can have an easy slaughterfest and then tell you to kill yourself or worse. There is no way for you to really improve if you're constantly first dead with NO IDEA what you did wrong. This game is NOT for people who are looking for a group of friendly fun. The community is against friedship the developers don't care about my very last most important con. If you don't believe me please try playing League of Legends as a new player and pitting your might against the Diamond ranks. It's not fun. It's not REMOTELY fun. Neither is this game.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-24,0,0,542,False,Not Recommended,Fun game but terrible matchmaking where people with 5 hours in game can be matched up against people with 1000 hours in game. Progression in the game isn't just rank and skill. It's based off unlockable items mechanics which the longer you play the more you're able to hop into games on *your* terms rather than someone else's. So if you queue up as a killer not only do you have to account for the skill gap between you and the survivors but whatever items and perks they have packing. With a full set of four very rare perks and a matching very rare item a single survivor can get a generator up and running in 30 seconds easy. Nevermind the sabotaging of every hook except the four in the basement which you won't be able to carry them that far so they get dropped and you have to chase them down again to down them to drop them again. Same goes for survivor it's a steep learning curve on how to deal with each individual killer and what to and what not to do. You are pitted against people that are decked out 100% with perks they've spent hundreds of hours acquiring in a specific combination to f*** you over and it's up to you to figure out just how they're going to do that. Don't get me wrong it's a fun game but it has terrible balance via the shoddy matchmaking system.,Dead by Daylight

The game has now been extremely fun since its release and now the devs are not looking entirely at the money but more onto the side of fun and balance. Even though it may have a little bit of bugs it sure is still fun as it can get! Atm the game is abit fair now with its blood point system such that camping is not advisable since one wouldn't be able to get that much points! Also if the killer face camps the crap out of you(just by standing infrnt of person you need to save) just do all the generators so he gets minimal blood points.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-21,0,0,1510,False,Not Recommended,I purchased the game close to its release and I have to say that this is probably one of the most toxic unfinished one sided game I have ever played. The developers don't know what they are doing the game has been consistently broken since it came out and the developers have barely scratched the surface with rectifications. Points disappearing SWF games crashing no prompt response from devs when an issue has been highlighted plus they constantly upload one 'dev stream' a week which consists of them chatting one load of rubbish with no relation to the games problems adding to this is the lack of communication aswell to their community.Killers seem to gain more respect and what I mean by this is if the killers side complains about a certain perk/survivor/complainaboutanythingandeverythingthatsurvivorshas then the devs prioritise that... When it comes to a survivor complaint its put at the back of the shelf left to gather dust! Killers gain more speed perks that let you actually see survivors on the map the new dlc with Freddy is absurd there is a perk that stops survivors from escaping if he hooks the obsession.Fk this game Fk the devs and any game they release I would boycott!,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-03,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is very unique in the play style it has the player can either turn on all of the generators and escape together with their teammates or they can turn on 4 and wait until all of their teammates are dead to escape through a trapdoor. This game has scary moments due to the unpredictable behavior of each player and it has some funny moments to such as friendly killers or glitches. One thing that may annoy impatient players is the long load times. These vary depending on your location but the can get very annoying. Once you are in a game you can be killed faster than the time it took for you to even get in. Overall Dead by Daylight is a good game for players who like strategic games that require teamwork.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-27,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"Initial impression after first couple of matches At first I really didn't think this game was anything special given that there is no story or single player campaign. So I continued playing and I realized how interesting and addicting it truly is. I think given what appears to be a ""low budget"" in nature and the reliance on solely a multiplayer platform the the graphics gameplay skills and abilities that the survivors and killer can use is what makes this game a success. I'm willing to bet if you're a serious gamer you could think otherwise however as a casual gamer This has to rank somewhere between an 8 and a 9 solely because of the lacking campaign/story function.Impression after a few hours However after playing this for a little longer now I am beginning to see why this is receiving negative reviews. It is terribly unbalanced. Survivors are overly exploiting perks and abilities (or cheating) in such a way that as one person playing the killer makes it impossible to keep up. Honestly at this point I really wish I could get a refund for this game. Game rating 3/10",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-31,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"This is one very unique game. I never thought I'd find myself playing something like this. It's not part of a normal ""genre"". It's 4 survivors versus a bloodthirsty killer (there are multiple types with each their own ability) and you have to survive and escape. You've got to power generators whilst also hiding or running from a killer that is faster than you. There are perks to unlock items to get through a unique system of spending ""bloodpoints"" in a ""bloodweb"". It's all really well done and keeps you wanting to play. But the main draw is the game is just fun especially when you play with 3 other friends. You get an amazing feeling when you juke a killer or slam a pallet on their head and you do genuinely feel your heart racing when you find yourself crouched in a corner and the killer steams passed you and doesn't see you.I'd recommend anyone to at least try this game (you can always refund within 2 hours on steam).

2018-01-23,0,0,431,False,Recommended,It s a very great game even if you have over 300 hours it s still fun to play. So many Killer and survivors you can level and play how YOU like. A bad point is that the games can be so short because of how fast the gens can pop which Killer makes camp so they get a guaranteed kill and maybe some others who try to help. Another bad thing is that the community is one of the if not the most toxic one i ever saw.,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-23,0,0,793,False,Recommended,If you're looking for a deeply immersive horror game that will constantly keep you in a state of panicked awareness this is not the game for you. The scare factor of the different killers begins to wear off after only a few hours of gameplay and once you understand the game enough you'll likely begin to toy with the killer often leading to your death. However if youre looking for a fun party game to play with a few friends casually or another game to grind out points to upgrade your survivors and killers this is definetely worth the 20$ asking fee.As for the DLC you don't need any of the dlc to have fun or build your characters properly. However if you have a few dollars now and then you could probably pick up some of the DLC. But AGAIN you do NOT have to buy the DLC to play the game to it's fullest extent. In fact all of the teachable perks from the survivors and killers included in the DLCs can be aquired simply by playing the game to aquire shards and buying them off of the weekly shrine for 550 (sometimes 750) respectively.So for $20 yes this game is worth it to buy. I advise that you come into this game ready for toxicity and saltiness because no matter what you do or how you play whether it be survivor or killer someone will always complain about how you play.Only real downside to this game is it's lack of a casual mode without rankings. The only gamemode that doesn't include a ranking system is Kill Your Friends which is a private lobby mode. However if you dont care for rankings and don't mind toxicity you should have an issue.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-30,0,0,174,False,Recommended,This game is great. A great premise and a great format. There are a few issues but some of them are just inherent to the game itself.1. You're first couple rounds of survivor are actually pretty scary. After about match 10 it just becomes a game a great game but no longer heart pounding scary. So if you have a family member you want to scare the crap out of the investment is well worth it.2. Balance will always be tricky to get just right. The Devs have consistently listened to the community and added great things to the game and adjusted the worst parts. People will complain about Decisive strike and dead hard all day but I still remember when you didn't have any hooks on the map! Good luck killing anyone like that!3. Hook camping is a fun sapper. Since the games inception camping hooks is the biggest complaint I ever had. There really isn't anything the survivors can do about it except keep doing objectives but that makes the gameplay completely boring for the person who got hooked and the killer is actually missing out on tons of BP but they never listen.So I highly recommend this game for everyone except those who are squimish about blood and gore.,Dead by Daylight

After letting it sit in my library for about 5 months I finally decided to try it with them and now i'm hooke (Pun intended.)If you suffer from mental illnesses that might hinder your ability to play this then just play custom matches with friends only. It's very fun and it's helped me battle my own mind. I love the different killers you can play as and all the various maps.

Even as the killer it's completely based on skill whether or not you find all the survivors chase them down and manage to get them on the hooks without anybody saving them or shining a flashlight in your eyes.

2017-12-06,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,After watching weeks of streams and videos I finally bought it and tried for myself. Here's what I think. The game is fun and easy as a survivor. You can pretty much on any killers with the right set of tools (perks/addons) and simply by having a little bit of experience. As a killer well at rank 20 it's really easy. Matching against survivors about your rank and non op perks you can have a good time chasing them down hanging them etc. But once you reach rank 17 18 (keep in mind its just 3 ranks up) you get completely destroyed. Being a new player I don't have access to high level perks for survivors/killers. I was just trying to earn blood points every game. But it is really really hard against most survivors. If you're lucky you get to kill 2 in a game. But most of the time its just a wild goose chase as even when they won with the gates wide open they will simply refuse to leave and taunt(teabagging is really popular in this game) the killer knowing they have nothing to stop them.And yes. Killers have some decent tracking/chasing perks. But the survivor's perks are really too much. Dead hard sprint burst borrowed time decisive strike with a trusty flashlight in hand. Let's just say you don't want to play a killer. I think the devs have a good concept and it's a beautiful game with nice music. But the game is in a really dark place now and it's going to take a lot of time to fine tune and balance the game. Some of the survivors understand they have really unfair tools in their arsenal and chooses to not use them to make the game more fair to the killers. But sadly most of them are really toxic even to each other. I do not blame the players for this because it is the way the game was designed to encourage and condone this kinda 'killer bullying' behaviours. To conclude I will continue to enjoy the game as a survivor but I cannot reccomend the game until some sort of balance is in place as at it's current state no amount of DLCs will keep the players for much longer.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-06,0,0,22,False,Not Recommended,By all means a great fun game....If your playing with friends the amount of BM and rudeness in this game is some of the highest ive ever seen even playing games like league of legends for years. Anything from constant 4man SWF all 2k+ hours dragging games out for 20minutes or just doing rude stuff like tbagging behind pallets ect. Or a 4man team all blinding you constantly so you literally cant do anything. This game is great when you have perks and when you are playing with people your own skill rating unfortunately there is no *ranked* or *casual* in this game so you will often run into groups or solo people with 2k+ hours that will just run you around and be rude while doing it. Get the game when its on sale Its not worth buying just to be disrespected every game your in. For some reason this is the way the community on this game is and its a shame,Dead by Daylight

The killers are a bit too easy to play while the survivors have almost nothing going for them. That I can put up with. It can have bad latency issues with drops in framerate every so often. That I can put up with. The most intolerable part is that if you want to play with a friend or two the game basically says ""Go f*** yourself and your friends"". I timed myself multiple times waiting for games using the party system and it averages from 12 15mins to get into a lobby. Then have the time when you enter a lobby you get kicked back to the title screen anyway to start over. Until the developers actually fix the party system to oh I don't know actually put players into a game I cannot recommend this game to anybody who likes to play games with friends like I do.

2018-01-22,0,0,847,False,Recommended,I can honestly say this game is one of if not the BEST games I have bought on steam. There are a few small things you should know before purchase and consider.Pros Survival Horror is done well. As a survivor (when you are new) every killer is in many ways terrifying. A fun game to play with your friends. Literally a game my group of friends and I (we have different tastes in games) all enjoy. diverse set of killers and survivors. The DLC perks which you do not have to buy occasionally are available without spending more than the baseline if you do not want to buy the killers. This game has no loot boxes though so even though I may not play every DLC i spend the 7 dollars to support them NOT having loot boxes. A game you can wrap up in 30 minutes tops ( normally) matches are normally pretty fast.Cons The community can be at times very angry towards each other. I really should not look at post game chats the killer and survivors. (myself included at times) can lash out at each other and really all we want to do is enjoy the game. If you hit the &gt &gt it disables your chat and you should leave it that way. Some bugs can persist a while and terrain has some dead spots. At times you will think your character will be able to run through trees or rocks ect. Then the game lies to you. Vaulting over pallets and windows can be buggy. Sometimes it feels you should not have got hit or hit the survivor. (could be lag related)All in all these are some of the issues good and bad that I have with the game. Buy the game and give it a try outside the somewhat toxic community (at times not as often as others seem to say). This game is allot of fun. ESPECIALLY if you want to play with a group of friends. Kill your friends mode allows 5 of you to make your own matches. Those are a blast.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-13,0,0,209,False,Recommended,Now that I have gotten some time in on this game I feel I can review it properly. Pros Intense game play for those looking for a fun hide and seek esque game with objectives. Replayability to an extent. Good Killer design that does justice to movie villains we all know and love. Especially like the Leatherface model and how they made it so close to the 1970s version of the killer. Can level up one survivor to max and then keep using to put points into another survivor or killer. Pretty balanced gameplay. Some tough perks and killer combos to deal with but not everything should be insta winnable. If your team bails on you you still usually have an option to cary yourself to a victory. Cons Graphics are nothing special but can run on a budget PC well at least. I hope the game is updated with better or mmore interesting textures as time goes on. Sometimes glitchy mechanics or gfx like on Megs hair. The hitboxes are a bit wonky sometimes and is reminiscent of a CS S game. Ping makes for a lackluster experience and find myself dodging queue until I get someone hosting on my side of the country and that can take some time. Bloodpoint grinding can be annoying if you don't get lucky with 100k point dailies have 7+ 30k or less quests in a row. Steep learning curve makes you feel useless until you start to understand what all the perks do. So far with about 100 hours of actual playtune I have only managed to get to rank 10 and my progress is slowing. I have taken 2 survivors to 50 so far and two more to 20 and 30.,Dead by Daylight

I played the killer once and thought it was too op and very easy. I've spent 399 hours playing the survivor and i have to say it gets easier and easier to juke a killer you just need the right perks that work for you. at the end of the day i highly suggest you get this game. if you're easily triggered or easily rage this game is not for you. it takes skill and patience if you have neither jog on. if you enjoy others rage and get triggered then get this game and grind your killer because trust me people get really upset for hilarious things. this game is very underrated but it's very fun and who the hell has 10 friends anyway?

2016-07-17,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Consider this to be a neutral review Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer survival horror game. In it you'll be able to play as one of 4 survivors or as one of three killers each killer having different abilities. Your main objective as survivor is to fix generators to open the escape gates. As killer your objective is to (duh) kill the 4 survivors by wounding them or sacrificing them over a timespan of 1 minute by hanging them on hooks.Upon completing a match either by dying escaping or killing survivors each player is rewarded with leveling points for certain objectives those should encourage players to play in different styles depending on their character and situation. And this is where (in my opinion) the games problems kick in... Due to the point/leveling system players on both sides killers and survivors will resort to cheap tactics to win the game. Killers will often spend their time camping in front of a hooked survivor clinging to the few extra points they get by successfully sacrificing a survivor instead of venturing across the map to catch other survivors making the game incredibly boring for the hooked survivor the killer and probably also the other survivors (since they wont be able to enjoy one of the best aspects of the game the thrill of being hunted by a killer and the possiblity to outchase him). If a survivor tries to rescue the hooked person he'll just get picked off by the killer putting him in danger and probably making him the next person to be camped on.The game feels kind of unbalanced due to these uneven odds (mind tho survivors can resort to simular cheap tactics I just feel like mentoning spawncamping as the worst of 'em since it ruins the game for at least one survivor and probably also for the killer)Another thing which bugged me is the matchmaking as said there are levels but aside of those there are killer and survivor ranks (You'll raise your rank by getting a ceratin amount of leveling points during a match). As killer I was on a fairly low level and got matched (multiple times) with high ranked and leveled survivors (same as survivor with the killer being fairly overleveled). This harms the balance of the game even more since you can potentially get a fairly strong leveled party with many helpful perks against a weak killer with no perks or the other way around... and this really needs to be fixed to make playing ranked&amp online a fairer experience for both sides!Aside of these balancing flaws the gameplay is fairly solid and if you don't run into a camping killer you'll presumably have a great and adrenalin filled match. I can absolutely recommend playing this game in a lobby with 5 friends without camping and gathered in a skype session it's incredibly fun. Beware though Playing in a lobby will not give you leveling points or archievements out of fear of abuse. If you have at least 4 friends to play with you should check it out and if you can overlook it's design/balancing flaws you'll probably have fun playing online/alone as well. Just don't buy this game if you can't handle unfairness or unbalanced mechanics or even repetition in quite some matches 'cause as of now there's alot of exploiting going on. EDIT September 2017 They made quite some changes to the game and now quequeing is faaaaar faster &amp fairer game improved much in general,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-03,0,0,206,False,Recommended,I can play this game for hours and not get bored. It's a fun game to play alone or with freinds. Also it allows for a lot of customization for the characters that makes each one unique. Pros Playing with freinds is fun and easy No two rounds are the same / Never gets repetative New DLCs quite frequentlyCons Sometimes the game will glitch and get stuck in the middle of a loading screenCan't really think of much cons because this game is generally a fun game to play with few glitches.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-03,0,0,48,False,Recommended,Had waited a long time to actually get the game I actually never buy games at normal price I got it off Humble Bundle.

Lack of communication and teamwork really ''kills'' the vibe factor so log on discord get some friends and play you'll have a real good time. If you have some time to lose between two things a quickie in private really does the trick and it's real fun.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-03,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,I like this game. But I will only give it a good review after some issues are addressed * map glitches. Basically I was stuck in the map and couldn't do any action killer couldn't hit me. The only thing to do is leave. Or just stick around until the killer gets bored and leaves.* last survivor camping. For those who don't know some as***** killers just chase / hit / drop the last remaining survivor until they quit. The killer gets points survivor gets 0 points at the end.* leaving the game gives you 0 points. Generally you will do that because you either glitched out or getting camped and it is just not your fault so why should the game punish you ???* server issues. Christ partying with friends is just almost impossible sometimes. You have to create the lobby 3 4 times until you manage to get into a game.* playing entirely only with friends does not give you points. People will abuse this sure but let's face it how much ? This game is not going to become an e sport so why take blood points so serious ?

2017-09-03,0,0,343,False,Recommended,List of pros/cons and a quick personnal review.Pros Many playable characters with their own unique playstyle/skills. Great maps that are generated randomly. Pretty smooth to run. Some DLC are free ( they include survivors killers and maps ). Others DLCs are not too expensive. The bloodweb is an awesome idea ( You can buy skills items addons ... from the points you earn in game ) and it's randomly generated too.Cons Your ping relies on the killer's internet ( host ). There are campers and this ruin your game besides the report system seems not to work since they always do it. I had a data loss ( which happened to many people as I see ) ok each game has issues but the support takes way to long to answer your mails and that's a lowering the image of Behaviour Interactive. If you play with friends it can take a long time until you find a game. Usually it happens when you play with 2 3 friends duo is ok.I think that's pretty much it. The gameplay is really awesome. When you play by yourself it's pretty intense. But my opinion would be that Behaviour could really do much better about this game ( talking about bugs and support ). I'd recommend it though because it's a cheap game which is really addictive.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-19,0,0,290,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a fun game at the core. The gameplay is admittedly fairly simplistic but that doesn't stop it from shining in the asymmetric survival genre. With only one gamemode and one primary objective it might seem at first glance that it can get quite repetitive and boring but I think that the bloodweb system of acquiring items perks addons and offerings keeps the game feeling fresh.Don't get me wrong this game has its issues with a fair variety of bugs and some pretty OP items or abilities but since the games are pretty short it's easy to get out of a boring game and get right back into the action. One of the biggest problems I have with the game is the fact that there aren't any dedicated servers. Servers are instead hosted by the Killer which makes for some very annoying situations in which you think that you weren't seen or that you shouldn't have been hit but they somehow find or hit you. This could probably be solved by creating dedicated servers and giving players a ping indicator in the HUD in the lobby so that they know if they need to leave the lobby and find a new one.The strengths of the game are the high skill cap and the procedural generation of maps. Skill is a large part of playing this game since repairing healing sabotaging wiggling and struggling all involve a quicktime event of some sort. In addition to the QTEs evading the killer is quite skill intensive as well since you have to know when to juke hop in a closet drop a pallet etc. The procedural generation of maps is a strength in my eyes because it keeps those who play a lot from knowing the best spots all the time and keeps the playing field relatively level. The randomness provided by this feature also contributes to the overally feeling of the game that you never know what's going to come next and the torment that the characters are supposed to experience.Overall I highly recommend the game if you like asymmetric survival/horror games or just want to try something a bit different.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-29,0,0,229,False,Recommended,The devs have recently thrown a few patches at the game and I must say that it's been very positive so far. Firstly the lobby simulator seems to be of very little issue now. There is a delay when playing with friends on Steam that could be addressed but it's a much better experience overall. The graphical changes have been great too and the whole game feels different but in a good way. Definitely recommended and good fun with friends.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-03,0,0,222,False,Not Recommended,Short version Killer is always in favor with cheap bs Surv are always nerfed when they have a slight leg up Not the best community Killers can hit through walls You need to leave ppl to die if you want to win problem is no one knows when is the best time Not for causal play Your team will kill u for points. It induces rage I want a causal game not one that constintly is only ranked Killer will leave loby if you enter with 3 or more friends I am not good at technical game plays like fliching and stuff which you need to be good at to play game. (I personally hate learning that stuff since it breaks the game a little and just want to not invest that much time.) No balance. Even a rank 1 surv can get absolutely destroyed by a rank 15 killer. Sure you'll waste 3 minutes but thats about it. Depending on team not very much. Cheaters on crackLong Okay so palets get glitched (on top of several more game breaking ones killers are always way more in favor then survivors. They give you one map in the game thats good for a survivor and it gets nerfed. Your team mates usually get you killed. If your a killer main then the only choice is trapper there is only one killer TRAPPER he moves so fast with the chase buff that he sprints past you. Only thing that could counter him was sprint burst/lethe you can't use them together now cause of nerf. If you want a game you could casually enjoy this is NOT it. You shouldn't even play surv cause you barely ever are enjoying urself with all the bs. A killer can flick the mouse and 360 around buildings cars and trees big obsticals as well that shouldn't be able to reach. I get this is a skill thing but to be honest whats the point in trees and cars and T walls? You can take em out. I think flicking should be out. It makes more sense in the game that way. Also you should take out being able to hit through windows. I get hit through walls when that happens. I will be around a coner and his hand will hit me through a wall. How can the trapper even hit someone (Same for nurse wraith and every other killer but myers) with a weapon that big. You can't ever juke a billy hit cause range is so long and u can 360 hit the WHOLE area around you.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-19,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Fairly nice 4v1 cat vs mice game. Although this is coming from someone who sits around the rank 15 20 mark in the game (low end for people who don't know the game).From what I've seen though there are some toxic survivors who t bag and pallet loop for days like it's skill when it's not. (learned how to do it in about 3 minutes of running from a killer) As well as there are some killers who quite literally just kick a chair back when they hook someone and light the campfire. If the person they're face camping gets saved they'll tunnel them and face camp again which ruins the game for the other survivors (wtb chases not just gen simulator or pallet simulator)Overall decent enough game would definitely recommend if u have friends. But I would suggest learning how to juke the killer over pallet looping. As juking is much harder but is better in the long run than hoping for the map with 20 pallets and using them all.,Dead by Daylight

On the other side of the dile there's the killer Let's put it this way I've never had a more twistedly fun experience in a video game then playing the killer on a good day it's a really good anger outlet in my opinion. Finally theres's the overall feel of the game the grungy music &amp visuals gave off a really great vibe the aesthetics of the game are most likely my favorite part it really gives off a classic slasher film/occult feel like there's always the overlooming presence of the paranormal breathing down your neck this is helped along by the constant refrences to offerings sacrifices &amp rituals including the real life practice of burning tea leaves &amp flowers &amp the keeping of totems to ward off spirits &amp other things of the sort.

2017-02-10,0,0,1079,False,Not Recommended,Not a good choice if you want a fair multiplayer which requires skill. The fact that there are still mechanics like bloodlust (making the killer faster after a certain time in a chase) autoaim (helping killers to hit stuff) perks which let survivors tank way too many hits or get free escapes actually just giving the survivors way too strong placements of tiles (walls with pallets and windows)makes the game a complete mess if you get into it.The design of killer and survivor is used to only have one side really having fun. Killers are from the game design used to camp (stay near you so you die for sure after getting caught) because survivors seem too hard to catch that a killer would actually go after another one instead of securing the kill. Survivors are used to gen rush (do generators extremly fast) which makes the game completly survivor sided. The maps are way too big that the killer could have enough pressure to stop that. Also a couple of items and killer abilities are just braindead broken or just unfun. If you wanted to be a part of a non toxic DbD community and have fun you should have started playing this game summer 2016. Now its just sad looking at it its dying.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-25,0,0,441,False,Recommended,Edit I believe in being fair. While I stand by my feelings regarding many aspects of the game I did finally hear from BEhavior. They were effusive in their apologies for the long reply and awarded my wife 830 600 000 bloodpointys to restore her characters. With that said I have to say that my main gripe has been addressed. However many of the other issues really need to be worked out and improved. If you submit a ticket to BEhavior expect to wait a few weeks to a month for resolution of your issue via bloodpoint reward. I can cautiously recommend this game again...with the caveat that you backup your save and in my case disable Steam cloud saves.So here are the facts about this game Pros Incredibly addictive fun to play Great maps Great killersCons Developers do not respond when you need assistance. My wife lost her save data due to a well known issue with this game and the Steam cloud. She lost over 1 100 hours of bloodpoints and prestiges over multiple characters. We went on the forums found the method to ask the dev for help. They replied that they would get back to us and that they appreciated our patience. That was a month ago. Since then we have requested help two more times sending them all the information they asked for...no response. Survivors are lacking in true ethnic diversity. Mostly white. No Latinos Hispanics Middle Eastern people and no Black men. It has a distinctly Eurocentric myopic feel to it. Not super welcoming to people of color to have super limited options for them to play as people who represent them. Leatherface is a reskin and rehash of the Hillbilly with slightly different perks. Even his weapons are not realy different. The game is supremely glitchy and it gets to be really hard to play if the host has poor internet Plenty of hackers on here who make the experience less than fun far too often Survivors have a bunch of mediocre outfits that offer no bonuses in and of themselves...just looksWith that said I still play this game as does my wife because we have supported it from the beta stage and sunk so much money and time into all of the add on content Which was mostly not really worth it. We stuck by this game because we thought the devs were really trying to do things differently. I bought multiple copies of it for friends and family. But in the end they behave no better than EA or 2K games. They are only about the bottom line and could care less about the people who were loyal to them and helped to stuff their pockets and promoted their game at the grass roots. I am extremely disappointed. I can't in good conscience recommend this game to someone else knowing how BEhavior treated us as customers and gamers.,Dead by Daylight

They fixed the faults i pointed out and added a lot of new stuff ( most of it free too). I think it's a really enjoyable game now so go ahead and give it a try )Edit2 Fall 2017 now. They added some new survivor perks which just let them straightup escape or give them a third life. Playing killer is now either being bullied by survivors who you can barely kill one of with some of the killers after being looped around safe pallets for 20 minutes. Also instant blind flashlights.Now the other thing happening is that you actually kill 2 survivors and now the last 2 just hide waiting for the other guy to die so they can take the hatch. Sometimes 5 10 minutes pass without you seeing a survivor or a survivor touching a generator (rank 5 10 btw). Then you finally kill on of them. Now you have to search the whole map for the last survivor who is hiding next to the hatch just so he can tbag you before getting his free 7k bloodpoints for sandbagging his team.

The kind where you will have the moments you either slap your leg/throw your controller in frustration or burst out laughing at either that awesome thing you just did/stupid mistake anther player just made. This game has two main ways to play be a social survivor and play with friends or be an anti social killer and murder the normies.Jokes aside this game can be a blast! Just hope to see some expansions to gameplay in the future I think a mode with 2 killers and 8 survivors would be nice or maybe some kind of single player/co op story mode.Regardless I think this is great for the price!,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-10,0,0,146,False,Recommended,One of the few games that really hooked me in.I've been obsessed with this game for about a month I played 30 hours without a graphics card at 15 25 fps because it was so thrilling and fun. I recently switched to playing the killer which is a whole other type of fun as well. In the beginning you experience the thrill of being hunted. You run when you shouldn't you stay put when you shouldn't all out of fear of the hook. You try to fix generators but keep screwing it up and making noise which gets your heart racing. After this stage of personal progression you begin to learn better when to run and hide. You might even watch the killer roam around a bit nearby waiting for them to leave so you can continue working on your generator.Then you experience a new killer one you haven't played before. They can sneak up on you like the others can't or you don't realize they're coming until you see their red glow on your back. You'll eventually play in the insane asylum which sucks but has it's own reason for adding to your level of fear.Moral of the story is get this game. It's fun and thrilling as all hell.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-28,0,0,241,False,Recommended,"This game transformed my wife into an official gamer! When first starting to play this game be sure to turn out the light and be prepared to have your heart beat out of your chest. This is an exceptionally exciting game (especially for new players). The basic mechanics are about as simple as it gets so it makes for an easy learning curve. At the same time there is a nice complexity to the game that builds with your experience so what appears simple on the surface actually can be quite intricate. The DLC is pretty nice in terms of nostalgic value and the most recent patch introduced some new mechanics as well that help keep the game from getting stale. The only downside I have experienced this far is that the adrenaline rush doesn't come so much any more when the killer comes near after many hours of gameplay. Absolutely love the assymetry too many games are cookie cutter and this actually presents a real challenge when playing as a survivor. Backstories for the characters are interesting and I wish they were fleshed out a bit more so that you could connect with them more as favorites. If the devs could figure out a way to deal with ""face camping killers"" this would be a 10/10 for me. Excellent game have gifted it to several friends pick it up if you haven't already!",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-20,0,0,622,False,Recommended,After many updates the game has improved and is very fun for survivor mains. Killers have a rough time because its survivor oriented now. Also not been able to play on my own account for over 3 months now because of an error the devs haven't gotten back to me on. Negative review because a small percentage of the player base (myself an avid loving player included) can't play a game they paid 20$ (or more in my case for the cosemetic DLC) for.OLD REVIEW BELOW Ok. I've played the game long enough now to update my review. Solo queing survivor 5/8 times unless you play selflessly you won't get help from the other survivors. Survive with friends you can party up to 4 and have a much more organized game with the help of VOIP servers such as discord (free) or teamspeak. I've had great games when I've been able to talk with at least one of my fellow survivors. Killer. Needs work. The debuffed a lot of the killers recently but they are about to drop a new map and new killer. Trapper was my favorite until they removed putting the trap down infront of the hooked victim. Now everyone just camps / patrols again. I try not to because I know I'll get more points chasing around other people then having a staring contest with a guy stuck hitting spacebar that isn't going anywhere because your dumb is just trying to sit there and smack him with your weapon even though it won't do anything to make him die any faster.TL DR If you wanna play with friends and survive game is 8/10 if you wanna kill people and up their day 6/10 until killer buff to compete with BS survivors or the new killer will be better. Idk I'll probably update this review in another 200 300 hours of gameplay.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-23,0,0,62,False,Recommended,I love this game I think it is great the designers of this game to come up with a game completely different than most main stream games it offers something completely different to the table and gives the option to play either killer my favorite and or survivor. I love the different take of this game and this game is like no other this game for me stands alone. I would love to see the intensity of this game evolve and continue. Excellent concept for a game. Also granted a lot of people I've noticed rage quite on the survivor side which is unsportsman like I understand but rage quitting..I would like to see that once survivors are then selected for the match then to be locked down till the end (If thats even possible to do why beacuse if you've selected a bunch of totems hexe's and or offerings rage quitting then will render the killers perks and or offerings to be completely useless. Just because they get salty and dip out half way through a match.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-28,0,0,157,False,Recommended,I LOVE this game! Variety of killers survivers and maps to play and the developers are constantly working on improving and adding content. I really enjoy playing both killer and survivor. I usually play killer if I'm solo but really enjoy playing survivor with at least one friend although I know idealy I should play solo I appreciate that it is an option. The only thing unfortunate about this game (and any multi player game i'm sure) is that I've found the survivor community to be quite toxic in after game chat but it's always something you can ignore. There really are a lot of fun random people out there to play with but it seems the toxic ones are always the ones that stand out since the scram the loudest. Thankfully there are bans for that D. I definity recommend this game to anyone! I still consider myself a newie but find it enjoyable and look forward to learning more and getting better!,Dead by Daylight

It no longer takes forever to que for a game. People still BM but I guess this is 2017 and the interner so what do I expect. Otherwise this game is a lot of fun and if you have some friends to play with you will definately have the optimal expirence. Previous Review I'd love to write a review but I'd have to connect to the internet first.Anyone who voted this game up either played a way earlier more stable build of the game which I doubt or is fanboi'd themselves up and made a stand. This game is a hot mess constant lobby issues constant reports of being not connected to the internet contstant BM from killers and survivors alike.For what it is worth when actually playing the game and not recieving BM from a toxic community it's a really solid game that I enjoyed a lot. But it's not worth fighting through 15 minutes of trying to connect to a lobby for a game to only be trolled by a killer who knocks the last two players down and walks around.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-30,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Review changed to positive.Play with friends has been patched in allowing you to progress while you play together.Old Review I was going to refund this game because the features I was told will be in game never came when the game released. Even with the devs knowing full well weeks before the release of the game the ability to invite your friend to a game other then private was never added.I love to progress in games it means that you get better at it with tools you can use. When you play private sure you can play with your friend(s) but you do not level or gain anything in return.The problem with playing a private game means that if you only have one other friend to play the game with one of you will be the monster and the other a surviver you cannot open the game to public or invite others not in your friends list. This means that out of the 4 survivers that could be on the map you play by yourself.If you want to play with friend and progress you have to play the loby game you enter and exit depending if your friend is in there or not.I cannot speak for everyone others who play this game think that the game would be easy or unfair if friends talked over the internet allowing them to communicate where the monster is... I've played the game with 2 other friends 1 other surviver and the monster from this experience I can say that we ether won with most of us dead or all dead rarely we all survived comunication did us little good except when we had to run which still eneded up with one of us dead we never took advantage of hopping windows like crayze.Its been a few weeks now since the game has released and the survivers life has gotten even harder. You still cant play with friends and progress however.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-22,0,0,586,False,Not Recommended,I have to start off by saying that I really do love this game. I'm super late to the party having only purchased during this most recent summer sale but it's quickly become an obsession. That being said I can only give this game a 3/5 for the following reason the lobby feature is super sketchy and sometimes you have to wait a ridiculously long time to play. The wait is affected by a number of factors including being dropped by the matchmaking service problems with authentication for some reason and just good ol' fashioned being locked in some kind of cue limbo. It's a truly dissapointing fail on the developers end because the rest of the game is wonderfully addictive and great fun.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-16,0,0,51,False,Recommended,I've played this game for about twelve hours and already see a glaring problem. This game is complete garbage in some aspects. Here are some pros and cons. Pros Playing survivors actually conveys a sense of fear and dread at times not actual fear but fear of losing them sick rank progression points and potential blood points. (essentially XP.) Killers are unique and interesting to play as despite some clearly being better than others. (The nurse being clearly amazingly good if you can understand her.) The game is oddly... hard to find stale despite spamming game after game the consumable add ons and offerings add a layer of replayability and lack of staleness. Cons Killers. Listen survivors once they get easy access to flashlights and batteries... are ing insane. I've played five games so far level 20 into trapper rank eighteen. Trapper is a solid pick but is weaker than the high tier killers this would be fine if skill mattered into whether i get to have fun in all of my games. When i actually am able to have fun due to my skill it's because none of the survivors brought flashlights and batteries. Survivors can group easily pick up gens move to the next and stomp you. I downed two survivors they didn't even worry just waited for me to pick one up flashlighted me due to the fact there was no nearby wall... and i dropped the survivor who instantly healed due to a poor game mechanic and then immediately lost him and had to chase him again. Therefore giving more time for them to do gens. It took me a solid Five MINUTES. of just hitting and picking up survivors to finally get one dead. There isn't any intrinsic lack of skill to me they literally face camped me as the killer and i felt more scared to play than i ever did as a survivor. This really makes killers feel unfun and non scary to play as. Now this is due to the fact i don't have the perk and offering to reduce flashlight stun and build up but that shouldn't be required to have fun even at my low level... survivors Survivors... just feel unfun to play as unless you completely stomp the killer honestly it feels unfun for the game to hinge on three other people unless you have the godly perks. Teamwork and altruism will crush any killer. Borrowed time decisive strike and sprint burst? Dang well i guess we're just gonna completely stomp the killer as our Dwight runs leadership so we can speed through our 5 gens in less time than it takes for one hooked teammate to die. If you like challenge play without items or item add ons allowing RNG and chests to actually give you that edge with a sense of risk. otherwise it feels like it's too easy to hardstomp. TL DR Killers are horrendously perk and item locked in the early game compared to survivors. Early survivors with no perk and no item are harshly under relevent unless they know how to play well. Killers are horrendously irrelevant to late game survivors... even with some decent perks.Survivors are fun but eventually become dull to the fact they can hardstomp easily. Final Thoughts This game is worth it to buy on sale for every time i get flashlight s i will get two or three games of people who are normal and one or two games of altruistic good players. then about four or three games of people who play hyper altruistic without any sense of safety and easily let me decimate them. In total the game is good as a whole but the small bits and pieces make either the survivor late game... or the killer early game... horrendous.,Dead by Daylight

I really recommended to buy it DLCs is cool but you can play it without DLC without any disadvantage since those DLCs are just only for some new killers and survivors.In my opinion The DLCs are just only for fun buy it if you want to have a little more options on what to play and those cosmetic DLCs really worth the price.I can't regret that this game have a lot of bugs in 1.9.2 patch update. If you just gonna buy it please don't get angry with bugs because I'm sure developers are working on fixing it.Ok...

2016-10-31,0,0,381,False,Recommended,"As much of a buggy piece of this game is it's surprisingly fun and addicting albeit repetitive. When you get used to everything the ball starts rolling.Starting off the game legitimately had me scared. Not cowering under the covers kind of scared but legitimately nervous and afraid of dying and losing the match because the killer is very intimidating. Especially during moments of pressure when you're being chased down or have to force yourself to not panic in order to sneak and not give up your position because stealth is very much so rewarded.This game is not easy especially when starting off as a survivor. If you're coming into the game ignorant you're going to be making a LOT of mistakes. That's why it's good to be with friends or ""survive with friends"" so that someone's there to show you the ropes. I feel a lot of newcomers jump into this clueless and get salty which is honestly understandable. This game isn't so casual as it requires some commitment especially with how grindy it can be with the bloodpoints system. On the contrary the killer's part is a lot easier. Don't get me wrong it's not baby mode you have to at least know what you're doing or you're going to get trolled by teabagging survivors who constantly juke stealth and farm bloodpoints from your lack of knowledge. But with some commitment you'll do just fine as a killer as well.Survivor and Killer are completely different worlds and which being more fun is all up to preference Survivor is more difficult and focuses more on keeping you on edge where you have to keep a level head and not give away your position. In the end you have to be as stealthy as possible and not give yourself away unless you absolutely must have to such as saving a friend from an impending doom. But you gotta be clever too and wary about the kind of noise you make when performing certain actions.Killer on the other hand is easier and is all about hooking them up. You assert your dominance and gain pleasure from their panic and despair. While Killer is a walk in the park in comparison you still have to be clever about what you do because survivors can be just as clever. With the first person perspective it is surprisingly easy to lose track of your prey or have mind games be played on you. When you overcome this barrier you'll soon learn that you get the most satisfaction from not only sacrificing survivors but playing with your food (which coincidentally is a perk too). Camping and securing your kill isn't usually a good thing to do as hooking survivors repeatedly can net you more bloodpoints (and fun too). When you hook someone and walk away they will stop doing generators to help each other which can clue you in on where they are about to go next. Even if they successfully save someone they only have a certain amount of times they can be hooked before an instant death. It's very much possible to get lots of bloodpoints without sacrificing a single survivor because you are moreso rewarded on the amount of actions you perform. But in the end you would want to get multiple hooks and if possible kill absolutely everyone after you've grinded them out.Now I'm not here to tell people how to play the game but the intention here is that you're suppose to be scared as a survivor. If you're teabagging all over the place can you honestly call yourself scared? No. If you're discouraged from messing around and instinctively try to get out ASAP can you call yourself at least a little bit worried? Yes. What confuses me the most is when people talk about balance and use that as their entire argument for downvoting the game. I understand that balance is very often important but in this case Dead by Daylight is a unique case. Yes the killer will kill you once they find you. Yes Michael Myers will one shot you if he keeps staring at you for long enough. But is he impossible to beat? The answer is no. Michael Myers is very strong one of the strongest infact but he is not OP like the Nurse once was. Once you figure him out you'll once again learn that stealth is still very much so rewarded because being one shotted isn't a thing when he doesn't even know where you are right? And if he finds you you're SUPPOSE to be scared and concerned about living or not. There shouldn't be a definitive strategy to never getting caught such as infinitely juking or hiding. It's kind of dependent on luck. That's why the maps are randomized and never consistently the same. In a way this games runs off of RNG or situations that are not very easy to control. If you know what to expect that gives you a sense of security. But no Dead by Daylight is a game where you should never feel safe and the devs try to make it so with every patch. The killers SHOULD have an advantage over the survivors otherwise it wouldn't be a ""survivor horror"" game now would it? Now don't get me wrong there were plenty of times where both sides had unfair advantages or just completely illogical things happening but the devs handle it as diligently as possible.And what's with all these people complaining about paid DLC? He's MICHAEL MYERS from Halloween. Do you honestly think the devs can profit off of a licensed franchise and legally get away with it? I feel like there's a bunch of kids these days with mob mentalities who just look at Capcom's DLC practices then just use that as reference to start hating on all forms of DLC as if they know that the system is corrupt and that they're here to preach the truth and fight the power. Why don't you actually take a little bit of a time out of your day and learn about how corporation works?In closing this game is fairly new a couple months old. It's got a long way to go and I'm hoping that it goes somewhere within the next year or so. It'll either be dead or still kicking. I'm hoping it's kicking. Despite my hours I felt I made this review very early. And besides some argue that this feels like an early access game. And trust me it sure does feel like one. I'm just hoping there's much more to come in the future. Not just new survivors killers and maps but more objectives and content. I understand it might be kind of difficult to come up with new ideas since honestly this game is a one of a kind and requires a different approach. Why is this game with as many bugs as it has is still frequently played? Because literally no one else has made a game like it. But an exception might be Friday the 13th coming soon.",Dead by Daylight
2017-08-08,0,0,54,False,Not Recommended,This game has very amazing content and the way it was set up is clever. However there are serious downfalls to the game. Major one that is ruining the game and litteraly making matchmaking take insanely longer is the SWF feature which allows you to team up with your friends before joining a match. Most killers will leave the lobby when seeing everyone join as a team and if your the killer why wouldnt you? It is to unfair mainly because high rank 5+ will have one rank 15 or lower in there team and be matched up with a new killer who is also rank 15. And going against player who have all 4 perks while you do not and in teamspeak is not fun. This is ruining the game for both parties and the forums show this. I would avoid this game untill a solution is found.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-20,0,0,765,False,Recommended,There are pros and cons like all games. But its not good when the cons out weigh the pros. The items should not disappear it is complete bull that they do. A shop should be implemented as well to where you can buy clothes hair masks weapons etc. Or let us get the items there something needs to give or the game wont last long for many. There needs to be a party system. People get this game yes to play with their friends but online as well. You want us to wait in the lobby screen forever waiting to see if our friend may possibly appear at a 0.00000001% of them actually getting into your lobby? There are definitely some bugs that need to be fixed with the game the crashing the mouse disappearing even the glitches of you being the killer and have someone one hit away from being downed they go over a barricade you hit them and they are still standing up but it was a registered hit. Fixes need to be made or the game will just fall off after a while because of all the problems people are having or how unbalanced the game can be on both sides of the spectrum. Like not being able to control the hillbilly chainsaw sprint Not enough hiding spaces for the survivor to get away. A majority of the time if you even get spotted your done for. Or another aspect when your the killer there being to many knockover barricades on the map it just becomes an aggravation nuisanc and overall makes it less fun and more hard to be the killing role. There a problems all over and thats alternately what happens when you release a game earlier than it should have been. Gaming companies are more for releasing them early then making sure the game is perfect and entertaining and fun for the players. People should NOT release games early. Bugs are no fun for anyone yes there will be bugs but when there are this many its just straight carelessness and greed. Please fix the bugs. I love this game and id recommend it because i wish to see it become better and be more fun and less aggravating for the players.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,557,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 7/13/2017 The devs pushed an update that absolutely obliterated matchmaking. It's now almost impossible to find a match and often trying will crash your whole game. The crash can happen when you're queuing by yourself trying to join a Survive with Friends or Kill Your Friends lobby or when your SWF lobby tries to connect to a killer. If your game doesn't crash outright you might get the infinite loading screen bug which requires a restart to fix. It's now also super easy to get disconnected in the middle of a match.Until Behavior fixes matchmaking don't buy this game. You'll spend more time waiting for a match than actually playing. Overall the game is a lot of fun! I generally really enjoy when I play and the game provides the kind of stress based fear that horror games should strive for. However I DO have some issue I feel like people should know about.1. The matchmaking is absolutely horrendous. If it can't immediately find a game to put you in it often quits looking and you have to click the button again. (my record is 12 tries before it actually started searching like it's supposed to) If the hunter leaves the game everyone is booted and you have to search all over again. Further there seems to be no experience basis to who gets put in what game leaving me in my first match as hunter to try and chase down two top rank survivors.2. The game is often laggy. In the worst cases I experience nasty rubberbanding. When I'm in the middle of a chase and try vaulting or throwing down a board to escape the game hasn't quite caught up with me and while I'm waiting for it to register my frantic spacebar spamming I get shanked.3. The ranking system is incredibly frustrating. As a survivor one can play a perfectly good game with all or most escaping and derank solely because you didn't heal your buddy or escape a chase often enough. As a hunter it feels too easy to rank up even hooking only one survivor I gained a mark because I chased around the other three long enough to make up the lost points.4. Trying to use items is also incredibly frustrating. They occur rarely as is and even when I do find one I'm reluctant to use it since if I die it and any add ons I attached to it are gone for good. Their benefits weren't even enough to keep me from deranking when I DID get to use them.5. Nothing is intuitive. The tutorials are just videos with vague imperatives like ""maim survivors"" superimposed over some staged gameplay. I didn't even know which buttons to press until I got into my first game. The items and perks aren't any better I keep seeing mentions of ""dark mist"" but I have yet to find out what that actually is.6. There's no way to communicate once the games starts. Of course I wouldn't ask for team voice chat a la Overwatch but even a couple of range based interaction hotkeys would do wonders.This doesn't even begin to touch on the lack of a party system the completely average graphics and the fact that the game has so few mechanics that it's outdone by most game jam products but those are of less concern to me personally. Again I really do enjoy playing the game it's just so full of issues that I can't help but be frustrated after a couple of minutes of playing. Definitely buy it if you like horror just wait until it goes on sale.",Dead by Daylight

I started out getting board/window looped by some people and never being able to track any of the 4 survivors down as they got generators on and escaped. Then I got good with the hooks and realized that nearly everyone tries to save their friends. Some folks call it camping I call it a sure way to win if you are playing with scrub survivors or altruistic high ranks. This game is awesome and I also have a great time as a survivor escaped for the first time yesterday (got 2 gens on myself too). You can hate on the Killer for camping or you can not get caught in the first place don't be stupid and try to save your friends and if you are still butt hurt take it up with the DEVS.

Even though its irritating to be camped by a killer there is game balance here from the fact that a team of good survivors should see whats going down and exploit this to make progress on their objective. I think its a fun trade off and makes for some interesting moments!The thing that has been sort of a disappointment and this is something I've given some thought to because its weird the toxic attitude in the lobby both before/after games really gets old after a while. After about 40+ hours of game play being subjected to the abusive language over and over again is just tedious... I know I'm here to play a 'murder' simulator but its always a little sad seeing the % of the population that feels OK with subjecting everybody else to the chat room equivalent of a truck stop bath room wall.

2016-06-16,0,0,570,False,Recommended,DBD is basicly where you are run and hide from the killer. You need to find generators and start them up. With a full match of players you need to get 5 gens. Pro Loved the game while in beta and I love how the updates are becoming more often than not. There is a survive with friends match and kill your friends private match. This game is a fun survial horror trying to be a team to work together to escape the killer. Love all the maps that are out. Con not everything is balanced some perks are way to over powered and they keep adding help to killers Doctor needs a debuff.I like the game and I would definnitly recommend this game to anyone that likes survival horror games.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-01,0,0,220,False,Not Recommended,"I do not recommend this game to potential buyers. It has a very high skill cap for new players to learn the game to the point of many people not wanting to try it again because they get absolutely demolished by people abusing exploits to lower their ranks and somehow not getting banned for it.... Meaning people playing killer with 2200+ hr gameplay are getting put in the same match with 0 30 hour survivors. This is terrible design. It's also terrible that survivors are getting nerfed more and more. Less pallets bloodlust slower vault speeds games being extended longer by several minutes because of perk combinations like Ruin and BBQ Chili.... BBQ Chili even on Billy is the most anti fun game you can play. This game has gone from jump scare Michael games to annoying grind fests where you're held hostage in a round with a killer... e.g. a Doctor that you have to attempt to sneak around which is nearly impossible and also impossible to get away from Doctors or do any actions once they've chased you for a while. Ultimately the devs are making bad decisions by killing off interest for most of the player base the survivors. They're taking away bright/dark moonlight nerfing flashlights again reducing pallets more..... it's just way too much. The mechanic of simply ""running away"" is boring. Little strategy involved there. With devs talking about taking away moonlight already having nerfed mist to it not being worth playing etc... it sounds like they're trying to address the issue of people hacking items on their accounts in a less than productive way. I think there's a huge problem now that you have to rely more and more on terrible teammates to unhook you. This isn't scary it's annoying. Many of these changes just lead to frustrating game play. I'd say a reason many people still play is to unlock everything but even then it's not really great because devs are making games longer without actually giving us much more points.On the weekend that Freddy was released I got 3 5k tops most games. Normally with my full build I would get maybe 12 20k+. Doesn't matter if it's bonus points weekend if you still end up getting average points because you don't properly play test a killer and balance it.... you guys should seriously read the review bombs that happened around Halloween when Freddy came out. It was all deserved because little testing clearly went in to Freddy and it was nearly impossible to get away from him or do anything. Rare skillchecks to be found item add ons that were supposed to give you more skillchecks actually REDUCED your chance sabotage didn't cause you to wake up from his dream perma deerstalker on you etc.... just led to a very anti fun weekend. I should say it can be fun... especially if you group up with friends on voice chat but if new killers continue to end up being as unbalanced as Freddy and if devs continue to ruin their own game by keeping survivors hostage in garbage killer rounds then I cannot recommend this game anymore. Again the skill cap is already really high and these killer perks are punishing new players even more than previously... if you get demolished every time you play you might not want to play again. This has been the case for a number of my friends.****** TIPS FOR DEVS TO IMPROVE * Stop nerfing survivors. Removing items completely from the game (as well as pallets) is not a fix for balancing gameplay. It just makes the game more two dimensional and bland.* Survivors absolutely need ways to counter BBQ Chili more. Hiding in lockers should counter BBQ Chili. If a killer is BAD he should not be babysat by saying ""here are the survivors""... it takes away skill from the game.* Doctor is way too strong still. There should be a much longer window between screams when in stage 3 it's already way too easy for a doctor to hunt someone down even after they escape. If you ESCAPE from a killer by juking you should be able to get away for good. You shouldn't be punished for it. This is very bad design. You should not have to rely on selfish randoms to save you.* Consider adding a tutorial video or training mode for killers / survivors. The tips in the pre loading screen is a good start though",Dead by Daylight

Both seemed pretty fun I gotta say one thing I gotta say though is that the devs should listen to a bit more of the community before doing anything to the killers and to the survivor mains who complain about killers being op its just as hard for killers as it is for the survivors I wouldn't listen to the negative reviews. Most of them are complaints about how op killers are. What Im trying to say is buy this game have fun. Or not I hope to see you all in the forest,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-04,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Ladys and Gentlemen I welcome you to the saltiest game the world has ever seen. https //youtu.be/3KquFZYi6L0 This is a short description of how the game community functions /url I'm happy to announce the most toxic community since League of Legends. Here you are morally somewhat below a pedophile terrorist who sells drugs to kittens if you play killer. Threats to have your family yourself and your pets killed sexually violated or tortured is something you should get used to.The game is an asymetrical horror competitive coop game. Where one side plays the killer as a single person and has to kill four survivors. The survivors need to repair 5 generators on a randomly generated map of which each has a specific theme but the maps are always very slightly different.For the horror aspekt of the game is to say that it is not exactly clear who scares who more. If the killer is more scared of the survivors or the other way around. For the survivors to win they have to repair the generators which enables them to unlock the two exit gates and leave through said gate the last remaining survivor can also leave through the exit hatch which opens even if not five generators are yet done.For the killer to win he has obviously to kill the survivors. To kill a survivor the killer has to hit him twice where the first hit damages said survivor and the second hit puts the survivor down. After the survivor is downed he needs to be put onto a hook. Hooks can be everywhere on the map.The survivor is then for a specific time on said hook until finally dying. The other ways to kill a survivor is by hooking them once and if they were rescued and you used a so called Mori offerring before the start of the game you can kill the survivor https //www.youtube.com/watch?v Rw7gTUzPDbc which looks ultra cool btw /url directly after downing him.The survivor can be hooked for up to 3 times before dying completly but he can also die in a single hook as long as noone comes or manages to rescue said survivor.The sides have completly different playstyles. A survivor can shift between crouching walking and sprinting. He can also jump through windows and above dropped pallets as well as he is able to drop pallets. The survivor plays from a third person perspective.The Killer plays from a first person perspective walks generally faster than the survivor can sprint but has a set speed. He can be stunned by pallets can't drop them but can destroy dropped pallets and walk slowly through windows. Each killer also has a special ability like setting traps for the trapper a chainsaw sprint for hillibilly a blink for the nurse etc.The killer also gets indicators about noise that the survivors do. When they for example jump through a window or finish a generator. The killer also sees every unfinished generator with a red indicator which enables him to go directly to them without searching for it. And the killer can see the tracks of injured or running survivors to enable him to chase said survivors better.Each side can unlock various perks tools and addons they can equip before each round.Lets talk about the specific jobs of each side. Your main job as a survivor is to make the killer angry. Teabag him have him follow you through a bunch of pallets and loops and basically just him up. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v tahJmMkEEXA basically like that /url The killer runs around and tries to down a survivor. He then proceeds to place him on a hook and then has the big moral questions. Because the general psychology of the survivors there is always someone near to save him. Thus he has the decision between three things.1. Leave the hook and search for survivors2. Softcamp3. HardcampThe first decision is the one survivors try to force at the killer this is also the decision that appoints you with the lowest killrate and lowest amount of Blood Points. This decision normally leads to survivors calling you a noob and laughting at you because of your low killrate in the endgame chat.The second decision grants you the highest Blood Point and a normally you have about as many kills as when you'd hardcamp. Sometimes more sometimes less. This decision also grants you a decent amount of salt.The last decision would grant you an o.k. amount of blood points a decently high killrate and an insane amount of salt. Don't forget if you play killer your main goal should be the salt. The more death threats reports insults and flame in general you get the better you were in reaching your goal.In turn as a survivor it is your task to flame the killer in the endgame chat. Don't worry in this game the only bannable offense is to cheat nothing else ever got banned.I don't know if the game is something for you. But if you want to get the salt. Live for it. Breath it and strife in it. And all the insults you fired in League of Legends and that were fired at you throughout all your time playing is not enough for you. Here you can get the same amount in a week. (Only if you played League of Legends for at least 3 years and played ranked in low elo).This was my review. Have fun. And remember No Salt no Life.,Dead by Daylight

It's a lot of fun to be able to play as killers from well known slasher flicks like Halloween Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street. Excellent halloween game and excellent game in general. Good job.Original Review This game is fun but between the matchmaking being terrible and the ton of bugs I cannot recommend the game at this time. You guys had a beta to sort out all of these issues but apart from maybe one bug all of the bugs from the beta are still present in the full game on release.

The killers are way OverPowered on top of that there are no penalties for killers camping hooks leaving the survivors limited chance.. now even less than getting off a hook in this game. To top it all off there are not nearly enough perks to combat the fact that nearly every Hex/perk makes it so they(the killers) can see you.the concept of this game is a good one but with killers overpowered and survivors with no space to move or counteract the killers....why even play as a survivor?..or in my case at all.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-12,0,0,384,False,Not Recommended,"This game has been incredibly good to me so far. After playing around 100 hours of so I've gotten used to the mechanics of DBD. Honestly this has been a pretty unique experience in terms of asymmetrical multiplayer. You've got your standard four survivors (playing in third person mode) who try to fix generators to open a gate and leave (and maybe save a couple of hooked friends) and you've got your killer (playing in first person mode) who just wants to hook and kill everybody for fun D.I'm sure people will say that it'll get stale blah blah blah but that's only for the first few hours of the game. During this time killers will feel incredibly overpowered and you WILL feel like giving up. However if you level up your survivors enough using the in game currency of ""Blood Points"" you'll eventually get cool neat perks and items that you can use to your advantage against the killer. Conversely the killer can also do this against you.Now this sounds pretty good until you get to the toxicity of some of the players in this game. Survivors often use pallet looping which is basically just running around this object that can stun the killer when you drop it in order to save time for other survivors. This is incredibly frustrating for killers. On the other hand some killers also just camp you sometimes to the point of literally just staring you in the face so that you can't be saved by your fellow team mates. The devs have tried to alleviate some of these problems (in the form of new perks or added features in the game) but some of the solutions just kind of fall flat. Not to mention that strategies against certain killers really have to involve pallet looping to some extent but that's just based on my experience and what I've read.Furthermore another jarring negative in this game is the lack of dedicated servers. Normally it would be fine since the game just directs you to a killer who has a good connection with you most of the time. But if you're playing with friends who are geographically miles apart it's frustrating to get a good compromise between the two and it usually takes several tries to just get it right. It would be amazing to have servers choices instead of this constant trial and error. We have a ton of DLCs but no god damn dedicated servers.Another thing that irks me incredibly is the redundant separation of the menu for ""Survive with Friends"" and ""Play as Survivor"". The only difference between these two menus is that Survive with Friends has this little button on the lower right portion of the screen where you can invite your friends to a lobby. Why can't the devs just put these two together in one place? Not to mention that if your party fails to find a match it DOES NOT bring you back to the Survive with Friends menu instead you go back to the Play as Survivor where there is NO OPTION TO INVITE YOUR FRIENDS. This is probably the most annoying thing in this game.There are also a plethora of bugs like when my party and I queue up for a match we all get kicked out for no reason. My friend's game also literally crashes and we have to try MULTIPLE TIMES just to get into a lobby where there is no guarantee that the game will even start. There are also many in game bugs that I hope the devs are trying to solve.When we do get into a game as a party it really is fun to try and survive together. Coordinating with your friends on which generators to finish or telling them to proceed to a gate or trying to save your friend via flashlight are all satisfying to do. This in my opinion is what makes Dead by Daylight a very fun experience.To conclude although I sound incredibly angry and negative in this review I still have to recommend this to people who wanna pick this up. Though the huge number of menu related bugs are annoying the game is fun enough with its perks items and different strategies for each killer that I can look past it and give this game a thumbs up.EDIT NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF LOBBY ISSUES. LITERALLY WE HAVE TO TRY LIKE 10 TIMES JUST TO GET INTO A LOBBY WITH A KILLER (IN SWF) AND MOST OF THE TIME THE KILLER IS A SCAREDY CAT AND WILL LEAVE SO WE HAVE TO TRY 20 TIMES AGAIN JUST TO GET INTO A GAME.DEVS FIX THIS PIECE OF",Dead by Daylight

I suggest a change in the matchmaking sistem it would be great if you can find players with similar Ranks as it happens now but also with similar in game hours and achievements so even after the rank reset you can get matched with people with your same skill level.I really recommend this game if you are looking for a funny game that will keep you playing for a very long time.,Dead by Daylight

Killers move way too fast and obstacles don't really slow them down. You can't jump over small objects. Only objects the developers allow you to jump over.Positive The monsters look cool.

2018-02-15,0,0,174,False,Recommended,The game is fun for the most part however there are a great deal of bugs and issues that need fixing. First being their ranking system. New players are often tossed into the mix with other killers/survivors that have had a chance to gather and earn more than the new players. It really isn't a new player friendly game. Second would be to fix the issues with killers who lag. The killers are the ones hosting the game and therefore if they are lagging all the players are lagging. I've been in games before where one moment you are completely fine and the next you're on a hook with no clue how you even got there. Unless the killer dc's you are the one punished for it without any help from the company to make up for it. It really puts a damper on the enjoyment of the game. Other things that need fixing are small bugs such as characters and objects floating in the air. At times the game will crash for no reason usually when in the menu. There are times when a lobby will get stuck in the infinite loop of never finding a game. All of these problems and more are not just things I've noticed with my games. I have a large group of discord friends I often play the game with who all seem to have the exact same issues. Not a bug but something I find absolutely no one enjoys in the game is campers. That is when the killer will hook someone and simply stand under or so close that no one can go save them without having help from other skilled players. Even then it's hard to actually get out still. It really runes the fun. I would rather make the killers stronger and remove the ability to allow a killer to camp over allowing them to camp. Survivors have a penalty for camping killers should get one too. (And no I don t just play survivor. I play killer just as often. They are easy enough to play that the only people who actually need to camp are those who can t do well unless they do.)Despite all of its problems it is still a game I would recommend playing simply because when it isn't broken it can be a lot of fun and I hold on to the hope that someday the company will fix the issues listed above. If you are someone who can't handle the chance of losing everything you've worked for due to a bug I would not recommend this game. It will frustrate you beyond reason.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-27,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Had a lot of potential but 15 spent and a combined playtime of two hours doesn't seem like a good deal to me.Gameplay is redundant and survivor objectives are boring and mundane. Many would disagree with me but the implementation of a proximity based social component could have enhanced the gameplay but the devs don't want to add it as it would break the terrifying immersion.What's truly terrifying is you have to haphazardously activate all five generators which is about as exciting as painting a wooden panel.Graphically the game is relatively pretty and the character models are nice and expressive. The procedural generated maps are conceptually good but since the base assets are copied and pasted into mildly different locations you'll hardly be able to tell that procedural generation was even a part of the game.Overall if you like spooky things and that gets your wet then give it a try. It's not necessarily fun or deep in any way but some people might like it more than I did. I just wish I'd bought DS III when it was on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-17,0,0,1837,False,Recommended,It's a good game!,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-17,0,0,26,False,Recommended,"This game is on a good path.Before I start reviewing lets talk about what Dead by Daylight is.Dead by Daylight is a 1 vs 4 online/private match based game where the goal for the killer is to kill the survivors or sacrifice them to an ""entity""with your ability.The survivors goal is self explanatory you try to survive and power all of the generators spread across the map with perks and items.Now lets reviewPros This game has many and I mean MANY pros so i'll just do the 3 biggest pros so lets get started.First off the character customization is amazing you can give your character a bloody skin at lvl 50 or even the amazing DLC skins and there are skins that are already there with the download. Another pro is how many characters there are.For survivors you have Meg Dwight Jake Claudette and many more! for killers you have Trapper Hillbilly and The Nurse just to name a few.And they are all unique!lastly Are how many items and perks you can give your survivor or killer.You can give your survivor so many perks that makes playing as your survivor a lot easier and fair. Your killer can not have a main perk but have perks that help the main ability. because they have abilities such as cloaking invisable trapping chainsawing and a small range teleporting feature for the nurse.Survivors get items too like med kits mainly for Claudette or flashlights for Meg tool boxes for jake and maps for dwight.Those are the biggest pros for Dead by Daylight now on to the cons.One con is how much content there is that needs to be bought.If you added up the prices for the game content it would be more than the entire game itself which is very sad because most people dont want pay up to 6.99 just to play as an extra killer or survivor with a map.Another con is the games bugs and glitches I know this one is just something that devs are working on but there are so many bugs and glitches. like options not showing or getting flung out of the map sometimes not being able to even move. The good thing about this con is that I like to think that its getting fixed by devs and should hopefully not be a big problem in the near future.Further more is how Dead By Daylight makes some of the most horrible maps for killers. Maps can suck for two reasons pallets being everywhere or the map being HUGE. Backwater swamp is the biggest and foggiest map ever so catching survivors is so hard and frustrating.Autohaven wreckers is an example of how pallets can be so annoying you cant go 2 seconds without finding a pallet being slammed in your face.Those are some of the biggest cons that i could think of.My overall thought on Dead By Daylight is this. If the develepors keep doing the pros and less of the cons this game will be so much more fun!If they keep doing the cons the game is going to spiral into trash.Thank you so much for reading this it took me about 20 minutes.Tell me if i missed anything and Critical out!",Dead by Daylight

You'll find yourself with a group of more three survivors trying to complete only one goal power up remaining generators to open the exit gates and win the round.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-02,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a great game with plently of maps and a plentiful variety of survivors and killers to choose from. From my experience I've ran into almost zero issues and couldn't be happier with the performance of the game. I could honestly play this for hours and bringing friends only adds to the fun. To be honest I've played plenty of rounds and I've come to appreciate the multiple tactics that is surviving every killers different game styles. However and here it comes Freddy is undoubtably a very powerful foe. I'm not going to make the argument that he needs to be nerfed. I just believe that he needs to be ... tweaked slightly. I've had my fair share of wins and losses but not once having came across Freddy have I nor my randomly matchmaked party been able to successfully escape him. I invite challenges in games besides that's what makes them way more fun but Freddy is most definetly an overwhelming enemy. I in my good faith hope they find a fair way to balance the character for both stressed survivors and blood thirsty killers. If no compromise can be made or even the developers don't want to make changes I can accept that. So long as they add a feature where survivors can choose which Killers they DO and DO NOT want to encounter in matchmaking. It's a longshot but if that's what it takes I'll bite. Lastly before anyone proclaims I'm a sore loser I'd like to contest that because I've played enough to have many Wins / Losses and I'm fine with that. However when players start disconnecting in game or bite the dust once Freddy is the killer that's when there is an issue. Freddy has pretty much manifested himself into the in game meme equivalent of certain death / failure itself.

2017-02-01,0,0,132,False,Recommended,Really fun game. Play killer solo or queue up with 3 other friends or randoms as survivors. The only problem is that the game is bugged to Getting stuck on random terrain falling through the floor and floating are some of the bugs you may encounter. There are also exploits where killers can use survivor perks to reveal other survivors and harmless glitches like having a killer weapon (unusable) on a survivor. The matches are also killer hosted so survivors are at the mercy of their internet connection. For some reason when playing survivor the more people you are in queue with the longer it takes to find a match even though a 4 man queue who only needs a killer SHOULD be quick. There is also a bug where offerings aren't used up and can be endlessly spammed game after game. Once they fix all of the bugs I will change my review.****EDIT Most of the bugs have been fixed so heres that thumbs up,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-19,0,0,490,False,Recommended,"So I see a lot of people being semi misleading and thought I would clear some things up a bit first this game is not p2w you don't have to spend a single penny on dlc if you don't want to currently all the survivors have nothing unique because of teachables every survivor/killer has 3 perks that (until the teachables are learned) are unique to the these teachables are gotten at levels 30 35 40 for everyone since survivors have no powers or anything only killers really provide a unique play experiance (at least at tie of posting it has been hinted passives may be a thing for survivors one day) killers all have a unique power so you can play the killer you want now Dead by Daylight does get free killers currently only 2 recent ones but each killer plays differently some powers allow the killer to really shorten a chase (Nurse Myers Hillbilly Wraith(post rework) Leatherface and Trapper) now Killers also can fall into multiple catagories so have a list1. Trapper Utilizes placement of bear traps to slow or prevent going through certain areas (his traps can be disabled as can hag) these can shorten a chase or even catch an unaware survivor off guard2.Wraith(going to use knowledge of his rework as currently he isn't very good) He is able to find survivors easier when bleeding and he is also good at chasing going in and out of invisiblity to keep up with survivors during a chase (weak to flashlights while invis causing a longer stun)3.Hillbilly A high map pressure killer using a chainsaw to dash around the map from gen to gen that allows him to instant down survivors (his turning can be weak without addons or knowledge)4.Nurse Another strong map pressure killer that requires lots of skill and practice to do well as she can blink (short range but longer with charge up) the weakness is a mini stun after a blink with longer range equaling longer stun also can be easily juked by a smart survivor or due to poor nurse knowledge5.Huntress A killer who can hurt survivors at range with a throwing axe (can be hard to aim as there is no crosshair also hums that reveals location while roaming) Another killer that requires practice but can do well in a lot of casesPaid killers 1.Hag A killer who places traps that pop a illusionary version of her which she can teleport to (can be crouch walked over without activating or burned away with a flashlight) this killer requires knowledge of the game to do well with as proper trap placement is very important as she is slower then other killers2.Myers A very strong killer if you are new and want a dlc buy him first easy to play killer that requires little game knoweldge to do well with (He stalks survivors after a certains amount of stalking you gain a tier. 1st tier smal lunge slower speed but non existant terror range. 2nd tier normal lunge range normal speed with a normal terror radius. 3rd tier heavily increased lunge faster window vault insta down atks) mind you he can only stalk a survivor for so much till they turn red and give no more towards his power3.Doctor(my fav) A killer with two stances 1st allows for a ranged lighting attack that increases a survivors madness and prevents them from doing any action for 2.5 seconds (this is a charge up attack) along with your terror radius increasing madness (this does no damage mind you) (madness 1 30% chance of a skill check going to a random spot on screen First time reaching this makes a survivor scream revealing where they are. madness 2 60% chance of a skill check moving to a random spot on screen first time reaching this makes a survivor scream revealing where they are. Madness 3 survivors can not longer repair gens or heal themselves or others they also periodically scream revelaing themselves they then have to ""snap out of it"" which causes skill checks to pop that have to be succeded in order to go back to madness 2) his second form is just a form allowing him to hit people4.Leatherface Utilizes a chainsaw like hillbilly but instead of a dash he gains a small speed up that then allows him to swing his chainsaw in front of him multiple times (this is an instant down) he is more of a defensive killer that is meant to patrol gens hard to find his prey and then down them(sometimes multiple survivors) 5.The Sandman (not yet released so I have no clue)I hope this helps people better understand killers the only current glaring issues I would like to note is there are instant blind flashlights (thus wraith being terrible rn) and killers can face camp which involves blocking a survivor from being unhooked from meat hooks (this is being fixed and shouldn't be an issue within the next week or two) also the dbd reddit is the best place for info and people to ask questions D so have fun out there in the fog!",Dead by Daylight

I quit out and now I'm heading for a refund. GG. WP. Wait times and game stability scared me at least.********************************EDIT*******************************************Okay! I have rebought this game after several months.. Well that's a lie. The bitter taste left from my previous experience kind of made me want shred my SSD as I installed this game but I waited. I was told the game was better and that every issue with the game had been solved.Well. I have to say the game (FINALLY GOD DAMN FUNCTIONAL) actually works pretty well. You can use several different approached to the game and enjoy gameplay by yourself or with friends. I personally have no tendency towards either as it's now really fun to play both.THE WORST CURRENT THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE CAMPERS. THESE ARE THE GAMES WORST ATTROCITY. However it happens less recently so maybe they're addressing the issue. TL DR NOW ACTUALLY PLAYABLE AND REALLY GOOD GAME. EXCITING. YOU'LL PROBABLY S!!T YOURSELF AGAINST MYERS.*************************************************************************************************************** NEW REVIEW 02/10/2017Okay so leaving my third review for this game so far a lot of mechanics have been changed and there's be a whole lot of improvements made. In my opinion the game now has become unplayable again. I would understand if it was down to my computer but I'm fairly sure it's not. I'm using a I7 7700k with watercooling 1070 overclocked and have a tested build that can download a stream of data at 50 75 mbps. This isn't an issue of my computer can't handle it. Now that I've gotten that out of the way let's look at what's wrong *CURRENTLY*. There is an imbalance towards the killers favour now however that's nothing to complain about I get the logic the devs are going for. They want there to be two survivers and two killed survivers in each game. That's cool it adds to the game make it more competitive maybe it's been taken a bit too far in some cases (leatherface is frankly too OP and they need nerfing) but hey ever game has an OP character.Now that isn't what has made the game unplayable now in my opinion.What made the game unplayable in my opinion is the fact that the game couples you with people from all over the world nothing inherently wrong with this but after a few days of playing the game I literally cannot play the game because I'm rubber banding (pinging on the screen all over the place) because I have a 500 ping average for each game that I'm being put into. 90% of the killers I'm facing are from Russia / some other far away country again nothing wrong with that I truly do not mind it at all. But if I'm dying from jumping half way across the map when I'm fixing a generator or opening an exit gate and still having heavy heart beat despite the fact the killer just hooked someone from the other side of the map something is seriously seriously wrong with the game. If you need to make it so that UK players face UK players and American players face American players do it. People would rather wait 5 minutes longer in a queue than play with 500 700 ping...I will still recommend this game but if this isn't fixed soon I'm changing to negative. **************************************************************************************************************,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-30,0,0,624,False,Not Recommended,TLDR An addicting but buggy and unbalanced game. Fun for a limited time. Can't recommend as is.Let's start with the fact that there's no tutorial. Only pictures and text. Try to learn skill check sound from that. Or the fact that the red stripes on ground mean someone ran there.Some people like to learn things through mistakes but some people don't.If you try to play a little more seriously you'll see how many problems are nested in this game. I don't play mind playing casually but the games ranking makes the games a little bit tryhardy.When you hit single digit ranks the games gets really toxic and joining a lobby takes forever. And players DC or give up early all the time no matter what rank they are.And when the game eventually connects to a killer lobby it connects to lobbies with 250 1000ms ping like 2/3 of the time and you'll have to DC and wait again. And lobbies get disconnected all the time from killers side. They're screening survivors I guess or maybe some survivors don't understand to DC with &gt 300ms ping.Playing lone survivor there's little strategy. If you happened to take a flashlight against the hag or wraith you win the lottery. Of couse if you play with 3 friends with voice chat the game changes totally and becomes unfair for the killer.Playing killer you can choose the killer perks and offerings based on survivors and their items so there's some strategy.Some more problemsYou can stun the nurse mid blink but she can still hit you after the stunned blink which seems super fair.Hit boxes are a mess so playing huntress or against her is lottery. This affects hillbilly somewhat as well no matter which side you're on.There's no real counterplay against leatherface other than try to run away and slow him down. If the player is good you're f'd. His chainsaw doesn't seem to hit terrain much at all so you can't pull any anti hillbilly moves on him. Also crouching has helped me like 1 time I think and lockers have saved me 0 times.Lithe doesn't activate reliably when the killer starts chasing you. Even with chase music.Pallets seem to hit kinda randomly too. My record is when I hit a hag from like 1m away with a pallet but sometimes they don't seem to hit when on point. Desync?The last big update ruined the games balance big time. Leatherface itself isn't the (biggest) problem but the perks that came with him.Nurse or hillbilly with barbecue &amp chili + nurses calling is such a pain. Or losing your item with 100% chance when getting hit.I bought a bunch of extra content right before they released him and would've 100% refunded them if Steam would allow it.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-16,0,0,535,False,Recommended,"Dead by daylight consists of a 4v1 players game where survivors need to repair gens to escape and killers need to kill them. Although there is only one ""mode"" to play the game is equipped with lots of perks and habilities that you gain by winning matches making it really fun and vicious. I played for 4 hundred hours and i dont regret it! But there are lots of problems as well. The community is really toxic sometimes and can deeply make u feel that you suck in tge game and you have to get over it. There are also dlc's to buy which are expensive (for me at least). These dlc's are changed regularly by the developers but lots of times they ruin the perfect dlc that you spent your money with and it kinda make it look garbage. But there are always changes to be done. I really enjoy playing this game!!10/10",Dead by Daylight

There is a pretty steep learning curve but if you play survivor you'll advance fairly quickly.If however you choose to play the killer? Be ready to be bullied and mocked by teams of survivors using voice comms the game balance wasn't designed for. Be ready for devs who seem to value survivor gameplay over killer gameplay.Game itself gets a thumbs up lack of balance to make the game equally fun for both sides gets a thumbs down.

This game is plauged with a decent amount of problems that made me realised. tbh this game should still be in beta with the amount of connection issues bugs and exploits. This game isn't anything special and if you're interested in the game I'd just wait for Friday to come out or watch gameplay on youtube bc this game gets very repetative.Edit in 2017Although the game has seen many updates and optimization I still can't recommend this game for solo players If you are playing w/ friends against a killer it can be somewhat fun though,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-19,0,0,123,False,Recommended,Previous review can be found below I'll just update my thoughts on the game for a bit.Much has changed. Much hasn't. If they release a patch that breaks the game they don't revert it they wait until they find a fix. I don't like this behavior it feels unprofessional but that's how the entire game feels to me.That being said I can tell they are at least trying to improve the game. The grinding was made somewhat easier they're still putting new content out some of which you don't even need to pay for. And even with all the bugs and whatnot the game is fun. You can play a good couple of hours without getting bored. From what I said below much still holds true but if you can gather a few friends you can lighten up the game's issues.I'd guess the worse part of playing the game is trying to find people who want to put up a fair game which takes both skill and a good mindset by everyone involved. Both sides can decide to ruin each other's fun and unfortunately that sums up more than half of your matches.Should you buy it? If you have the money to spare sure go for it. Chances are the positives will outweight the negatives. Old review I never thought I'd regret paying for a game the way I did with this one.Let me state this before anything else the game's idea is great. I didn't play over 10 hours of it because I found it boring.But I wanted to know what is going on inside those devs' heads. I've seen a few dozen free games that make this game look like a joke programmed by a teenager who just found out about Unity. I've probably had more crashes than matches in this game and I'm not exaggerating at all. I've known from people here and there that this game had issues but I couldn't possibly imagine they were so bad.I'm not even getting into things like toxic community or the ridiculous grinding system it has. But I probably should because unless you've played over 10 hours on a single character you'll just get frustrated at how everyone has better setups than you do. Also did I mention that like 60% of the matches someone disconnects before it even starts? You can guess how balanced things get when it happens.I have no idea what made me go through with the purchase when everything else pointed to this. I guess I wasn't expecting the game to be this broken. Maybe if the game was free I would understand the lack of quality or interest on improving the game but given they are constantly releasing new content and charging almost half of the game's price for a pack of two characters... yeah I can't really understand why this game is so poorly finished.Honestly what I want to say is if you're planning on buying this you better know what you're getting yourself into. The game is fun yeah but sometimes it feels like you're stressing yourself trying to make it work more than you're actually playing it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-15,0,0,1363,False,Recommended,As I write this I have 1156 hours played. I have bought every DLC up to this point(besides the soundtrack) however some were on sale. If you bought everything at full price the game+all DLC would add to $64. 1156/64 18.06. That means if I payed full price for everything I would have gotten 18 hours per dollar. However I bought many DLC on sale and none of them are necessary to heavily enjoy the game due to all DLC maps and perks being available in the base game. If I simply bought the base game at $20 I would have gotten 58ish hours per dollar. Extreme price to entertainment ratio. Cannot recommend enough.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-11,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Loved the game But it has some problemsI've got about 24 hours in the game at the time of writing this and I have to say I love the game. The gameplay is riveting and the balance is pretty good asd well I have never left a match unhappy. The problem is thatI rarely get a match due to a certain bug I am experiencing. I won't go into the full details but about 3/4 of the times I try to go into a match the game boots me back into a bugged main screen and I have to restart the game. From what I can tell the bug is rare I've only seen a few people on the internet get it but it is near game breaking for me.A common problem even without bugs is matchmaking which can be difficult due to the killer survivor ratio.Verdict good game for 20 dollars but be prepared for matchmaking difficulty and possibly some bugs.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-11,0,0,532,False,Recommended,Of course i appreciate what the devs are trying to achieve with their most recent DLC (raising money for charity) But i feel trying to reach out tothe listed twitch streamers and basically turning every player into a walking add not the best way to go about it. Instead of reaching out to the big names that continue the play this game they should be reaching out particularly to those anonimous players who have been playing this game from the start or even other twitch streamers without a lot of followers or views to show that even their support is realised and appreciated rather than asking for more money for extremely basic articles of clothing. To summerise the overall game of Dead By Daylight is recommendable but this particular DLC is far from that. Dissapointing to say the least. I feel there are far more pressing matters that needs to be addressed that have as of yet been ignored.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-07,0,0,324,False,Recommended,The game is like a 4v1 strategic game. You choose a survivor/killer depending on their special trait. some survivors are sneaky others have leadership skills depends on what you prefer. Some killers can be sneaky (mike myers dlc) others very loud but fast. Your main objective as a survivor is always to escape wether through a hatch or through the main exit. You escape through the main exit by teaming up and fixing all the generators going through skill checks (some perks make it easier for you). Your main goal as a killer is to catch the survivors and hang them on a hook giving other survivors the chance to unhook them. As I said every killer has their own special trait like the trapper which can place bear traps and notify the killer where they were trapped. The game can get very intense making it interesting.Bottom line this game is worth it especially with this price. I would rate it 6/6 generators!,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-27,0,0,266,False,Recommended,Game is amazing and suprisingly deep. It gives you all kind of options. You would think that the game would bore you within 2 hours of playing it but since you actually have so much freedom on what way you choose to play the game you can spend hundreds of hours playing it.I recommend to buy it. It is well worth the price.And btw the reviews complaining about bugs are honestly over exagerrated. If any of you knew anything about programming you would actually understand why a game with so much choices has to have some bugs in it. Personally I have only encountered 1 in my 100 hours of playing this game that was kinda game breaking but funny (I was hooked 1 and died inmediately) the rest of the bugs are just funny. If you don't have a terrible PC you will run this game with no problems.Its a unique and very special game that deserves more popularity.The developers definitely took a risk in producing it but in doing so they have created an almost new type of game. It is truly a master piece of programming so I forgive the little mistakes it has.I also want to talk about the balancing of the game. So as a rank 5 survivor I can honestly say that all you people complaining about killers not being balanced (freddy) they really are. If you keep dying as a survivor it is only your fault. If your team isn't helping you then change your tactics become a sole survivor. If you keep losing well maybe you actually need to help out your team specially in the beginning when there is 5 gens. Once there is 3 then you can start being a little selfish.The game is balanced developers did a pretty damn good job and they don't deserve to be blamed for you losing and losing over again. This game requires a lot of thinking and strategy sometimes to win against good killers. If you are still not sure if the game is worth it buy it while on sale or try it out on free weekends. Even though it is worth 20 bucks for sure.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-26,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"2 modes of play Survivor or killer. Survivor NEED TO WORK AS A TEAM you have to ""POP"" generators by completing skill checks your reaction times here matter and help other survivors when they are caught and ""hooked"" by the killer. You are rewarded ""blood points"" for your endeavours. The more you do the better your teamwork the bigger your contribution the greater the reward There are a selection of survivors you can choose from very little separates them at the lower levels but once you get to about level 25 35 the differences really begin to show. It s a good idea to level up 2 or 3 survivors as they can share abilities at the higher levels between them. KILLERS Need to ""hunt"" the survivors and kill them hit them to take them down then hang them on hooks there are a selection of killers each have different weapons and abilities and require different play abilities. Advantages A co operative group of survivors that work together will have a better chance than people that run of doing their own thing. this game promotes teamwork not just about yourself. a good killer will add suspense to the game the better the killer the more skilled the more active the more they hunt move about strategise the better the game.Disadvantage CAMPERS! and FACE CAMPERS CAMPER KILLER Will walk around you in a medium sized circle so that they can see you at all times on the hook and make it imposable for the other survivors to rescue you! Their (the camper killer) justification for this is they are using you as BAIT to draw the other players in! REALISTICLY If you camp then the other survivors will see this and not come to rescue you from the hook! And you (the camper killer) have just made everyone else hate you! FACE CAMPERS the most unskilled of all the killers. Their lack of skill shows in the fact that they only know how to stand in your face and watch you die if you are unlucky enough to get hooked by a face camper forget getting rescued..... no one likes camper killers please do the game a favour don t become one.IMPROVEMENT TO THE GAME Personally I would like to see the killer buffed the longer they stand around camping once they have the survivor on the hook they should be buffed for being in range. Movement buff or aura buff. Slow the killer down or better SHOW THE KILLER UP for the lack of skill and ability they really don t have! Reward the killers that don t camp.... by not buffing them. Think about it. If the killer stand by you for 10 seconds and have lost 100% of their movement (that s 10% of the killers movement reduced for every second they stay within maybe 24 meters of the active hook) then the person being camped can be rescued in front of the very face of the camper and nothing they can do about it because they are to TRANSFIXED to react they will be either TO SLOW to chase or totally stuck transfixed maybe if the developers were to do this properly they could even make it that the penalty is heaver applied the closer to the hook they are so face campers get transfixed in 6 to 8 seconds while an area camper gets maybe 10 to 12. It would soon push killers into playing a better game and add a little new difficulty to the killers roll and balance back the game a little given how hard it is to survive with all the skill checks and other buffs already placed on the survivors.",Dead by Daylight

2017-10-21,0,0,559,False,Recommended,Product received for free. If I could only play one game It would most likely be this game. They way the developers made this the texture and detail are beautiful. The game play gives you a rush where you have to be stealth and sneaky as a survivor or scary and sneaky as a hunter. Where the more you play the more you are strengthened like its not a P2W. They way you can even customize your characters and hunters and get achievements for reaching level 50 each time and that there is a character for everyone to pick from a nervous pizza nerd to a solider and all the dlc's in between. The hunters each give their own experience to the survivors each one is different. Now there is some bad stuff you can get a bad match where you have a camping hunter or a way to over powered group of survivors that are all friends using discord or other communication device but it just makes it more intersting having to use the best of your ability to beat them and have brag power in the end. This game is worth every peny and I have to thank my friend so much for introducing this game to me and buying it for me cause I love this game so much it is just a piece of art. Even if you think your going to lag there is a little bar that tells you your ping with the hunter so you dont have to waste your time if it isnt going down the game runs so smoothly well besides when you glitch and land on the oppisite of the pallet you know the side with the hunter on it...I highly recomend getting this game.,Dead by Daylight

I learned to just keep playing and let the unique feeling you get from the game sink it. Its decent after you get past the unknown. Once you start to learn the players/killers You learn the basics.

2017-10-22,0,0,210,False,Recommended,Got this on sale awhile back just recenetly got into playing it. It's pretty fun although most of the early ranked survivors/killers are pretty toxic and most of them are more focused on saving you instead of getting generators but it's still fun to play.Playing as a killer is always fun but be prepared to be called a camper by everyone even if you don't camp. There are quite a few killers and survivors to play and level up with an optional prestige mode that gives you cosmetics so you aren't pressured into doing it. The maps are really nice but a few of them really suck as a killer. The perks for survivors are set up so that most of the high ranked people use the same 4 perks which can be really annoying Hopefully there is an update that gives other perks a chance and gives them more benefits. The only real issues i've had with the game is the lobby breaking(to which you just leave then requeue up) and on rare occassion when i do a survive with friends it puts me into a different lobby.It's a really cool game fun with friends fun as a killer and fun as a survivor. 10/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-07,0,0,467,False,Recommended,As of January 7 2017 the gameplay itself is great but its matchmaking system is a complete failure. I'm not talking about who gets paired with who (which is also an issue). I'm talking about whether or not it will even pair you up with ANYONE. It bugs out more than half of the time and kicks you back into the player menu.Another issue is that you're lucky to find a decent match where all four survivors load into the map where you can finally play. It takes ages to load into a match sometimes after you've been paired up with everyone too.If you go to join a public lobby through matchmaking (your only option) sometimes the game glitches and sits on the loading screen forever. You have to kill the game's .exe process and reboot it if you want to try and play again.If you're playing with friends you need to manually invite them again after each match. It kicks everyone back to their player menu after each match.It's truly a shame to see such a great game go to waste if the developers don't pick up on these obvious flaws. Otherwise the gameplay is great and the game itself is fine once you load into a map. Currently I do not recommend this to friends until the developers fix these issues.***EDIT*** Septemeber 27 2017 ***EDIT***Wow! A developer actually listened to their community and fixed their game for the most part! I mean it too. The game is much better now and it's much more playable now!

Granted it wasn't one of their finest moment's and I personally didn't experience the bug. However one of my friends did and for those who actually read the comments I hope that the bug didn't put you off.The game is great if you want to play something for ages and not get bored the fact they were able to create a game that can do that is amazing! The bug was just one of those hug bugs that comes every once and a while the game is constantly being developed and if anyone has done coding you will understand why it's hard to find the one little thing that wrong. I am 98% sure that the developers have fixed the bug. So it shouldn't be a problem now. Yeah I understand that to all the people who have played this game for so long that it kills you that all your progress has gone but if you message the developers they will get back to you. It might take a while but if you think about how many people play this game I would give them a little slack.Personally I love this game and it just keeps getting better if the bug does happen don't let it put you off the game.

2017-11-26,0,0,252,False,Recommended,When looking at the game thinking about buying it don't take the negative reviews seriously. They complain how hard it is but in reality they just dont know how to play properly. Unlike me i was a naturaly good killer and normally get a 4 kill even with no perks. People just don't understand how to play and instead trying to get better they try to complain so the game can become uneven and unfair. But TBH I would take time to watch Dead by Daylight channels as they can easily teach you some cool tricks and help you be a better survivor or killer. The only problem I have with the game is that when I moved I learned that comcast or really any good internet service so if you have horrible internet like me I get around 400 ping in most games and in this one if the killer has bad internet too then I have about 900 1000+ ping. I have learnded to deal with this but sometimes the game is just unplayable and if you too have horrid internet then dont get the game untill you do have better internet. And the last thing i have a problem with is how much DLCs there are and how much they cost for maybe 2 characters and thats it. But over all I would 100% recommend this game as it can provide limitless fun and can be so addicting especially if theres is like a double bloodpoints weekend or something.

2017-01-28,0,0,2106,False,Recommended,"It's a fun game for the price tag and it will get you plenty of quality gameplay. Here's a list of what I think the pros and cons are.Pros Fun core gameplay The game's fundamentals revolve around a Hide and Seek like gameplay that has a killer pitted against 4 survivors who try to run and hide from an unkillable killer. It's intense at times and it's great to pair up with your friends for a good time. Interesting Lore The game has an interesting and mysterious backstory that is obviously Lovecraftian based. It centers around a dark force known as ""The Entity"" that is the puppet master behind the events taking place. It feeds off the hope of the survivors whom it has taken into its own realm. It's an interesting read if you ever get the time to sift through it all. Licensed Content The devs of this game use their money wisely as they've selected slasher films' most notable icons such as Michael Myers and Leatherface so far. They plan to do more licensed characters in the future of course.Cons Higher level gameplay has dubious balance There is a learning curve to be had as survivor once you get into the game and killer is easier to pick up off the bat but when the game gets into higher level play the dichotomy reverses. The killer ends up having a tougher time outplaying the survivors due to large margin for human error designs that are easily exploited in higher level play. These designs include but are not limited to Pallet looping exploitation of poor pallet design by circling an object near the pallet resulting in a maximum waste of the killers time. Just type in pallet looping on youtube and you'll see what I mean. Infinites There exists areas on the maps that can force a killer to run in a large circle several times before being able to catch up. They usually involve a window in the center of a long wall this is a problem because the killer vaults through these windows slower resulting in the survivor constantly gaining ground while the killer inches through. Perks There are ""crutch perks"" at the survivor's disposal that can be used in a way that punishes the killer. Most notably of these perks are ""Decisive Strike"" which allows you to break free from the killers grasp once per game and ""Borrowed Time"" which allows you a limited frame of invincibility after unhooking a survivor.Overall I'd recommend the game if you intend to play it casually but if you are going into higher ranks patience is definitely a virtue.",Dead by Daylight

It is more stratagy and no not camp to make things fun which i really enjoyed but WAIT! yet you will get blinded by a flashlight every single time you pick up a survivor and lose the survivor . I made almost 20k in points and did not kill one person.

2016-10-15,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,"Not sure if I should give it thumbs up or thumbs down. Bought the game because I saw how much fun the Achievement Hunter guys were having playing this and it was fun but only for the first couple of hours. Not because of the mechanics or the gameplay though those are great and I enjoy them. It's because as is my experience in any other Multiplayer game the matchmaking is You either destroy or get destroyed. No middle ground. Doesn't matter if you're a survivor or a killer. You either steamroll or you get steamrolled. Which is no fun for anyone. Guess I'm gonna go with a thumbs down.EDIT Oh and by the way I meet the minimum system requirements but I still rarely get to 30fps even on the lowest graphical settings which is really frustrating. It would help if you specify the necessary processor speed cause everywhere I look it just says that I need at least a Intel Core i3 4170 or AMD FX 8300 + ""CPU SPEED Info.""

2017-12-16,0,0,802,False,Recommended,This game is a massive thrill fest when I first laid eyes upon it i dismissed it for looking weird and pointless but it's not. It's actually super fun its 4 v 1. You can play either survivor or killer I find both roles fun at certain times but the killer normally gets a hard time. If you're a survivor you can loop things and slam stuff down to stun the killer which is hilarious or if you're killer you can knock survivors down and carry them away to hooks you can either face camp until they die or go find other survivors. It really is a trolls wet dream.,Dead by Daylight

Good Gameplay. Lot of maps and features. The perfect player ammount for a horror game. Nice story. Nice maps. Nice characters. A good and long level up system.Bad things You can't heal yourself sometimes. Is very hard escape of the hak when you're the last survivor I think the chance escape can be around 50% when you're last survivor. I think can be good if killer when you escape of hax can't move for 5 secs or can't see you for 5 secs. I think can be good if on custom games with 4 friends and you you can put a unlimited players ammount and unlimited generators ammounts and you can select how you want the session be because you will not get bloodpoints or league up for that. I think can be good if there is a new gamemode because always is the same gamemode and the same goal and well that tires a bit /.Other thing what I have to say it's I don't see bad when the killer is camping just he watch over what he taked so I don't think camp is ""Bad"".Conclusion The game is good and funny it's one of the best actual horror games it have some bad things but well I think every games can have bad things.

The devs are pretty idiotic and biased in there game decisions they were on the right track but for some reason got torn off track and is now "" Buffing "" The underpowered killers into not being used and the only decent killers atm are Huntress Nurse Hillbilly and Doctor but if you play any of those well you will be blocked immediatly by the cherry picking survivors that use MLGA. And to be fair to survivors as you go up in rank if you have any exclusive or prestige cosmetic or any items you will be dodged and you will be camped and tunneled no matter what you do.

It is very unique concept and I've gotten addicted to it. Just make sure to backup your profile because the Devs don't give two s what happens to it.The worse thing about this game is OP Freddy Krueger. It's ing ridiculous playing against him. Of course you'll see people saying that Freddy isn't overpowered and he doesn't need a nerf. Complete t. Every time survivors play against Freddy it isn't fun as he just walks up to you while invisible pulls you into dreamland then sodomizes you while you pointlessly try to run away because he can see you through walls when you're not around him. Frankly it ruins the game for me.,Dead by Daylight

The gameplay is super fun and although it honestly isn't that scary once you get used to it it's still thrilling. I still get the occasional scare when The Shape creeps up on me or when I turn a corner to run right into the killer. PositivesThrilling if not Scary gameplaySupport for multiple playstyles Teamwork being highly encouraged and enabledFun and Unique survivors and killers (None of them are the same thematically)Cool perks and Killer abilitiesLOTS of customization optionsIncludes survivors maps and killers from well know Horror properties such as Bill from L4D and Micheal Myers (The Shape)Regular DLCOcasional Free DLCNegativesSome characters lack customization optionsMost of the DLC is paid No clear stance on things like FacecampingI highly recommend Dead by Daylight. It is very fun and any fan of horror would love it. The gameplay is easy to pick up but is very deep if you choice to put time into the game. The pros easily outweigh the cons. A lot of the problems the game had a few months ago have been fixed and the Devs have become a lot more communicative with the community. They even hired a community manager a few months ago which has made communcation between us and them a whole lot better. Rating 8.7/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-10,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,There is no longer a meta in this game. The latest update buried survivors into the ground and left no balance. The biggest issue I have with this game is as a survivor when hooked chances of escape are very very slim. I don't mean attempting escape what I mean is that when another survivor unhooks a hooked survivor the hooked survivor now has to evade the killer while injured which is nearly impossible if the killer is half decent. The main reason this is true is that every single decent or above average killer will camp hooked survivors they won't facecamp but they will stay within the vicinity. As soon as someone gets unhooked the killer will dart straight back to the crime scene and down the originally hooked survivor. Killers have no penalty whatsoever for camping according to this new meta once a survivor is hooked they're dead for sure. Borrowed time was the only counter to this sickining meta but the developers obviously had to bury that perk into the ground because why make a balanced game? I understand survivors would pallet loop and troll killers for a crazy amount of time before this latest update which needed fixing. But something needs to change for sure hooked survivors don't have an actual chance of escape which wasn't the intent of the developers in the first place. Getting hooked once and dying because of it is just not fair for survivors. Please review and fix this update.,Dead by Daylight

The developers have shown time and time again that they are really trying to make a great game. It's a learning experience for everyone involved and I think that's really fun. The developers have no reference material to work with so everything comes down to experementing and figuring out what works and what doesn't. At the very least this leads to interesting patches and fun new mechanics to toy around with. All in all this is a good game and I can only see it getting better.

A good example of this was how a little bit ago the game didn't feature any way to get in a game with your friends (which alot of people weren't ok with and for very good reason) so the devs made an option right at the main menu so you can group up with your buddies and survive together. With a good bit of polishing up and spit shinning I believe that this game will definitley go far and is worth a buy when It's on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-03,0,0,417,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is one of those games you either love or hate for the majority of gamers there's no middle ground when it comes to DBD. Game mechanics are fairly simple and the objective play as well killers try and down/hook all the survivors to sacrifice to the Entity survivors try and activate enough generators to power the gates to exit the trial before being sacrificed. Gameplay sounds easy enough but the game itself has a fairly steep learning curve. Killers and survivors have various perks to unlock to give additional abilities as well as items (for survivors) and addons for items/killer abilities and offerings to affect gameplay for each trial. Developers are active in trying to balance gameplay but there are still balancing issues (nothing game breaking but sometimes frustrating). Devs toss out tons of DLC (and a suprising amount of free DLC too which is amazing) and for the most part have done well to get some licensing rights for some really cool killers (Michael Myers Leatherface Freddy Kruger). Love all the extra content they've released so far and have purchased it except for Freddy (they absolutely botched his mechanics completely). The community is really 50/50 in my opinion I've run into some really toxic people but I've also had the pleasure of playing with some really cool folks as well. In any event I'd say watch some Youtube videos to see if you're interested in the game and give it a shot if you see it's on sale. I'd definitely recommend this game but sometimes you have to accept you're going to get frustrated playing it (like getting face camped/tunnelled as a survivor or constantly getting insta blinded by a group of survivor friends as killer).,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-22,0,0,966,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight (DBD) is a fun game with lots of potential. Some of the play styles of players as survivors and killers can make or break the game. Biggest issues * The 'camping' killer that moves only a few meters away from a hooked survivor and claims they weren't camping just 'patrolling'. While camping can be considered a strategy and right by a killer (hey they are there to kill you not play nice) it does lead some survivors to rage quit since they have no chance of being rescued and if they are pulled down the camping killer typically 'tunnels' the injured survivor quickly. (Nothing like just taking out the easiest target). * The 'slamming' of pallets breaks occasionally either causing you to rush through the pallet to same side as killer instead of stunning the killer OR *major bug* the killer or survivor is stuck in/on the pallet. If the survivor is stuck the killer can break the pallet and hit the survivor (or place in dying state if survivor was already hurt). If the killer is stuck the survivors cannot do anything to free the killer so they either finish the round (and get 'free' bloodpoints) or the Killer disconnects and ruins the game for themselves (their score goes to 0 and survivors get bonus ""5000"" survival points. * Endless pallet looping survivors just irritate the killers and can make them rage quit. While looping is consider by many a valid strategy it can and does lead to killer's rage quitting. They may want to implement a change to pallets like they did to windows and block survivors from abusing the same pallet over and over. This would change the dynamic somewhat and lead to additional strategies.These are just my opinions of things that should be looked at for improvements. There are other issues in the game that are addressed slowly. Sometimes changes are made to killers that are unneeded unwarranted etc because people (survivor mains) want to always cake walk troll etc the killer and if a killer can prevent them easy bloodpoints its a whine fest (aka Changes to Freddy when he first came out to his neutered down self).Feel free to agree or disagree with the above. I am not complaining or asking for things to be banned just looking for ways to improve and reduce the amounts of raging quitting due to some of the items mentioned above.As I said other things really need improvement (not even going to touch on the ""matchmaking"" system that can takes extremely long times to find a match to even play) but these are some of biggest issues i've seen over my 600+ hours of playtime.",Dead by Daylight

2017-05-22,0,0,553,False,Not Recommended,"After many hours of gamplay I can honestly say what began as an awesome game for me quickly rolled down hill faster and faster spiraling out of control. First is the pros.+Great graphics and sounds.+Plenty of characters and killers to choose from each with their own sets of unique perks.+Cool to see executions.+Haven't seen many bugs. Some occasionally maybe once in 20 or 30 games. (May just be lucky?)+Weird cult people running around doing... Strange things... Example provided in my steam screenshots. Pretty cool though.And now the many cons... But i'll keep it as brief as i can This game is INCREDIBLY survivor biased. Killer perks get nerfed very frequently and survivor perks are just plain ridiculous. (Trying going against people with 2+ borrowed times. The community is absolutely horrendous. When the game ends whether you catch all but one or no one when you see the exit there is always that guy. (I like to call him Uncle Skeeter because why not.) Who stands at the exit repeatedly tea bagging you. Although sometimes it's amusing to bait the little troll out and one hit down him with no one escapes death which almost always makes them rage quit disconect which is priceless. Always run that perk on every killer just to at least get some laugh for the trolls.) The great camping epidemic. The entitled category of survivors are incredibly salty of even the smallest thing that looks like camping. (Patrol in a very large radius around hook your camping. You see someone staring at you from behind a corner less then 3 feet away from hook obviously visible your camping. Standing beside the hook with all exits open and hatch all within visual distance and easy to walk to no sprint needed with zero incentive to leave. Your camping. Standing on the oppiosite end of the map facing the wall still camping. It is ridiculous. The fun ""survive with friends"" an absolute kill joy to nearly every game of high rank. Vs a 4 man premade team with maxed flashlights AND voice chat blinding you continously as they tea bag up and down everytime you look in their direction. You are going to have a very bad time. Not only do they all have flashlights but if they all run 4 borrowed times 4 decisive strikes 4 dead hards/sprints and 4 self cares. Your chance of winning is zero don't waste your time and give them the satisfaction. That being said not all sfw teams are bad it can be a good time for all if they aren't all running the same exact thing and items. or 4 new parts. There are some places in nearly every map where survivors can lead you in circles litteraly forever even with bloodlust which was supposed to fix it. There is still no way to catch up in an infinite loop. However there are some spots which are very long to run around but you can catch up but it takes precious minutes to do so and if you miss god help you. Or if you hit you get to do it again for second hit! If the previous con doesn't get you this one will. Tons and tons of pallets. If 5+ pallets all spawn in one spot. your chances of getting whoever is hiding in there instantly becomes zero and your only choice is to go through it all and waste at least 3 generators or more and still not touch him. Or leave only to chase him again a few minutes later or one of his bodies who repeats the cycle wasting more of your time. one of these 2 cons always happen every game pallet loops or inifinite loops.I can continue to rattle off much more but to save everyones time this will have to suffice for now. Can't keep my review positive anymore so i'm changing it. Will check the game frequently to see what changes it has good potential if some of these issues become addressed.",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-02,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,I honestly want to give this game a good review becuase it is entertaining but the mechanics are so flawed it becomes more of a rage inducer than a legitimate fun game. As the survivor some maps are fine and others are too wide open to be able to avoid the killer so you will unavoidably be hooked. This is fine except for the fact that the other survivors will come unhook you because they dont give two ****s if you live or die they just get 1500 blood points (exp) and can basically rank up after just 3 unhooks and a bit of other stuff. You on the other hand have no chance to escape and will just be hooked again and three in a row means you're automatically dead usually resulting in a derank. If the killer leaves after the game begins you get a derank. If survivors leave mid game you will most likely be slaughtered and again end up deranked. These are just some of the more apparent flaws.As the killer the survivors can constantly pallet stun you run then vault through a window numerous amounts of times because of how the map is layed out. They will sit in between a pallet and wait for you to walk in so they can stun you and you honestly can't do anything about it. Then at the end of the game you will most likely be called a camper for playing the game the way the mechanics allow you to play. Again these are just some of the more apparent flaws.And gameplay wise every play session is just more of the same repairing generators by holding mouse 1 and pushing space every so often. Not much variety besides the strategies used against the different killers.Is dead by daylight a good balanced game? NoIs dead by daylight entertaining? Too an extent if you can look past the flaws.,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-24,0,0,503,False,Recommended,I haven't played this game that much but I'd say it's absolutely worth the 20 . In this game there are four survivors who need to start up five generators around the map and after this open the escape doors while one killer tries to stop them. Sometimes you get adrenaline rushes while escaping the killer and sometimes you feel afraid cause you don't know where the killer is (expecially the Shape aka. Michael Myers in early game). Surviving a match feels good. I can't say much about playing a killer cause I haven't played as one due to my bad modem. There are some bad things like laggy hosts bugs and of course camping killers. Campers can ruin your game experience expecially when they literally stand one meter away from the hook and stare at you untill you die and I think this kind of behaviour should be punishable. Bad hosts can ruin the experience too if the lag is at its worst and you just teleport around the place. I don't recommend this game for people who throw stuff if they rage because of these campers and bad hosts.Good adrenaline rushes pleasure after surviving a match losing the killer while he/she/apache is chasing you variety concept friendly killers team work surviving with friendsBad laggy hosts campers bugs ranking system Rank 20 survivors in the same match with rank 1 killer (this is ed up) finding all survivors for one match can take up to 30 minutes.PS.

2017-12-18,0,0,31,False,Recommended,I so far have enjoyed this game but I recommend getting it with a friend or get it if you have a friend that has the game.I recommend not to play if you get scared easily and don't like getting scared. The game gets really crappy as a survivor if the killer is just camping. If you are the person where you find people popping out of no where funny then I recommend this game (I find this game funny because I love getting chased in games and love making jokes as I play scary games).Other than that the game is pretty decent other than the minor glitches that don't really affect the game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-14,0,0,251,False,Recommended,I have left the original review below as the good points still stand.It seems they have now resolved the progress loss issue which was my main gripe with the game. If this is the case (touch wood) I cant recommend this game enough. So this game is a tale of two reviews...Firstly the game itself is decent and works really well... played both survior and killer and the two different approaches really feel different and allow a large amount of customisation.Everything clicks together from the perks to the maps to really make the mechanics worth coming back for unfortunately thats where we get into the second part of the review.I have 7 hours of playtime at the point of this review and have had 3 full progress resets. This is where any points or items you have earnt just dissapear and you have to start the game from pretty much day 0 again.If you dont mind this and just want to jump in every now and again then its a decent game however if you cant this I would steer clear of this game until the issue is resolved.Its a shame its a decent game but not good enough to have to start from scratch every couple of days.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-26,0,0,224,False,Recommended,I have become completely addicted to this game. I picked this up during the Halloween sale so I have been playing it for about a month. I have about 70 hours on it so far. I mostly play survivor as I have been trying to level a good main and unlock some teachable perks. I have played some killer as well. This game is a ton of fun and it also definitely brings out the salt in players. There is salt from both survivor mains and killer mains. I see both sides of the coin. Survivors can be annoying at times when playing killer and killers can be annoying at times when playing survivor. Like most games there are those that would seek to exploit features and those who just want to have fun.I plan on running this game for quite a bit of time still. I sincerely hope that the devs continue to love nurture and grow it with future updates.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-01,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,First off I've refunded this game as since it doesn't run well on my laptop. The game is fun. It's addicting and at some moments it gets your heart racing. But sweet jesus the community sucks! I know every review says this but it's insane. You have to be half way across the map to not be called a camper. If you can't get any survivor cause they're in a SWF and lose you get called trash and rubbish. And if you touch a SWF group get your inbox ready. I've since moved to PS4 where the community is better ( not by much ) The bugs aren't as bad also. The playerbase is also quite large. I don't recommend this game on PC. The playerbase and unsupporting devs ruin it. I'd recommend PS4 if you'd like to move over. I've met new friends also. XBOX is dying slowly off anyway. I'm ready for people to say get over it or you're a pu!!sy. Get the game on console is all I'm saying. Good day,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-26,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,At first I recommended this game..but after a bit more time I have to say I can't anymore. DBD loses a lot of the tension and horror after a while and the matchmaking system makes it worse. Early players will often be put into groups of extremely skilled ones with abilities that pretty much neutralize your play no matter what you do. The game has no communication system so although survivors have to work together they can never talk or communicate. Killers can secure kills easily simply by camping which survivors hate and will call you out or report you for even though this is a tactic the game fully supports and promotes. This game goes from fun to dull and boring fast.This is a game better suited to watching on a stream than playing it. Even though Friday the 13th is a buggier game it is still a lot more fun to play than this.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-03,0,0,42,False,Recommended,This game is pretty fun I didn't think I'd like it too much when I first started to play and it seemed really hard to get used to at the beginning. Once you learn what you're doing and when you can start reading other survivor types and survivor builds w/ perks and items you can work together without talking. A lot of people are complaining that survivors leave you to die but that is not really the case. This game is hard if you're not with a group of friends there is no way to talk to one another so of course it's going to feel like you're being left behind. I have met plenty of killers and survivors who are not trollish. The only people I have found to be toxic is killers who facecamp but that's because they're ienexperienced and don't want to learn to play the game like they should. Over all I would at least suggest to buy the game while it is on sale and give it a go. Take the time to learn your role and don't try to face camp if you're a killer. This game was made to have fun and that's what we should try to do. You won't win every match and sometimes you'll be the first to die. It happens. It doesn't mean you're team is crap or the killer is a troll every game. Like i said buy the game when it's on sale if you doubt the game's community. Try to play during the day in Central Time Zone that's when I find the most people online. Don't forget to make friends and practice in the Kill Your Friends!,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-22,0,0,89,False,Recommended,This game although not perfect is honestly such a joy. That fear factor is always there even though it does lowkey subside once you get used to you know killers coming out of nowhere the fear of getting to that board the suspense as run for a window the angst as you struggle to get out of a killer's grip as you get closer and closer to a hook. OKAY but this is such an enjoyable game with great variety in both KILLERS and SURVIVORS with cosmetics that spice things up. The leveling system suits this game great and I it keeps you wanting to fight for a rank each new season. Comparing this to F13 is bull FYI because both are different games that have unique things about them although I do suggest both. Overall it's definitely worth the buy even more so on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-29,0,0,186,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a great game that I would recommend to any of my friends who enjoy spooks. Admitedly yes as other negative reviews say there are bugs the game is not perfect and some of the killers are pretty damn strong. But the core aspect of the game ""Horror"" rings true despite these shortcomings.There is a very attentive design approach to Dead by Daylights horror theme and that horror is derived from adversity a point that is missed on a lot of players. If the game were easy or balanced you would not feel even a semblence of horror because you'd always have a way out. The cold truth of the matter is that sometimes you will queue into a game and you will die. Sometimes you might even be the first to die. And thats part of the experience. It creates that tone and atmosphere that can only be established in the time you spend at whatever map you're on. Adapting is a key part of the survivor experience. Learning what does and doesn't work through trial and error. Research and study and grinding points to get addons that will increase your odds. I want to place special attention to the level up system in the game because its probably the best format for a horror type game like this. As you level you'll find that the 'entity' the being that controls all these games will try and eat your level ups and perks. This means you have to carefully strategize how to get in and out of the bloodweb to get the most out of each level. This ideology of optimization and adaptability is what the survivor experience is all about.And when all is said and done if you're having a hard time as a survivor that means its time to truly embrace the entity and play a killer.Killer is the most fun aspect of the game to me. its like playing as an endgame boss and exerting power and fear unto your enemies. I would say to still play survivor to get a hang of the game and get map knowledge before trying killer but once you do you'll find a very fun gory game of hide and seek.Endless strategies endless possibilities. The games can range from very fun to very frustrating and all the feelings in between. Its about learning and applying what you learn to make yourself a better player all the marks of a good video game.",Dead by Daylight

2018-01-07,0,0,79,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. If you like horror slasher films this game is a good homage. To survive as a survivor sometimes you got to think like a killer. To secure a few kills as a killer sometimes you got to think like a survivor.You start at level 1 with a character of your choice and gradually you make your way unlocking perks based on your character until you can unlock teachable perks at level 30 35 and 40 respectively. Teachable perks lets you ""teach"" your character perks to the other characters in a sense letting you transfer your perks to other characters and allowing you to make your own builds with your own combinations. Max level is at level 50 and then you can choose to remain or prestige.Obviously you can only teach killer perks to killers and survivor perks to survivors of course. The game encourages teamwork and lone wolf gameplay at the same time but given the atmosphere of the game you have to make a choice at some point in time. Can you kill them all on your own without the survivors completing objectives and rescuing each other and taking hits for one another? Can you survive together and avoid killers and leave your fellow survivors to die when the time comes?However the negatives of this game is that the perks are incredibly grindly and even after you get the teachable skills on a character obtaining the perks is another question as it's subject to the RNGesus. Oh did i mention your perks have levels and those upgraded perks are ALSO subjected to the RNGesus? Oh you can grind your way up and I find that playing as the killer lets you farm faster and more especially if you know what you're doing. You can sort of farm together WITH the survivors but most of the time the public survivors have no clue of your intentions as there's no chat system in game. There is one in the lobby but that's for the survivors. For survivors? Tough luck it's a lot harder to earn bloodpoints. Still doable. But that's if your killer is nice enough to let you survive. Farm with friends? Hahahahaha you can't do that unless you are able to matchmake with your friend as the killer. Developers and some players say what you want about farming in this game bans and all but if you're going to introduce items that lets you earn more points and subject 85% of the game to the RNGesus then farming should be legitimate. Also the item system is very one sided allowing survivors to keep their items if they survive but killers lose their items regardless if they win or lose. Granted 2 of the perks can substitute as the 2 items and the items are reacquirable but again all the items and their add ons subject to the RNGesus. Given that the community is also toxic whether you play as killers or survivors be prepared to be trolled when playing in pubs. For killers that's 4 players working together. For survivors if you're up against the killer yourself.. Good luck. This game has a lot of potential and i'll admit there's a lot of fun whether I'm playing with my friends or on my own but seriously unless you got a party of friends to co op and go up against the killers or you're playing in private among yourselves or you like to play alone you can wait for sales or just outright skip this game if you're on the negative side. TL DR Pros +You can unleash your inner psycho on those people.+You can unleash your inner survivalist against supernatural killers. +Interesting perks with various killers and survivors with their own advantages and disadvantages+A good number of maps and content for its price.Cons When playing as the survivors you can't fight back against the killers. Survivors be prepared to die. Killers be prepared to be trolled. Hard. Very very grindy and subject to RNG. Which adds to the grind.",Dead by Daylight

2017-09-07,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,No graphics options on a pc game. The excuse offered that being able to toggle for example vsync and AA would somehow be an advantage in multiplayer is laughable and is no doubt an excuse for laziness. The only tutorial offered is entirely a wall of text because laziness. No AI mode because laziness. But most damning of all is that the game uses peer to peer hosting where the killer is always the host. Lag and drops are omnipresent due to this but worse this enables cheating killers to induce lag and rubberbanding in survivors. I personally experienced this in one match where the lag was constant interfering with our ability to fix the generators but when the killer appeared near me suddenly the lag was suspiciously horrific and I was rubberbanding out of control. This occured every time the killer chased me in that match. Everything about this game is lazy and poorly thought out.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-28,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,My boyfriend let me borrow his copy of the game. At first I enjoyed the concept of it and liked it overall then I played a few more games and started to see the issues. The ranking system Unless you're constantly winning games you don't get anywhere with anything. The worst part is even when you're a fairly good player for some reason you still get camping killers and players. I think the ranking system needs to go and it needs to be fair. A rank shouldn't determine how good a person is at the game and whether they deserve to play with better catergories or not. It's the most annoying thing ever when you're trying to have a good game online and the killer camps or the players do absolutely nothing and like me not many of my friends play the game so I have no choice but to play online and I can honestly say most of the time it's just rage enducing and not fun at all. So no unless the ranking system disappears and there's better people playing as killers and more cooperation as a team I won't be recommended this game nor will I be looking for future updates and patches.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-24,0,0,140,False,Recommended,One of the most amazing games I've played in a long time. I thought at first that it was too simple and repetetive but I've played it so much already and I am completely loving every minute. It's a simple game to understand and to play but it has surprising complexity. Totally recommend this to anyone who loves being scared survival games is a horror enthusiast or just wants a fun game to play that actually has a really fantastic community. Oh that's one more thing as someone who mostly plays survivor I have to say I've had some really fun interactions with the people who have played the killer in my games. I have not had a game that didn't end cordially and I just can't even say a negative thing. Oh well now that I said that I can think of one thing the servers are very laggy sometimes for me. Laggy enough that it sometimes makes a match unplayable. It's not super frequent or anything but the game could be greatly improved by addressing this though I'm sure it's a question of resources.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-11,0,0,741,False,Recommended,I am changing my review written in January of 2017! I've been playing Dead By Daylight on and off for a very long time. It's always been a fantastic game to fall back on when other games arent as fun. In the beggining there were alot of bugs. Alot of abusing of bad mechanics and alot of paid dlc being released despite glaring bugs that would ruin the game but lately this game has been fantastic! There are still things that need to be worked on but the devs over at Behaviour Studios showd that they do listen to us and they have always worked on making improvements in this game.There is so much that this game does right. Every killer feels unique and bring their own challenge to the game when you are against them and every game as a killer feels fast paced and exciting! I hope that you concider playing this game because it has brought me alot of fun (alot of headaches too but thats with any indie titlle that is constantly pushing to new limits) This is alot of fun and if you are a fan of multiplayer horror games then this is 100% the game to pick up because others can seldomly do it as well as this game as done See you in the fog,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-16,0,0,96,False,Recommended,Current GPU is not good enough to have decent FPS but this game is still hella fun. Even with 13 15 fps i still find the game to be fun as the killer. The game provides enough clues to keep on a survivors trail provided you don't over think their escape. It is crazy how easy i can be to overlook people hiding in plain sight but it is equally rewarding to catch people doing it XD. I was a little bit thrown off but how long it takes to fully kill the survivors at first but then I got better at the game and realized it makes the game mo better nothing more rewarding than getting the final hook on someone that has Barry Sanders'd your all game DPlaying as a survivor for the first time was scary as hell until I learned how to hide myself correctly. Think outside the box and hide in plain sight! Oh wait! Sometimes it is luck the killer doesnt see you sometimes you hide in the areas your current killer hasnt been patrolling. Im god awful as the survivor I freak when the skill check happens thanks Devs &lt 3 i am always amazed when I land enough in a row to almost have the generator fully repaired and slip up right before it is fully repaired T.T. one day my FPS will be decent and my skill checks will be on point but until then ima keep on freaking!!P.S. some mother kluckers get a little too fresh with pallets or windows when you are the killer and it can suck but you have to remember there are other people repairing generators so stop wasting your time with mofos that are playing you and slay their less bold buddies the cocky bastids will always slip up sometime later DP.P.S. it can take a bit to load a game in solo que my tip for getting around that is clicking on survive with friends exiting out of the friends list that pops up readying up waiting for the game start timer to count down and have it throw you into a lobby within a minute. Otherwise have fun waiting 10 30 minutes for a the game to throw you into a lobby from the main menu survive alone option I like turtles,Dead by Daylight

This game really feels like no other I've played.You know when you get into a new FPS or a new MOBA your prior knowledge can be usefull and allow you to perform somewhat well in the new game.This won't happen here. You'll spend your first few games confused runnung for your life as a disfigured man runs at you with his chainsaw. And that's great.The game also comes with two ""games"". A coop stealth/survival game and a solo hunting/slasher game. And I was surprised to find out that the playerbased is well shared berween the two roles.There is a few details I don't like about the game. Survivor ranked is based on their grind ingame. Rank is Pip based (like hearthstone) and not Skill Rating based which is very weird for a game that doesn't have a binary win/lose condition. The community can be very toxic at times. In game it's not that bad as there is no chat during game but the forums are a I feel like the survivors can abuse some killer mechanics a little too well.Beside that I love everything about the game.

The premise is simple. You are a survivor trying to fix a bunch of generators to open the doors and escape a supernatural serial killer. Or you are said supernatural serial killer trying to decorate your home by putting survivors on hooks (feng shui). Play one play the other or go back and forth as you see fit.

2016-09-17,0,0,371,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Recently started getting back into this game with the mindset of playing to actually have fun instead of playing to win. It appears the game can be much more enjoyable playing with that kind of mindset.. especially when playing as a survivor. If you take a look at the forums and reddit and any other media outlet for this game you will WITHOUT A DOUBT see posts about how and why killer is hard to play and why and how survivor is hard to play. I can tell you from my experience of playing this game so far that killer is much easier to play. I don't know if thats because of the type of playstyle i have if I'm a good killer or if the killer truly is easier to play but I ALWAYS get 3 4 kills. I have never put points into my killer therefore I do not use any perks on them and still get 3 4 kills every match even at rank 10 and lower. As you can imagine I play survivor more now as I feel its more of a challenge and I have a lot more fun. So if you plan to buy this game don't expect to always win and don't expect to always play against/with people who play ""fair"" because of the toxic community this game has.Pros Lots of fun even more so with friends Much more in depth then you'd think with the perk system and items/offerings Cheap DLCsCons Peer2Peer servers that are based off of the KILLERS connection therefore you will run into killers with horrible internet and killers that abuse their host connection by lag switching. To combat this I recommend downloading Kindred/MLGA to see what your connection is with the killer before beginning the trial and you will also be able to block the killers IP after the game is over if they were lag switching or you did not have fun play against them due to face camping tunneling etc. either way it is nice to have the CHOICE of who you play against Can be a bit buggy at times and usually the dev's response to something that is deemed ""unfair"" is just to nerf it to oblivion so keep that in mind when choosing to run with ""meta"" perksOverall I would recommend this game! Just remember it's exactly that... a GAME so if you decide to purchase this don't join the ranks of the toxic community and become another complaining player.",Dead by Daylight

2017-07-16,0,0,202,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric game that when everyone plays the way intended can be quite a fun experience. The game centers around the Killer who uses first person to track down and eliminate 4 Survivors before they can activate generators to survive. I won't get into the specifics of ""who's more OP"" because the game is an asymmetric game giving different strengths to both groups. I will say that I have had tremendous fun with this title(mostly with friends) and have been filled with the utmost of salt and I'll explain why. While the game does do a lot right there are several aspects it needs to have examined and fixed or outright reworked. I've played both Killer and Survivor and I feel like the Killer was the easier of the two to pick up and has the most responsibilty to make the game enjoyable(face camping is not enjoyable for anyone and does nothing but cause one person to be removed while the rest of the Survivors beat you merely by doing objectives.) That's not to say you have to outright abandon your prey but don't just stay there and stare at them because it removes the tension and fun for a stupid one off kill. Where the Killer shines is the ability to stalk and hunt down the Survivors and when done right can be a very fun time for all. Survivors as well have the responsibility to not use flawed design or mechanics to abuse the Killer(and yes it DOES happen lol).My biggest gripes with this game are actually design/animation/execution issues. To start off the game puts everyone into a hyper tense state of survival or hunting which is going to naturally lead to easier anger. The problem lies with the fact that the animations and coding for this game are absolutely awful. I don't know how many times myself and others have cleared a window/pallet and been hit in the back because the game uses and awful lobby system (where the Killer is the host) and causes major latency issues. Which leads me to my second biggest complaint. The Killer has a distinct advantage and can even abuse their high pings and that has led to games where I physically feel ill because of how much rubber banding is going on just because someone with awful internet(or intentions) decides to be the Killer. And that ruins the game for every Survivor and not so much the Killer. It really ruins every game I've been in and there's no reason for it(just pull from the every person in the game and assign a host at the best latency). There is also the rampant issue where Killers disconnect from a game as soon as offerings are on the table which costs loads of time and is seriously childish and causes no one to want to use anything for fear of losing it without cause. That's not to say that the Survivors are innocent of it as well. I've been in many games where a Survivor will insta rage quit the moment the Killer sights them or hits them and that ruins the game immediately.All in all the game has loads of potential and is lots of fun with friends. If the Devs would pay more attention and fix major issues(such as buggy animations glitchy items add ons and offerings) then the game would be excellent. But it seems the Devs only care about making some more money and less about fixing persistent issues so it's unlikely these will occur. In closing very worth the buy on sale if you enjoy asymmetric games especially if you buy with friends.",Dead by Daylight

2018-01-15,0,0,116,False,Recommended,This is an amazing game. A 4v1 horror game. I remember the first time I played I was so scared however the more I played I got more adept at it. You get to choose to be a fearsome killer or be a brave survivor. The survivors objective is to repair 5 generators on the map and exit through an exit gate. It's not so easy however as the killer his or her objective is to down and hook the survivors. The survivors have a certain ammount of times they can get hooked before they get sacrificed to the entity. However the game is way more complex which you will have to learn by playing the game and trial and error. It's also important to mention that public games you play are always ranked except if you play kill your friends a mode in which you and four other friends play as a killer and the survivors. During a match (not kill your friends) you gain bloodpoints which you can spend for the survivors or the killer to get perks items offerings and addons. I have said enough about the game. You should try it out. So will you be a brave survivor? Or a bloodthirsty killer?,Dead by Daylight

Killers are extremely under tooled while the survivors are over tooled. The amount of comeback mechanics for survivors are unreal with the killer only having a handful of options from relying on his or her game ability NOED and over altruistic players all of which cannot come close to comparison to the toolkit of survivors.

I was in a match with 11 hours play against 440 800 625 and a killer with 1200+ all had 4 lvl 3 perks with purple items ...guess who died.2 make a radius around a spiked survivor in which the killers aura is revealed to all players let them know immediatly that he intends to camp so they dont waste any time go a step further and give them a repair boost while the killer is revealed this would be enough to keep the killer from camping or at least basically end the game if he does.OR create a radius around the spiked survivor in which the entity progress will not count while the killer is within radius removes camping completely3 reveal the map/killer and perks to the players during character select and reveal survivor items and perks to the killer,Dead by Daylight

Maybe for some it will be the only way they play as they do not want to even deal with the abuse but at least people will be playing your game. Thanks for listening.,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-15,0,0,171,False,Recommended,This game is pretty simple 4 survivors try to get generators going to escape the level before a killer sacrifices them on hooks. Rinse and repeat that for every level. That being said it's pretty fun to play. If you were to play it a lot it would probably get repetitive. I think this game could hang around for a while if the developers continue to push out updates and DLCs. Time will tell. I purchased it when it was on sale for $10 and at that price it's worth it.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-05,0,0,133,False,Recommended,Although I have my salt momments they go away and this game makes quite a fun experience.It might have toxic players but you are not forced to read their hate.It requires a lot of strategy and lately it has received many fixes and additions which greatly improved it if you were to compare it to 1 year ago.I am very happy of what is it has become and there is no reason not to play it if you saw it liked it and you see it on a sale.(also if your PC can handle it too D) 10/10 piece in my library.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-10,0,0,132,False,Recommended,"DISCLAIMER Buy on sale only with lowered expectations. Big potential deal breaking flaws listed below.It all boils down to there being a decent game in here dragged down by the perk system and the community.Perks They're there for incentive to play for points and to keep you playing with a sense of progress but they're insanely powerful to the point they screw up the game. Stuff that doubles baseline abilities or nearly eliminates 90% of a side's challenge (instantly repair a generator as survivors! Flat out know where the survivors are as the killer!). You will constatly run into higher level people than you who are running 4 very rare perks while you're only running 1 common one and the fairness between the difference is a joke. Skill can only mitigate this to a point. If you stuck a noob into a fully leveled/perked character he could probably beat a long time player using a level 1 perkless character.You don't even get to know what perks are being used until after the match so you can't plan around them. It's total guesswork until suddenly the survivors have half the generators repaired in the first 30 seconds or some such horse manure. Imagine trying to play Chess and in any given game you never knew if your opponent would suddenly be able to move bishops and knights in straight lines. It totally undermines any strategy and the idea of a level playing field. You shouldn't feel any satisfaction winning or losing with that. Yet that is roughly how half your Dead By Daylight matches will go. I honestly wish they'd ditch the perk system altogether and have it be decided entirely on in game skill rather than pre game loadout and grinding. If they HAD to include perks then let them be available to everyone sooner or at least limit everyone to 1 or 2 slots max.The community You would probably have to venture over to Counterstrike to find a more unfriendly online FPS user base. The winners will be just as nasty as the losers.If it was just bad attitude I could take it by simply ignoring lobby chat. But it goes beyond that with the reviled ""Survive With Friends"" system. Basically having a premade team of survivors on voice chat throws the balance out the window. A lot of SWF players claim it's part of the game. No it is not. It is also blatantly obvious to everyone who's played even one hour of this that the game was definitely balanced around the fact that the survivors cannot directly communicate. The game was not designed around the survivors being able to have a dedicated lookout warn the entire team where the killer is at all times or a captured survivor tell everyone that the coast is clear for a rescue. There are survivor perks with the explicit purpose of gaining information on the status and whereabouts of other survivors so you cannot argue that premade voice chat teams are totally legit and don't throw the game off.You might say ""Well of course a cordinated team has an advantage!"" If both sides were teams this would be a fair point. If it was 16 survivors against 4 killers sure. But the game is 4 against 1. Coordination and voice chat is not somethign the killer can use and only gives the survivor team a huge unintended advantage.In summary if they got rid of the perk system (or at least heavily toned them down) and gave the killer some kind of option or bonus against premade survivor parties (very hard to impossible to implement) then this would be a pretty decent low cost multiplayer game. I don't see either of those happening though so I'd say only get this on sale with expectations of half your games being screwed over by unfair perks and premades.P.S. Holy hell is Michael Myers a pay 2 win character. I suck as the killer and even I can regularly get 3 4 kills a match with him and that's with NO PERKS! I can't imagine how broken he is with 4.",Dead by Daylight

Downside is toxic community camping and gameabusing killers and the fact that skill isn't all you need you also need a pinch of luck to survive. Can get buggy from time to time no actual gamebreaking bugs but I find it frustrating that killers can bodyblock you in various ways in order to farm points/prevent you from moving. Sometimes commands don't work playability also depends on other players' internet connection. If it gets bad you usually start teleporting around the map.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-24,0,0,865,False,Recommended,I have this game since it's release and boy was it a journey from then to now. I play Survive with friends aswell as killer (mostly Trapper Huntress and Hillbilly) So i know the game from both perspectives. The game has phases of beeing really annoying because of bugs (sometimes gamebreaking) and matchmaking connection problems aswell as phases of running almost flawlessly. The phases always change with each update.The game runs nice # UPDATE # the game runs and there are new bugs # UPDATE the game runs nice and and the bugs are fixed # UPDATE the game runs again and there are returning bugs that has been fixed 10 times alreadyI dont know what the main problem is together we joke about Behavior programming this game with MS Paint but i have never experienced a game with such conditions. For example a little update fixes a colission problem with a static prop on a specific map... suddenly all dropped pallets (dynamic props unrelated to that specific fixed prop) start to fly up in the air when destroyed by killer. Other example an update introduced a new killer to the game...suddenly the sounds for when a killer breaks a generator changes to the pallet drop sound.....HOW CAN THIS BE....really mysterious.Also the community mostly the killer main players is really whiny in the forums and the studio listens mostly to them since they pay for the Killer DLCs introducing new inbalanced perks and addons that for new players are really hard to counter. But if you got the skill and help of your friends you can still manage to MAKE DAT DAMN DOCTOR RAGEQUIT after he got hit by the 5th pallet and 10 flashlight beams in a row. And these moments are one of the best. The best moments in this game you can only have with your friends in my opinion. Or you have super friendly and skilled random teammates. Although the community is toxic the game has some flaws and bugs (although always different ones not the same bug for ever haha) and some decisions on balancing the Studio is making are really questionable ......I CAN RECOMMEND THIS GAME in it's current state (23rd November 2017).The Studio is constantly updating the game like every week so who knows what the future holds for it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-29,0,0,411,False,Recommended,This game has a very cool unique concept that has been rarely approached before in horror games the classic slasher movie killer against survivors.As a fan of those classic slasher movies i love this game and it's idea.I USED to give this a negative review because of it's unplayable state with massive amount of glitches no key binding and overall unprofessional work for a full release.However these issues have all been fixed since then with balance issues and small (animation) glitches being the only minor problems.This game is very unique scary and fun you get to choose whether you're the survivor or the killer there are many survivors and killers what makes them different are their abilities. The survivors get their unique abilities much later on but killers have a different playstyle from the get go. It's up to you to make a choice about which you prefer. As a killer you have to hang every survivor (and get them killed) while as a survivor you have to activate all the generators in the map so you can escape. As a survivor you'll rely on teamwork while as a killer you'll have to rely on yourself only you'll need to make smart decisions. Either way if you fail (killer or survivor) you still get a good amount of bloodpoints (the game's points which allow you to get perks) so losing isn't really that big of a deal.When it comes to the soundtrack it's a fairly simple soundtrack with a nice (although repetitive) menu music ambient music related to how close the killer is related to you music when the killer is chasing you and snippets taken from the Halloween movie's famous Micheal Myers theme for Micheal Myers' abilities yes he's a killer in this game. Despite being simple the soundtrack fits the atmosphere perfectly.Overall the game's balance is prettygood with a couple of issues the devs are looking into (hopefully) both sides can be both fun to play and infuriating at times. I'd recommend this game when you can afford it (maybe on a sale?) it's very fun very spooky and actually really good.,Dead by Daylight

After I made my case they preceded to harass me by stating in a similar manner ""that isn't the way the game is meant to be played"" and also threatened to report me. The first match I've played today was fine I lost they won and it was fine. ""Let's move on to the next one"" I thought. So I did just that and it was all fine and dandy.

Now Operation Bloodlust was an idea that most people mocked when it was first revealed. In reality who did think that having a killer running around at mach 5 was a good idea? In case you can't figure it out the Dbd devs. I digress the whole Dead by Daylight world would soon have to face the wrath of this implementation. And the ones who suffered the most from this was the new meanie faces. The new meanie faces have now grown accustomed to running around at the speed of sound and are stuck with permanent training wheels. Wait this is where I post reviews? In that case if you liked the old retro Sonic games from the 90s I think you will really enjoy this game. Even though there are some really weird fan made versions of Sonic in this game the player can still experience the same fast paced gameplay through the killer mode of this game! If you have friends that have poured a lot of time into this game don't listen to what they say.

Good sountrack Games are often short and sweet Skill ceiling is fairly high Semi random map layout each timeCONS Semi toxic player base Clear survivor bias from the Devs Semi random map layout each time (can sometimes result in 1 sided maps.. not for killers though)CONCLUSION This game is fun and the only thing that detracts from the fun doesnt arise from the game itself but from the players in it. A good portion of the Survivor base is toxic and anything that results in them losing is ""broken"" or ""cheap"". Unfortunatly the developers compound on this attitude with the very obvious bias and refusal to listen to legitimate criticsm if it comes from a Killers point of view.The best example of this was Freddy Krueger a mediocre Killer at best yet because low to mid skill Survivors didnt know how to play against his unique abilities they screamed and cried and just 1 week later had a raft of incoming nerfs. Now only 1 of these has made it through so far because of the massive outburst of Killer mains but even then the 1 nerf is bugged and basically makes him unplayable. BUT DONT WORRY KIDS!

2017-11-25,0,0,60,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is one of those rare multiplayer games that makes it fun to both play by yourself or play with friends. Want a fun solo player experience? Play the Killer and single handedly hunt down four other players. (Or in some cases chase them around a tree until your speed boost kicks in.)Want a fun multiplayer experience? Get some friends to buy the game and make a four man scooby squad to evade/outsmart the killer.The game does have some slight balance issues when it comes to match making but the devs try really hard to make the game as fair as possible and so far every match has been a unique experience.,Dead by Daylight

I bought this game months ago and took a long time off because of bugs and matchmaking but the devs stuck with it and really smoothed things out. They've added a lot of killers and survivors to add variety to the game. Accept the fact that when a new killer gets released its going to take a few patches until they are more stable. They'll come out everyone complains they are OP because no one has experience against them they'll get nerfed too hard and then get balanced after that. If you can live with that you'll have fun either trying to escape with your life OR murdering 4 victims brutally.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-03,0,0,611,False,Recommended,"So I been playing this game quite alot recently and have lots of thoughts to share. It is you who should decide whether to buy this game or not but I would like to give you some thoughts about this game and gives you pros and cons (which I felt along the way).I knew about this game before buying it cause one of my favourite streamer used to play this game alot (recently he havent though because of viewers trying to troll with him ingame) but he havent played for last 2 3 months so most of information I had were outdated when I purchased it we had few more killers few more survivors. The fun aspect of this game I think is the intensity you feel initially. I think this is unique experience you have with Dead by Daylight. You may have some experience similar to this in other games but personally I find it pretty hard intensity heartbeating experience when I had to hide and killer was searching for me. The music the heart beating system the risk you can have by failing QTE and goes on. I think first few hours of this game is one of the most intensity gameplay you might ever have (As Survivor I mean.) You also can learn few perks (""skills"") ingame that can help you along the way. You dont need these if you are really good at this game but still it is good to have them. Especially certain perks can really help you play as Stealth and be much more safe than playing without perks.You can also have different variations of perks. For example one character can have only 3 unique perks on its own but if you level up that character to level 45 the perks now become avaliable to other characters so you can have fun of mixing different perks of different characters and find your own style whether to play stealthy or play flashy type.What I dislike about this game mostly is about the bloodpoints. So in this game when you learn perks or levelup what you use is Bloodpoints. These points are made by winning through the game or doing some works in game such as doing some objectives helping other teammates running away from killer and so on. Problem with this system lies on the fact that in order for you to level up you need more bloodpoints. Therefore more bloodpoints better. Winning game? Surviving? well it doesnt matter if you have enough bloodpoints. At one point of time like me you will probably feel less and less intense about this game. For example few days ago I was so scared and my heart was beating so quickly when I was last one to live and I had to find hatch (escape route). I was literally fighting Killer 1v1. This moment was so unique and I enjoyed every last bit of it. However already I started to get used to this. I now dont feel as scared even in situation like that. I am more interested in bloodpoints since afterall surviving this game is not really main point you need more bloodpoints to level up.So from one point this game become not a killer vs survivor game but rather who makes more bloodpoints game. I seen some players who play this game just to make more bloodpoints. Killers wouldnt even kill survivor Survivor would help killers to get more bloodpoints. This should never happen in this kind of game more it happens less you feel intense about this game.I am no killer player but I did try killer twice just to do my Daily ritual and what happened on 2nd game was players in game realized I was new to game so even though they opened exit instead of leaving they tried to take more objectives hatch instead of leaving the game. Should we call this game survivor game at that point? Sure it isnt.So Conclusion do I recommend this game? for now YES sure thing. However I think if this game management fails hard we might even see less and less players in this game in near future. This game has done such an awesome job of creating heart beating music hide and seek system but it is failing to make it game serves its original characteristic of survivial not trying to ""farm"" more bloodpoints.",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-19,0,0,992,False,Not Recommended,"Old part I like the game but to anyone thinking about buying it Don't! At least not yet. The developers set their priorities on releasing new content instead of fixing important broken issues (they claim it by themselves see their interview streams). Most prominent example You basically cannot play the game as the mathmaking algorithm simply does not find any games for you meaning you sit there clicking 25 minutes (not exaggerating) every 2 seconds on ""Join a Lobby"" to play a single approximately 10 minute long game with random people who do not match your skill level (since there seems to be almost no rank matching whatsoever).This issue came up with release &gt 2 months ago and still resides in the game.I will update my review in a detailed manner once this is fixed.Update 1 Apparently the developers now changed their strategy They included more telemetry tools to find bugs faster and fixed some crucial game mechanics.Now this game after the implementation of the Halloween addon with Michael Myers brought back a feeling of terror and surprise which I really like.Still there is a competitive component to crack this 10k points mark so you will be able to improve your survivor/killer rank.Especially the survive with friends mode is a fun challenge when you are able to play certain strategies with a good killer.For people who want constant action I have to say there is a lot of ""down time"" when you just sit there and fix a generator wait for the killer to vanish or heal a person and you do nothing but watch out for the killer. This is part of the game and I like it but I can understand some people don't.Update 2 Even after one year the game is not fixed. Medium to severe bugs are still there the studio just cares for new features instead of bugfixing again. I do not think that this is the dev's fault but the fault of e.g. this economics guy who thinks he knows everything better (the arrogant guy who leads the stream) but seems to have no clue about anything (just my opinion). &gt Play if you own it but do not invest your money in this game.",Dead by Daylight

I've played the game for 5 hours now and it has crashed and breaks the game more times than a game is actually finished. That's unnacceptable and I can't recommend this until you can play the game. The worst part about the game is how buggy it is. You wait too long to find a match. It is the number 1 selling game on steam right now you shouldn't have to wait at all. When you finally get a match to start there is at least a 50% chance that the game will break before it can be finished. If that happens to you no matter how much XP you earned you lose it all. I just crashed a game where i was the killer and had just finished off the last survivor and was taking them to the hook. Crash. I lost 10 000 XP and lost 18 000 XP from the completion of the Trapper Divine Ritual goal. Talk about taking the wind out of your sails... 28 000 xp lost in a single match. It's already too difficult to level up as it is but you only complete a game half of the time. This game is early access at this point. Buy it if you want to be a beta tester.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-18,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,Don t get me wrong this game is loads of fun However with that being said there are some major problems with this game that IMO is holding it back.1) The ranking system In order to rank up you have to achieve a certain level of blood points in each game (3 times for 1 rank) and if you don t make the requirement you lose one of your progression marks. This is a completely idiotic idea because it turns the game from a Survival style game into a Farm Simulator . It should be changed so that you get a progression mark if you survive not by how many blood point you acquire.2) Lobbies Instead of having set servers for the game the dev set it to be P2P This means that if the host has a bad connection you re in for a bad time. There is no auto reconnect so if you get dropped you have to find a new lobby. Since there is no set matchmaking you can be put into a lobby with people way beyond your own skill level which leads me to my next point The Host (Killer) is able to see everyone s names and ranks but not vice versa so if you and your group are rank 20 with 10+ character levels against a rank 10 character level 30+ you re going to get stream rolled.3) No matchmaking with friends a huge complaint that I have seen so far is that there s no way to play with friend online other than creating a private match. I m sure this will be added it (But who knows how long it will take)4) Mechanics Some of the mechanics in the game feel a bit off/unfair. No matter how much you wiggle you won t escape before being hooked (Unless everyone has a tool box and destroy all the hooks) The chances of getting off the hook on your own are extremely slim so even if the killer leaves you hanging there if your team doesn t come back for you you re SOL5) No team communication in the game How can there be no team based communication in a team survival!?! The only time you can talk to anyone is when you re in the lobby before the game starts after that silence. (Again I m sure they will add something in but who knows how long it will take)6) The Killer The Hillbilly and Trapper are fine as they are but The Wraith needs some serious tuning. He can turn invisible / move faster while invis you can barely see his outline while he is invis and the only way to tell if he s there (Since the heart beat is silenced) is to sound the hell out of the game and listen for his growling which is hard to do while fixing the generators) 7) Items I hold no issue with the Med kit or the Tool Box however the Map and Flashlight are completely useless. The Map allows you to see the outline of generators that you have already been to. This makes the map useless since you can easily remember the locations of all the generators (The game map is small / locations almost never change) The Flashlight has little to no accuracy and it burns through its durability extremely quickly which means if you miss the killer on the first try don t bother doing it again. 8) No penalties for deserters While I am guilty of leaving 2 3 games so far I do have an issue with having no penalty to it. If someone leaves early then it makes it easier for the Killer and it decreases the amount of blood points he gets which affects his rank.While I have listed quite of bit of negatives I do see hope for this games future if the developers take people s concerns and criticism seriously. From what I understand these issues were brought up during the beta yet nothing was done. This game makes you think on your feet and can be more intense than scary. I look forward to playing this game a lot more if these issues are resolved.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-18,0,0,30,False,Recommended,that game is so fun but they have to do a big update for the killers and the map less generator there is to many and reduce the cooldown of the killers it's to easy to escape them,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-08,0,0,322,False,Recommended,I would have recommended this game very highly before the Huntress was introduced. An utterly broken character that is to over powered with the ability to have ranged attacks. Further the player base though mostly okay seem to gravitate to watching you when hooked. With normal killers it is easy enough to get someone down with a bit of distraction but the huntress makes that entierly moot. She camps from a distance so that people who are coming to get you don't know and get an axe to the back or the second you get pulled down you get downed again by the throwing axe. If the devs balance her it may be better but I doubt it. They won't even fix the constant bugs or put in place anything to prevent camping. Instead they keep making dlc to add an ever growing number of bugs and cheep exploits. If you can handle a game where matches are un winnable at times because of the bugs or camping do what you want with the game it was fun once. If you cannot go buy a differnt game like Friday the 13th or something.*Edit*I now approve of the game a lot of the concerns with bugs are fixed and new perks make camping harder.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,9,False,Recommended,Very well done game for a small dev company. Without a queueing system for ranked games with friends I feel like this game is going to lose its fire pretty quickly. Playing as a Survivor gives you the willies and a few of us were in voice coms together and were screaming like little babies! When you're a killer it's pretty effing satisfying to hook and sacrifice people! The chase really gets your blood pumping too lol.I'm upvoting this game because I hope other people will give it a try so the devs can add the much needed features to take this to the next level.TLDR Fun as hell as survivor and killer needs ability to queue with friends and earn bloodpoints but with some checks and balances so boosting doesn't happen. Overall worth it.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-17,0,0,334,False,Recommended,Pros A lot of ways to play. If you want to run distraction grab a flashlight. Medic? Grab a medkit and use some healing perks. Sabotage? Get you a toolbox or the perk. Killers have the same goal to sacrifice survivors but different perk setups keep it interesting with Hex users or making the survivors progress harder. Doesn't get repetitive despite seeming like it should with the same goals each game. Chat in the before game lobby allows survivors to coordinate offerings and items to help each other which the killer cannot see in the normal lobbies. If you're playing the Kill your Friends mode then it's not a ranked match and the killer can chat with you. Survive with Friends allows for an easy game to play with friends that doesn't get boring quickly. You can only spectate your other survivors after death/escape so you can't cheat by watching what the killer is seeing. You don't need to purchase the DLC to get the full experience of the game. While you cannot choose DLC characters for yourself you can be pit against DLC killers and play with other people using DLC chracters. Skills are creative and you can make some very good builds to play with. Shows the ping for the lobby you are in to prevent laggy games.Neutral Ranking System that pits you against people of around the same rank. You have a survivor rank and a killer rank and it resets once a month. Neutral because of the reset and each rank is shared between all killers or survivors respectively. Killer hosts the game which can be good or bad depending on their connection. Worth mentioning for people with internet data limits. Certain things are very overpowered. The devs are usually pretty good about balancing as needed though.Cons Killers in lower ranks tend to stand right in your face after you've been hooked known as face camping. They will even ignore survivors obviously trying to get their attention nearby. This prevents anybody from saving you and kills any chance you have of getting any points or enjoyment out of that match. There's a glitch currently with people losing all their progress. You can conctact the devs to get it back but it's still frustrating and takes time. The glitch is known and being looked into. Keep screenshots or pictures of your progress at all times to prove your level etc. There's also a way to back it up but I don't know how. You can get kicked from the game due to connection which can be frustrating especially when playing with friends.Overall I highly recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-29,0,0,547,False,Recommended,"Payed 20 euros for this game 1 and a half years ago aproximately when it was released. At first you don't get anything of what's happening and you will either go out of your way and watch dozens of tutorials or you can learn everything by yourself assuming you are dedicated to spend lots of hours in leveling up your characters getting new perks which referesh the game's ""repetitive"" gameplay prestiging your beloved prey...i mean survivors and your favourite killers. If you want the full experience you will need to pay extra for the DLCs which as of now will cost you about 50 euros (with more to come in the future i am pretty sure). But these DLCs really make you want to jump straight back in the game if you were bored of it as i was. After taking a 4 5 months break from DBD i come back finding out that i missed 2 or 3 killer releases and some nice cosmetic items.I was forced to jump back in and give Dead by Daylight a second chance.

Because the killer sees in first person and has no visual aids the game boils down to hide and seek. For a simple concept it's pretty fun though the community can be (and often is) downright cancerous.Just to be perfectly clear as many see it as a point of confusion this isn't really comparable to Friday the 13th. Friday the 13th is more of a slasher simulator while this is a tightly focused competitive game that merely shares the killer versus survivors trappings.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-12,0,0,27,False,Recommended,It is a fun game it can at times feel broken and that the killers have a very unfair advantage (most recently with Freddy that killer needs a serious nerf or adjsutement to his play style). In the end you really should experience this game with 2 3 friends if you are going to play as survivors. I have only one game in as the killer so I cannot make any comments on playing as a killer but playing as a survivor you either win or lose based on how well the team plays together. When you get that jerk teammate who is more concerned with their survival than the team winning it takes ALL the fun away. I recommend this game only as a team playing game be warned if you try to solo it.....,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-12,0,0,523,False,Recommended,This is not really a review its a suggestion for making matchmaking better and more enjoyable. Request to the devs. Please add a ''Ban a killer'' Option in the matchmaking. By that i mean having the option to block certain killers from being matched against you. E.g I would ban ''Nurse'' and the ''Nightmare'' so i wont have to deal with how unbalanced ''i think'' they are.The game would be more enjoyable for players like me as we would be matched only vs killers we are comfortable playing against. Its not fun being chaced by a decent nurse 90% of the time you will get caught and hook camped as even if nurse leaves your hook she can insta teleport to it from the other side of the map.... And the nightmare ? Where to begin with ? If he is close to you he is chasing you if you manage to escape he sees you and by the time you find a way to fail a skillcheck or a teammate in order to wake up you are already on a hook if your teammates are not in the dream they cant bodyblock neither flashlight that guy... Please either balance the killers or give us the option to not be matched against them. And im not saying give us the option to ban every other killer so we would always be matched with the same kind just 2 bans per game so there is a plenty of options for finding matches as there are a lot of killers to choose from.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-21,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Played 'til Daylight The Good Every game almost always guarantee suspense and sometime even fear. From hiding from the killer up to running for your life there is no shortage in emotions from winning or losing and surviving or dying. Dead by Daylight is constantly being refreshed and updated by its developer. New Killers Survivors Skins and even new maps have been thrown at this game since its release. Make no mistake there is a strategy to this game. I have to admit I haven't mastered or even aware of all of them. Thankfully there are communities in facebook youtube channels devoted to educating new players how to advance and succeed. Multiple Play Styles. You can be altruistic or heroic. You can also just look out for yourself as a survivor. Characters can carry different perks according to how you want to play. The Bad Don't get me wrong its current and only game mode and mechanics is fun. However given the potential of this game I expected it to have another game mode or different types of mechanics for the killers or survivors to catch their prey or survive the game respectively. Developers made a huge blunder. A lot of players lost their hard earned progress in the game. If you've slaved over this game to get all the perks and items you've wanted I can't blame them for down voting this game. The Recommendation BUY ITWith the comming halloween season now is the perfect time to get this game a long with your friends.

2016-06-18,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,With more experience I'm gonna have to change my review. The balance and quality of the game goes down every day as more and more survivors learn how to abuse the game's mechanics. When the game first came out it took 20+ minutes to get a game as Killer because nobody wanted to be survivor. By next week there'll be nobody left playing Killer because playing Killer in the current balance environment is an agonizing ordeal.As it stands right at this moment the game is broken. It's not horror it's not stealth and it's definitely not fun. It's Benny Hill whack a mole where survivors will actually start chasing you if you haven't given them enough points to rank up.Don't buy it right now. If a major balance patch fixes the game's egregious problems it'll be worth a buy but if it keeps its current trajectory it'll be dead as soon as the twitch hype dies down.,Dead by Daylight

There are a few things that may bother some but the devs are working on it for sure. I know I've read a lot where people are complaing about not being able to communicate with their fellow survivors but in my opinion that makes it all the better. I mean sure it does hurt in some aspects but it truly challenges you as the player to think about morals. ""Do I save my teammate and risk being caught or do I take this time to fix generators and escape with the others?""That is one of the questions that you'll have to answer in a split second because time is of the essence here.

2017-11-14,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,So after a good amount of play time i can write a pretty good review which will be accurate from most perspectives.PROS This game is very fun and has constant updates this means there is always something new as well as new perks addons etc so no game is the same especially with the amount of killers currently available. The game is very unique and devs respond to problems somewhat well depending ( I will get onto this) Being able to party with friends and trying to survive personally it makes the game loads more fun to play and also allows you to work better as a team and will have higher success of winning The game has a relativly high skill cap depending on wheather you play killer or survivior and if killer which oneCONS Now this is where i start to dislike the game and therefore cannot reccomend this game to other people. The main reason is BALANCE now Im not saying oh this killers OP this killers not bla bla im talking balance in general. A lot of killers at high levels say rank 10 on arnt even considered a viable pick because of how bad they are wraith has always been bad and will always be bad the hag is okay freddy is god awful but WAS good and this brings me to my next point. The Devs takes surviviors complaints A LOT more seriously than killers when Freddy first came out he was good he was balanced he was viable then because surviviors started actually dying and no longer had control of games and could no longer bully this killer they had a tantrume saying hes OP and shouldnt have this or that and so the DEVs nerfed a perfe ctly fine character to the point NO ONE plays him now which also results in 5 pounds down the drain as you pay for freddy New Killers and surviors cost money now this is a topic I am in the middle on yes they have to pay for lisenced killers such as freddy and the new pig but then again its only a killer survivor and map with then perks for each its not that big of content to warrant 5 pounds every time theres a new killer and survivor if you main surviviors its pointless as you basically then buy the dlc for looks and to get their perks (if they have good ones). If that DLC killer then gets nerfed (like feddy) then the money (to me) is wasted Balancing issues so im going to explain WHY i think this and I share the same opinion as a lot of killers and big youtubers and this is based on the fact that the killer doesnt have enough time. Now im not going to put all statistics in here you can look online but the killer takes so long to chase hit chase hit/down then pickup potentially get Decisive Striked and if so chase and hit again and pick up then carry to the hook (hope they dont wriggle out or get blinded or get a pallet slamed on you and then hook them. This takes SO long by this time the other 3 survivors could have completed 3 gens. A survior can harass the killer and dependant on how many and the placement of pallets out run the killer in the time all gens are done. Surviviors control what happens they have pallets items windows perks like DS and sprint burst they can get back up after being downed from Bills perk they can duke you by literally if mastered turn around and spin right past you so so quicly their movement speed is now so much quicker its insane I was playing the Pig today and it takes about 10 15 seconds just to catch them if we are both running in a straight line without pallets now I know that doesnt sound long but in a game thats a lot of time wasted it feels like your just tagging along behind them and then the game becomes boring My final point is the new killer she has great potential but not right now her abilities are AMAZING and i was so excited to try her out but then I saw the downsides. Killers can see the Saw boxs from the start they are highlighted. 2 problems with this first they straight away know what killer you are and secondly it is stupidly and i mean stupidly easy to get the saw trap off they just run to a highlighted saw box and inte ra ct with it like a generator now the patch notes say that box may not be the right one for their saw trap I call bs every person ive seen run to one has got theirs off and thats with me using addons to create more skill checks and if they fail a bigger punishment. So the masks yeah they buy time have I ever killed anyone with 1 yet? NO Overall this game is very good and I do love it but I cannot play it reguarly or reccomend it to anyone because of the balance issues so many people are complaining to the devs but they just dont listen and if they do they attempt to buff a killer like the wraith in the most stupid way it doesnt even help. The game is mained up of mainly surviviors and so they are the ones who the devs will prioritise.But there you go i hope this review helped and let me know in the comments your opinions!,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-20,0,0,681,False,Recommended,This game as a ton of potential. That being said even with a lot of common things that should be added in (devs said will be added in) it is a very fun game and a cool concept. Would Recommend,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-16,0,0,15,False,Recommended,its a fun game but sadly it followed evolves steps. they made a great game but theres no proper matchmaking. atleast in my experience. i only have 5 hours in the game and im being paired with prestige and legacy players along with killers who have all the perks. I as a new player have no leeway to learn. i can watch all the youtube videos I want but frankly what was a fun game in the beginning is now a game I hate purely because the matchmaking doesnt really take in account of your skill. I'll keep trying the game in hopes of the matchmaking being fixed. Evolve was a fun game as well that was ruined by poor matchmaking. please dont make the same mistake.Ill still reccomend it to people who are interested. its not a bad game. its just bad matchmaking.,Dead by Daylight

I know it is hard and i really really love this game but the bugs... oh man.First of all i'm getting set back on my rank sometimes loosing up to 3 pips after a round i just got one during leveling my charakters. Then i sometimes can't leave when sleeping and chased by Krueger or the game crashes and then i also loose pips or even up to 2 ranks.It just takes away some fun of the game if there's no success to look at.also a lot of my friends and me are starting the round with disconnects or just half of the people what makes the game nearly impossible.And to addition even the own teammates are trying to save their own skin instead of helping other survivors even if they hadn't been hooked themselfes so playing a completely normal round became a special event.Sometimes i'm thinking it's kinda sad that you can get your money back only two weeks after purchase.UPDATE With new DLC even more camping and tunneling.

2017-09-23,0,0,721,False,Recommended,Its a great game that deserves some credit for being the first fully fledged horror game that was multiplayer that appeared on steam it has done a great job I had gotten into the beta a while ago (I still havn't bought the game) and got into the free weekend recently this game deserves credit but it also needs to relise its own weaknesses in how the devs have communicated to the players. Pros This game is not Friday the Thirteenth at all Period Exclamation Mark! People try to compare the two games and you really can't and it does truly bother me that people try this game was never meant to be like Friday the Thirteenth it trys to establish a equal playing field for the surivor and killer while Friday likes to establish the killers dominance but gives numbers to compensate for the players own weakness. This game is competive in nature and you can't change that. This game is soul eating faced survivors against a killer that will cry this could easily be a con because the community can be rather meh at times but you can ignore them mostly. The graphics are nicely done and animations are fluid Bloodwebs + Perks are a nice way to level up and grow in strength. Ranks do reset and so does your progress at the start of a new season some could say this is a weakness but I say its great to have everyone start from the beginning but there is flaws to this as well which I will explain more in Cons section of this review Pricing now I may lose some people here because its a game how do you really say price is a good stand point its because of what you get for the 21 dollars you get 5 killers and alot of surivors around half the amount of survivors of friday and killers but the variance of what these characters can do you have a wraith (weakest character do not recomend but I did kill 4 people with him so yeh he used to be worse) he can go into a half baked invis and ring a bell to come out of it. you have teleporting nurse You have a huntress that throws axes you have a trapper that places traps and you have a hillbilly with a chainsaw all have different abilities and different strengths making this more divergent that Friday going back to the Friday the thirteen because I was just getting at the killers for this you get alot of diversity and alot of content to play with making it really worth if you enjoy the game if you don't you won't get your money's worth but thats normal but it feels like you will have alot of way to get enjoyment and time into the game Random Generation Kinda Its not really but its a nice fact that its somewhat random maps but not really which allows for some skill and memorization to come into play.Cons Here is the that happens yeh Communty is Reported You camped me I'm going to derank now because I lost ect... its not terrible like League of Legends and CS GO and DOTA and Overwatch. but it has its darkside but I'm just going to talk to these people now I don't care if you say I camp I don't care if you decide this I'm going to derank because its just for fun in the end and its a game meant for a killer to find the most effective way at killing you wether that is to stay around you because your a surive with friends or whatever people need to relise that killers will do whats best for them not whats best for survivors. Now you can get angry at me or you can accept this you won't change and I know it but for the love of god understand and look through the killers POV because at the end of the day its sad to go throught a game hard fought and manage to get 3 kills and then for someone to yell yah camped them for no reason but you saw some guy standing by a window and you knew as soon as you moved he would come and get you. I hope the community can learn not to ostrasize the killer (that sounds extremly ironic) but the community needs to understand the killer has to do whats best for them on their side of the field its their choice sure some killers camp you because its a pip but some do it because they have no other way to kill the people that will free you if they come a knocking at the hook. DLC Paywall this is very small and it doesn't matter in the long scheme of things if you play killer you will see all the survivors and if you play survivor you will see all the killers you just won't be able to play them which is nice in a way you get to see what its like but its just a slight missgiving the game has in the end. Rank Reset and Skill Purge You will meet people on reset day that are far above you inskill and in the following weeks new killers will be turned off and so will new survivors this needs a fix because it does feel unfair FOR BOTH sides of it. Someone kiting a bad killer for 2 years or a surivor being down one after another in a minute or less both feel terrible for the side unless they know they are the right skill level so in this side of things its terrible the skill purges are annoying on rank reset day because all that time you took to get those perks and now they are all gone but its a way to somewhat ofset the skill gap for surivors and killers that happen when a ranked reset happensFinal VerdictIts a good game its less buggy then Friday that for sure... But you can't take my word for it in the end I have only looked over footage so take everything I said about friday with a grain of salt ok you dihard fans of the friday franchise ok. but I know there are a ton of bugs and this game doesn't have as many the devs can be scatter brained at times but they balance stuff out eventually thankfully I have seen alot through streams and such to know where DBD has come from to now and its looking fine. I hope people hop on the game and take a mossey through some fields and get chainsawed by the Billy or New Leathered Faced Friend in haddonfields P I recommend this game because it is fun it is somewhat balanced in its current state I will probably eventually buy the game but I will also say if you are hesitant wait for a free weekend or when it goes on sale if you don't truly know this game I can't give a rating too because a game is hard to judge by numbers its just fun for me and its my own opinion those who have read this entire rant and all my points I thank you for all survivors who take what I have said to heart I hope you give a surivor a little less of a toxic chat experince and I also what to remind them I know not all surivors are toxic just a few get carried away at times and with that I'm off to some unkown game somewhere where I will have a good time see yah !,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-08,0,0,26,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Disclaimer I got a key from the devs So about 24 hours in and overall I've had a great time. It's a unique concept (when it first hit Steam now there are other copycats) and can be a ton of fun with friends. It has a bit of a learning curve as survivor but it's well worth it. I've not played enough to encounter some of the major issues people have had other than the sometimes long matchmaking times. I'm sure at higher levels of play some of the biggest problems start sticking out (I mean hell even Overwatch suffers from this). But if you're looking for a fun asymetrical survival horror game that won't break the bank check this out.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-16,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,The game has potential but right now it is too buggy for me to give it a good review. For a long time the game didn't have a party system but when they finally released Survival With Friends it was really buggy. At first you would search for about 20 minutes before actually finding a game or be kicked to lobby.The recent update stated that it fixed that. It didn't only making it worse. Instead of taking a long time it just sends you to main menu making you have to join your friends lobby again.I wouldn't be writeing this review if the developers weren't making other content while their game is still broken. Paid DLC's shouldn't even be thought about while a main part of the game doesn't work.Should be marked as Early Access.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-26,0,0,306,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is great the concept is decent the nurse just got a big nerf but since I don't tend to play the killer I'll let someone else do it.Matchmatching is by far the biggest problem with the game if you a solo player getting into a game isnt to hard for killers matches are instant for solo survivor the time varies it can get instant or it can take up to 10 minutes or soSurvive with friends is currently the most broken match making I have ever seen the way it works is you invite your friend(s) everyone readys up it searches for a game and then you get kicked marjority of the time which means you have to go reinvite all your friends all over again I've noticed that player population and pip has alot to do with this since a game cant start without a killer say one of your friends is like under rank 10 and you just got the game maybe 15 20 rank expect a huge wait time if your friend is closer to your rank its a little bit easier.The process of inviting friends and searching before a kick averages around 30 seconds if everyone is paying attentiona few stats listed below for 4 games (i have played more then 4 games with more or less same problem.07 04 (14 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 Match Found Sucessfully08 21 (12 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 Lobby found friend kicked04 30 (8 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 Looby found Sucessfully14 23 (26 Lobby Remakes) SWF2/4 Lobby Found Friend kicked (Survived with friend button bugged twice forcing friend to invite instead)Getting the game to play on your own is more recommended then with friends but there is a learning curb to get over and without having someone to teach it the game can be very hard and make you not want to play muchI highly recommend staying away from this game if you are getting it to play with other people until the match making is fixed,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-24,0,0,38,False,Recommended,"Campers really ruin the experience for me. When the killer grabs you and puts you on the hook it's practically impossible to be saved when they're standing there staring at you. And the length of time it takes to start the generator is much longer than the time you have on a hook so saying ""camping lets your team start generators faster"" isn't a valid argument. Besides if one person dies the team is at a serious disadvantage the next time the killer decides to be a camper. It's unfortunate because this game has an amazing concept. Killers just abuse the system.Other than that game is addicting and adrenaline pumping. Just needs better balance.",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-24,0,0,114,False,Recommended,"I'll be honest some folks are gonna play this game once or twice get infuriated beyond belief and stop. And I will see you off and salute as you leave. The devs' strategy of making every new killer unreasonably strong and buffing characters/mechanics by leaps and bounds leads to a lot of frustrating slogs where queuing as either killer or survivor against certain characters feels like an instant loss. The tendency for killers to be structured around depriving survivors of essential mechanics doesn't help with this The Nightmare making it impossible to hide The Hag's hexes forcing an extra step into the game before repairing generators.But now I gotta be honest with my honesty. None of that has stopped me playing. Sometimes I even circumvent mechanics or characters I thought were unreasonably powerful and there is a kind of joy in that. The core mechanics are solid straight through an asymmetrical multiplayer about surviving the assault of a slasher movie villain is a fantastic idea on paper and the reality isn't far off. It's tense it's panic inducing it's frantic...and sometimes when things don't go quite how you planned it's hilarious. In short it's emotional. It makes me want to puke but sometimes in a good way the game intended hence my ""Mom's Spaghetti"" award nominee.At the moment it's a solid buy for anyone with an itch for some fast paced eccentric multiplayer action with better balance practices it could be a safe bet for anyone full stop.

2017-11-24,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,The game is entertaining and definetly worth playing.My major complaint is In this game you have a ranking system which is based off of something called pips. You need roughly 13000 blood points to be able to pip or rank up. Lately its been rather aggrevating to attempt to pip. A killer starts a game and just leaves every time that occurs you lose a pip. Alone in the last hour I depipped 3 times from a killer leaving the game. Which for some reason this game penalizes the survivor. This problem has existed for the longest time and has not been fixed. Its annoying to see anywhere from an hour to an hour in a half of games just dissappear because a person decides to leave the game. It pretty much undid my progress and it begs to ask the question of why I am playing this game if Im going to be penalized because the host disconnects or leaves the game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-27,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Epic game...perfect envisioning of a horror movie.Pros Even with one kill you still win the game as a Killer. Easy point and level up system. Exhilirating music and ambience brings the atmosphere to a complete head. Each killer character's design is well done and believable.Cons Non destructible environments cause survivors to run in loops making it impossible to catch literally. Few Abilities and skills to really change each match or how it plays out. Little Customization options No sprint ability unless you are the Hillbilly.What I'd like to see Destroyable walls/ledges to end the eternal looping from survivors. More Characters Weapons Costumes and Abilities. More traps that maybe the survivors could set to hinder the movement of the killers. The ability to shut off or damage generators for longer games.All in all I still enjoy it. I primarily play as a Killer and even if 3/4 get away ultra satisfying to hook that 1.7.5/10,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-22,0,0,329,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is a popular assymetric multiplayer survival horror game. Each match is played with up to 5 people 4 survivors and 1 killer. Survivors go around the procedurally generated map searching for generators to fix (there are up to 7 generators spawning in each game at random locations 2 more generators than there are players in game). Killer patrols the map trying to prevent survivors from fixing enough generators to power up exit doors. Killer can hit survivors with his/her melee weapon to injure survivors or put them into dying state if already injured. Dying survivors can be picked up and carried to sacrificial meat hooks. Hooking up survivors is the primary goal of the killer in order to win the game. Fixing enough generators while evading the killer and then escaping through the powered up exit gate is the main goal of the survivor team. Both survivors and killers have a complex leveling system utilizing bloodpoints earned during the game to purchase perks items addons for said items and offerings which can be used to alter a single match in some way ranging from increasing chances of being sent to certain map to allowing the killer to kill survivors by his/her own hands. Game is very entertaining to play from both the killer and the survivor perspective. Killer gameplay provides a nice stress relief after a hard day's work as you get to hunt down some players running scared from you (unless they are much more experienced than you are). Survivor game play provides a more difficult but ultimately more rewarding experience where you can either cooperate with other players to complete mutual objective or play selfishly in order to secure your own escape.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,120,False,Recommended,"So this is an update to my previous review. I have about 30 hours on record. Have 1 Survivor sitting at Level 31 only made it to rank 19 as a survivor but have a more firm understanding of the ins and outs of the game (I'm just not amazing at it) So here is my breakdown of the Good Bad and Ugly Good Game is super easy to learn and play. No steep learning curve (Good for us old guys) Graphics and level of detail is on par with some of the top line games. Ability to play with friends has been added so you can enjoy surviving with or killing off your friends. Leveling up system is unique from most games where you use points you've earned from games to collect items on a ""Blood Web"". These items are perks or items that are used for your killer or suvivor in future games. Once all items from the Level 1 ""Blood Web"" are collected you become level 2 and a new ""Blood Web"" appears and so on and so forth. Each Survivor and Killer is leveled up individually. Killers are fairly balanced across the board. Although the person playing the Killer can make the game not fun through camping bodies on the hook or placing traps under the feet so the rescuing survivor has no chance at rescuing. Everyone knows the rule if the Killer is camping the bodies everyone run for the other engines to get them running. But for the person on the hook it makes for a very boring and frustrating game.Bad The player base tends to lean more on the unfriendly side giving it that League of Legends community feel to it (Name calling before the game foul language cursing at each other talking crap after a match etc.). (Some may consider this good or bad) The ranking up system is very difficult and tedious and im not sure the ranking system has any major effects aside from bragging rights. The ranking system works on bloodpoints earned in a match and you are ranked seperately as a Killer and Survivor. The way the system works is this Your earned bloodpoints are calculated at the end of a match which fills a meter with 3 ""diamonds"" along it (checkpoints in essence). The first ""diamond"" is black. If you get enough blood points to reach this point you don't gain or lose any rank marks. The 2nd and 3rd ""diamonds"" are white. If you earn enough points in a match to reach them you will fill 1 or 2 empty rank circles respectively. You have to fill all 3 circles to reach the next highest rank 20 &gt 19 &gt 18 &gt etc etc. Most match wins will get you high enough to reach the first lit ""diamond"" filling 1 rank circle and meaning you will have to win 3 times in a row to rank up 1 time (Sounds easier then it is). If you don't win (and you die pretty early in the match normally you won't even reach the first black ""diamond"" which means you lose 1 filled circle from your rank (if you had any). If you were rank 19 with no circles filled you move back to 20 with 2 filled circles. So as you can see you need to continuously win or at least score enough points in a match to not lose any rank. So to those guys who are rank 1 congrats because its extremely difficult to do. I can say personally my survivor was level 31 before i each reached rank 19.Ugly The queing system is incredibly unstable. You might be fine getting in a game for 5 games but then the next few games you'll keep getting ""Failed to Join Server"" messages. ""Failed to Join Server"" messages appear quite often and it means the game has frozen on you. The only fix is to close the game through your Task Manager and reload the game to try to requeue taking the chance that the same thing happens again. During Survive with Friends you occasionally find yourself having 3 5 Min queue wait times (For what reason I don't know). Once in a game if any player doesn't ""Ready"" you will be stuck on a long loading screen and you will either have to wait it out (Approx 2 3 min) or you have to close out the game again through the Task Manager. (This happens quite often). The reason for this is that a player has just dropped from the game and the game has to wait for him/her to timeout and you are now without 1 (or more) survivors in a match. With teamwork being an essential part of being able to win against a Killer losing anyone from a game can make it a lot more difficult. Losing 1 person is still doable but 2 or all 3 more makes it nearly impossible. Most just drop from the game and requeue for another match.Overall this is a fun game to play. As you can see there are very frustating things with the game that need to be tweaked to make the game perfect but if you are looking for something fun and simple to play with friends or even with random strangers this is the game for you.Rated 8/10.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-05,0,0,566,False,Recommended,Ok first thing is first i dont write reviews often but when i do its cause the game makes me my pants!xDI will tell you about my favorite match on here.I joined into a lobby all the guys all playing good characters and werent too low of levels so i stayed.Once we were in the match we were intantly getting slaughtered like pigs.The killer was playing as the hillbilly(chainsaw guy).He had goten one of my teamates down and onto a hook .Being the nice guy that i am i saved that asshat.I did not know he was an asshat at the time so i saved him.The killer decided to chase after me not him.The killer one shot me with his chainsaw and just left me on the ground to bleed out.At this point in time i was still up it was before i saved the kid He went and killed another kid leaving him to bleed out on the ground.When i got down it was maybe 45 seconds after the other nice gent.Ok lets go forward to where i was at in the story The asshat kept going for the generators even though we were down.This selfish kid escaped by himself and left us two to die.after that i realized oh im gonna loose my rank cause i just ranked up.Then the kid started to spin in circles signaling me to go to him so i started my way to him as soon as i got there he bled out.But that kid saved my Where he was was the hatch and i was the last player alive i had maybe 10 seconds of life left in me then i heard the killer's terrror signal growing.So i was dragging my bloody fat body towards the hatch slow as right as he came up behind me i jumped into the mother ing hatch!11/10 would crawl my fatass into a random hatch to excape a crazy chainsaw killer again.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-04,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"90 % of all Killers camp next to the hook. With this ""press space in the right moment"" mini games it gets nearly impossible for the other survivers to get a generator running while the killer is camping. Thats extremly stupid and way op on the killer side. Maps are really small and you got almost 0 options to slow down the killer.Edit After playing some more I think its not that bad. You just have to give up the thought that everybody can survive. While the Killer gets one and camps at the meathook you and the others can go and repair generators. With decent team you get 3 before the first one is dead. Then you go and fix the others if he catches one and camps again go and fix 2 more. Thats often all you need and then one goes and opens the gate while the other tries to bait the Killer. So most games you get 2 people at least outand even if the last 2 ones open 2 diffenrent gates one will survive",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-03,0,0,4,False,Recommended,No reddit review here sorry. The game is a lot of fun I find it more fun to try to survive than hunt just scarier IMO. It seems like some of the survivors are more favored for their abilities and what not so thats sort of lame but I don't worry to much about it as I just find it fun running for my life and playing the game in such a way. The hunters are pretty cool too with my favorite being the hillbilly the chainsaw is scary. The other two both have unique qualities to them as well. My only complaint really is the lack of party making. I would be nice to be able to group with 1 2 more friends and play together rather than do it in a private party 1v1.

2017-04-26,0,0,530,False,Recommended,Sadistic Simulator 2017. Although this game is quite unpolished you can see the developers are actually working quite hard to make this game better even today! With the recent patch 1.5 changes it's quite obvious they're working hard to balance/fix as much as they can for us. And for a 21.99$ game that offers what it does I do not regret my purchase! If you're into games such as White Noise Deceit the upcoming Friday the 13th game or hell even Depth I'd recommend adding this one to your collection! Pros Lots of Killers with various gameplay styles &amp lots of Survivors (with customizable clothing). Lots of perks items and offerings for your Survivor/Killer (that are being actively balanced). 4 or 5 maps + randomly generated chests hooks and generators. Matchmaking + Ranking System. Survive with Friends. Can gives you thrills playing both killer &amp survivor.Cons Finding a game can take a while. Players disconnecting to save their ranks Peer to Peer (killer always hosts which can lead to them disconnecting when they know they're going to lose). Slight balance issues for certain perks/items (being worked on actively by developers). Odd bugs here and there but not often. Facecamping Trappers (they removed traps under hooks). Trolls of any kind (both killers and survivors). I've had a survivor spam the rescue button when I was on a hook so no one else could rescue me... Then let me die.I always wondered why I kept coming back to this game but I think I nailed it... The thrill you get when you're running from the killer or when you fill every hook in the basement with a body... That feeling of pure sadism coursing through your body... It's nice.,Dead by Daylight
2017-04-26,0,0,357,False,Recommended,This is a very solid game. I used to play it when it came out and I stopped after awhile because it kept bugging out and caused me to have to restart over and over and trying to play with friends was horrid. I recently came back and all of those problems are fixed. I can't play anything other than this because I'm so addicted to it now. The dlc's are worth it if you like to play killer and dope survivor outfits. My only advice is to remember the point of the game and don't get upset because a killer decides to actually kill you rather than play around and point farm with you.ALSO some people complain about wait times in this game. If you play killer it's not a huge issue however I'm a survivor. Just for a quick tip I play on US Dallas during the day and then at about 12 30 1 00 a.m. I'll switch my steam download settings to Canada Toronto and get insta queues almost always.

2017-11-11,0,0,798,False,Not Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer only 3rd person ""horror"" game where one player takes control of a killer and hunts the other four survivors.The game has great sound design and the devs are always updating it... and thats about it when it comes to positives. The devs (although they work hard) always seem to be heavly on the side of survivors with them getting crutches in the form of torches that can blind the killer in litrally 0.5 of a second and perks which absolutely blow almost everything the killer has out of the water.The survivors also do something known as looping. You can probably guess what it involves by the name the survivors run around objects with a pallet in the in the center and due to the diffrence in speed between the killer and survivor it can take up to three loops of the object for the killer to catch the survivor. But it doesn't matter anyway because the pallet in the center can be dropped onto the killer stunning him for about 2 seconds giving the survivor enough time to run away and locate another loop location. when I first saw this I felt like I gained a stress induces aneurysm and also thought that it must be an exploit. But apparantly this is ""part of the game"" which I would be fine with if it weren't for the fact that it can cause chases last up to 5 minutes sometimes more.For proof of the imbalance I recently purchased the Nightmare on Elm Street dlc which had the new killer Freddy Kruger (I got too tempted). Who I thought was a good unique and well balenced killer only to have him nerfed two weeks later because survivors complained about him being overpowered. Even though due to his ability survivors can do things like litrally run up to a hook and unhook someone right in front of him an he can't do so basically the devs took my money then gave me the finger. Unless you enjoy playing as a survivor and the killer off (or playing as killer and getting off) I can't recommend yet.",Dead by Daylight

The game does have a good bit of a learning curve on both sides and learning what perks are good or bad can take some time as well as what mechanics are what.Overall the game is a hell of fun while buggy at times which can cause some salt it's always being worked on the Dev team streams once a week to keep people up to date and answer questions and they do work hard on the game and while it only seems they recently began playing in and getting a better understanding thats fine as they are getting a better prespective on things. 9/10 would salughter random teens again,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-01,0,0,230,False,Recommended,UPDATE 12 May 2017Following on from my previous review (remains below) I am pleased that the developers have addressed many of the bugs with the process of the game. The majority of matches now launch without issue and for several weeks I haven't had to kill the game process in order to play.With that said the game itself is fantastic. It's entirely objective based. There is no way to avoid the objectives and this leads to teamwork in 9/10 matches. The changes being brought to the game sometimes don't sit well with me but they are balance fixes and so it is perfectly valid I may not agree with all of them. Many changes they make improve the gameplay and negate cheese tactics. Just recently they changed the game to prevent the Trapper (a killer) from placing his traps underneath hooks. They also made it so that hooks which have been sabotaged respawn.As someone who plays survivor almost exclusively I agree with one of them as it is beneficial for me but I completely respect their decision on both of them I can only imagine the frustration that killers must go through when they only have a small set of hooks left which could be located on the other side of the map.How would I compare this to other games on the market? It's become one of my most played. It's fun for the sake of being fun. There's progression but it isn't such that you NEED to be a high level to be able to compete. It's beneficial but even a completely new player could jump in and have a chance of winning.** ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW **The massive bugs with failed match loading and being stuck unable to join a lobby or go back to the main screen let down what would otherwise be a fantastic game. I should not have to force close the game down 4/6 times I attempt to play a match.Get it fixed developers or I'll be blacklisting your future games when it comes to considering purchases.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-23,0,0,100,False,Recommended,EDITED REVIEW The game is now good. There's still bugs of course but it feels a LOT more finished than it used to be. Survivors are overpowered but I kind of agree that they have to be seeing as how most people that recommend their friends to play the game will be playing survive with friends with them and if they get stomped by a killer nonstop they likely won't like the game. So I think the game is in a good spot right now despite the obvious imbalance.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,32,False,Recommended,A fry cry to classic horror,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-20,0,0,60,False,Recommended,I recently played this while it was free on steam and here are some thoughts and issues. When you first begin to play as a survivor you can expect to get reckted the first few rounds. There is really nothing letting you know what to do. The killer will seem horribly overpowered at first. I found that they are not as overpowered as it seems. While they don't have to hit you many times and it seems that they are right on your tail if you can run randomly and get over obstacles than you have a chance to escape. This game does have some scares. I was playing with a friend and we were fixing the generator than all of a sudden the killer that turns invisible was right next to both of us. Scared the living out of us. It was very fun and winning is very doable once you get the hang of it and play with people that are not level 1. The game does have some issues though. playing with a friend can be a bad experience. Multiplayer is fine very badly. My friend and I would have to back out of every gane and reinvite to continue the party. This is something that with most AAA titles would be seen as unacceptable. Also the game will let you click ready when you are already searching for a game which leads to a bug that stops the game search and will not allow anyone in the party to do anything. This leads to having to relog the client to continue play. Items you get are notated as having uses. In actuality it is more like having a certain amount of usable seconds instead of uses. This could be explained more or reworded maybe. certain aspects of the game seem unexplained. Does startling crows alert that spot to the killer? It is entirely way to difficult to wiggle your way out of the attackers arms. With one execption. Of the survivors have diasbked hooks and the killer can only use the basement than it is easy to escape because the killer may have to walk for like 2 mins just to get to the basement. I would almost consider buying this if some things were fixed. It seems great. I enjoyed the few hours I got to play it. The blood web system was awesome but can be worked on. The overall concept is great. The experience can be generally scary. Everyone who has watched a scary movie and thought man I would hide in the closet what is that stupid idiot doing hiding under the table you kind of have the opportunity to do that somewhat here. It is scary and to run away from the killer and not even be able to see them. Really enjoyed the experience. I hope it has more free play time soon.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-23,0,0,406,False,Recommended,TL DR the game is good and I'd be happy to recommend it.It's a great game fun to play and the concept is awesome although it has its issues.I do genuinely get scared and feel like my heart is pounding at times playing this game and the race to the door after the generators are done is thrilling to say the least. Generally speaking the DbD community is pretty nice to boot although there is a lot of killer survivor etiquette that needs to be learned before you stop getting spammed in the after match chat. In essence be nice and play fairly and you'll be met by a community who chats nicely and plays fairly.Conceptually it's a genius game One killer four survivors five generators and two doors mean that all in all there's a 50% chance for either party to win when paired up against people of equal skill level. Furthermore the map layout aids to chases and near misses that could be used as the inspiration for Hollywood horror movies. If a spectator could freecam it really would be cinematic at times.The balance of the game between killer and survivors is ridiculously out in some cases.The nurse is the most well balanced killer and possibly the most fun to play as her strong powers are well countered with the stun periods.Hillbilly is also pretty well balanced easier to play as and I don't hear anyone complaining in chat about going against him.It seems like a de facto part of the game that the Trapper will place a trap under any survivor on a hook. How this hasn't been axed yet is frustrating it just seems unfair and makes for a tediously linear game once you know you're playing the Trapper. The better trappers in the world hide traps in places a survivor might step a fair fete requiring forethought and skill.No comment on the Hag I think she's well balanced but I haven't played against her that much.Mike Myers is a different story. Completely overpowered and a pain in the to play against. Losing as Myers requires a complete and utter lack of skill in video games. If I were to list my frustrations against him I wouldn't be able to finish the review.The etiquette side of things boils pretty much down to these simple rules As a killer Sticking on a hooked survivor without even looking away (facecamping) is totally unacceptable unless that survivor got caught sabotaging a hook. Coincidentally this renders the hard earned perk Saboteur almost useless.Camping hooked survivors (running around the area of the hook and staying within hearing distance of anyone bold enough to unhook that survivor) is unacceptable and lacks skill.Relentlessly chasing a single survivor and actively ignoring the others is poor sport give them a break and chase the guy you just ran past instead.As a survivor Sabotaging the killer's hooks. Although this requires some skill daring and patience the DbD population looks down on you for this. The perk sabotage and toolboxes are useless because of this unless you can justify it against a camping killer.That's pretty much it.In all the game is an excellent survival thriller. Happy to reccommend ),Dead by Daylight

2017-05-19,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight has so far been a point for so many arguments it's hard to count them. However despite everything people might say it's still a super fun game to play. If you're a chill person that mostly play games for fun you will enjoy it very much especially while you're being a low rank player cause that's where all the nice people at. The more you grow rank wise the more toxic people you meet on your way. Both killers and survivors abusing some game mechanics in their favor to make your lower point hurt with pain. But! That's not the game's fault but the community's! The whole idea of the game is so epic and fun that you wanna come back and play more and more. Game devs keep working on it releasing new DLC's patches fixing bugs and improving the quality of the game in general which is very admirable in my eyes. All in all get the game play it and enjoy!!,Dead by Daylight
2017-03-14,0,0,291,False,Recommended,Very Fun Amazing and Addictive Game. Worth a buy. Dead by Daylight executes the concept of a competitive horror game well but only to a point. As players become more familiar with both roles the horror dissipates and they begin to play for the competitive element alone. The poor matchmaking and the highly exploitable scoring system make Dead by Daylight less competitive than it should be resulting in gameplay which doesn't resemble the horror experience it sets out to be. Overall it is a great game though.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-16,0,0,381,False,Recommended,I end up playing Dead by Daylight often with my friends. It s a great game that you can either play alone or with friends. No voice communication but there is a messaging system when in lobbies. Matches are hosted by the killer and you face them with four survivors. There are a handful of free survivors and killers but like every game there is DLC. It s a great sorta jump scare/horror game to play cause killers can be crafty.Some advice Play as both survivor and killer. If you are playing solo start as a killer. You learn some basics on how people are spotted and learn how the camera angles are important. If you are still shy of playing there was a free weekend not too long ago from when I posted this. Put the game on your wishlist and wait for either the free weekend or for it to go on sale. FYI it never goes for more than about 40% off.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-24,0,0,162,False,Recommended,"The TL DR Version This game is AMAZING worth far more than its price for its insane replayability but needs dedicated servers to prevent Killer tampering issues and some ****MINOR**** balancing issues.So personal overview I got this game because a really good friend of mine had raved about how much fun it was and how much he liked the concept. I did my research read reviews watched gameplay and although it was all mostly positive it did NO JUSTICE to how much fun this game is. Even when really stupid things happen and I have to take a break from it for a day I still get super excited to come back to it. PROS The Killer is a real player. So are your allies. Objective Diversity is great (I'll go into that later.) Character Diversity and Balance are relatively refreshing. Real Terror. A Horror Game where you can play as the terror. The Game gets better and more replayable with experience.CONS The Killer hosts the game so lag and lag switchs are a big problem (for now) Some unique character perks are pretty bad. (I'm looking at you Dwight.) Some perks are broken/do not work. (I'm looking at you Iron Will.) As the game is in its early stages some glitches are still pretty bad. (I'll go into that too.) Useless item Flashlight. (I'll mention why) Matchmaking system needs some work but is ""aight."" (Worth the wait tbh.) Killers are often pretty rude. (Not a proble mwith the product though! I'll mention this.)Ok so things about the game that are really important to know before getting into it in a little more depth The objective diversity can be different depending on the player killer and how you feel.The primary objective of the game is to get generators done and escape without dying but there's also the role of sabotage and plundering. Sometimes you'll have someone who will spend the game destroying hooks so that the killer can't actually kill you without a special item or getting you in the perfect situation (under perfect circumstances for the sabotaging player) and you may make your primary objective finding the chests around the map to leave with a new item and focus on finding the trap door instead of working as a team. This is a selfish victory but you get a lot of points for it. Every game you'll find a different mix of 4 players picking one of those three primary roles. You'll also find the altrusitic player who's entire role is getting ready to save people from hooks but that role can go with any of the previous 3.So onto the most annoying issue with the game. Killers host every game. There are no dedicated servers (yet?). So when a Killer wants to use a lag switch or anything like that it's REALLY easy. It'll always be super obvious and you can try to report them but they still ruin a match and lower your rank. Also cheating aside some killers are just SUPPER laggy. You can have the craziest most amazing connection but a killer's connection will get you stuck on a window for 30 seconds while they hit you twise really easily and put you on a hook while your frame is still on a window. Since timing is everything when escaping a Killer you need a reliable connection and the lag does not effect the killer nearly as dramatically as it effects the player so you'll find that the killer benefits from lagging while you crash and burn and lose rank. ( This problem however could be easily fixed by dedicated servers so we can cross our fingers this gets taken care of before too long and thus does not ruin the game.So onto glitches. There arent all that many but the few existing glitches are pretty rough. The worst of which is that some games you'll pop in without any of your perks and you'll be able to see your item going up your arm instead of in your hand and you can not use it. Thankfully if you put your item in a chest and pick it up again it will function and not just get deleted when you escape but you will still have to function without perks. That's the worst of the glitches the others are very minimal like Killers phasing through objects thrown down but that problem isnt too huge since they still get stunned and it doesnt completely screw you over(most times).As a whole items are actually really balanced and great. The most stupid ridiculously powerful item the Skeleton Key is incredibly rare and therefore not too much of an issue while the Toolbox Medkit and Map serve their purposes PERFECTLY in a balanced manor. However the flashlight is a completely useless item. You can stun the killer if you shine it in their eyes for at least 5 constant seconds. The only problem with that is that you have to be pretty close to the killer to do it and he can just down you in that time or look in another direction and down you without any problem. The purpose of the flashlight is for multiple people to use it at the same time but there is not enough of a communication system in the game for that to be in any way functional so it's just a useless item.All the nasty bits put out to dry for everyone to see the game is actually still absolutely incredible. Everything that's wrong with it right now will probably be fixed and the game will be crazy wonderful from that point on. A lot of issues like these in most games are problems with the premise or concept of the game and aren't nearly as fixable as the issues with this game.With the glitches I give the game a solid 8/10Without it s without a doubt a solid 10/10.I would with no doubt or hesitation reccomend this game to anyone who could remotely appreciate a good survival horror game.",Dead by Daylight
2016-08-24,0,0,17,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. Great game. It has such a simple systematic behind it still it's very complex.Every session is different depending on which people are playing. It gets you involved with other players to the degree you decide. It's not a decision of letting a character die or not but a decision of getting out alive or helping someone having a more rewarding session(to name one). This is boostet with a clever xp system. So it puts you right on the edge where it's a tough decision.Didn't have this much real fun in a game in a long time.I understand the negative reviews. It's frustrating if you buy a claimed finished game and it's broken all the time. A finished game that's full of bugs and stuff is a real pain in the a**. And it borders to a scam that its not ""early access"". And some bugs really destroy the experience but I think it s getting better.

2016-08-25,0,0,21,False,Recommended,"As of 8 25 this game is great if you want to play solo or kill your friends. The game is incredibly fun and the bloodweb(skilltree) is diverse and keeps you wanting to play one more game.The Survive with Friends mode is broken though. The way it's set up now when a killer decides to look for a game a lobby is created for them and the any group of survivors that start looking for a killer *after* the killer's lobby was created has a chance of getting into that lobby. If they dont get into that lobby the survivors are booted back to their pre lobby and forced to ready up and start searching again.The more people in your survivor group the harder it is to get into a killer's lobby since someone playing survivor solo can be put into an empty killer's lobby thus removing them from the list of available killers for a 4 person group. Resulting in the survivors having to press ""Ready"" and search for matches many many many times before getting lucky enough to get into a killer's lobby as soon as it's created.Once the survivors ready up they should be put into a queue where other survivors are matched to them until there are 4. Then the 4 person group is placed into a queue where any killers that want to play are matched to the 4 person group at the top of the queue.That way no one has to constantly click ""Ready"" and players will be efficiently matched.Other than the Survive with Friends matchmaking everything is GREAT love this game and will continue to play it.

2018-09-18,0,0,109,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I understand that some people are disappointed by the community and the bugs the games has but take in consideration that the devs are doing their best to improve all the black dots in this game. Let me tell you that this game is not bad. The community makes it bad.1. When I first had Dead by daylight in my hands (Console back then) I fell in love with the game and I couldn't stop playing. There are a lot of survivors and killers. 4 survivors and 1 killer in a random map. You must complete all 5 generators to open the gate and escape from the killer. Of course it won't be easy. It's entertaining but people sometimes can be harsh for stupid reasons and we are gonna talk about that in the next paragraph.2. People. YES there are salty people like in ALL games out there. you will with no doubt encounter a salty premade or killer. The salty killer is not offensive but survivors are mostly. They bodyblock you just because ''They didn't have a good day'' or basically just because they are grumpy and want to bring misery to others. I don't understand the people that doesn't like to play for fun. One thing for sure is that you can't complain about the community to the developers. It's not on their hands. Why? because it's not that easy to wipe out these salty pimples. They are like mites stuck in a dogs furr. 3. The game itself is REALLY entertaining and VERY funny. The people are just idiots (if you excuse my language) I dont hate the game but I do dislike the specific ''I am so proud of myself'' kind of people. They blame you for every mistake they make and they get away with it. Ignore these pimples and enjoy playing with friends trust me. Now this ''TUNNELER YOU F**** S***'' and this ''CAMPER PIECE OF GARBAGE'' and this '' HACKER MOTHEF*****'' is everywhere D but ignore it.4. If you dislike repetitive games then this is not your game. People argue about it being the same over and over but the point is surviving from a killer and that's all. killers will be added every year survivors as well with different mechanics. The game will evolve. Just be patient. Bugs show up and then vanish it's normal for a game. All online games has it. Give the developers a moment to breath because they can't fix things that fast and easy. Find some cool friends in steam and play together if you think that other players are dumb easy. Buy the game It's very good and I recommend it. ),Dead by Daylight

2017-09-06,0,0,275,False,Not Recommended,this game i swear...... i used to play this every single day with my friends and i really enjoyed it but i ended up quiting because of the amount of bugs in this game. The dev always provide new content which i love because it keeps the game interesting but the problem is that they NEVER FIX ANY BUGS. Every game i play theres always a bug and as new updates comes in more and more bugs appear to the point where it takes up to 30mins for me and my friends to find a damn game which is why i quit. today i decide to come back and give the game a 2nd chance because i see that its getting more and more players so in my head i thought that the dev decided to fix the bugs at least thats what i thought until i enter the game to WAIT 30MINS AS KILLER AND STILL DIDNT FIND THE GAME. WTTFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!! WHAT IS THE POINT OF NEW CONTENT IF I CANT FIND A DAMN GAME. this review is before the new killer is released I CANT EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE THE WAIT TIME WHEN IT DOES..... i cant believe afters months they still didnt finish this bug it blows my mind. dont buy this game at least not now its going to ruin ur first experience. i will try again in a month or so and if they fix this damn issue i will be happy to change this review.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-21,0,0,1433,False,Recommended,I do recommend this game its a great game with hundreds of hours of play time if your not a complete scumbag. People will block you for doing scummy stuff. Community is becomming very toxic everyone complains theres too many bugs not a crazy amount of DLC and as of today (3/22/17) the game piggybacks Steam for its matchmaking. This makes killers the host of the game so beware of region hoppers and bad ping. Playing with friends at any other time than midday is kind of a nightmare. Once the console port releases there will be dedicated servers which in turn will fix Survive with Friends queue times. Small dev team does equal more time for updates. Overall the expereince ive had is a great one and i still love it. If you dont have patience or have a temper this isn't the game for you. If you can solo queue or stand waiting for a bit with a friend totally worth. Hope this helps.,Dead by Daylight

I really like this multiplayer survival horror but there is one thing that bugs me... sometimes it is the best strategy for killer to camp before hook but thats really anoying for survivors because they can only escape themselves or die trying to save their friend.

2017-03-11,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,Heya First This is a fully released game. No early access. Keep that in mind.I really like this game I do. The idea and the gameplay as intended is compelling.It is what evolve should've been. And a lot of the reviews that complain about long lobby waiting times are literally jack sh*t. They only wait so long because they absolutely want to play survivors. Since this is a p2p connection game the killer hosts the game. So if there are 20.000 survisors and only 100 killers in the queue the survivors will have to either wait or switch to killer. I play the kiler mostly and my games are full and running in under 3 minutes.BUT why I gave it a thumbs down has the following reasons Matchmaking sucks. No really. You cannot see the rank of your opponents (I guess due to the reason that the devs rather wanted to mask the bug than to fix it). I mostly run against survivors where I can exactly tell that they are a lot higher level than me (by the items they carry or the perks they have). That is a big no no in my book.Second big reason Spawn is a . You can easily spawn in the game with the killer's breath down your neck already.Another big no no No mouse settings. You will not be able to adjust your mouse acceleration/sensitivity in this game. Unless you have a mouse (like me) that has buttons for the dpi you are f*cked. Who the hell releases a PC game with no mouse settings?And on the long run playing as the killer is no fun since you have to deal with rank 1 survivors taunting you after a game as a rank 18 killer due to the sh*tty match making system. Problem here is There is no real reason to play the killer. You are already in a big disadvantage. There is no incentive. You p*ss off all the killers there will be no more games since they are the p2p hosts.EDIT Oh and as far as the free items (due to having left4dead2 etc) are concerned Don't bother. They are not usable in your steam inventory. Greyed out items with no options. No way to activate them.,Dead by Daylight

But I give this game an 8/10 I highly recommend it and at the time of this review it is on sale 40% off so super worth buying if you don't like it then utilize the steam refund before you play it for 2 hours see how you like it.",Dead by Daylight

The game needs to punish campers since no one likes to sit on a hook for the whole game or part of the game waiting for the killer to leave and give a fair escape and some of the killer do feel OP for example MM feels faster then any other killer (him and granny are fast hard to give a 1st or 2nd on there speed) anyway's there is no way to counter any killer it's pretty much hide and seek with an objective.

2016-09-02,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"The Howling Grounds update proved to me that the developers shouldn't be trusted. So while I enjoy watching the people play this game I hate actually playing it myself. Here's what it's like playing this game go to lobby pray for good ping or back out of lobby and try to find one with decent ping next ready up and hope everyone else readies up as well or wait for a minute get to loading screen and there's a 1/3 chance (roughly out of 123 games 42 were with one DC) that someone DCs in the loading screen if it's you you win by losing any item or offering you put into the match. Fun right? After waiting for 20 minutes you get in game and play rinse and repeat with a mixture of campers s and idiots (most people playing between rank 20 10) who'll get you killed unless you're SWF scum. So for now I'm done. I might return but I doubt I'll edit this review. (The only reason I will change my recommendation is if the final two suggestions are taken and/ or enough key members of the development team are fired and updates thereafter show a new approach to balancing the game.)Two things before I'll make a serious return to DBD Servers I'm sick and tired of P2P and all the t it entails. Second remove teachables or at least making certain perks only usable with certain characters I have come back and playing has been a mixed bag in terms of teams it seems to have reliable chance of winning you have to play with friends but that only means it's more challenging to rank up. So all in all give it a go. See how far down the rabbit hole you can go. (This was written right after the Myer's update) This game has huge balancing issues the devs have decided to change the game to make it nearly impossible for new players to play with any success as a survivor. I no longer recommend this game until the devs can make the chasing mechanics a bit more fair giving the survivor a greater chance of surviving because as of now if you're spotted you're screwed unless you play this game religiously as survivor and grind out your ranks as Micaheal Myers. Here are my criteria for this to be a fun game again Killers should average about 2.3 kills a game the reason I think this is fair is because the average survivor will be able to get about the same number of points this way. While also giving the killer a more difficult game to play it would be relatively balanced when we see those numbers for the majority. They've screwed up windows and are consistently making camping more appealing despite saying that it's an unfun style of play. They've refused to give survivors anything in the last several patches and show no signs of truly wanting to make it more fun for the survivors. They took away ""generator rushing"" aka punishing campers they took away windows and aren't listening to the survivor mains at all. So... Until this changes I'm not playing Dead by Daylight and I refuse to recommend it. Instead I'll be waiting for ""Last Year"" hoping to see a more balanced game.",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-02,0,0,957,False,Recommended,While many people would tell you this game has a ton of bugs and glitches which it does the enjoyability of the game heavily outweighs its problems. Been playing since day 1 and can honestly say I got my money's worth from this game. The only real problem I have with it is the community. There are many people who are convinced the only way to win as killer nowadays is to camp and tunnel which is saddening to me. If you can look past the occasionally toxic community I'm sure this game will give you your money's worth too.,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-17,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,"I really like this game...but there are a few things wrong with it. As a killer you can be out done by simple goofy mind numbing gimmicks like pallet running. This is where someone just runs in circles for minutes on end. It ruins any fun of the game.

2018-09-03,0,0,6,False,Recommended,Great Game Only 2 types of play and select few maps with play senario's. Lacking a fair few players in my experience (create a lobby and no one jumps in also very ristricted when just 2 of you want to play.,Dead by Daylight
2017-01-02,0,0,412,False,Recommended,EDIT 2 5/16/17 Because I think this game is great and I really enjoy it I want to update my review as the game changes. Currently I feel I can recommend the game again because of the new update. While I feel the new killer is a bit too strong I am also pretty low level and I dont have a lot of the good perks so he just feels pretty oppressive.DBD's developers seemed to have fixed the matchmaking at least a good bit. As before if you play solo you get a game instantly with no issues. But before this update with 2 people you may wait for a bit and with 3 4 people you usually cant get a game. Now with the new update games are pretty instant or fast with 2 people and with 3 people you will get games but sometimes you have to reset the matchmaker. With a full party of survivors however you still cannot get a game a lot of th e time. Which is really sad because I love to play this with a group of friends. I will be changing the recommendation however because they at least fixed a majority of issues. I hope they completely fix match making and some of the few bugs in the game. Currently 7/10EDIT After a lot of frustration with the current state of the game I have to say that I no longer recommend this game. Balancing with the killers can be annoying but the largest issue I have with this game is the broken party system. If you que for a game solo as a killer or survivor you get an instant game. But the moment I add even one friend in a lobby and que we sit there for at least 20 minutes if not more. And if you make a full 4 man lobby and just need a killer you will never find a game. I have searched for a game for an hour and a half and could not find a game. Everywhere I search people just tell me that the game just prioritizes the solo que and party que is lucky to find a match. This makes me very upset since my friends and I like to sit down after work and get some games in but never can and instead just waste our entire afternoon trying to find a single game. This combined with the bugs and balancing issues makes me unable to recommend this game. I like this game but it is trying its hardest to make me hate it.ORIGINAL REVIEW This game is a pretty awesome game but does have its flaws. Its basically a deadly hide and go seek where a team of survivors try and activate 5 generators and then a door to get out. If you are the last one left and your team powered 2 generators then you can escape via the trap door if you can find it. All the survivors do good stuff though if no one in the survivor party took a perk or item to destroy hooks it feels like there are far too many hooks in the game.The killers are fun but I do believe the two dlc killers are a little strong Myers is the obvious one. You can stalk to get a stack and once you have that you have great passive stats to go wreck and can slowly build up your next stack to unleash a moment of instant downing. The swamp woman is pretty good but she makes it where once she gets someone hooked that person is gone. With the ability she has she can just put her item down by the hook and just teleport back to the hook and get multiple hits in. At least with the trapper he has to stay near the area to try and get you if you stepped on his trap. Though you could cleanse the area but you need to be quick about it.My only major issue with this game is the matchmaking. This game is fantastic to play with friends and go as a party of survivors. The problem is when you search for a game you will wait literally an hour to find a game if that. But when I play on my own I can get games back to back and it just doesnt seem right. When I play solo I usually play as the killer and want to play survivors when I have friends around. Its kind of hard to convince your friends to sit there for an hour and wait for a match though. At least we can play custom games but you cant level up and so none of us progress.I give this game 4/5 because of its dlc killers being a little strong and because of the matchmaking issues. I would give it a 3.5 but I feel as long as the devs balance the killers the game will be in a great state.,Dead by Daylight
2017-05-16,0,0,264,False,Recommended,I love DBD great concept and the devs can do a lot more if they listen to community. Bugs don't the game up as much as people say what ruins the game is camper killers.(Devs NEED to fix bug that doesn't let you win after you escape through door instead it leaves you to walk around out of bounds in a never ending game unless you get escape hatch or killer kills you.

2018-08-02,0,0,335,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I got this game for free and I started playing it because I was going to join the team as a designer.I've played it for about 15 hours (I left it on longer than that so Steam thinks it's more like 21) and I have to say I like it quite a lot. I really like asymmetric games and this is VERY asymmetric. The Killer is first person while the Survivors are third person. The rules and goals for the two sides are also very different.The presentation is consistently grim and oppressive as it should be. It feels like the team did their research on horror films and how to convey the proper atmosphere for the subject matter.I am very much looking forward to working on this game to make it even better than it already is.,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-02,0,0,617,False,Recommended,Very fun game. The only problems I really see for me is all the bugs and the extreme lag issues when playing survive with friends with people 3 or more countries away (that being said I live in switzerland and all the surrounding countries are tiny or massive). Also the extremely high toxicity levels straight up you trap someone in a corner by accident for a second or so DC or extreme rage you Decisive Strike the killer 360 or pallet stun them Facecamped. Also if any developer or moderator of DBD is reading please to god improve the anti cheat Minecraft servers have better anti cheat please improve it.However what I have to conclude is Extremely fun with friends or alone personally I like survivor better than killer because the gameplay is a lot more immersive to me.8/10 alone 10/10 with friends a voice chat and some music bots.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-18,0,0,245,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a 4v1 survival ""horror"" game. With many elements in the mix. If you want a terrifying game to play with friends you've come to the wrong place. After a while all the killers lose their scare and just become an obstical to overcome. The only killer that can geniunely startle me now is The Shape (aka Micheal Myers) due to him not having a terror radius.That being said Dead by Daylight is still a good game and an amazing time waster well worth its pricing. The devs have made a ton of progress since they started and the game has come a long ways.DLC Sadly if you wish to become the best of the best you're gonna need to buy the DLC. Killers like The Cannibal and The Hag have perks almost required to survive the upper tiers. If you are a casual player it's not that big of a deal as many of the survivors and killers you'll be facing are in a similar skill level as yourself.Rankings The ranking system has improved greatly since they changed it sadly if you are Tier 1 potential you wont find a lobby. The future With a massive update and balances on the horizon there is a lot to look forward to. There are public betas where anyone can try playing as new killers and survivors so we can all colectively yell at Behaviour for having something that doesn't work.",Dead by Daylight

Somehow I have not really managed to get sick of this game and those moments when the killer is right in front of you and they can't see you is soooo tender! I haven't had the pleasure of playing with friends on this game but I'm sure it would be a hell of a lot of fun! However it's sad that the developers have only made one gamemode which can easily make this game repetitive for some.

2018-08-05,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This game isn't mean scary all the time but instead of that it is very frustrating. Dead by Daylight has many issues like No servers Weird hitboxes/ glitches. Sometimes you will be around a corner and a killer will literally leap 6230 metres towards you. This many come at a disagreement but I as a survivor do not like this. My hours spent on this game feel like its been kinda worth it because I get to feel the rush of excitement and being squirmish while getting chased. On the other hand All killers of this game feel very overpowered for no reason. For example Michael Myers. Michael Myers when at lvl 3 (The Evil Within) is faster than a bloody rocket. I really do not like this when I'm doing a generator and this boi literally zooms from point A to B in milliseconds (Exaggeration). I Feel like every killer is op except for the hag. Sad little hag is literally E.T's cousin that's been under shreks for who knows how long.,Dead by Daylight
2018-05-23,0,0,764,False,Recommended,How WIN Dead By Daylight as Killer Step 1 Dying Light and proceed to tunnel your obsession.Step 2 If step 1 fails and all 5 generators are completed don't worry No One Escapes Death has got you covered! You can now instant down people. Hook 1 and all the survivors will run to the rescue. Don't forget to camp the survivor on the hook. It's justified because the exit is powered.Step 3 If both steps 1 and 2 aren't working out for you try Make Your Choice as well. This will allow you to camp just outside of the hook terror radius and instantly down what ever survivor unhooked your hard work.Step 4 If all of those steps fail throw on some aura reading like BBQ and Chili. That way when ever you do hook someone you can see everyone on the map. It compliments well with Make Your Choice as it allows you to know that people are near you as you can't see their auras.Pretty easy game you'll have plenty of fun!Survivor?You don't win you just do a little better each time. Goodluck out their soldier.There aren't any tips for you just try and be as toxic as possible. Tbag at every pallet and window you can and make sure you bring a flashlight and Decisive Strike every match.Also play Claudette she's hard to see on darker maps. No it's not racism it's the truth.

I still play this game occasionally but unless it has some major reworking done I don't think it will have the same size community for much longer. And oh yeah a lot of the community are just the most toxic people.There are good people to tho and when you do have a fun match either as a survivor or a killer it is amazing!

2018-06-15,0,0,148,False,Recommended,"Amazing fun and addicting game. Games are fast and there's a good community behind it. An amazingly active 4v1 game something I craved ever since the sh*tshow that was Evolve &amp Evolve Stage Two.A few minor points There are perks in this game that give you a small advantage. The game has been updated mid june 2018 to make sure you at least can choose 1 of the character specific perks but from a certain level you can learn the perk to ""teach"" to other characters which makes some experienced players have the best perks and thus a huge advantage over a beginner. This is both on survivor and killerside. The time to 'catch up' is way less than it used to be pre june update but it's still a grind to do if you're just starting out. Sometimes automatch puts you in a lobby with a host (killer is always host) and gives you a bad ping clearly showing that this person is nowhere near you. You can leave lobby wait a few seconds and search again but it's a bit tedious to do. If you're not careful you're in a laggy game and that's just no fun for everyoneBut honestly my negative points are nitpicking. You'll get the perks eventually and you need to be careful for joining a server with a good ping just like any other multiplayer game basically. Great game great community!",Dead by Daylight

No level up with your friends. It all has to be done in solo play. Good luck. Camping Hunters Bad team mates. Quiters.

No main Hosting server (Lag is bassed on the Hunter's connection to you.) Cheaters who use Map Bugs to kill you. New bug game keeps hanging on loading screen. VERY bad optimization. It's been years on the market now and even Friday the 13th runs better than this The characters my looks better the popular named horror heroes and villians look nothing like themselves so why put the names on them?

2018-08-03,0,0,499,False,Recommended,One of my favourite games I've ever played. Dead By Daylight is a 4 vs 1 Horror game where survivors face a killer each using a series of perks to give them the edge.When I began to play this game it was very casually a couple of games in a wekk here or there and then suddenly I was hooked. From out of nowhere I wanted to keep playing and playing finding ways to improve and survive more games.Many people may say the game is in a bad state personally I think the game is healthier than ever with new content and updates coming regularly and online communities available this game truly is thriving,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-03,0,0,153,False,Recommended,"""Sometimes when I play this bug we find a few games.""While I completely recommend this game I will start off with the negatives. The biggest one is that the game is constantly full of bugs. Mostly minor ones like small graphics glitches (I can see inside my arm) or certain actions not going through (press the button and nothing happens). Occassionally they are more difficult ones people falling out of the game etc. It's not too bad learning to play around the bugs then relearning when they fix the old bugs and you get new ones. But certainly not recommended for anyone who gets easily frustrated by bugs and such.The community is a mix of wonderful and toxic on both ends. Salty survivors and killers who break the game (and often both are to their own detriment). The post game chat gets a lot of salt but I feel it can vary. There are some frustrating killers/survivors but also those who are genuinely good and really just want feedback. I've made a few friends this way and often find that it's overwhelmingly neutral or somewhat positive. But for those who are easily upset by toxic communities again this game may not be for you.Finally there's the difficulty in balancing the community. Nerf killers and they're upset. Nerf survivors and the survivors are upset. It's a dififcult balance to make both sides happy especially in the very low or very high tiered ranks.But there's still a lot of good. If you adjust to the bugs the game play is enjoyable and surprisingly not repetitive. Each map is procedurally generated and each game seems to vary greatly. Survive with friends is a fun mode as well. I find it more fun to play with friends in the matches which helps counter a lot of the frustrations mentioned earlier. Also it's interesting to have to balance what game play you want in each match. Some matches punish you for being altruistic while others tend to make it harder to play without saving the other survivors. With all the factors that go into each match it feels like a brand new game each time you play.Overall don't take it too seriously. I'm at best average at the game and really it's just that a game which is meant to be enjoyed. Nothing is truly going to change if you're rank 1 or rank 20. So yes I do recommmend it but again take the whole game with a grain of salt and don't play too seriously and you'll enjoy it a lot more.",Dead by Daylight
2017-11-07,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,Game is so unbalanced now. If you want to play killer you'll have an easy blast if you want to play survivor now you'll be fighting an uphill battle that you'll lose more often than you'll win.,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-02,0,0,430,False,Recommended,"I love Dead by Daylight and I personally enjoy being a survivor. I would be lying if I stated that the game was perfect it's not. My main concern as a survivor is killers that camp. (camping meaning once a killer downs a player or hooks them they stay around the survivor until they die) How am I suppose to ""survive"" together with other players when some killers suck the joy out of being a survivor? I can't and I'm sure many other players who play as a survivor can't. I suggest fixing this pehaps a penalty for a killer that just stands in one spot for too long. Maybe the killer slows down or can't move at all for a few seconds? I just wish for some penalty for the killers that do this. There's a penalty for vaulting too much through the same window so why not a killer that doesn't give other players the chance to survive? Just a thought. I also suggest you all get rid of peer to peer. A lot of players use lag switching and it's so easy to tell. If the developers are making money I suggest hosting this on your own servers because then you wouldn't have to worry about people lag switching other users. You're going to end up losing the fans you do have becuase of these issues. I paid for this game. Did I get what I paid for? Yes. If you enjoy being a killer and PROPERLY hunting down your prey I suggest this game to you. If you like being on the edge of your seat and running from a killer I suggest this for you too. This game COULD be more ideal and I don't doubt that the developers care about the players so it's worth sticking around and seeing what new things they come up with.",Dead by Daylight

""if you invest in being a rank 1 killer or survivor there is no benefit to do so"" ""games sometimes reward you post season for your accolades / achievements and I'm left uninspired to continue playing to maintain my lower rank status"" the game is still fun both as a solo player and playing with friends.",Dead by Daylight

For every game that I play I spend two matches in vain trying to find a room that is going to actually start. And here comes the worst part which I don't even know why it still a thing the offering still being consumed in matches on which the host leaves it's just ridiculous. &gt Ridiculous loading times if someone has a bad PC or something or even if the host quits it can take from 3 to 5 minutes. It's not a problem if everyone have reasonable PCs though. &gt This one doesn't really bother me since I play a lot Age of Empires 2 HD Edition but since I am here throwing the shi* on the fan it might worth a point there's no dedicated servers. For the lay people games with dedicated servers on Multiplayer send the player's data packages to the closest dedicated server from the company itself and from there the server will send these packages to all the players which means your own connection will have any impact on your ping besides of course the geographic location of the server. P2P games however connect the players right in each others machines like a torrent. If someone delays the sending of the data package everyone will lag because everyone is receiving the packages slower. &gt Too many Russians.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-02,0,0,60,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely horrendous. I mean it's actually really fun. But it's horrendous. Let me explain why..Why's it really fun?The game is fun because the plot and idea of it is just intriguing. It's a small mini game style game that really makes you rethink your surroundings. Gameplay is mildly interesting when it comes to tasks a better way to put it would be 'clever' rather than fun (skill checks). The game so far seems relatively balanced. Of course it may come to the occasional 'wtf' moment but aside from that it's pretty evened out in what Killer's Perks are able to do what and how to counter them etc..The game surrounds the subject in an enclosed arena style map (procedurally generated) included with 3 other survivors and one killer. The Killer's objective to sacrifice all the humans to the 'Entity'. The player's objective escape with all other survivors or on your own by fixing 5 generators or escaping through 'the hatch'. It's a pretty simple idea but it's filled with so many little mini games within the mini games and tactics upon tactics it's frightening almost. Though that's one of the many things that I admire about it. Keeps it interesting! Why's it absolutely horrendous?Spaghetti. Code.I know the game was made with UE4 stating either the game was made with blueprints or hardcore C++ (or both). With that in mind ing hell. It's stringed together like grandma's 90 y/o hair still trying to impress guys. It's not feasible. It's not clean. It's just not ideal for a game that DEPENDS on not crashing. For a game that requires you to be in the 'trial' until you die or escape it sure as hell crashes more often than a blind man driving a car. Which results in what you may ask? Losing everything you've done that round you get rewarded no 'blood points' (the main currency in the game for leveling up your character) and of course lose all progress towards any 'daily rituals' (daily challenges for players/killers to complete for a hefty sum of blood points).Now of course every game has it's ups and downs. And sure this review could be depicted as some form of hate/anger directed towards the developers but I can assure you it's not. I love the game in fact it's a clever design for something so intricate and complicated. I applause the developers for that however something as simple as stability.. that should be a given in a game like this in all games in fact. It's just a frustrating downfall of such a great game.I recommend this game only if you're prepared to be disappointed every here and then. (Meaning almost 4/10 matches resulting in crashes) But aside from that it's definitely fun to play with friends or alone!,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-06,0,0,574,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. REVIEW EDITED AT BOTTOMI only have a little more than 100 hours on this game but I've been consistently watching streams of it since it came out and have kept up with it since longgg before I finally picked up my own PC. It used to be pretty balanced with balance patches here and there mixing up the meta. Now this 1v4 intentionally imbalanced ""survive against all odds"" horror game has become a 1v4 ""try and get a kill against all odds"" surprisingly balanced for a 1v4 bully the killer game.Over the last few months patches keep coming out that directly address complaints of survivor mains then either ignore barely touch on or outright claim it's not a problem whenever killer mains have any complaints of things in game that had really ought to be changed. This has resulted in the survivors being able to negate things the killers do that take a lot of effort (outplaying a survivor to get two hits on him hooking someone etc.) by just standing in the right spot equipping one perk forever or doing one skill check.Despite the survivors becoming more and more unnecessarily powerful and the people who play mostly killer continuously and loudly voicing their concerns the developers release patch after patch after patch and have developer live streams where they announce that they will not be working on things the killers would like changed at any point in the near future but have many plans to tend to the wishes of the survivors. I used to be a killer main and this was my most played game. Now I sometimes get back on to play survivor but I've moved onto other games. It's a crying shame. Do not buy this until the devs make an effort to fix it which if the last handful of awful patches are any indication won't be any time soon.EDIT 1 I definitely purchased this game at full price I'm not sure why it says I got this for free...EDIT 2 I've more than doubled my hours since this review and I can say now that the game is in a better place than it was at the time of the above review. The developer (BHVR) has purchased the full rights of their game from their publisher (can't remember the name) and it has been only great stuff since then. There's been way more communication way more use of the play test server for big changes and way more ACTUALLY listening to the community. I'm far happier now with the game than I was before and I'm happy to change my review to positive.Obligated to say maybe this more positive experience is because I'm now a survivor main... _(ツ)_/",Dead by Daylight
2018-07-23,0,0,47,False,Recommended,This game can be incredibly fun especially with friends! I just started playing the game again after playing at launch (2 years lol) and noticed so many changes. I also encountered various people that insulted me after playing so take that however you want. It's fun to be both the killer and a survivor as each has their own fun playstyles. I will say though the killer will almost have no advantage to the game whatsoever. Winning as a killer takes strategic thinking and luck. Same with the survivors. As a killer It really only comes down to whether the survivors make mistakes. The best killer with the best perks going against the best survivors in the game with the best perks will almost always have the disadvantage. With all that said this game is really fun and I'll keep on playing with friends. If you do pick up this game 1. Don't insult anyone or teabag the killer. It's pretty childish and it's not fun to get teased and insulted and it deters new players from buying the game and bringing in more players.2. Try not to camp it prevents the survivor from actually playing the game and them from getting any points from the game. It's not fun to just watch someone die on a hook and honestly isn't viable since generators can be primed during that whole period3.Don't tunnel (targeting one person the whole game) if they are recently unhooked it is understandable to go after them but if there are others in the way attack them first. It makes the game a whole lot more fun that way and gives others a chance to play (this point can go both ways)4. Learning curve can be quite steep especially when seasons are reset since high level players will also be at the starting rank.5. If someone insults you try not to lash back at them. It honestly just feeds them and I just laugh and tell them to have a good day. Kill'em with kindness DTL DRFun game that can be even better with a full lobby of friends as both killer and survivors. Community can be quite harsh and if you play killer expect some games to be challenging and frustrating at times.

2018-01-10,0,0,92,False,Not Recommended,Playing as the killer in DBD is baisically impossible and is rarely fun unless you're with friends. You have to abuse techniques like camping a hooked survivor to generator patrolling and face the music of the suprisingly toxic survivor playerbase. Most of the fun killers are considered mid to low tier killers within the game. While these killers can be good when starting at the beginning of a ranked season they become less favorable over the higher tier killers as you progress. If you actually want to do well as a killer in higher rank matches you baisically need to use the Hillbilly or the Nurse.As an online Competitive game Dead by Daylight makes some dumb desicions on how people connect to each other. DBD and Call of Duty are some of the few games I remember that still use P2P connections. I want to give BeHavior the benefit of the doubt within this reguard but if you're able to afford four movie tie in DLC's (plus your own custom character DLC's) and be able to push microtransactions into your game it seems absurd that you can't afford dedicated servers.The overall bias towards survivors is extremely noticeable. The breaking point for most killer mains was Freddy Kreuger who was nerfed by the dev team within A WEEK OF HIM LAUNCHING (this is made more absurd due to the fact that he is a lower tier killer and is hard enough to use). On top of this most have noticed that the survivors barely get any nerfs whatsoever which only reinforces the obvious bias against killers. When they do get nerfed it's nothing noticeable either.While certain killers do have overpowered techniques to use these mostly come in the form of one time use items while most of the survivor techniques are the root of perks and bad game design. You can be chasing one survivor with a flashlight (if you shine this into the killers eyes they become blind and drop anyone they are carrying) self care (allows a survivor to heal themselves without a medkit) decisive strike (explained later) and sprint burst for 5 minutes while the rest of the survivors fix generatiors (which takes about 80 seconds to do for each generator). Normally by the time you catch them 2 3 of the generators are already fixed. Plus if you have my luck they use decisive strike immedietly (a perk where if a survivor completes a QTE while being carried they instantly escape and stun the killer). By this time the survivor has escaped and at least 3 4 generators have been fixed. By this stage you're sh!t out of luck of getting all 4 survivors and have to tunnel and camp just to get one.I would say go buy Friday the 13th when it's on sale instead but the game recently had to hault content production due to a lawsuit so you're baisically stuck with this game.If you want to have fun convince 3 4 of your friends to buy this game so that you can properly do KYF matches. It's baisically the only way to have fun.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-24,0,0,784,False,Recommended,I guess it's about time that I finally get to reviewing this one.PROS It really isn't Pay2Win in any way. Although I can't personally confirm this from what I know you can unlock every character through farming. And honestly if you really like the game you're probably willing to do that. It is fun for a surprisingly long time especially if you have atleast one friend to play with. Content. New Characters and maps are released at a decent pace helping to keep the game fresh.CONS The Community. Seriously these people are on the same level as the League community when it comes to toxicity. Although I have to say that I don't think that this comes from the people actually being angry or anything but rather from the fact that they don't understand their opponents' way of thinking. This become really obvious after you play alot of both killer and survivor as you can somewhat put yourself in the shoes of any given person.An example of this kind of misunderstanding would be camping. I once hooked someone and when I turned around I saw three people standing there. Obviously I didn't go away. In the post game lobby everyone was ing about me camping. It's like the hell you want me to do? Just walk away when you're obviously RIGHT THERE and just ruin the result of some of my precious time? Yeeeeeeeeeeah no.Overall it's fun. Gather up a few friends and get to killin'. Or escaping. Whichever you prefer.7/10,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-19,0,0,618,False,Recommended,"So this a game that is worth the money. It can be a bit frustrating initially and there are scum survivors and killers at the low ranks. However if you get past that then you'll find whatever you paid vs how much you play it gives you a great value.On the flip side of this the developers are more concerned at adding more content than fixing or balancing. They get things ""working"" and then release it without what feels like the proper test scenarios. They are more than capable of doing public beta tests but do so what feels like for hype.This most recent release with the clown they didn't ""finish"" before releasing. I've been grinding up points for purchasing perks when possible or redeeming them for bloodpoints. They took this feature away and haven't returned it yet. Even though the area for purchasing this is still there. In my past jobs I got yelled at for taking away tools or features like this.

2016-12-08,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,in the beginning the devs buffed the crap out of the survivors which made any decent survivors able to always beat the killer i never got to be a decent survivor back then because whenever a killer would miss one swipe on me they would face camp me to death then they changed the killer up and the way certain things with surv worked and it was decent the survivors had to be a lot better to beat killer i improved because of less toxicity from killers camping me to death and had a decent time most games win or lose (mostly lose still) but then the devs started nerfing everything the killers complained about and believe me i had my complaints when i played as killer and survs did the same things to me. but i didnt want them to change it so that killers didnt Reallyyyyy get affected by it more or less just slowed down for 4 seconds at most and then they totally destroyed survivor in the last update the game that i loved i watch slowly get killed by the same people who had made a few tiny mistakes with survivor but have now decided to make it extirely unfun to pay survivor sometimes wining turned into rarely winning (id say probably 1 in every 30 game i would actually escape normally other times i would get lucky and find hatch) they made killers from something that required just as much work for survivors to win into a point and click winning game i know i dont have nearly as many hours as people who have spent many many MANY hours on here but honestly i dont want to have that many hours because the only way i will be able to win is as killer and i feel like using them is just cheap now its not fun to play killer or survivor and i truly believe im never gonna touch this game again because of this update as of 7/25/2018,Dead by Daylight

It plays more like an early access in many ways. Lack of diversity in the maps (they look a lot alike) very few maps and limited play options. You can't really join a server off of a friend or see where your friends are playing. Another limitation is in if say you have 3 friends 1 of you wants to be the killer this isn't easily done and you can't do public with a group unless you all are the ones being chased.More options for play better ways of searching for friends etc. along with more diversity in maps would make this game even better.

This is 10/10 best fitness game because I lose so much weight forgetting to eat.As for my recommendations for different Survivor Perks and Killer Perks something to do with trapping the killer like 'Vine Knowledge' where you can set up a small slowing trap for the killer in a really small area (5/10/15% slowdown). Maybe for killers a perk that allows you to lock the Escape Hatch (temporarily permanently (unless 2 survivors open it together) and permanently).Again I really enjoy this game it's super fun and cool.

2018-07-17,0,0,202,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight has clear successes and failures in almost every aspect of the game the game developers fail to throw in proper fixes to abused gameplay mechanics this includes the OP flashlight and difficulty to fight against SWF (survive with friends) that can communicate although I m not a professional in the game I bought the game close to launch and loved its flare and gameplay mechanics. Now it has lowered from killers being feared by survivors to survivors making the killer fear flashlights and extremely long chases. Even though the killers have been crippled lots of people miss the difficulty for killers because of their simple mechanics compared to a survivors and continue to demand nerfs towards the killers and buffs to survivors. The game has improved a bit however there has to be proper balance as there is always 1 a meta in perks. And 2 a uneven success rate between survivors winning and killers winning. (Survivors win most of the time). However the game does have original design and can become great once the developers get their head out of the drain and balance arguments from the community,Dead by Daylight

Don't buy this game unless you're willing to be tunneled (The killer only tries to kill you until you die of course.)Pros It's fun for a while ONLY fun with friends.Cons Willing to face overpowered killers such as the Doctor and the Nurse. Being incredibly frustrated. Gets repetitive after a while. Toxic community such as killers that taunt you when you're downed and wait the entire game for you to rot.

2016-12-22,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,Long live the king...Jason Voorhees.This game istmosphereic and enjoyable but brutally one sided. This is a great game to play with your friends but the non killer characters are very too helpless. I know its supposed to be a horror movie esque set up but as far as game mechanics go it could use tweaking for the sake of balanced gameplay.Game designers if you can read this hear me out. How about you make it so the hooks never kill you and just hang there...then someone can save you any time they want. Or maybe allow your player to pull themselves up withotu the aid of another player (that is insanely frsutrating). Or give the players more health.Left 4 Dead is another multiple player horror game where you can play as the monster and it had far more balance. I'm just saying this game could use effective gameplay mechanics.But it still is a lot fun. I can't see myself playing it for hours and hours but I had a blast playing it with my buddies.

2018-07-20,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"Introduction This game has alot of ups and downs sometimes more down then up. but personally i think this is the best attempted of creating 1vs4 game. However i recently play fewer and fewer dead by daylight and more and more of ""No More Room In Hell"" and i din't know why. But i think i had my reasons. So everyone this is going to be a detailed and in depth review as to why i start to play dead by daylight less.I will tell you this i think this is the most harsh review i wirtten so far. Too many dlc's To me this is a big evdience that Game developers are not the people who makes games to get attention and create playground to have players experience and have fun they never had before but rather as business game developer forcus on making money then actually making players happy. They more forcus adding microtranscation of the game Then balancing and fixing the game. While having a cosmetic store is okay but half of the killer roster are locked behind a paywall raised red flags for me. Let me tell you this i wish i spot this sooner so i don't have to pay all of that dlc and left the game. because at this point having faith in the developers is just gone. heck i think certain dlcs make it kinda pay to win. Which suprise me how many players are still playing this game despite the amount of transactions But the cosmetic store is okay but the rest of it hell no. poor game balance This is both a causal and competitive game but i feel they trying too hard to balance both bad and good player. i will put it this way ""Both bad and good players rely more on second chances or crutchs then actually getting good."" this is how bad the game is balance. everything get's self explaintory from there. The End this game have alot protentional but it is ruined by business men and game developers who looking to make a quick buck out of thier players. and to this day i am surpise that the game has still a wealthy of players still playing this game.I think the reason why players is still playing like tydetyme and marth88 is because they had too much faith in developers wearing suits which they kick the bucket on the poor game on every oppertunity. to be honest Tydetyme marth88 and everyone else you should quit while you still can and stop relying on that type of developer team because business men like that one are the worst type of people to rely on.",Dead by Daylight

Even after all this time it's been in developement many of the same bugs still persist. And some of them are quite annoying while playing such as being hit while you've already vaulted over a window. Some bugs that aren't major are model issues especially with Feng Min her model. I frequently have it that I can see insider her left shoulder.

I've played both sides to rank 1 and as a solo survivor I couldn't tell you how many times us solo players would band together to bully a killer. Now Killers got the Buff they needed and are stomping survivors. The survivors have forgotten that this is a asymmetrical game. There's a power role( The Killer) and the survivors are not suppose to be able to SINGLE HANDLELY TAKE ON THE POWER ROLE which they have for a very very long time. it will now take four of you to band together to do it.

2018-07-25,0,0,429,False,Recommended,My feelings about this game have been pretty inconsistent because of the toxic community however I love the game's unique gameplay as an asymmetrical horror. In the game's history the developers were very hesitant in balancing the game because of the process of approval required by their publisher Starbreeze. Ever since Behaviour bought the rights from Starbreeze there have been many balance changes that have given the killer side of the game the balance they deserved. Before the balance update survivors were very powerful in that they almost didn't even need to cooperate in order to survive. The point of a 1v4 asymmetrical gameis that the 4 survivors must work together in order to overcome the overpowered killer. The developers have recently been enforcing that type of gameplay which is why you can see many negative reviews and why there is so much toxicity in this game.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-25,0,0,132,False,Recommended,Great game only play killer. Survivor is ok if you don't want to stress out and you can rely on your teammates and get away with being bad. Not so much for playing Killer.,Dead by Daylight
2018-03-05,0,0,309,False,Recommended,Previously the game was in a bad position for killers and for the most part it's getting better. Only issue is toxicity thanks to that moron OchiDO this game won't heal from toxicity unless we get an actual report system going. Currently there is some major balancing issues (Survive With Friends Instaheals Hex Totems) which are slowly getting fixed. If you want a timesink game this is a good one if you need a goal or an achievement pedestal to stand on. At the time of this review there is also a major negative reception. This is mainly from toxic and/or entitled survivors being mad about Killer Buffs and Survivor nerfs. Killer is meant to be strong. Survivor is supposed to win if you work together.

2018-01-18,0,0,323,False,Recommended,You really shouldn't be listening to the massive influx of negative reviews the context is that the game was patched that featured a lot of balancing of broken survivor mechanics and reworked some killers that needed some love. A good majority of these negative reviews are salty survivors who are finding difficulty getting used to these balances and instead of working to improve their skill they rather bombard it with negative reviews and blame the devs. This game has never been more balanced and I hope the devs continue to go in this direction for the rest of the games lifespan.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-27,0,0,1094,False,Recommended,This game is quite good in my opinion. In this review I will sum up what it's about and what I think about it.The game is an Asymmetrical Horror Survival game.The game goes as follows There are 4 survivors and 1 killer. Both can equip up to 4 perks 2 add ons and one offering per match. Survivors can equip items while killers have a set power. There are licensed killers like Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger but also licensed survivors like Laurie Strode and Quentin Smith. There are in total right now 12 killers and 13 survivors. Survivors are played in 3rd person while killers are played in 1st person.Survivors have to repair 5 generators to power 2 gens which can then be opened and the survivors can then escape. Meanwhile there is a killer who is slightly faster than the survivors who has to hunt them down and kill them one by one. It takes a killer to hits per survivor to down him. 1 hit injure and 2 hits downed. When survivors are downed the killer can pick them up and hang them on meat hooks. There are 3 phases on the hook. The hooking phase the summoning phase and then the sacrifice. 1. You are given 3 chances during the hooking phase to escape on your own with every escape having a chance of 4% to be successful2. The summoning phase renders you unable to escape on your own and requires the help of another survivor to escape. You have to spam the set button (default spacebar) at a specific pace so you won't get killed instantly. You have to be hooked 3 times to die except if u get into the summoning phase during the first hook then u die at the next hook.3. The sacrifice phase is when you die. You get penetrated by pointy entity spikes and you get pulled up into the sky and die.Survivors have many means to escape the killers' grasp and hits. There are a lot of windows in the 20+ maps. Vaulting is quick for survivors when running and jumping through the windows. While vaulting is slow for killers. Pallets enable you to slow down the killers and even stun them when they get hit by the pallets. Killers can destroy these which will take some time and enables you to escape or just give you some time during the chase.If the killer finally gets you after the chase he can pick you up but during the walk towards a hook survivors are given the chance to wiggle out of the killers grasp by spamming A D A D A D A D etc. When released the killer is momentarily stunned giving the survivors a chance to run away and hide.There's a place called the basement. There's a meathook stand with 4 meat hooks attached to it. It's a dangerous place you as a survivor should try to avoid.There are 3 chests with items for survivors located throughout the maps. One is always placed within the basement.There are 8 generators (referred to as gens by the community and players) per match. There are also 5 totems located on random spots in the maps. Destroying these can give you points.A killer shack is in most maps. The killer shack is basically a run down shed which sometimes has the basement included and sometimes not.Killers have few items for disposal to chase down the survivors. They have a few more to find the survivors.When trying to find survivors killers can commonly patrol the gens. They're transparently outlined. When survivors are running the killer can see their ''scratch marks'' and follow them towards the survivor's location. However they end when the survivors start walking again so the killer has to look around a bit as well.Killers have a terror radius in which survivors can hear the killers heartbeat and start hiding.Killers are slightly faster than survivors but that won't really help them that much. During very long chases killers get a helping mechanism called ''Bloodlust''. This will make them slightly faster for a short time.Killers can simply hit to hurt a survivor or lunge forward to hit survivors. Killers have to think ahead of time to expect where survivors are going to go.I think this game still has high potential. Even after its release 3 years ago it reaches almost 30k players simultaneously every day. The game is not what it promises to be though. It's not very asymmetrical right now since the survivors are very strong since release. The developers are changing this slowly and because survivors are getting a bit weaker since the last patch they instantly made 440+ bad reviews of the game. As you can see from that the game has a pretty toxic community but what game (which was made in the last 2 years) doesn't have that? This community has 3 sides. Survivor mains killer mains and people that play both.I play both and have to say just like every other normal player that survivors are superior in strength to killers. Survivors can run around pallets for some time and then smack em on the killer in the last moment just to run to another pallet and repeat the step. During this one chase multiple gens can be finished leaving the killer with no chance or time. When killers get a buff or just a QoL change the survivor side gets really mad resulting in a new killer nerf.This is because survivor players are in a 4 1 ratio and thus are the cash cows for this game (buying outfits and auric cells for example) This means that the devs kinda have to obey to the survivors' will which they have done plenty and thus nerf killers. (which they have done plenty as well.I would give this game 5 5 or 6/10 stars basically. The community is and the dev team is pretty bad considering balance but the game is great and deserves more people to maybe one day fix the community. The game is quite hard in the beginning since there are a lot of killers and playstyles but you will get used to it and start dying less/killing more people. Thank you for reading this long review and I hope to see YOU in the fog.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-21,0,0,1442,False,Recommended,I can now recommend this game now since the developers are now actually listening to the community and buffing/nerfing things acordinglyI play killer and survivor about 50/50 so i do know what both sides are capable of experiencing in terms of toxicity and frustration and i can say with experience that the newest update is balacing the game toward the right directionRight now survivors are having a reeeeeeeeeeee because the update has changed how 'exhaustion' related perks work now they can't get their sweet sweet Sprint Burst or Dead Hards if they prolong the chase for long enough. Since i don't rely on those perks as much i havn't had much difficulty adapting to these new changesI can say that i don't think they should buff killers or nerf survivors/game mechanics anymore the balance right now is just right and they should focus on providing more content in the future(PS IMO i'd like if the new content to be 100% free no grind or paywall crap just content for content unless its a licenced killer then its completely understandable),Dead by Daylight

2018-07-06,0,0,498,False,Recommended,"I play this game somewhat casually and it's a lot of fun. Especially with friends. Keep in mind this review is solely from the perspective of a survivor player I have not played any killers and am not interested in doing so. So I will not be talking about being a killer in this review.The concept of this game is simple to follow and there's no overtly complex mechanics unless you're aiming to reach the top 1% of players or something. As a survivor you and 3 other players have to activate 5 generators to escape the area (which counts as a win) while a killer looks for and attempts to murder everyone. This game is effectively a horror themed version of hide and seek and I don't know about you but I loved hide and seek as a kid and I love it now. Just with a few extra mechanics to work with like saving other players from hooks (what the killer places players on when they're caught) and various items to work with (toolbox for repairing or sabotaging hooks medkit for self healing or faster healing of other players flashlight to attempt to stun the killer and ""keys"" which I have yet to use).Additionally there are about a dozen or so survivors to work with. At first they are unique but as you level them up you allow their perks to be able to access other survivors' ""bloodwebs"" which are basically skill trees. So late game survivors can effectively become skins. I like this because if I don't like the look of one of the survivors I can use helpful perks from them to someone else.When you start the game it is a bit scary. You don't fully understand killers' mechanics so some of their abilities can genuinely scare you at first. The Doctor for instance has a jumpscare. The Nurse can teleport the Shape gains power by staring at you (imagine working on a generator and you turn around to see him just looking at you). After a while you understand these more and kind of get the gist of their playstyles but I still get adrenaline from running away from killers while the music hypes up and the heartbeat is thumping like crazy.All right with gameplay and out of the way graphics are okay. They look a little dated and some animations could use more polish. Sometimes the physics whack out like crazy and you can see someone's hair stretch a yard away from their head. Not amazing not bad but it's nice enough to look at.The maps aren't amazing but they aren't bad. They're small but this allows for quick games most of the time (there's no time limit). Environments feel sort of the same but this is also for the sake of gameplay and everything's dark because it's horror so that's to be expected.I got the game on sale and it feels worth it for $10. It's fun can be played casually and so far nothing feels like t mechanics. Everything feels fair.EDIT Doubling my playtime now and playing a lot of solo I've found the game to be less fun without friends. That's how I originally got into the game and without voice communication I find myself baffled by the choices my teammates make even if it makes sense for them. This can leave the experience frustrating for solo survivors. I'd say the game is best played with a 2 4 premade.Worth mentioning that yes there are a few ""camping"" killers in this game. They do ruin the entire game experience and there is not enough mechanics within the game to punish camping so that it's entirely pointless to do so which of course just encourages more camping.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-23,0,0,687,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is one of the latest games in the asymmetrical 4v1 horror genre similar to the upcoming Last Year and Friday the 13th. Consider Dead by Daylight a hybrid of Outlast and Dead Realm.I'd held off writing a review to see if the developers would fix the numerous bugs within the game such as waiting upwards of 30 minutes for a lobby collision detection issues and killers being allowed to cherry pick who they want to play against. As of the 23rd of August I can happily say that the vast majority of these issues have now been fixed matchmaking is now instantaneous (although still lacks dedicated servers) collision detection issues have been addressed and thankfully no longer cause problems and ranks are hidden from other players to avoid lobby dodging.Overall I now highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an atmospheric horror experience whether it be with friends or by themselves.,Dead by Daylight

If I had any grip about this game its about the match making and even then its minor complaint since matches come up at a decent pace. More often then not ill be a really low ranked killer and a couple of meat sacks will be really high ranked and all of a sudden it becomes a really really hard game of tag. As a survivor its the opposite effect where your just trying to run away from the overly attached girlfriend and she JUST WONT GO AWAY. But as I said matches come up pretty quick though and when you die you can just que for another one. In all honesty a very thrilling game that I have enjoyed.,Dead by Daylight

2018-07-18,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,"The game is great. You have fun for a few hours play with some friends maybe solo to increase immersion. Each killer has unique abilities and gameplay and so does each survivor. The game is going great you load in find a generator and start working on it. Within the minute of the beginning of that certain match someone is down. You think ""Hmm that was quick"". Seconds later you are near the killer using the run around the tree to avoid being seen tactic and you notice ""wait a minute is that Michael Myers? Or Leatherface? Don't you have to pay to use those? And all of a sudden you get one shot. By a killer that cost at least five dollars. And then after a few more games it happens again but this time with a different paid killer. And it hits you. Pay To Win. Three words that are so true for this game. Want good clothing that helps you camoflauge? You can buy it with auric cells and be pracitcly invisible against a dark corner or in a bush. Want a killer that will win you games? And get you blood points? Cough up five bucks and you got it. This game is ridiculous with making paid killers have one shot abilities that take mere seconds to charge with almost no setbacks on the killer who is faster than you and has great hit range. If you can prove to me that it isn't bull that the only way to get those characters is to pay then go ahead.",Dead by Daylight

2018-07-19,0,0,32,False,Recommended,When I first started playing this I was also playing F13. Both good fun games. Im a big F13 fan in general but I think DBD has the edge over it on the fear factor. The atmosphere is just right on it. Theres no attacking as a survivor you can only hide and do what you need to do to escape which really helps make you feel vulnerable.A few niggles I have with it are the graphics settings. They are very sparse and don t seem to do much when changing them. Also it says its in fullscreen but it s not really its borderless so the performance takes a bit of a hit. There are loads of guides online that tell you how to solve this which I used and now the game looks and plays great.Another little niggle is with the actual connection. I get a fair bit of rubberbanding more so over the last couple of plays Ive had. This is where my character seemingly warps forward or wherever making it difficult to judge your escape from the killer. I suppose it could be due to me playing over wifi but it wasn t doing it the other week. Something to keep an eye on I guess but I can see that others have the issue as well.Anyway I recommend the game if you fancy something a bit tense and dark. Give it a blast and maybe hit me up for a game!,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-16,0,0,701,False,Recommended,"Love and hate relationship.Pretty good game quite addicting really. The overall idea of the survivor x killer is getting popular these days with some of these upcoming games for instance. I finally started playing this bloody thing this year but damn it's been 2 years and the game continues broken af. A 4v1 game was supposed to give the killer all the tools needed to be OP and impose terrorand pressure on them. There's a massive reliance on pallet looping in order to waste the killer's time extremely powerful perks such as decisive strike and borrowed time and the lack of stealth options given to survivors. Dbd's gameplay in a nutshell is basically like this If you are playing as a killer your ability to win is almost solely based on the ability for survivors to make mistakes. It's always wheter or not they screw up. If you remove most of the pallets from the map the killer would be really powerful. However the survivor doesn't receive points for being stealthy and so they must relie of pallet loops because it's a really strong option and they get points for being chased and stunning the killer with said pallets.Let's not even discuss about flashlight abuse and survivors removing your totens within 10 seconds and nullifying your powerful killer hex perks. That being said just think about the following idea four survivors with four powerful perks against one killer with four powerful perks the survivors will always win if they play correctly. For a killer to have a good time on this game the survivor MUST mess up for you to get rewarded. Unless the Devs decide to make any balance rework or something alike there will always be a Jake jerking off on your hooks and kage bushin Claudettes.Devs response after 2 years no uI recommend watching ""Problems with the Dead By Daylight (DBD) Meta"" by Bricky if you need more insight into thatBy far I love this game but I definetely do not enjoy playing for hours straight too stressful most of the times.",Dead by Daylight
2016-12-18,0,0,94,False,Recommended,"They still have matchmaking/lobby creating issues and most of the thumbs down reviews are completely correct on the gameplay issues. That being said they fixed a lot of the initial problems the game had and it got me hooked on the recent free to play weekend.Update Review 12/23/2016 After about 2 weeks of playing on and off the main issue with the game seems to be the extremely salty community Dead By Day Light has acquired. Many surivors complaining about host advantage issues with the killer/monster (whom is always the host) plus complaints of constant camping.My issues with ""camping"" After having played both survivor and monster extensively I have to say that camping is a completely fair and viable tactic. Survivors seem to have some sort of superiority complex where they feel they can have their cake and eat it too. It completely ruins the entire experience in my opinion specially when you go against a group of survivors that's a steady group of players that are constantly partying up because they're friends and they all have all their four perks unlocked plus full ultra rare (red colored) perks.They run around the entire match causing complete mayhem they love to not only fix generators as quickly as possible with perks such as saboteur but they break hooks traps run to every single board on the map to drop it on the monster chasing them and are generally a group of smart asses that feel like they should all make it out alive.It ceases to be a ""horror"" or thriller and devolves into smart asses running around trolling the monster. Then in the aftermatch lobby they have the gall to and complain telling off the game's host for camping if he even manages to catch one. This is a game about a horrifying monster sacrificing ordinary people to a dark entity that exists and permeates in some unexplicable form from the area or ""map"" you happen to be on. Not everyone was meant to make it out alive. Part of the experience of this game is the fact that you're likely going to be executed. That's that. Stop being a ing",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-29,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Although outside pressure probably had something to do with its release date *cough* before it was done *cough* (why not closer to halloween?) I appreciate that this game was released when it was to allow the community to shape the balance and tweaks to gameplay and allow time to grind up points for advancement.I believe this game is a lot of fun for the following reason YOU ARE IN A HORROR MOVIEPrevious games have used the multiplayer aspect to pit monsters versus survivors but not quite on this level before.One can be a helpless survivor scrambling to escape a never ending nightmare with others they can choose to cooperate with or bait the monster with to save their own hide.You can be the killer fast powerful and driven with malice to hunt down the other players using cunning and prediction to catch other players off guard.You get the feeling from each game a new story is unfolding that you inevitably are a part of. Especially with items that change light levels and fog in the game.Couple that with a kind of misty backstory of a web of blood and you have a weird awesome near lovecraftian experience of confusion heart racing and momentary relief from danger that normally only comes from single player horror games like FNAF or Slenderman multiplayer.For those considering buying the game do it now as you will need to grind up points for additional perks that make the game more enjoyable. And hey its $20 not like other high graphic $40 games that are multiplayer only. You can't expect the quality to be the same for what you pay. Plus you help influence gameplay changes in its continuing development.ok enough preaching.You might want to hold off buying the game if you want a more finished bug free game as the devs are working still on game balancing new content bug fixing and the like. A recent patch helped to balance infinite escape spots for survivors so it is easier to play the killer now in a sense (less abuse of arena). Perks on certain characters are overpowered versus others meaning these perks almost never see play. The ranking system is different from other games and takes some adjustment as it is not enough to simply win the match while hiding in a corner watching everyone else work. Ya gotta be brave to get pips.Disconnects ruin the fun (when has it not in multiplayer gaming?). Perhaps some adjustment to disconnecting so that if a survivor disconnects at very start of match a generator gets taken off the count or something. The connections in games vary by match meaning some matches are laggier than others your connection is not going to be stable every game. Very frustrating when as a survivor you glitch into the view of the killer or as the killer you can't hit a lagging survivor.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-19,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,I really wanted to love this game and in some aspects I do. Every game if someone is hooked they'll just dc or let themselves die on purpose. If you're hooked then it's just killers camping you. (I don't have anything against that really) But if you're being camped and tunneled team mates should just get on with gens while the hooked person gets as much time as possible to help them out and buy them as much time as possible. This isn't the case though people just disconnect as soon as they're picked up never mind hooked which makes the rest of the game more difficult for everyone else. Occasionally you get team mates that know what to do how the system works and to use their brain when it comes to escaping. This however is a very rare occurance. Until something is done about people leaving once downed or dying intentionally it won't be a huge success. I'l continue to play the game casually from time to time though .,Dead by Daylight

The game is not bad but it's a shame that you have to buy the characters instead of earning them through gameplay it's also a shame that apparently in my first two matches i get killed because A an idiot of a teammate opened my closet door thus revealing my position and not bothering to help. B a teammate screws up the skill check and reveals our position while the killer for some reason chooses me to chase. The teammate screwing up a skill check is forgivable. Opening up my closet door and getting me caught isn't. However the game is fine. It's just me and partially the teammates. That screw up. I guess i'm more or less just used to games where i can actually fight back or atleast be able to get one objective before dying resulting in me playing bad.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-19,0,0,862,False,Recommended,I've been playing this game for more than 2 years now. I bought it when it first came out in june 2016.I played consistantly to get better. Warning this game is not beginner friendly and it's easy to feel oppressed.Yet with that out of the way. I always come back to this game cause the way it makes me feel while playing it.A hide and seek plus the seeker is a killer. I love the mindgames the chases and the thrill. No game is perfect and the devs are trying to make the best of it.Pros The thrill that the game is creating All the maps Be able to play with friends or killing them P The strategy that you have use while under pressure The constant updates balance patchs and dlcs coming out.Cons A little tweaks to make the killer feel that he can do more that just waiting for survivors to make mistakes. I was scared for the longest time playing killer cause i was getting insulted whatever playstyle i was using. This is a community problem and it's not related to the game. Now i just do my thing and if they are mad...i just don't care.I had a pretty great experience playing this game and i still love it...to death hahaIf you don't like losing don't play this game. This is a simple warning. To get better at this game you will lose a lot of games.With that in mind i still recommend the game if you like assymetric horror game!Peace out!,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-05,0,0,96,False,Recommended,After finally being able to play this game this year and spacebar no longer crashing my game I can say what I think about it. This is genuinely a fun game and very suspenseful when you're the killer or the survivor HOWEVER there are some little things in the game that are a big deal that deserve a fix things like Not being able to squeeze through places that are clearly open enough to fit in toxic players (that one is unfixable some people just hate losing) Strange hitboxes no ban/suspension on people who constantly leave no way to practice using a killer you're unfamiliar with unless you're in a friends lobby just to name a few.If you got some friends then come on and play! Survive if you can,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,27,False,Recommended,First of all I Love this game!It's so much fun to play and the atmosphere is amazingyet I have 3 points that might need some rework The beartrap killer is able to place traps directly beneath the hook while a survivor is on the hook making it impossible to save him because one of the survivors always gets stuck in the bear trap if they try to rescue each other. Maybe just change it so the killer is able to place traps near the hooks but not underneath them. Playing with your friends is obviously the most fun but if you're just 2 or 3 people it's almost impossible to play together as survivors. So adding either a server browser or the option to create a lobby for your friends to join together as survivors would be GREAT! I sometimes have issues with my internet connection so from time to time it occurs that my connection breaks for just a second or two but that's enough time to throw me out of the lobby and there is no option to join back in which leaves not just me but my fellow survivors I really hope the developers read my review and maybe even think about adding one or two of my ideas because in my opinion those would make the game even more fun than it already is right now!Please keep up the great work. I love your game and hope it will get some more content as i wish to be able to play it for as long as possible without it getting boring. ButterFliege33,Dead by Daylight

Now its just a survivor rank that changes too many times in my opinion. And they should add a system were you get lobby's based on (the killers) level(s) for example it (could) happen that a killer is rank 1 (highest rank) and a new survivor joins the lobby at rank 20 (lowest rank) and it's his/her first game thats not fair by far the killer would have a huge advantage which can lead to new people rage quiting.

2017-10-19,0,0,1386,False,Not Recommended,This game has been a fun ride since I first started playing it around a short amount of time after the Nurse came out. The game has given me mixed emotions since I started playing being bumpy once in awhile although maintaining what it has and will always be a headache. I'd like to section off the review into three or so sections starting with the overall community and then going deeper into the game itself. Community I want to get this out of the way. The community is filled to the brim with nothing but toxicity and reasonably so because of the 4v1 gameplay. I seriously doubt that the community will ever be any different. Survivors and killers alike both have the mindset no matter what that the other is directly going against them not only in game but in overall moral code and feelings shared with eachother. I have almost never seen anyone on the survivor side agree with the killer and vice versa. One key example that I have seen the community do to reflect this is mass reviewing the game if a side got mechanics changed against their favor only giving negative reviews because of a simple change. Ranks 20 16Ranks 20 16 consists of people who are new to the game. Conversation is usually pretty open consisting of sharing ideas to general talk. Essentially the community that you would want to see from a developers standpointRanks 15 6Ranks 15 6 generally have your standard gg's and maybe some back and forth communcation here and there although there is some people who stand out from the bunch here and there.Ranks 5 1Ranks 5 1 are where the true community shows out. There is usally little talk if any at all and most of the time only a few gg's if you play right in the opposing player(s) eyes. Developers The developers for this game are a mixed bunch. They have made some awkward decisions ranging from balancing to just gameplay mechanics. The best example would be in patch 2.2.0 with pallets having only stun if the killer is essentially inside of the pallet. There isn't too much to hate on here besides that you can tell the developers are scared to make changes because their community hates change. The GameGameplayThe base gameplay is balanced in favor of the lower ranks (Rank 20 16). This has made playing in higher ranks feel too hard for every killer except what is generally considered high tier killers with nurse being the best as of now. The gameplay after 1k hours feels repetitive and I find myself coming back during high ranks only for the new chapters which to be fair usually come with their own rank resets. I feel as the gameplay would be more fun if there was either something to boost the baseline killer to have a higher skill ceiling or to make gameplay slower and less competitive the higher the rank you are.BugsBugs have plagued this game since its start being nothing but even more stress on the player. The PC side of the game has PTB's or Public Test Builds every once in a while. Each build usually contains a few bugs and what feels like every PTB the developers let through a few bugs or bad changes and release the chapter even though they exist. This on top of the community have made me question if I should have spent time playing the game to begin with. Conclusion Overall I feel as if the game is incomplete. It deffinetly needs a massive change to feel fun again in my opinion whether by making a casual mode or by making bonuses for being in high ranks. There honestly isn't much to say about it other than it is what it is a simple 4v1 game that gets harder to play the more you play it.I'm giving this game a no simply because of the dedication and patience you have to put into it to keep your sanity and to keep your anger down while playing it.All edits so far have been for formatting.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-27,0,0,968,False,Recommended,I don't know I'm not good as it is but I dropped 3 ranks all because Freddy is almost impossible. I haven't found anything to counter any of his perks or even his dream state. I wouldn't recommend this game to someone just starting out. If you want the game and are going to buy it anyway I'd suggest just playing with friends and try to have one of your friends play as Freddy and practice against him. Even after the hype dies down I still think a majority of bad killers will stay as Freddy. Even then though I'm not sure the game will be fun.I'm not saying I need to win every time and obviously I don't seeing as I'm usually a Rank 16/15 but when you have bad killers that are all of a sudden getting up in rank you can't just chalk that up to someone getting better at the game when they can only win with one killer. If I'm out of line thats fine but just giving my opinion. Going into Dream State is instant getting out of dream state either gives up your position or you have to hope you have teammates that will help he is incredibly fast. Also once in dream state he can see your aura.I changed my review to recommending the game from not recommending because I think I was premature. I still believe everything I wrote but a good way to counter Freddy is having self heal and taking advantage the 7 or so seconds it takes to get into the dream state.,Dead by Daylight

This is probably the only time I like a coop game where I have to lvl up. Everything is more or less well balanced just need to use the perks and environment to your advantage. And that's where the negative points come in the tutorial is crap. Took me a couple of hours (and youtube) to figure out the Skill Check and other game mechanics. Make a Tutorial where you can pick what you want to practice. And of cource it's a P2P game. Between disconnects lag switching and bad pings all online games need to be client/server based and not P2P... the game will be better for it... get servers... you reduce cheating and other disconnect issues.All and all I still recommend DBD.,Dead by Daylight

I love playing killer but here is where my negative review comes in this game is very anti killer. the killers can be balanced but theres exploits to screw killers like ""pallet looping"". the being strung along in a 1v4 while the other 3 beat the game is fine and dandy but this game is toxic. if you kill one person you are a camping ****. if you kill all 4 you are still a noob camper etc. the players on survivers side (not all of them) are so toxic it makes this game not fun. then you add on survive with friends +so players can communicate with eachother (basically cheating it helps so much) and keep you from actually getting kills. this game is draining and if you like a grind go for it but a game where the community (and developers to a degree) make the game cator to survivers allways winning or else you get salted at isnt fun long term.

2016-07-08,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Good game idea and plays well I could imagine that this game would be fun to play with five friends but from a single player perspective it can get really annoying and frustrating because of the lack of people who actually help you when you are stuck on a hook or being hunted down by the killer. Another problem with the game is that you cannot search for a public game with friends (that I know of) meaning that unless you have five friends to play with then you are unable to play with friends at all. The game doesn't include any in game chat meaning that you are unable to communicate with your teammates. Overall I would recommend this game to people that have enough friends that own the game to play with.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-10,0,0,25,False,Recommended,not bad but it takes forever to get into a match if you are playing killer. Lots of ways to tailor your character and every level of your bloodweb has atleast 1 useful item. One major downside is the community. It is more toxic than a game of CoD filled with 7 year olds. If you have a laggy game as killer and win you are called a hacker and reported. If you have a quick victory as killer you are called a hacker and reported if the players even stay but most rage quit to keep from losing rank. If you are playing survivor and get generators repaired too fast the killer quits so he doesn't lose rank. In short its really rare that you find a good game full of people who don't cry about losing. I'd still suggest it to players looking for a better version of Friday the 13th that won't go into perma stasis mode any time soon.,Dead by Daylight

Falling though the map being laaunched by unknown forces displpacement and many more. The community itlself its another problem too.

2017-09-12,0,0,1372,False,Recommended,Mixed feelings about this game I think its an amazing game if you overlook the balance &amp toxicity issues.This game really is something different and unique but playing survivor is kinda easy with friends because the swf(survive with friends) mechanic works and playing killer is quite unfun or too frustrating to play.If you REALLY REALLY want to play as a killer play the nurse or learn how to play the nurse because she's the strongest killer in the game since she can blink(teleport) through walls &amp pallets(THE ONLY THING THAT A SURVIVOR HAS) and also she can end the chases preatty easily again only because of her power.So maybe recommend if you have friends or you want to play as a nurse.,Dead by Daylight

I'm happy I only tried this game as a trial.The game is quite focused on rank different characters items perks points of different types and upgrades.Some killers make a noise some dont. Some turn invisible.These character differences don't really make the game interesting. The first 5 10 games you play might be interesting though.Instead these differences make you go ""uuh really? what the . "" and you start hoping for a killer which isn't op. But then the op killers are picked more often in order to own.It can be fun but it sure isn't worth the money.You ALSO have to buy additional customizations and characters with real money.

You'll die horribly and quit the game in disgust but be loading the game back up and joining another game within 10 minutes.Sure there are some bugs at the moment but nothing that stops the game being fun overall. Just don't take levelling up and ranking too seriously and the fun will remain. Coming back to the game after not playing for about a year it has been expanded greatly. I feel like there are a lack of places to hide in the indoor maps as there is no foliage to hide in and no option to hide in items like boxes etc.The game still feels overly complex with the myriad of new mechanics perks and items. especially with the DLC killers.

2016-07-11,0,0,45,False,Recommended,"If you're even tempted to buy this game do it! Been playing it for about 2 weeks now and I'm loving it. This game will seriously make you feel like you're trying to survive in a horror movie so if you're a horror fan check it out. It definitely requires a little bit of strategy but once you play a few rounds you'll get the hang of it. I was a little worried about it getting repetetive but after 32 hours it hasn't yet. They're also going to keep adding to it with new survivors killers perks and maps. Pros Fun intense gameplay Makes you feel like you're in a horror movie inexspensive Great matchmaking generally does a great job of pairing you with similar level players. Cons Can be frustrating especially when you have teamates that aren't helpful. There are two leveling systems Levels and ranks. Ranks matter more but can be frustrating as you have to win multiple games in a row to rank up and you lose part of a rank when you lose. Depending on how good you are it can take a while. Some of the player base can be ""elitests"" but not overwhelmingly so.

2016-07-12,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,I want to start by saying that I do have fun with this game and some times it's the same way that some people have fun by putting needles into their private parts.There is so much that is good about this game and in the same breath i have to also say that there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed.1. THERE IS NO CONTROL REBINDING! that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls. Really?2. The Infinate vault hopping thing. there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window. 3. Perk Ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby. how many times i have come across a high lvl Meg with Adrenaline seriously that perk is so OP it is not funny full heal and run speed +150% at it's best it will full heal from dying state... are you serious? AND after she gets to lvl 30 she can teach it to other survivors.On the flip side lets look at a few killer perks Insidious for example after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect or no heart beat to hear untill you move or act again.Dearstalker the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance awayAnd Iron Grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them.These are in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have.If you are going to buy this game be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game. Ther is serious Potential in this game and i want to see it brought into being and that is why i bought it...

2016-06-28,0,0,22,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is overall a fun game. However needs quite a lot of work and balancing to become a great game. No party system makes it hard for people with only 1 2 freinds. The ranking system is some what broken. In the sense that is very hard to rank up. Now the worst part is some of the exploits that the survivors can use to make it impossible for the killer to get them. From vaulting over 2 ledges that are right next to each other to running around a truck endlessly to avoid the killer. It can make the game infinitely more frustrating to play. In conlusion Dead By Daylight needs work. It's a fun game but it might've needed a little more time before it's release. Hopefully the devolpers can fix these issues within the game. 6/10. Worth a buy if you have a group of freinds to play with.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-09,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,Don't bother even if it's on sale.The devs are ether too stupid to figure out haw to balance that game or just don't care. Everytime a new killer is released it's a broken mess and a poor attempt at fixing something instead of addressing the actual problem. The community itseft consists of ether griefers or morons with maybe a handful of decent teammates. There are no dedicated servers so you'll be playing with lag most of the time. The gameply itself isn't very good ether once you realize what a chore everything in the game is. Doing generators is nothing more than a boring quick time event. Chasing survivors amounts to being endlessly looping the same obsticle while every generator gets done and even if you do catch the survivor they ether get saved by a flashlight of use a perk to escape making the whole thing pointless.The only way I could recommend this game is if you like feeling like the other side is overpowered no matter which side you're on.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-01,0,0,64,False,Recommended,Great game so far. the gameplay whilst a bit repetitive at times (due to the lack of maps and game modes) always manages to feel tense. At one point i thought i had conquered my fears only to join a game and start screaming the second the killer came around a corner. The game seems fairly well balanced never seems like one side is at a massive advantage. The one glaringly obvious flaw this game has is its lobbying system there is no way to join with friends although the developers have said they intend to fix this. it's levelling system is also a bit odd no upgrades feel like they do much so progression is sort of pushed to the side. EDIT the fixes have come for the lobbying system this means playing with friends is easier.TLDR Good game would recommend if you're into scary adventures obviously better with friends.,Dead by Daylight

Killing your friends while you're all in voice chat is glorious fun. I'm looking forward to the Survive With Friends option so we can play together even if we don't have a full 5 people available (and still hopefully earn blood points).

2016-07-23,0,0,1035,False,Recommended,Honestly I enjoy this game BUT (yes there is always a but) there are a lot of things that need to be improved on. The killers are kinda OP. I'm not saying that because WAH WAH WAH /insert tantrum I get killed. I'll accept my death like I should but there are times where it just seems impossible to even get away from the killer. The whole party system needs some help too. I shouldn't have to click ready constantly while trying to get into a lobby with a friend. The killers shouldn't be allowed to see the victims ranks. It gives them the chance to back out and then we are back to playing the ready simulator all over again. If we can't see the killers rank they shouldn't get to see ours. Why should they have a hand up on deciding if they want to play with us or not when we can't make the same judgment based off the killers rank/level?,Dead by Daylight

It only hinders the ability to hear footsteps groans vaults failed healing skill checks closet doors being shut Wraith snarling and basicly any other sound that's supposed to help give away the Killer/Survivors position. Need an incentive to continue playing after going from 4v1 to a 1v1 when 3 4 generators still need to be fixed. You get zero bonuses for solo fixing 3+ generators and living. Not really worth the time and effort to continue. The toolbox needs to last longer. It's virtually useless when 3 4 hooks are a stones throw away from each other. There are a few perks that don't seem very helpful or at least that I haven't noticed them be helpful. Someone explain to me when the Wraith unlocked the ability to attack you while retaining invisibility.

You always feel that the killer is looking at you or is standing behind you!Playing as a Killer is also great fun as you can scare the **** out of survivors.What I dislike about the game are the perks they seem to be a little confusing.Furthermore many survivors who are trying to rank up quickly dc if they know that they are going to lose causing them to lose no xp. However if you do not care about ranks that should hardly ever happen.Overall a game worth the money!,Dead by Daylight

Easily within my top ten favorite games to play with friendsAmazing gameplayAmazing mapsCreative perksVery good online playFun to play as both killer and survivorCons While the game is balanced for the most part it can be a nightmare to play with the killer being completley overpowered and unbalanced or a perk the surviors/killer has that makes everything impossible. For example there is a perk that makes every generator not work unless you cleanse an impossible to find token.There is no penalty or prevention of campingThree placements on the hook means your dead. So if youre getting camped and someone tries to save you you can immidiately be put back on the hook and killed.No explanation for how the killer you are facing works.

2018-06-08,0,0,88,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. TL DR it's worth buying given the latest update and with the next update in line as long as earning characters isn't too dificult and hopefully they slow down gens a little bit.Since the time of my original review several much needed changes have been made and there are current y quite a few very important changes in the works for the next patch. Because of this I've changed my mind about the game.At the current point in time I would say that this game is worth the purchase. Vacuuming has been fixed a new quality killer has been added many of the survivor perks I previously took issue with are being reworked the lowest quality killers in the game are being reworked to make them more viable several killer perks are getting much needed reworks and all of the non licensed DLC has been made available through gameplay. Because of the combination of all these things I believe the game is worth buying now more than ever.I do still have some issues however. Generators are still completed far too quickly especially with a toolbox and even more so with the ""brand new parts"" add on and the cost of buying characters using iridescent shards is very high with a seemingly low rate of earning. With the update that made characters available via gameplay they modified iridescent shards and how they're earned. Now you earn shards by leveling up your profile which is done by simply playing the game. But int the beginning you earn very little with each level only ten per level up to level ten which is how much you used to earn from each match. From there it goes up to 195 at level 16 which sounds good in theory but I don't know how much more it'll increase later and I don't yet know if later levels require more exp. Level 15 and 16 both require 2 700. If they do have higher requirements the increase may be inadequate.Each killer in the game costs 9000 shards. That means it may take many hours to earn a single character but hopefully the shard gains will steadily increase and make it fair later on since gaining a new character will dramatically change the game experience for both parties adding to the variation and replayability of the game. Making it hard to get these characters without paying for them would mean that most people would play to the point of near boredom before they get a chance to do something new simply because they can't or don't want to spend extra money. But even so this is a step in the right direction for the consumer and I applaud them for making these changes.",Dead by Daylight

On release and to this date wich is 3 weeks after release It is still impossible to play this game with your friends (other then private games wich don't give you any credits to upgrade your characters). Yet they were selling a 4 pack edition of a game that matches you with random people? After release people were complaining about the unability to queue up with friends and play but they said they were too busy going to E3 to patch it? I feel like the devs are laughing at my face releasing this game with such little content. Few maps no customization broken ranking system unable to play with friends and unbalanced.

She can blink over walls this for great distance up to 3 4 blink almost impossible to juke unless the nurse jukes herself. this killer was made against the fundamentals of the game wich is hiding and running away to ""safety"" where there are pallets. Plus this patch they released a game breaking bug wich makes the killers attack with aimbot so they can never miss and have litteraly twice the attack range if not more.

Just question what was the idea of the doctor? someone that removes all ability check potentional is a bit too much of a challenge due to the consistant way anyone can win is a hatch game thus leading to the ignoring of team play (fixing genorators and saving teammates) and this is in specificity for low lvl players (10.1 hours logged into game at point of review) at higher lvls this probably is not as much of an issue but possible fix could be lvl based matched making heavier on the doctor in relations to low lvl players.

2017-04-09,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,Without a doubt when this game came out it was so fun but after all the updates and patches came out the killer is so overpowered and beyond effortless it is idiotic. I can play killer hook one person and still have over 10k. easy blood points. but on the reverse playing survivors is basically a beat down and punishment then if you want to survive with your friends its a 14 hr wait for a queue with more than 2 people. And each time I hear about a patch it just makes the killers so much more at an advantage. I really wish you could be challanged as a killer. Survivors are at such a disadvantage that if the killer can simply watch the victim its an effortless down and Iron grasp is basically a free hook. With tier 2 or better you can take a person to the basement from accross the map. And if the hooks regen then there is no effective counter to it. I hope that one day the developers pull their heads out of their asses and figure out this game is totally onesided.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,118,False,Recommended,"Edit Wow blown away by the way the devs turned this game around. 2 years later I've picked the game back up after the whole F13 debacle and man this game is actually enjoyable now. My biggest gripe is not having perks compared to others and having to grind everything out but it's not that bad. Overall fun game for what it is.(original review from release)It's really a neat idea but sadly this game falls short of what it's aiming for. The game is about teamwork yet it has no way to matchmake with friends and no form of communication which really goes against the whole formula of 4v1. Even a pre set text wheel of things like ""area clear"" or ""killer nearby"" would mend this. Performance wise the game is subpar. Looks decent considering its UE4 but with no options other than ""quality"" (which is only low med high ultra) and a resolution slider. Going from a solid 60 fps at med then switching to high causes 20 35 fps is really annoying. Devs have no excuse for a lack of graphic settings in the year 2016.Most matches as survivor aren't very fun against a decent killer because its impossible to tell what is going on with your team if they arent in your line of sight. Levels are auto generated which I think is an issue because of the killer's much faster move speed which allows him to quickly get a layout of the map with nothing to deter him while survivors have to slowly pace around to avoid being spotted. In most of my matches I played I managed to get 2 3 generators up alone and would stop to help a team mate off a hook or heal them only to have them follow me and lead the killer to my hiding spot or get knocked right back down etc. Lack of communication is an awful idea.Playing as the killer is fun because it's fun to win multiplayer games. If you have a slight idea of the way the game plays you'll have a good time regardless. Balance wise I the whole 1 hit down mechanic of the Hillbilly is annoying when your team runs into you and stops you mid sprint or something. Wraith has the power to go invisible which imo in a game with 0 communication is too strong without it having a lot a negatives which it does not.The item/perk system is set up around whoever has played longer gets an advantage which isnt all a fun time for new players considering the killer is a one man team and has an advantage if one surivor is lacking items or perks. I played the beta a decent amount but still the game needs some major patches and after that I'll consider checking it out again. As someone who loved Evolve and was hoping to find a new home I'm sad to say this game is going to be my first refund.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-22,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,First time ever asking for a refund. The game looked like it was going to be awesome but what a let down. When you're a lvl 1 killer going up against a fully stacked lvled group of survivors with all super rare perks good luck. As the survivor its not so bad but I would like to kill people as well. As the killer you will spend most of your time playing ring around the rosey as they hop through the same 2 windows or fences. While you do this the others are turning on the generators and escaping. If you leave the game of ring around the rosey then they will just turn on the generator you left them by. Once you know the general lay out of the map its pretty hard to get killed as a survivor plus the added perks later on make you pretty untrackable or being able to be snuck up on. I get the survivors need to be quicker than the killer but to be able to just hop over the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over... get my point. I can see how this game would be fun in a lan type setting or with a group of friends over vent or something but as of right now not so much.

2016-06-22,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,At first this game was fun. Getting found by a killer was horrifying and an adrenaline rush but now its just a nuisance. Killers seem to move must faster now than a few days ago. Ive read alot about hacked/cheating players....make sense now. Queue system is GARBAGE! It takes about 10 minutes for each round that my friend and I want to join a match together. Cant imagine trying to do it with 2 other friends as well. Playing as a killer can be just as frustrating. Players seem invisible and the scratch marks on the ground that are supposed to help do nothing to help. When you do catch someone they are able to wiggle away in less than 5 seconds.

The game is a total blast I had tons of fun playing by myself. HOWEVER the biggest gripe I have with this game like everyone else is that there is no party system whatsoever. Do not go into this game expecting to play with your friends unless you have enough to play on your own private server. The monsters/bad guys/hunters are very creative and look creepy the game seems pretty damn well balanced and is a joy to play. I'm recommending this because of how fun it is and no doubt that there will soon be a party system implemented into the game.

2016-06-23,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,Entertaining gameplay however there are some major flaws.1) you can't play with your friends unless you have a full 5. This sucks because its rough to get 5 people together. It also means poeple are constantly leaving and joining lobbies to try and find their friends. Making the wait even longer.2) There is no ranking system. So the rank one players just ruin the experience for killers.3) It's plagued by a series of glitches. The somewhat clunky gameplay plus loading and joining glitches really just makes trying to get into a game an unpleasant experience.4) This one is more personal preference but I think having a random number generator in the core mechanics really ruins the game. It takes away a huge amount of skill. Sometimes players can get insanely good perk drops that can seriosuly make the game impossibgle for the opposition.All up its a really fun game but it needs some serious work before its worth $21.,Dead by Daylight

But I've played it nonstop and no matter what changes are made the toxicness of some of the players i still manage to have a great time. My wife and son play it with me and we always have a great time together. People complain about nerfs and buffs to the survivors or the killer but the game is always changing and you need to adapt. For the price i paid for it i completely under estimated how much long lasting gameplay i would get. Bang Fo Yo buck ya'll.Definitely deserves an award.,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-11,0,0,144,False,Recommended,For 20$ I can honestly tell you this game will be entertaining. When you get tired of playing killer you just switch roles and fight from the other side. Because of the matchmaking you will have to level up to 15 for the two perk slots or have great luck with getting solid perks in the first few levels. After that the game opens back up to skill vs skill...Unless someone is abusing infinite windows harvester fast locker switches....With the devs releasing updates occasionally I dont see this game leaving my desktop soon.,Dead by Daylight

Cough*AngryPug*...People who are losing often DC ( the devs have addressed this to an extent)Most will say killers are op Yet they are destoryed in Higher rank. Most will say DLC killers op...

Update 10/16/17So in Sep of this year maybe a week or so after i posted my review lol my save file was reset. My biggest problem is the dev have done nothing to help I have provided Steam ID Screenshots even video of my account atleast 5 emails to them with only an auto reply from zendesk. Still my account has not been fixed. I love this game but man... I feel really left out in the dark in this situation and Its frustrating cause there is really your able to do no contacts no replys. T.TCan't recommend this game til its fixed this issue. Update oct 30th 2017 was finally contacted saying I will get a bunch of bloodpoints not yet active but good news it seems.UPDATE02/16/18Ya so patch 1.9.2 ruined the game Broke the game on both sides flashlights are now skill less to preform broke the nurse more and then on the surivor side they ruined the heartbeat random heartbeats make no sense i watched the killer across the map yet felt the heart be has if he was right be hind me. Said they fix pallets... no fake nerf. Cool lunar event... wish it was way more fun then it is now because of all the patch updates not the event it self. Since I have had some of the worst games I have ever played. I currently will no longer recommend the game at this point. I currently hate the dev for the game atm and fully believe they running the game to the ground. 2018 June update lol you devs July updateI can no longer lie to my self I love this stupied ing game.

2017-01-21,0,0,1225,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game in its earlier days (December 2016). Originally Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical killer game where a killer is chasing you until you'll die. The survivors have to repair at most 5 generators then they re able to escape. While repairing gens a killer is hunting you thought the entire map. When all gens have been repaired you can escape thought the exit doors. It s simple or?Yes it is but When I started playing as a survivor in December 2016 I thought this game is amazing but after a few months the game gets I don t know how I should say weirder crazier xD.When I was in the higher ranks the killers started camping and tunnelling. I recognized that the community is filled with s survivors AND killers. When you re playing Dead by Daylight it doesn t matter how you ll play well or badly. There might be a person who is playing as good as a pro and he lets you know how to play. The community is the first problem. Killers are crying because of decisive strike (a perk where you can escape from the killer s grasp) but you can counter this perk in 6 different ways Wtf and the whole killer community of this game is crying because of ONE ING PERK? The second problem are the developers. I understand that perks and the game have to be balanced but The game was balanced when the doctor was released. Then the development of the game decreased. The developers are just reinforcing the killers and the survivors gets weaker and weaker and weaker. It s possible to influence the survivors internet when lag switching as killer to get an advantage. Servers might be a solution! The third problem are the community managers and the balancing/performance of this game. The community managers do NOT think about your problems. If you have one hahahaha You ll still have it because no one will help you. (Dead by Daylight had a bug where you lost all your advance and WHEN but just WHEN they were helping you you had to wait at least 5 months.) The balancing IS a big problem. I said in a sentence before that killers are able to influence your internet and I think it s an absurdity in a game. While chasing it s not as impossible as you may think but sometimes you re sticking into a tree or in the grass. A new bug is that you can t move when the game begins so you have to disconnect and you get punished for it. Story of today I had a killer with 800+ hours in the game and he was hacking (speed hack) and a friend got banned because he left more than 20 times because of face camping killers Is just amazing how the developers are impressing me.You might heard about the new shop Just look in It s just unbelievable. I did the mistake and I bought outfits there for at least 35 (don t know the US/GB prices) and it was just a mistake. I spend 35 in 8 clothes and I can t put them on in real life (To sum up I can say Dead by Daylight is funny to play with friends and when you have aggressions it s a playground for you &gt I won t stop playing yet but when I ve found another game bb and gg Dead by Daylight.,Dead by Daylight

2017-11-25,0,0,89,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a competative online multiplayer game the unique scenario a slasher/horror type plot where you can play as either the survivors or the killer.The developers are very proactive with updates responding to both balancing issues and bug fixes. Games like this tend to lack re playability (as there are no variation in game modes) however the competative nature of this game creates and the large playerbase allows for plenty of variation for more than a few hours of entertainment. The real fun in this game is the suspense (as with a slasher/horror flick) which is largely reliant on how willing the killer is in indulging the survivors in a game of cat and mouse.Outside of the playing cometitively online there is also the option to play with your friends in closed matches (which can also be very fun).,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-04,0,0,115,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a very very awesome game however it does have a lot of ups and downs.If you get frustrated VERY easily and are a really REALLY bad loser you'll hate this game very quick I'll list the reasons why.(Some things I will mention might spoil the way to play so BEWARE alright?)PROS AMAZING movement! The moving of camera is really good and you can easilly find your way around Amazingly different perks for each character you choose to play as You can be a full 'team and heal' player or the more 'I'll help but I'll leave quick too' player It's super intense when the killer is after you and when you stun them you feel downright AWESOME When you get a really good killer they are the ing best praise the outta them It's really nice to play with your soul mate(lover or whatever u like to call IT) hell ing yes it's the BEST team The graphics are AMAZING the characters are creative that being both killers and survivers Some glitches but they are pretty darn funny when you find them Every map is in 'the same area' depending on what map it is but is totally different so you can always end up surprisedCONS Toxic cummunity Killer's that wont play by the rules camp you so that other people can't get near you and then you DIE If a killer camps you and you call them out for it they'll be so rude you wish you stayed in your mom's womb More toxic community 'cause damn it is TOXIC Really the REAL 'killer' of this game(see what I did there?) is the community they will come and on you so seriously bewareThe game is cool though and with really good friends it can be a wonder to play. If you have never played it before I SERIOUSLY recommend playing with your friends through 'training' rounds it's an option where you 'can kill your friends'. It's sickly good for practice and better than just jumping right into the game and ending up getting a killer or two survivors who lost connection to the server.AT LAST A word of advice IF you are dealing with a camper killer signal the other's by waving your arms(attempt to escape but don't go through with it) to tell them to stay away or tell them before the game starts that if a killer camps you they should just work on the generators because the killer is losing a sick amount of precious time guarding your hanging dying body.Oh and lastly The Doctor sucks the Doctor.,Dead by Daylight

2017-04-01,0,0,239,False,Recommended,This game is a good game from my experience starting from 2016.I will tell you all how this game works.This game is a Multi player game co op. You can play as Killer SurvivorAs killer you should kill 4 people that they are repairing generators and trying to escape you as killer you need to prevent them from escaping and place them in the hook 3 times to die. As SurvIvor you need to repair 5 Generators if you have 3 more team mates if someone disconnect in the loading screen you all will be 3 and you need to repair 4 generators.You can escape trought Hatch GateThe hatch will be open only if you all repair at least 2 to 3 generators and everyone dies you will be the last one and the hatch is a little door in the ground.You will not have all the killer's and survivors you need to purchase their Dlc.You will get the killer and the survivor for purchasing a dlc.The dlc's could be even Characters even cosmetics.There are a lot of things in that game but I am not explaining everything about it.

2016-09-13,0,0,2,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight... A brilliantly designed game by Behaviour Digital Inc. The graphics are good a bit dark at some points but an overall beautiful game. The game itself has 4 players and many characters to choose from to play as. Their goal is to escape from the killer. The killer can choose from 4 different killers which all have a unique perk that will allow them to kill faster and/or easier. When you activate a generator it notifies the killer where you are making your adrenaline rush your heart beat faster until he gets in view. You cannot outrun the killer your only choice is to jump through windows knock over boards or to hide if he looses sight of you for a minute. If all the players but 1 die a secret hatch will unlock better find it before the killer if he does you cannot escape unless you open the doors while he guards the hatch and when he sees you trying to go for the door you can run around him and go to the hatch. A few minor glitches here and there also balancing levels is not the best but this game has true potential in the future. I am excited to see what they have in store for their next big update/DLC. The Last Breath Chapter captured an ayslum feel a nurse who can ""blink"" to kill you and a new survivor was added. A new map was also added even though I have never played on it due to random maps and usually getting the same two I have seen what it looks like and its a thrill!",Dead by Daylight
2016-09-13,0,0,31,False,Recommended,"With the premise that I do not like leaving reviews of a game I've only played barely 10 hours I consider this a fantastic game when it comes to mechanics but it has so many flaws like everything after all.Of those barely 10 hours the vast majority has been spent pressing ""JOIN A LOBBY"" and shortly after having to press it again and again and once again. This game needs some serious attention to its lobby system and how players create/join lobbies because as of now it kind of ruins the player experience especially as a casual player who just wants to pop in for a couple of hours and actually play for at least one and half hour of those.Other than that I like the artistic concept... but boy are they heavy. I run the game at max resolution and high settings on a 4K screen and a solid frame rate. Yet the 3D graphics look quite poor.Moving onto the sound and music. Spot. On. Everything feels immersive and suspensful. I got used to the Wraith's jump scares ok little note just a second why on Earth would you even consider giving stealth to a killer in a game like Dead by Daylight is far beyond my comprehension.. like isn't the game scary enough? It sure is for me! and still everytime I hear that heartbeat or even that warning for skill checks while repairing a generator I swallow a little piece of my heart.I'm looking forward to seeing how the game development progresses especially with new characters killers and possibly game modes. As of now I'd recommend the game 110%.",Dead by Daylight

2016-08-06,0,0,327,False,Recommended,A fun game that you will find wastes a few hours of your day. The gameplay is fun if not slightly repetitive from both killer/survivor. High replayability given it's competitive multiplayer. However both survivor and killer can be frustrating to play. This is *for the most part* because of a mix of bugs/exploits (see the pages of random reports on the community discussions page for specifics) that can ruin a game often enough to be annoying. The reason this does not make this review negative is because I find the game fun to play! The devs are hardworking and listen to their community and are actively fixing the game's problems. When the game works right it works extremely well. When it doesn't it's either very frustrating or very humorous. So if you enjoy 4v1 multiplayer within a horror environment and are willing to support the devs through a somewhat rocky launch by all means pick this game up and join the mass murdering fun! Many people are posting negative reveiws about this game because of numerous nitpicky complaints that really don't affect gameplay often enough to ruin the experience. As an example at the very beginning of the game's launch many people posted negatives because friend to friend multiplayer wasn't exsistent. This was a bad move by the devs but it was deliberate. It was deliberate because it would shift the balance of the game towards the well coordinated teams. Though the devs openly said this the community didn't care. So it was implemented early with barebones funcionality because of the community's impatience. Now what do the reviews say? That it's broken and makes it too hard for killers to play. See a problem there? Again I will repeat if you like this genre of game and are even slightly interested and don't mind the once in a while bug that are indeed being fixed as this review is being written don't be turned away by some of the whiny negatives this game is worth it!,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a 1 v 4 game with 4 survivors trying to outlast one killer. The survivor's goals are to start up the generators and get the escape door open all while having to outrun the killer and save their teamates from death. The killer's goals are to catch as many survivors as they can and stop them from escaping the compound. It's essentially a cat and mouse game chasing each other and running from each other. What makes the game fun is the suspense built in. It's not like any other horror game that tries to fill the scary aspects with jumpscares. When you hear the heartbeats getting faster but you can't see where the killer is it really does turn into a scary game.I loved the beta and I love the full game even more. There's a decent amount of content from types of survivors killers items perks maps and the large amount of skill building built into the game. If you want a game that includes suspense and fear while also being a challenging game with lots of content to explore I would definitely reccomend Dead by Daylight.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-17,0,0,51,False,Recommended,This is a very well made game. Though it has in its earliest stage lots of glitches and bugs. This is forgivable only because it came out a few days ago. I feel like the killer the Wraith is overpowered because it can move so fast and the only things that give it away is the very hard to see patches of body and weird grunting it makes. I don't like the fact the add ons only last for one round i think they should last at least 2 or maybe more rounds. Other than that the game is pretty good. The character progression is great and the gameplay is mostly smooth. I would recommend this game to more advanced player who can easily make it over the learning curve that comes with this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-30,0,0,563,False,Recommended,I'm redoing my review for DbD considering that it has seen a lot of changes since I last reviewed the game. (My review was more of a first impressions after 20 hours of gameplay kind of deal) So overall I'm very happy to say that those changes have been positive for the game. While the game is still rough on newcomers it is significantly less so especially from the killer PoV. The devs even included tutorials on how to play survivor and kiiller which is a great touch. (It's free BP to do them even for veteran players)So my intial review touched on the hatch game and that was one of the only things from my list of complaints that hasn't changed. I have however grown lukewarm to the idea of the hatch. It doesn't really...bother me like it did when I first started and I think that has more to do with the fact that I don't care if I 4k or not as killer. This game does that to you with enough experience. At some point I just take victories as me pipping and even will farm with the survivors and let them get the hatch if I'm feeling nice.In regards to the matchmaker...that is also still bad in a way because of rank reset and I can see people complaining about rank 1 survivors/killers bullying new rank 20's. However I have heard that they are fixing this soon by limiting the rank you can be reset to so rank 20 players will never see rank 1's anymore unless they buy the game on a separate account.The pallet vacuum was also removed not too long ago which really increased the skill level required to play survivor and really helped out the killer side to not be a frustrating mess to play. I can't commend the devs enough for this change. I know I may be a little biased because I'm a killer main but I do like things hard on me as a survivor. You're probably noticing a pattern by now the devs seem to be really looking into this game's issues and listening to the community.Really the only broken things left in this game are honestly just DS and NOED which is incredible considering how many balance issues this game had a year ago when I intially made this review. The Nurse is also broken when played right let's be honest but she also demands a high skill and memory to play her to her max potential so I think it's alright she remains the way she is. It was one of the complaints I had with this game the killers *should* be scary...and the Nurse at least accomplishes that.So all in all I recommend this game to any survival horror fans or just anybody who loves slasher movies in general. It's a steal at the current price considering how fast you can be addicted to this game and pour tons of hours into it. This game thankfully has a high skill cap that is always rising but is also somewhat casual at the same time for beginners to intitially get into. There is some frustration to be had left in this game but from what I can tell the devs have been hard at work on fixing this games many problems so those last few frustrations may finally meet their end. To that I say cheers!,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-19,0,0,103,False,Not Recommended,The game used to be a lot of fun however since i got back into the game it is clear that the game is far too easy for the killers. the survivors can do almost nothing against certain killers that can down you in one hit and they also have perks that make it far to easy find you. not to mention leveling up a survier is much harder since they barely get any points as compaired to the killer. over all dont waste your time if you want to be a survior.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-11,0,0,990,False,Recommended,This game is great. It's scary competetive makes you anxious but also exciting to run and hide. Tons of killers and survivors but you gotta pay for a lot of DLC atleast you get all the maps and starter characters for free. Playing as the killer is pretty fun and always a challenge to catch the survivors if they play well so its not just a blow out. Overall the balance of perks items and killer abilities is done very well and its always nice to come back to this game.If I had to say a con it would be that theres no voice chat. It feels weird to play multiplayer and not be able to voice chat to your teammates and stuff. It adds to the tension atleast and you can use discord with your friends or whatever still so not a huge deal but I wish they would add it in.,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-26,0,0,193,False,Recommended,It is a fun game. There are a variety of tricks you can use to survive longer as a survivor and as a killer it can be very fun to hunt down and get into the mind of a survivor to predict what they'll do next. Sometimes the fun of playing hide and seek with slasher villains can get bogged down by the mechanics of the game but each game is different from the last and the game is incredibly replayable. The game can be a blast to play with friends especially in the fully custom games where your friend is the killer.,Dead by Daylight

I've mained survivor for 500 hours for the past year and a half. And more recely have been maining killer for the latter 300 hours. I've been playing dbd for nearly two years now. And my relationship with the game has been an up and down roller coaster. The devs work hard to make new content and please everyone but the fact is that it's impossible. Bewarned the dbd community is pretty toxic which is one con I have with the game. People like to degrade others in post and pre game chat to boost their own egos from a loss or their current negative mood.There are a lot of bugs and balance (b/w killer and survivor) issues with the game. I even lost my save file because of the bug and lost my legacy skins and rare items. But despite this I keep coming back to this game. This game can be quite addicting while being very repetitive. The devs try to fix their problems by releasing killers that hot patch the problem but neglect the other killers that run into the same probelm as well. This has been a theme of the dbd devs. Can't hit 360s? Leatherface.Gens going too fast? Ruin.Gens still going too fast? Make bnp have skill checks instead.Gens STILL going too fast? The Pig. Don't get me wrong. The devs work extremely hard on their game but their solution to fixing the balance of the game is not well thought out and any fixes to the bugs or exploits can be slow at times.

This happened for weeks until we just stopped.

I write this review to prevent new players from buying it right now and getting disappointed by this great game.The game itself I really love the concept and how the game is made.Once in a while I start playing the game and after about 30 hours I leave it for a month or 2 and come back at it again. Well when the last DLC and big update 2.0.0 came out I really wanted to start playing. And here comes the part why I'm really not recommending the game in the state it's in now. Since the last update the game has a very annoying bug which causes major FPS drops and a very laggy experience. Which for me makes this game pretty much unplayable.

2016-08-18,0,0,117,False,Recommended,Played this game since it first came out. Liked the game more when it first came out as it was mainly hide and seek with a killer. Now it's more like an objective rushing game.It's great fun for groups of friends playing together however playing with friends disadvantages the killer. If you play killer with a controller you will also be at a disadvantage because the mouse people can turn on a dime.The gameplay feels the same everygame. One of the best strats while playing survivor is to loop around pallets until you need them. The gameplay at that point for the killer and survivor is nothing more than looping. It should be called a circle running simulator and is as tiring as running circles in real life. The toxic people have lessened quite a bit but I wouldn't recommend this to children or sensitive people. It's worth buying on sale.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-16,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is pretty wonderful . I love the asymmetric 4v1 game that they have created. If I were basing this review on the gameplay review I would definitely recommend this game. There is something that will stand in your way when you're trying to play it though and that is the matchmaking. As of right now there isn't really a group matchmaking feature when you want to play a survivor. Even if you aren't trying to group with friends this feature not existing will still affect you. People will be constantly joining and leaving your lobby in order to find the game that their friend or friends are in. This means if you queue as a killer you could spend maybe even 20 minutes like I currently am between games waiting for 4 survivors to ready up in your lobby. Conceptually I underdstand why they didn't add group queue. I believe they wanted to add this atmospheric horror element of being alone. The issue is it heavily affects gameplay because there is a good chance you won't even be able to play unless you have all the time in the world to just sit there and wait.Update I sat in a lobby as a killer waiting as I wrote this review and it's been over 30 minutes and have had hundreds of people join and leave my lobby. If they don't fix this feature this game will not last.,Dead by Daylight

This game has put Behaviour and Starbreeze on my ""watch out"" list.That being said the game at its core is crazy good. But between the bugs and other players DC ing I just can't do it anymore. If only they didn't rush it out and fixed all the major bugs first this game would be a GotY contender. By my reckoning we'll be well into 2017 before they get through fixing most of the issues.

The game itself is a blast to play. There is some fantastic original content and every game can be different.Unfortunately the developers show a complete disregard for their community show biased behavior towards huge partnered streamers (because they don't have a marketing dept. so they rely on Twitch) and have had game breaking bugs since release (at this time of writing about 7 months) that have YET to be fixed. I haven't ever experienced a patch of this game that has completely working matchmaking and it's a multiplayer only game.In conclusion a great idea with some fantastic original content and ideas.

2016-07-02,0,0,122,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight Four survivors try and activate 5 generators scattered across a level in order to restore the power to the exit gates. All the while they are being hunted by one of three killers who have to incapacitate and place survivors on sacrificial hooks scattered about the level. Survivors view in 3rd person and detect the killer based on vicinity. Killers view in 1st person and detect survivors based on direct line of sight within a certain distance straight ahead. Survivors running is slightly slower than the Killer's base speed. When a survivor is hit they get an initial adrenaline burst of speed. Survivors are typically running walking or crouching about bushes and trees. Killers dash around the map patrolling generators. Survivors being chased can use the environment to escape their hunter. Such options are knocking debris behind them forcing the killer to either go around get hit and stunned or break the obstacle jumping through windows (which can be done quietly if you aren't sprinting) and hiding inside closets (crows appear atop the closet if you stay too long). Certain actions are loud and alert the killer to where they occured. There are a few spots where the killer has no hope of getting you but it is balanced in that you aren't being productive while being a troll so it's fine. This game has ridiculous strategy involved. You need to change your playstyle depending on who is hunting you or who you are playing as. The Wraith has a bell that he rings to turn invisible though it takes time. The Hillbilly has a chainsaw that when charged allows him to dash at an incredible speed until he hits something. THe trapper uses bear traps around the map. There are a few items survivors can equip before games to change the way they play. Someone with a medkit may stop repairing a generator and prioritize healing themself or others. The flashlight may make you more likely to act heroically as if the killer is carrying someone and is blinded by light the killer will be stunned and drop his victim. The map sucks. The toolbox is amazing but rare. It lets you either repair generators faster or dismantle two or three hooks. The skeleton key allows you to escape a bit earlier through the hatch. The hatch is an alternative escape option made available once there are two or less generators and you're the last alive. It is difficult to find but once in vicinity you'll hear an obvious sound. Buy this game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-02,0,0,110,False,Recommended,i love this game since it came out i just love playing as a survivor or a killer it doesnt really matter BUT can you please fix the matchmaking. When i am rank 18 and not a great killer why am i put in a game with a hole survivor team (with only purple stuff AND flashlight with pink accesories) in which the worth is rank 16 and the best rank 11 ? This is really destroying the pleasure i get from just playing the game. And why dlc of your own design (and not under licenses like Halloween or Saw) are now purchasable and not free since the huntress ? We already bought a game and now we must pay to access its full content and you are making correction of the meta trough the dlc with the new perks counter meta ? Is that supposed to mean we have to pay to stop getting hammered against strong killers or survivors ? Well if its indeed what it is supposed to mean its really sad. I belive this game can't be perferct and have a perfect balanced gameplay because on side will always be better than the other but killers are not fun to play anymore its more frustating than anything. I just would like to understand the direction the game is aiming to but its pretty much obvious with the new shop system... Money is more important than the amusement of players nowadays only numbers really counts.By the way why ochido can still play this game after getting ban ?

2016-08-21,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"ORIGINAL POST FROM AUGUST 21 2016. UPDATED INFO BELOW.A really solid premise bogged down by horrible matchmaking and lack of basic features. First and foremost there's no real way to communicate with your teammates even when they're right next to you. I understand the idea of it being a horror scenario but seriously if I was in the woods with three others and there was a psychopath chasing us I'd sure as hell tell them ""DON'T GO THAT WAY"" if I'd just escaped from them. There's no real way that I've seen to play with your friends either against others the ""Survive with Friends"" button on the menu seems bugged either that or it simply wasn't setting up parties right because nobody could join any games I was in due to ""failure to connect"" issues. On top of that from what I understand even if you CAN get it to work playing with friends immediately negates your ability to earn any kind of experience. That part is not from experience but if its true that's just all the more disappointing. However you can always just join random public lobbies right?More than anything that can ruin any multiplayer game is poor sportsmanship. As a killer you should have the same courtesy as in any other multiplayer game and refrain from camping your target. In this game this manifests as if the killer catches you and puts you on a hook to be sacrificed they can and often do simply sit there and watch you die. The killer is invincible so there's nothing you or your team can do to stop them. Even if you manage to free yourself (good luck) one good smack before you fully recover your controls and you're on the floor and back on the hook now unable to free yourself as you're in struggle mode. Play as the killer and try to be a good sport by not camping? If you then fail to kill everyone prepare to be mocked mercilessly post game as trash and noobish for letting people get free from the hook. So either ruin the game for somebody potentially as soon as less than a minute into the round if they're extremely unlucky or deal with toxic hateful attitudes. Furthermore matchmaking on its own is literally only there to set up games (if you're willing to wait for the queues) there's certainly no ""matching"" going on. Four new players fresh off the bus at rank 20 getting matched against a rank 8 killer? No thanks.This is a fun enough game but I can only honestly suggest trying it on a free weekend on a good sale (50% off or more) or if you have four buddies to have a good time with. Its a shame cause it really is a fun concept and the couple rounds I had where folks were friendly pre and post game were awesomely tense and very enjoyable. It just has too many flaws with the general community and lack of matchmaking balance.UPDATE 9/24/18 So after convincing some of my friends to try it with me for the F2P week I got to see what two years difference made in development. I have to say I am very very pleased. I'm going to keep my original statements above as a contrast but I can very happily say I can now recommend this game. Here's why I've changed my mind.The number of killers has significantly increased adding a much more varied experience as a survivor and keeping you on your toes as to what you'll deal with next. My personal ""favorite"" is playing against the Pig as she is absolutely terrifying to encounter against a good player. We escaped on my first encounter with her but very narrowly and it was thrilling all the way through.I use ""we"" because this time I was able to play with friends and I'm pleased to say that whatever caused the bug two years ago has been completely resolved. We experienced absolutely no trouble joining up to survive together. Furthermore the ability to communicate and try to coordinate made the game as fun as I'd hoped it could be and then even more. What was originally intended as a quick few rounds to record for my Halloween videos turned into nearly three hours of terror laughter and good ol' spooky fun!Also I was in error originally or maybe it was due to a patch but experience is earned while playing with friends AS LONG as you're all survivors playing against a random killer. You don't earn experience in ""Kill Your Friends"" mode only.The last and most significant detail I've noticed is a remarkably improvement in player behavior and sportsmanship. We still ran into a couple players who were less than sportly but being able to communicate allowed us to punish their camping tactics effectively. Furthermore most post game chat was very friendly and in good spirits which is an incredible departure from my previous experience.Assuming this wasn't just a fluke caused by an influx of super friendly players on the F2P week (which lets be honest how often does that happen in F2P promotions?) then these changes for the better have convinced me this is absolutely a game worth your time. Triple that if you've got some buddies to survive together with. Dig in this October for some good tense spooks!",Dead by Daylight

Then about that time PUBG and some other games got super popular with my friends and I took a break from this game. Decided to come back and 280+ hours later I love the hell out of this game. It's really fun chasing people around and killing them. Also playing mind games with survivors is so great.,Dead by Daylight

I tried to email the comapny to find out why and was informed that there is no control over who is banned in their own game. They hired a third party company to ban people without warning or reason. I emailed the 3rd party company to find out why and they never responded. Thanks for taking my money and shi77ing on my face.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,10,False,Not Recommended,I was surprised that this game was actually good fun.Initial Impressions Played as the killer mostly was loads of fun chasing the poor victims as their hearts start beating Hilarious when you catch one hiding in a closet and you imagine the stress the actual player is going throughMay not have the best graphics but honestlt really enjoyable and great conceptUpdate Several hours into the game Game has some serious imbalance is favour of survivors.Matched up against players way ahead in experience/rank levelsSurvivors Heal self and othersunhook instantly when finally hookedescape when finally caught if a hook is not nearbyTwo final escape routes in completly opposite sides of map making it useless once generators unlockthey are rapid and have a lot of barriers they can usecan hear bell escape and disarm traps chainsaw pretty useless and hard to hit withSorry but the game needs some re balancing asap /,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-19,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,I don't think I've ever asked for a refund for a game and I was really looking forward to this. Not only is it a nightmare to get into a game with a friend either play with friends only in a private match (which means you need at least 5 people that are friends the game for a full match) or the craziest way keep hitting join and hope that you end up in the same lobby (me and my friend tried for half an hour and it never happened. We ended up going on forums to find people to play with. The entire time the game chat doesnt work in the game and steam chat doesnt either because the game takes control of the mike. But all those technical issues aside the gameplay itself just isn't that good. The atmosphere is fantastic and for the most part I think the game looks pretty decent. However after playing two rounds I soon identified that there were dominant strategies when playing as the survivors which you could just pull off over and over again. I first noticed when I was being a spectator after dying (which btw is incredibly boring as you can barely see anything with the way the camera is tilted). I found as a survivor there were dominant strategies that gave them a huge advantage and made it almost impossible for the killer to catch them...which ruined the fun. The fact that you can't actually kill the survivors yourself is a disappointment too. You can't deliver the finishing blow. You knock the player down and drag them to a hook where they stay until their time depletes or another player saves them. The game mode gets quite repetitive very quickly and I only played a handful of rounds. It's a shame. It's a game I really want to like but you spend a frustrating amount of time trying to get the game going and once you finally get to play the buzz is already somewhat gone and the shortcomings of the gameplay just hit you that little harder. I love the Idea I hope they fix the technical issues and tweak some gameplay elements. They've clearly worked hard on this game but I don't think it's fair to have released it in its current state and if feels like far more play testing should have been done so for now I'm out.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-17,0,0,16,False,Recommended,I'm going to start this off with this is my first review. I'm a horror fan movies novels games anyhow you get the jest. I stumbled upon this game while browsing the market place and read about it. Right away I was captivated with the premise of the game. So I did some research watched some gameplay videos online and decide to give it a shot. I came into this game with a open mind and after playing it for over 12 hours I gotta say it's fresh it's addicting and it's a good change of scenery from games I normally play (A lot of FPS) The concept of this game is simple yet fun. It seems to have a small following that continue to support it and I must say I will be one of them. The only thing that bothers me with this game some members of the community. My biggest pet peeve is the players who swarm the hooks right away and you can see them because they clearly suck at stealth. Then they expect you to leave the victim on the meat hook and run away so that they can help them down the second you turn your back. Wrong If I see them lurking and not even bothering to hide I'm going to stay around that area to ensure they don't F### with my sacrifice... then at the end of the game I get called a camper because I never ran away to let you get down your buddy. Just boils my blood when they expect a victory to be handed to them in a 4v1 match.All in all it's a fun game and it's blast to play in a group of friends. I'm interested in seeing where the developers go from here. Can't wait for some new killers.,Dead by Daylight
2016-12-18,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,I'll start this review off by saying the game is incredibly fun with friends while also having a lot of intense moments. There are some issues with certain areas of the game but that is not what gives the game a thumbs down from me. The problem is the ridiculously long wait times. I'm not talking 3 minutes I'm not talking 10 minutes I'm talking 30 minute wait times. On a weekend on the east coast of the US at 9 p.m. on a saturday it took us 50 minutes to find a game and this was with 22 000 people currently playing. Granted the wait times only apply if you are playing as a survivor as killers have no problems finding matches most of the time. Only buy this game if you don't mind 30 minute wait times every other game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-08-30,0,0,123,False,Recommended,100% recommend this game to anyone looking for something like this.I started playing after I saw Jacksepticeye and Markiplier playing it so I downloaded it back before all the DLC after the huntress started coming out. It's a lot scarier than you think because things happen so unexpectedly and every game you play is different. Being the killer is a lot harder than you think it is when you're first starting out but it provides a good challenge which is always a really good characteristic to have in a game.My sister and I regularly play together. I only have 115 hours on record due to not playing in a long while after FNAF came out but my sister has nearly 1k hours and is incredibly good at it. We have a good giggle playing this game.The only negative thing I think is how OP some of the killers seem. I know a lot of stuff got nerfed after the initial release but some of the stuff does still make a couple of them seem pretty OP compared to the survivors or even other killers. But I digress.I would 110% recommend this to anyone who is wondering about it. Love this game a lot.,Dead by Daylight

PRO TIP When a fellow survivor gets captured by the killer RESCUE HIM!!!If your a killer and the survivors are working together you feel underpowered.I do feel like some killers are better than the others some powers just feel useless or have a like 1/1000 chance of working.

2018-03-06,0,0,540,False,Recommended,"Updated since the developers have full control of the game it has gotten alot better and alot of balance issues have been addressed. This is a great cat and mouse game. But there is tons of things that this game could be but if they want it to continue they have to figure out what their roots are especially with survive with friends. Do they want the game to be fun for 4 suvivors and 1 killer? Or just the suvivors. Why because the game makes suvivors OP when they can talk to each other if its 4 friends vs one killer it takes on a form of bullying they don't need perks to be successful because they can just chat over voip system and coordinate gaining up on the killer. The game sometimes feels like wack a mole with you constantly having to bat away the survivors as they swarm you for finally getting one of their own. In the meantime they can heal up and go back in until their buddy gets away. The ranking system needs some work why because if you join a game with friends (were you have the advantage of talking and coordinating) you then get not even close to your average level. I can be rank 17 killer and face off against 4 friends were a couple will be 15+ with two over rank 10 or one as high as rank 5. It would make sense to have the friendgroups go against higher rank killers because they have the advantage of coordinating so instead of the killer rank 17 vs a average suvivor group of 13 have the killers rank be 1or 2 higher then the friend group rank. If you want to play a murder game cat and mouse just know that the cat gets soundly beaten or has to employ tactics that people will whine and complain about such as camping over patrolling a set generator area use special in game ""currency"" purchased items to give them a clear advantage. The game does rank resets on the 13th of every month. What this means is that all the rank 1 suvivors drop a couple ranks so they can completely destory the killers at the lower ranks again which just creates massive frustration for the low rank killers because they are getting smoked by players with 300 hours and decked out perks.",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-01,0,0,636,False,Recommended,"Overall an addictive competitve game. Definitely worth buying. One problem is that killer design is very wierd and unbalanced at best. Playing as the killer in high rank matches is stressful and exhausting af if you're not maining nurse or billy or other ""viable killers"". Why would there even be an instadown map controlling killer and a bingbong boy whose power is almost useless without addons in the chase and can be constantly stunned by flashlights when all killers should all be at approximately the same tier????",Dead by Daylight

2018-09-01,0,0,377,False,Recommended,This game is great! Its fun to play alone but when you start playing it with friends the only time you will play this game is when your friends are online because playing Dead By Daylight with friends is one of the BEST experiences you will have playing a video game. However there are a lot of bugs that I would literally suck off the devs to fix. But other than that this game is fricking great and I 100% recommend if you are looking for a fun game to play with some pals.,Dead by Daylight
2017-09-29,0,0,632,False,Not Recommended,If I could I'd give this game a mixed rating. It's mostly quite enjoyable but at times you'll get a game which kills your mood instantly.The game's ratings are mixed for a reason. The core gameplay is fun and I personally like the characters and sounds a lot.The community though is very toxic. There's a lot of tension between the killer and survivor side. Killers complain about survivors who use overpowered perks (and some of them really are) and survivors complain how easy it is to play the killer (which is true in some aspects) etc. Personally I don't care about this stuff.However what I do care about is how people are playing. Killers facecamping and tunneling and survivors pallet looping. I simply don't understand why people keep doing it. I avoid doing these things because it just isn't fun for either side.The sad thing is that the devs constantly make changes that do not make the situation any better. For example recently they made it so that survivors can't recover from being exhausted while running (before you just recovered much slower while running which was fine imo). By nerfing the survivors' exhaustion perks they encourage the killers to tunnel and punish the survivors for surviving a chase long enough. There's plenty of changes like this for both sides which encourage toxic gameplay.So all in all I recommend this only if you are prepared to be dissapointed periodically because of patches and the community itself.,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-01,0,0,220,False,Recommended,I would definately recommend this game. At first it is quite shoking (and it sometimes is shoking even after I played it for longer time). The best and at the same time worst moments are when the killer kills you by himself (not by hanging you). I would recommend to play the game together with friends (in survivor mode) since that's easier to handle. You can coordinate what you do and therefor play better. If you play alone it can happen that other survivors leave you alone and you're soon dead (but that doesn't happen all the time).One bad thing for me I could NEVER play the killer. Whenever I tried that I was in the lobby for ever and never had a survivor joining me (and no my profile wasn't private at that time). I would really love to get at least some bots in such cases so you can at least try to play the killer.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-26,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,Oh what to say. This game is amazing. Its shocking how fun and addictive a game like this would be. You would think repairing generators would get old. Nope. Its intense at all times. From powering the generators to running out of the gates and escaping last second from being killed. The bloodweb is a great feature. Sure it may seem a bit grindy but when your having so much fun its like a bonus. The lore in this game is amazing. The Dead by Daylight Wiki has all the lore that I love. I dont play the killer much simply because im terrible at it but i see how it can be really fun and exciting.EDIT This was a long time ago. The developers are VERY BAD. They have practically ruined the game. They cant make a good ranking system and they cant balance survivors vs killer. Its ridiculous. Flashlights were OP for a whole year where the dev then played against it at an event and finally realized how bad it was. RIDICULOUS.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-29,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,"This game is a tricky one. On one hand it can be fun and I could actually take it competetively sometimes. But there is a serious balancing issue that made me and many of my friends stop playing it. There is a clear meta that is really hard to avoid. Hard camping hooks is the most infuriating things this game has to offer. I used to love this game. But I can't bring myself to play it anymore. Maybe I'm just bad but that is enough to make me not enjoy this game as much as I could've. The DLCs are just too much money for a character or t shirt. I bought a few of the DLCs before. But I never realized how expensive they are until I got a job and made my own money. Maybe it's because I'm not making a lot but I just know I can't afford them. Looking back on this game I can say that it really isn't worth the money you would have to spend to experience the full game. It is nice they add free killers and survivors. But there are only 3 that I know of out of 10. You also have 4 DLCs with just clothes I can let those slide however because they don't help you in game. But DLC characters feel more fun to play as well as more effective in my opinion. The final problem for me is even if it was perfectly balanced and all DLC was perfect and either free or at least cheaper. The game would still be boring. The color pallet is bland and dull. Sure it's supposed to be gritty and dark because it's somewhat of a horror game. But after a while it gets boring to look at. The characters have stopped being original and are just movie characters. They did make the rabbit chick with axes which is cool. But in the last 4 DLCs only one is an original character (Which is Curtain Call. If it is in a movie I haven't seen nor heard about it.) The rest being Leatherface Freddy Krueger and Saw Pig. I don't see anything cool about the movie tie in characters other than ""Hey I know that movie! I want to give you my life savings because I recognize the character!"" Which isn't really appealing to me. I just can't recommend this game anymore.",Dead by Daylight

2018-06-20,0,0,31,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I really enjoy playing this game and every bit of content it holds and has. It is a shame that console players do not get updates as fast however I do understand it is not as easy transfering over and the fact they even do is great. I would definitely recommend this game if you like multiplayer games in which are not exactly fast or slow. It is interesting the concept of one killer versus 4 survivors and the overall characters make it even better. I personally prefer the Huntress and will definitely continue playing. My tip to any new players would be to test waters for both killer and survivor to test what you might prefer. I learned very quickly but continue to grow as both. It is a bit tough if you play survivor alone but you can eventually get used to it as you earn perks and level up each character. I feel this game has a great community and a good dev team who often answer many questions the players give.,Dead by Daylight
2017-12-26,0,0,218,False,Recommended,i think we did a pretty good job so far,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-20,0,0,85,False,Recommended,So Dead by Daylight. There are many things to be said about this game but we're going to start with the negatives. Let me start by saying that this game is at its worst when you play with randoms. If you don't have at least one friend to play this with and aren't good at making friends then this may not be the game for you. Playing with randoms can be infuriating. Randoms in this game in my experience are almost always in it for themselves. This game is VERY much about teamwork which doesn't help when your teammates are leading the killer to you to save themselves unhooking you for the points but not caring enough to check if the killer is near (or sometimes they flat out do it on purpose) not even worried about helping anyone on hooks leaving once the gate is open and not sticking around to help others etc.. I could go on and on about randoms and how it's so hard to get matched with good players. Speaking of matching with players most of the games i've joined by myself have this issue where they take forever to find a fourth player. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the lack of dedicated servers and the fact that every killer i've ever played against has a ping of at least 3 digits (usually higher than 150). Don't get me started on the loading times *rolls eyes*. Another negative and boy is this a negative is the ever lurking presence of cheaters. It's all too often that you'll have a killer that is completely immune to pallets or they'll 'glitch' through them or they'll be faster than possible or they'll know exactly where you're at at all times (given there are a number of perks that deal with that but on the end match screen you can usually see that these people aren't running any of them). This game has a bunch of glitches and issues so be aware of that before purchasing.Okay that's enough of the negative let s move on to the positive. In an age of mass oversaturation of games in popular genres it is unbelievable to me that there are not enough asymmetrical games that actually pull it off like DBD. Dead by Daylight does it very well. It is one of the most simple concepts and yet it is so entertaining and keeps you coming back. It amazes me how a one trick pony of a game like this can fool you into thinking how diverse of an experience it is. That feeling of satisfaction and relief you get when your entire team makes it out there's nothing like it. It's not the most balanced game but it's actually functional and for the most part fair in it's mechanics. I mentioned earlier that this game is at its worst when you go solo well when you've got your team assembled this game is at its absolute best. Communication (besides for giving you obvious advantages) helps to make this game even more suspenseful and entertaining than it already is. Countless times you'll hear friends screaming and their pants because they're in a chase and it's an amazing experience. You're going to get the best out of this game with a full team of four but really all that you need for an optimal experience is a partner. With all of the above I'm going to leave you by saying that despite the numerous issues I recommend this game especially if you get the squad together. The fun I've had here outweighs the anger and frustration I've felt. All in all I think it's an entertaining and unique experience that everyone should give a chance. I will say though that you should definitely watch some gameplay and determine if it's for you because this game will not be for everyone. Anyways I hope you found this helpful!,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-26,0,0,8,False,Recommended,It is honestly a fun game but to have fun as a killer you are better off at low ranking. I know its odd coming from this account with a low amount of hours played but i do have an older account which was lost on my older pc. Which had at least 200 hours on it. When you do pull off a win with a killer its fun to hear entitled survivors talk smack. I wont even start with playing as a survivor because i barely do it it's not fun to me while it is to some others. If you do think about buying this game look at some youtubers who play survivor and then some who play killers only. But to me this game is fun.,Dead by Daylight

I enjoy this game but this game has so many flaws. The Devs don't even really care about this game and is just trying to make money off of us. The balancing is so bad killers complain about how hard it is to kill survivors but mostly everytime I join a game and the game starts the killer ends up finding me first and probably hooking me plus killers are able to lunge and have a long range which makes no sense because killers are faster than survivors so why are they able to lunge or have a ridiculous range. The killers are so more overpowered then the survivors like it ain't even fun. Then just trying to join a lobby takes forever. Even when it is just me I have to restart my game like 4 times before I could even get into a match because I am always in an infinite loading screen so I have to restart my game like all the time. Also there are so many bugs and glitches and the Devs barely try to fix it. Once I tried unhooking my teammate but then I got glitched and got stuck or there was this one glitch where killers were able to get the Hill Billy's chainsaw when they weren't even playing the Hill Billy. It took the Devs forever to fix this glitch and it was annoying whenever I played a killer that had a chainsaw that wasn't the Billy. This game has many flaws but I love playing it with friends.

I think the Lobbies with 4 Player should be filled first then those with 3 Players 2 Players and so on. This way nobody has to wait too long.2. I would appreciate some kind of Cheat Protection. Sometimes it really feels like the killer has some kind of Wallhack. Althoug it could just be my opinion any kind of protection would be good )But this is just nitpicking. The game is a milestone in gameplaying in my opinion. It's a kind of game i've waited for since ages! To me the best game since Left4Dead 2.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-13,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 survival arena type game. 4 players play as survivors where their mission is to activate enough generators to power the exit gate so that they can escape the arena.1 player plays as the killer whose mission is to kill as many survivors as possible.The game is a battle of wits filled with fear adrenaline and a tiny bit of luck. In a one on one situation the killer usually has the advantage which means the survivors have to work together if they want to escape.I've played almost since the beginning and so far no killer or survivor has been unfairly over powered. However it will take some time to properly understand how to avoid each killer as they are all equipped with a different set of skills.The game plays well a few bugs but almost none that breaks the game and/or hinders intended gameplay.A great buy definitely worth the price.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-14,0,0,14,False,Recommended,"I think I soiled myself! No really I did (This is a game that caters to both the inner sociopath and the inner socialite. The premise is simple. 4 nervous survivors attempt to outwit and evade 1 of 6 (i think) twisted psychotic killers and escape the level. This is done by the simple act of powering up 5 generators to give power to the level gates. Simple enough and actually a tad repetitive after a while. However each game still manages to inject just enough suspense excitement and fear to keep you coming back. Teamwork pays off but you can be the selfish type and just try to ensure your own survival. Perks and items collected from crates or from levelling up will make your survival a little easier.....maybe.As a killer you play a sometimes frustrating game of cat and mouse attempting to find chase and capture survivors so you can hang them from meat hooks.....yes that's right finally we can do what we've always wanted to ) The killers are all different with their own skills perks playstyle etc and it's difficult to select a favourite as they all play so differently.The trapper sets his traps and attempts to lure or chase his prey onto them. The hillbilly charges across the map maniacally swinging his chainsaw. The wraith is a stealthy stalker etc etc.Maps are all dark and misty very atmospheric in some cases. The graphics in general are nothing to write home about. The textures of the characters in general are pretty poor and the killers seem to be lacking something. However you won't notice it you'll be far too busy screaming ""OH FECK OH FECK"" as you dash frantically across the map leaping walls and throwing pallets down behind you in an attempt to lose the 7 foot tall hatchet wielding psychopath who seems intent on having you around for dinner.In conclusion a very good game. Suspenseful tactical and rewarding for those that learn to play. My only gripe so far is the community or parts of it at least but its no worse than many others. There have also been a few serverside issues that can cause problems joining a game but that's a minor issue as it doesnt happen often.",Dead by Daylight

Dead by Daylight is not beginner friendly but it's also not difficult to master the mechanics once you have some game knowledge. That said the average skill level is extremely low and most players just rely on the few overpowered items to succeed.The developers have no idea what they're doing but there are still some decent people playing the game. I wouldn't advise joining the game this late into its lifespan which surely can't go on much longer but I also can't convince myself to quit.I got my money's worth that's for sure despite all the pain along the way.,Dead by Daylight

It is pretty spooky if you are trying to hide and get away from the killers.For the most part everything is balanced. I enjoyed playing the survivors and tryign to work together to escape. That was fun.I played The Nurse as the killer. Fun and can be difficult to play but the actions of the killers are slow(which they should be).Here is what did it for me... I played about 5 games in and oon the 5th game here comes The Hag. This killer single handedly ruined it for me. The traps she can place next to the sacrifice hooks is unacceptable if you ask me. Should not be allowed. It allows her to be in 2 places at one time which if you ask me ruins the premise of '4v1'. With the trap it allows the hag to teleport to you if someone ran over it. which basically makes rescuing survivors from the hooks next to impossible.I am glad they allowed a free weekend so that way i can give it a shot before buying it.i will not be buying this game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-25,0,0,362,False,Recommended,So here's the thing.Dead by Daylight has the potential to be an extremely fun game and is truly unique. It happens to also be an imbalanced PoS.For those of you unaware it is an asymmetrical survival horror game where four survivors team together against one killer.The survivors objective is to repair five generators randomly spawned around the map and then power exit gates to escape and survive.The killers objective is to sacrifice the four survivors before they escape.And there are a variety of different killers and survivors to choose from survivors and killers each coming with their own unique perks that unlock special abilities and killers come with their own unique powers that change their playstyle in various ways.Oh and there's a leveling system. Playing matches earns you a currency called Blood Points which can be used to level your character and unlock items and perks to use in future matches. And there's an overall level system that progresses the more you play rewarding you with a currency called Iridescent Shards. More on that later.There are currently 12 killers and 13 survivors to choose from.Something that some people might find alluring to the game is that there are licensed DLC killers alongside original killers and survivors created for the game. Examples of licensed killers would be Michael Myers from Halloween Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Pig from Saw and Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare on Elm Street. Alongside these DLC killers are the survivors Laurie Strode Detective Tapp and Quentin Smith from their respective franchizes.This game is NOT pay to win. In fact the strongest killers are all free and come with the base game. And most of the better perks for survivors are on free characters too. And all perks for all killers and survivors have a chance of showing up in the shrine which is part of the in game store and changes weekly. You can buy the perks using the Iridescent Shards mentioned above.The simple fact of the matter is that the DLC killers and survivors should be bought because they look interesting and fun to you. Do not be tricked into thinking that they are required in order for the game to be enjoyable. Aside from buying killers the only other purchasable thing is an in game currency called Auric Cells which can be used to buy cosmetics for nonlicensed survivors and killers.Finally the last thing I can say is that your mileage may vary. From my experience the game can be a 10 or a 0 when it comes to fun depending on the match and the interaction between the killer and survivors. The community varies from being ok to extremely toxic. There's enough variety to keep things interesting and it's extremely replayable. And its progression system gives you a reason to keep playing. However the game is imbalanced at times due mostly in part to particularly strong perks for both killers and survivors as well as noticable skill gaps between players that can sometimes occur due to poor matchmaking.The best advice I can offer is pick up the game if it seems interesting to you just don't take it too seriously and play for fun. Side note Fun party game to play with friends.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-17,0,0,313,False,Recommended,First of all I never really write reviews but I pre ordered this game and I like it a lot so here I go.Do I recommend this game? Yes. Is there flaws? Many. This game is good fun IF you have friends to play with I wouldn't dare play this game solo unless killing is your thing then go ahead. A few REALLY frustrating and somewhat game breaking issues are pallets. When you drop a pallet sometimes it throws you on the wrong side which is a guaranteed hit for the killer sometimes they just don't drop. Vaulting through windows is almost always a guarantee hit for killers too since it seems their arms are made of rubber and can stretch a thousand miles the devs cater towards the killers constantly when they shouldn't be. They complain devs give. A perkless killer can kill ALL survivors where as a perkless survivor will probably die first it isn't very balanced. Enough ranting though is this game worth it? I'd say so get ready for a toxic community sometimes but it is good fun filled with laughter and butt clenching chases WHEN you have friends.,Dead by Daylight

For example all kate densons perks are useless while clowns are very helpful to killers. I ""love"" how you nerfed we are gonna live forever perk when it was not strong at all and doesnt help either yet you come out with barbecue and chili which gives double points and helps killers. We are gonna live forever needs either a buff or other ways to make tokens insted of just protection and unhooking others. Its literally impossible to get tokens if others are taking the saves you are trying to do and sometimes when ""protecting"" others for a hit it doesnt even give you a token so we are gonna live forever perk needs a buff or just add extra ways to get tokens.",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-22,0,0,284,False,Recommended,Great game! Even better than expected! I watched this game being played and thought i should try it out. It exceeds my expectations! I thought it might be broken based on other reviews and it does have its flaws but its still amazing! There are many killers to choose from and they are SUPER fun to play. Being a survivor gets your heart pumping and you feel helpless just like the creators hoped! Each killer and survivor has their own perks and strengths such as one survivor can heal herself without a health pack (Claudette) and another who is quick and quiet (Meg)! One killer can go invisible (The Wraith) and another can break into a crazed chainsaw sprint (The Hillbilly)! The only problems with this game are the numerous trolls and bullies (they just mess with you so it's not that bad) The Nightmare (Freddy Kreuger) is way too OP and that you have to pay about $5 on average per DLC ( There are about 13 DLCs 10 of which cost money) so all the DLCs combined is over double the base game! ( $50 for all DLCs $20 for Game). In summary the game is great and does have its flaws but it is WAY WORTH IT!!! 9.25/10!!!,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-03,0,0,62,False,Recommended,Update Despite the emblem system not being perfect for both killers and survivors the game is in a much better place and (mostly) enjoyable...However the emblems do not punish killers who camp enough. Games where you are the 1/4 (25%) to be caught first get hooked and then camped and tunneled to death is un interactive and not fun.Most games you don't get this but unfortunately their are too many where this does happen.Games still have unfair match making too where a new player may be put alongside prestige players against a average leveled killer. The math balances out but it makes the game un fun for the new player and un fun for the killer to try and get the more experienced players.With a new game by the devs coming out soon it won't surprise me if this one gets less developments and matchmaking issues (and camping) are still not fixed due to this new game taking development time.Only get this on a sale (50% or more) don't pay full price for this. Previous review (6th September 2016)I enjoy this game greatly I like most of the character mechanics and perks...What I don't like is trying a different character (who is at level 1) and being put with other survivors mostly at level 10 20 against a killer at level 40...I don't know whether the issue is with a lack of player base or lack of a background system to queue people around the same level but the game was changed recently so that rather than leaving a lobby if you felt other players were too high level instead it doesnt show you their level now.I've played as killer a few times at level 5 and been against level 30 players or level 35 prestige 2 players...The game isn't designed for people who can only play an hour or two a day and it is a shame.Maybe if there was a non competitive mode? (turns off perks) the game could be viable for new players but with the current systems it is unplayable. (additionally the lobbying issues and various other visual/connectivity bugs help to take away from the immersion and experience),Dead by Daylight
2017-11-07,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,Really intense at times. I enjoy playing this game despite thinking Friday the 13th is much more polished and well thought out..... While this is multiplayer only I really think it needs a single player campaign to add some longevity to it.Fast foward to now. Lobby's are a corpse to put it bluntly. All the DLC in the world won't matter without a single player campaign.,Dead by Daylight
2017-10-19,0,0,694,False,Recommended,Its an okay game if the devs tested their own game and didn't listened to people people that think a perk is op because they don't know how to play killer/survior and don't know counters for example. DS is not an overpowered perk its a onetime use and if you miss you wasted a perk and a little something called enduring exists sooo stops whinning.Second the devs need to learn balance like really killers that are slow enough that you can go get a snacc come back to 3 gens done and they aren't even across the map yet andchanging pick up to be so fast that light born makes it impossible to blind if you start at the pick up like really great job 10/10.Its a great way to stay in shape from all the sweating.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-07,0,0,64,False,Recommended,I really like this game. It can get a bit repetitive however it is very unique and after a short break i find myself coming back to it. Initially it is difficult but as you play more it gets much easier. The role of the killer is well balanced against the survivors. A bit more explaination of how the bloodweb works would be nice however its not so hard to figure out that its extremely necessary. For me personally this game is a breath of fresh air in a world where so many games have become stale.

2016-08-07,0,0,665,False,Recommended,This review is for version 1.05 of the game with me having played about 50 60 hours. I really love the feel of this game. It brings to mind the classic slasher flicks from the 80s like Friday the 13th Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street. I'm always tense and on the edge of my seat when I play as a survivor praying the killer keeps away from me long enough for me to restart this piece of junk busted generator. Conversely playing the killer is a huge rush. I love watching the survivors scatter like cockroches when I come out of the dark night. I can't help cackling madly as I chase them down and hook 'em. Gotta catch 'em all!That being said there are some issues with it. Camping someone that's been put on a hook is an understandable but annoying strategy that many killers tend to use. I'd like to see the killer get reduced points for corpse camping or the victem get more points for occupying the killer's time or some combination thereof.Also the game lobby seems to be seriously wonky. Sometimes you'll get dropped from a lobby or get stuck on 'searching for a match' for what seems like forever. It can sometimes take over 5 minutes between finishing one match and getting into the next. I still recommend Dead By Daylight because once you get into the game it really is a heck of a lot of fun. Hopefully we will see improvements with the connection and balance issues in future updates.,Dead by Daylight

Now I decided to actually purchase it and I have been morew than happy with what I got.Now with updates the game has become smooth and is very well balanced the only problems for me being hookcamping (It's very annoying as it can ruin a single player's experience entirely while the killer kinda sacrifices the match itself) and the Saw map ""The Game"". The map is in my opinion poorly balanced for survivors in terms of escape routes and it also is one of the more complicated maps having multiple floors. This makes finding objectives hard.Aside from those two things I dont have any problems with the game. It has very little rng lots of room to improve yourself as a player and multiple maps killers and perk combinations make each match a new experience. Also custom lobbies have everything unlocked for each of your characters so you can go wild with your friends.As Im writing this review the game is currently 50% on the Steam store. Go buy it.

2018-07-11,0,0,360,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a really good game. I reccomend it to people who love horror games. If any of the creators read this comment i would really like it if ( and this is just an idea) if GhostFace could get implemented into the game. He can teleport to lockers as one of his abilities. Again this is just an idea,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-20,0,0,1496,False,Recommended,This game's great the idea of an asymmetrical horror where 4 survivors are forced to work together in order to escape against a deadly survivor is great the execution of this idea in Dead by Daylight not great (at the moment).Currently this game is in a weird state where in low ranks and for new players the game is really fun the initial couple of hours playing the game always will be being immersed in the game and hiding gives you a rush but once that wears off the game becomes more tedious.If you want to have the best builds for either survivor or killer in most cases you'll need to buy at least one of the DLC characters. Also if you're a completionist and want to max out all killers and survivors in this game prepare to invest over 1000 hours depending on when you buy the game as once every few months a new killer/survivor is released.But the main issue currently is balance. Unless you're playing nurse pallets are currently the bane of killers. By pallet looping even sitting at pallets and wasting them will give other survivors enough time to complete all 5 generators and escape. Furthermore the map design at the moment is terrible with some maps heavily favoring survivors and others favoring killers. The game is currently the survivors game to lose unless you are exceptionally good at playing killer which takes a long time to achieve unless you are a natural. The devs do seem interested in fixing the major balance issues however but this obviously takes time.So to conclude is the game fun? Yeah. Is the game entertaining? Yeah. Is the game fun to play for the first 20 or so hours? Yeah. Is the game fun to play in the beginning? Yeah. Is the game fun to play after that? Not at the moment and thats why I can't recommend the game.Also I almost exclusively play killer so some of my opinions on the game are skewed by that.EDIT 11th July 2018Since I originally wrote this review the developers seem to have given the game new life with solid consistent updates that improve the game as a whole. New killers have also been added since this review was written specifically the Pig (I think) and the Clown. Both DLC's are strong as a whole and in the Pigs case introduces a new solid mechanic which changes the game drastically.Overall the game has made a great turnaround over the past couple of months and appears to be continuing along this path. With more balance updates around the corner I am excited for the future Dead by Daylight holds.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-01,0,0,197,False,Recommended,Worth buying and playing. The community is ok to nice also the best thing in this game is that your skill is in the center ( sometimes luck counts a little bit too) You can play whenever you want and with who and how you want.

2018-07-11,0,0,493,False,Not Recommended,Lol they deleted my previous review..... instead of spending time to delete honest reviews in order to get more people to give you $ for this buggy game why not use the time to address the bugs imbalanced map and the terrible matchmaking system? Too lazy to write down the long list of bugs a simple google search will net you a list of bugs experience by us the players. Certain maps consist of loops that just makes the players feel like they are playing a Merry go round simulator. The devs solution to this is that they added a mechanic (bloodlust) that makes the killer run faster after a period of chasing instead of reviewing the design of the map. Apparently this mechanic resets upon breaking a pallet so basically it is merry go round simulator until the killer is moving too fast that is the timing whereby the survivor will drop the pallet and turn the game back to a f*&amp k Feast of merry go round again. Genius matchmaking whereby the players are Q into red ping (&gt 300ms) rooms 70% of the time and they have to constanly re Q and roll the RNG dice in order to finally get into a room with stable latency. In order to make it more frustrating they added a 5 sec delay where users that left the room are unable to find another room. The time adds up considering the % of time where the users find a room of unstable latency.Although we can see the devs putting in some form of effort (Creating more skins?!?!?! nani????) to address the issues faced by players i strongly do not recommend the purchase of this game is you are spending &gt $10 as there are better games out there for this price.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-29,0,0,448,False,Not Recommended,Theres a lot of balancing that needs to be fixed. Some killers are WAY too OP and others are way too nerfed and hard to play.And same as survivors Some get perks that make it near impossible to kill them and some cant do anything. Youve got toxic survivors and toxic killers.Killers will camp hooks or camp dying survivors.Survivors will quit half way through load and screw the rest of the team over.Theres some things that need to changeLosing pips when the killer DCsLosing your high tier items when killers DCThe sabo perk should be a little stronger Hooks should grow back after a certain amount have been sabod. (IMO Im sure everyone feels some way about this).The match making needs to be fixed When your joining a match you should be matched with people in your region and with a decent ping.80% of the time people are leaving because they get stuck in servers with killers who have horrible connections. Lag is a big issue for survivors a killer can screw your game up with lag on his side. I feel like the devs need to focus on what the community is complaining about and fix it. Honestly I dont think the devs play enough of the game to understand any of the issues players are faced with when joining random matches. Not too mention they all have egos and what they say rules who cares what the community thinks right?Idk over all I enjoy the game. I recommend it to those who can handle the butt hurt and toxicity of the community or people who just want to screw around with some friends. The game can be fun dont get me wrong. But holy can it just push your buttons sometimes.,Dead by Daylight
2018-03-29,0,0,423,False,Not Recommended,This has to be the most broken and unbalanced game i have EVER player. Here are my reasons why..200 hours in and i lost all my progress. All my perks and everything i had grinded for. Had to contact devs to fix it for me and somehow that took a month and they didnt even fix it. They just gave me bloodpoints (the in game currency) and even then it took me hours to spend them all and get some of my stuff back.The lack of dedicated servers makes this game unplayable at times.. It relies on the same system as old COD games. Where the killer is the host and if his internet sucks d*** your game will most likely be ruined by horrible lag.The Balance is off as well.. It has a sort of ranked matchmaking wich would be fine if people did not disconnect every single time a good killer or a good team of survivors are owning.. Don't buy this game don't support sloppy game design and devs who don't care about their product..,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-14,0,0,1276,False,Recommended,Play the game enjoy it as much as you can. (I still play today so it s not boring).Well long story short..the game is pretty fun. You start at the bottom with no perks. As you play you gain better perks and experience on the way.I felt i should correct my review.Dead By Daylight is one of the best horror games you can find on the market right now. You can play as either the Killer or a Survivo and repair gens to escape. Now the game haver other mechs. inside that make the exp. more enjoyable or more painful. I changed my review to recommend because I have put 700+ hours in this game if anyone puts more then 10+ hours in a game then it is worth it.Just dont let this game get to you never mind try not to let it if you want to see how stressful this game can be just click on the community hub and see how seperated it is its like the US when trump got elected.,Dead by Daylight

2018-05-22,0,0,1186,False,Recommended,I love this game with all my heart but if you truly love something you need to face the truth. There are very glaring problems with not only the communty the mechanics as well. I would have to say the devs are pretty out of touch. Sure the community director is a previous player turned developer but making games is a lot different than playing them. I felt my opinion wouldn't be a valid if i hadn't played the game for at least a little under 500 hours. I feel like people will listen to me now. Ok. I consistently get to high rank survivor (Yes i am a survivor main but that will change soon) and i find that it takes forever to find matches let alone matches worth playing as in Disconnects Facecamping etc. I don't think its the mechanics that are mainly causing common problems. Most bugs these days are ones that people who have played the game since inception ever see but that doesn't lower their priority. The devs could easily fix a majority of the problems their games faces but they are scared to do anything drastic which sucks. Its understandable that they don't want to go to fast but its just frustating to say the least. There are so many things I would like to say but I can't really name them all. They are problems that irk me very heavily whenever they pop up but i learn to deal with them. Someones does an unfair strategy? Learn how to deal with it in the ways you can sometimes you just need to learn that you aren't Ochido or any other high ranking survivor or killer main. At the very least I'm hoping that the next anniversary update changes a few things that frustrates everyone in the community. well hope you have a fun time an look forward to seeing you in the fog if you choose to play this game Peace.,Dead by Daylight

Now. the game is about 4 survivors and 1 killer each killer is unique and has their own ability and cosmetics from outfits to weapons to perks the first few killers available are Trapper wraith nurse and huntress others are paid dlc and each killer has a difficulty level based on their ability and perks Now survivors each survivors have their own unique perks that can be unlocked and be unlocked and used in other survivors.At the start of every game there are 4 survivors and 1 killer of any of the available killers now the internet connection is ran of the hosts internet connection so basically if the host has terrible internet you will aswell and if you leave you will get deranked due to the games ranking system from 20 being worst to 1 being the best and to get higher up in the rankings you need to get a certain amount of points in a match and then you make your way up also each season the ranks reset now when you start a game you need to complete 5 gens depending on the amount of survivors 4 survivors being 5 gens 3 being 4 2 being 3 and 1 being 2 now the survivors have to complete these gens while avoiding the killer who is attempting to hook the survivors on a hook and sacrifice them to the creature whos responsible for the survivors being there the entity now once you get hooked you get a chance to attemp escape where you have a small chance to escape now after awhile you will reach the second phase of the sacrifice and if you got unhook and rehooked you will reach that phase automaticly and once thats complete you die simple as that and the only other way of killing someone as killer is using a mori that you can unlock in the bloodweb there are multiple types of mori's now if you get hooked as a survivor then unhooked the killer will have the option to murder the survivor from one of them to all of them depending on the mori now once the gens are complete you have to open the exit gate orrr escape in the hatch that can either be opened by a key or automaticly opens when theres only 1 survivor remaining in the game.anyway i guess this is where i end the review hope to see you guys in the fog! bye bye!,Dead by Daylight

The Pros Horror Villains aren't Alike and have a Wide Variety as well as there are main stream Villian DLCs Like Freddy Micheal and Leather Face.I had Friends who Introduced me to this Game and I played With them Via Discord Which was a Blast But Because there're No Mic Options in this Game I've only played Solo Once or Twice and Very Much Disliked it Because I believe that a game should be just as fun solo I've to give this a Thumbs Down.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-28,0,0,2197,False,Not Recommended,"Most toxic community ever. Not even kidding.You can try playing any kind of build in this game and you'll have the opposing side whine and complain the loudest about ""OMG. YOU RAN (insert perk) LIKE A NOOB. GET GOOD."" You have people in the community who will run the most scummiest items/perks so they can guarentee survival. (I can understand it on scummy survivors or killers but even the polite players get screwed over because of this behavior.) If you want to see examples of this toxicity then just look at the Steam Community Forums for this game. There is at least two or three complaints about something wrong about this game.If you ever stop by a good majority of the Twitch streamers that play Dead by Daylight especially the big name streamers a good chunk of people in the chatrooms are toxic. Sometimes the streamer actually encourages and promotes some of this toxic behavior. Criticizing another player is fine but just being downright disrespectful and toxic towards other players is uncalled for. Many of the good hearted players have abandoned this game because of how toxic disrespectful and scummy this community has become. I don't even want to stream this game and promote it in the current state it's in.Also if you dare trigger a killer as survivor then don't expect to be leaving the game alive in 90% of the games. As killer if you dare run something scummy on a specific group of survivors then don't expect to be catching them alive when they run into your lobby again. It's this toxic back and forth tug of war of scummy gameplay that has lead to the individual players not respecting each other. To the remaining group of people who actually still play this game respect the game for killers and survivors alike and don't resort to scummy gameplay I give kudos to you. Most dumbfounded developer and community manager team ever.There were numerous scummy playstyles that can easily get a killer or survivor pips and it took the developers almost a whole year just to patch some of them out. Some that are still in the game and still exploitable to this day especially with how awful in this current day and age. (OhTofu did perkless wraith played like any typical scummy killer and achieved Rank 1 in two days on his stream. The ranking system is a joke.) Alongside the ranking system doesn't reward you at all unless you want to consider the rewards of getting to Rank 1 of playing with streamers extremely toxic players or players that were carried by their friends to Rank 1. (Rank hardly ever matters in this game past Rank 15.) The developers are not communicative to their playerbase at all. Some of the developers stream on Twitch and they get bombarded by questions of fixing their game but they tend to ignore it and time out people who harass them. (Nothing wrong with that it just shows how many problems there are in this game.) Yet some of the developers (not all) don't seem to bother actually addressing issues in the game and push it to the side for another week until it actually blows up in their face and then they actually have to address it. In fact some of these developers and community managers have devolved into the same toxic behavior the community promotes on their own streams. I can respect them as individuals outside of their job profession but not inside of it. Their in game reporting system? A complete joke. You actually have to go to their website to actually report someone or contact one of the moderators on Steam. Yet let's just cut the bull here and say many of these cases the moderators will tell you need more sufficient evidence (video evidence) or some other reason to satisify the ban criteria. Unless you're friends with a moderator or provide enough ""credible"" evidence don't expect someone to get banned. Overall I suggest avoiding this game. Even though they might have licensed killers and survivors the community is not worth playing against. You thought Call of Duty was completely toxic with 12 year olds on the console? This game can easily beat Call of Duty in the dust and leave no trail behind.I do play the game from time to time with friends and was perhaps worth the $30 or so I spent on this game but it's not worth the hassle (looking into the game in the perspective of a new player) of how the game is currently sitting in. There might not be much competition in the field of horror multiplayer games but I rather not waste my time with a game that will give me more stress and grief than actual fun.",Dead by Daylight

The devlopers have good initial ideas as the game and DLCs are always good initially but you can tell their drive ends after release of the content.

Beware Playing as killer expect nothing less than 30 minutes to 2 hour waits for a single game sometimes more. The game was fun But is not worth spending your time or money on this until they fix Que times. Cannot believe there are still online games that let you sit for longer than 5 minutes in a Que this is beyond appaling TLDR.

2018-01-05,0,0,9,False,Recommended,It's one of those multiplayer horror games where one person plays the bad guy trying to catch/imprison the other players who are survivors. But this is a really good example of the genre.You have an upgrade/level system and items plus a few clothing articles to customize your character. Every survivor class has unique skills some passive some upgradeable and some have to be activated in addition there are numerous villain classes.There's even more if you also purchase the DLCs which are all quite good. Going by comments the biggest criticism of the game is that its community is toxic or takes advantage of unbalanced mechanics. I'm a newbie and a pretty predictable player (which in this game is a disadvantage) but I haven't encountered any negativity (in the GMT and GMT+1 timezone at least). Several times the Killer would let me and another sole survivor win out of pity several times all four survivors would form a conga line and mess with the Killer xD During every round I've played so far other survivors even other newbs are good at signalling and working with you. Roles are assigned and accepted without chat one player focuses on juking and baiting the killer another player is the designated rescuer/healer and the other two focus on getting the generators up and running for example.In fact for me this is a big draw to the game getting along with others and working out an escape plan even without direct communication. A word of caution though don't jump into the game expecting to play as a clever Killer the first time around. The Killer is the hardest mode to learn and master and your first couple of times you will most probably lose spectacularly. That's okay though! You can learn from this experience from guides and from how better Killers behave when you play Survivor. On a side note there are a few fundamental differences between this game and its unofficial rival Friday the 13th. Survivors have different abilities escape routes are different level design is completely different... It's hard to say which is better. It's like comparing Terraria with Starbound or Team Fortress 2 with Overwatch.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-28,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,"You might look at this game and think ""oh neat a game about surviving a killer!"" but it's not that. After learning the game it turns into a game about trolling a killer. Unless you're against incredibly inept survivors you're going to have an awful time as killer because are designed from the ground up to frustrate you. You'll get looped around the same loop for insane periods of time often leading the survivor escaping any way then having them accuse you of tunneling them. You'll get body blocked vt multiple survivors forcing you to drop a survivor before you can hook them. You'll play against a friend team of 4 that will gen rush the hell out of you. You'll get survivors that try to farm you by healing hiding in lockers sitting in the basement etc. You'll get groups in which all 4 people are running an OP perk setup making it near impossible to beat them. You'll get survivors that will teabag you then immediately disconnect if you hook them. You'll get survivors that escape because of s crutch perk they shouldn't have or an escape hatch they haven't earned. Then to top it all off you'll be chastised at the end of the match. If you win then you're a camper a hacker a tunneler a farmer an etc. If you lose then you're a noob a bad killer trash etc. The developers of this game blindly pander to incredibly toxic people that honestly believe it should be easy for them to win in an asymmetrical game and any time the developers try to make it easier on killers the same people throw a fit.

2016-08-06,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight a game worth buying. Fun Mechanics interesting lore and some really really tense gameplay (both sides of play).The gameplay is focused on 4v1 asymmetrical multiplayer. 4 people are survivors people attempting to repair generators that will power gates that will allow them to escape from the other player the killer who is trying to find and capture the survivors so they can be sacrificed to the entity the game's god. The gameplay on both sides are extremely interesting and fun with survivors having their heart pounding at their chest as they hear heartbeats getting more and MORE intense before suddenly a desperate chase ensues. The killer once on the trail is just chomping at the bit...just a bit...just a bit close....closer....near...ly......GOT YA! Each Successful strike of your weapon being a sense of the hunt.Both sides however don't come to this party of dark torment without some toys. The survivors have items for aiding in a number of aspects ranging from healing a wounded ally to being able to track where objectives are. These items are all on borrowed time as to die with them is to lose them but don't fret you can always reverse that with being able to find an item on the map from a chest and if you escape with it you keep it!The Killers however are a little more set in their styles as instead of getting random items they have their own unique 'power'.The Trapper (my personal favourite) as the name implies traps. Bear Traps. This killer specialises in placing traps in choke points behind windows that survivors can jump through or even in front of a hooked sacrifice for a little bit of insurance that ether the hooked or saviour is caught (sometimes both if they don't leave quickly!). Very fun to play as hearing you traps snap shut on a survivor is just a joy that curls your mouth to a grin like the killers mask.The Wraith (the communities pet punching bag) little more obscure power heh as the wraith can turn invisible (think predator camo it isn't perfect). This killer gets the most flak however that is just because he is considered the easiest to get used to due to a simple play style. While invisible you move faster but cannot attack or do any sort of 'attack' action (breaking barricades picking up survivors and the like) and it always takes a few seconds to cloak and de cloak. This power has a huge benefit as survivors cannot hear a heartbeat if you are cloaked. So pay attention and get ready for a jump scare when fixing a generator.The Hillbilly (he hates auto wreckers) The chainsaw wielding maniac. A simple killer but with high skill cap but high reward. His chainsaw takes a few seconds to get going but once it does he will come running for you like an american muscle car and hits like one too. Doesn't turn easily but the speed he travels and the fact a hit is instant downed status is terrifying better sharpen your juke skills for this one because a good hillbilly will see you downed quickly and you won't even see it coming. Quite terrifying actually.So lets be honest about the game it is good extremely good. I recommend it whole heartly without doubt but I will point out the game is still buggy in some things. However the Devs have been working extremely hard to polish their game and have been removing bugs and adding features people wanted for so long and are even going to add a fourth killer. However if you can't stand small bugs (like say a small camera unhitch here and there every say 4 5th game for killers) then don't until a later date.Other than small issues that most games (even triple As) have this game is great fun. Just great. Find some friends get a lobby and scream over voice chat as the hunter chases you down first every game.......grumble grumble........(Last sentence is a personal experience of mine with rotten luck and some really determined killers),Dead by Daylight

2016-08-06,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Insanely fun. There are some glitches that while not *game breaking* have been match ruining. . .mainly clipping through the floor as Killer and becoming immobile while I watch the dumbest survivor I've ever seen bumble his way through the map. The rank system is a bit dumb but a lot of games have problems finding the right balance for their ranking system. Hell Blizzard still has trouble. It *is* frustrating to lose a rank just because you offed the four survivors quickly. The game does a good job of getting you in the role of each side though. As survivor my heart rate really gets pumping and as killer the thrill really is in the chase!Bunny hopping is super annoying but I usually take that as a sign to move on. . .plus I've had some people that up and BAM ON MY SHOULDER YOU GO.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-06,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Looking for a Friday The 13th Game this is your place (until the actual one comes out) well anyways dead by daylight is a hide and seek game but with killers and teenagers.The game may seem boring and become bland later on when you play it for a while but this game is getting updated alot.The characters you play as seeming if they are a killer or a survivor you can have different perks or addons to items and certain characters have there own unique perks(Some of them are teachable to other survivors or killers) The servers aren't the best because the killer hosts the game so if they were across the world and so were you you would lag alot but im sure in the future of this game that will be fixed.Anyways if you enjoy Horror Movies Or Horror Games this might be the game for you.,Dead by Daylight
2016-07-27,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,I have a lot to say about this game some good but in all honesty this game is terrible from gameplay all the way to the idiotic devs who don't know when to stop when the game becomes unbalanced and bias towards the killer winning most of the time. With this last update they've decreased the wiggle time to get free so that to actually get free the killer needs to be all the way on one side of the mapand get to the other end so that the survivors are actually able to escape. The games are way too one sided with the killer picking up the win most of the time as either the wraith or hillbilly. The trapper imo is the closest thing to balance in the game and yes im also including the survivors and their bloodwebs which are completely underwhelming considering all of but two things are one time use and most of the time utterly pointless. Another reason the game is unbalanced is that they made the survivors pushovers almost making it impossible for them to win. With the decrease in wiggle speed no longer being able to recover yourself and making it your teams burden to come pick your stupid up baiting them towards to killer or them saying it and leaving you left for dead. This is also not mentioning that when your teammates do ditch you and you try to attempt to escape off the hook the attempt fails 98.888888% percent of the time. What im really trying to say is that devs need to stop focusing on the t killers realize the game is unbalanced and fix their ing game or they're going to have mroe reviews like this coming in.UPDATE Even after this last patch they refuse to listen to the community reviews and neglect to change unbalanced features of the game. STOP MAKING THE ING KILLERS OP YOU DUM SONS OF BETHCES. FORGOT ABOUT THEM AND FOCUS ON THE SURVIVORS YOU MORONS. &lt 3,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-06,0,0,265,False,Recommended,"There's not that many bugs. Might find one once a week.The survive with friends mode has been added as promised although that itself is going to make people angry too.I don't really care about matchmaking. Unless your teammates are in the single digit ranks they're pretty killable like the rest of us. If you have a good killer he'll just have some more common sense than the average dunce.The developers are constantly in a state of balancing the game trying to please both sides of the game (Killers vs Survivors) which will never be at ease due to both sides wanting the game in their favor. Any issues that cause major imbalance usually get fixed quickly.The whole ""finding game"" issue is a very minor inconvenience. Oh gee I have to press the button four times instead of once. Not a issue that will drag out the process more than five seconds.Infinite jukes have been fixed. As reward for fixing it the developers were greeted with hate. (fixing the issue tipped the balance back in the killer's favor)If you really care about a rank then you may have issue with the ranking system as it does not promote winning quickly but rather playing like the people in horror films which is an issue when your killer/survivor is a tryhard. (Think dramatic chase scenes and the survivor to narrowly escape only for the killer to pop back in).The insta killer offerings are lame but I've maybe been killed by them about 2 3 times in the 81 hours of gameplay that I've played with each match being about ten minutes.People complain about hook camping which is one of the few things that actually is common. Despite there being obvious disadvantages to doing this people continue to do it. I don't really know how I would fix it so I can't blame the development team for not fixing it either. They're sort of iffy on the issue since I've seen them both say that it is a valid strategy but they seem to frown upon it from judging how they talk about it.About one in every ten games I will come across lag. It's worth noting that if you really despise it then you will need to take that into consideration when you decide on buying the game. Due to the game being built upon a peer to peer system you will have to hope that the killer is not someone who doesnt realize how bad their internet is. A way to test whether someone has bad internet is by typing in pre game chat and seeing the delay. It isn't a fool proof method if the lag isn't so bad that it will delay chat but is bad enough to show up in game but it helps an unfixable issue.The way of progressing through the game is through an RNG system with each level having exactly one perk (random) and other random items which their rarity depends on your level. I have no issue with it but due to RNG being random someone is getting the short end of the stick and isn't happy about it. That's all the major complaints I can think of.If you like the game and really like the gameplay then these issues will not stop you from playing the game.",Dead by Daylight

2018-03-12,0,0,284,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is such a unique game you can experience the game from both the chaser (killer) or the chased (survivor) POV. Quite a simple concept but requires team play strategy (sort of) and luck. Being a multiplayer game you can play with friends (and even kill your friends!)One thing though I do recommend starting as a survivor. Once you understand the game mechanics then try playing the killer You will definitely suffer as a novice killer!,Dead by Daylight
2018-03-12,0,0,255,False,Recommended,I have a complicated relationship with this game but i'm to the point where i can comfortably say i really enjoy it.I started out being too afraid to do much of anything useful. This was back in October 2017 when I bought the game on sale to play with friends who had already been playing. We played some kill your friends together to get the hang of the controls and objectives.After that we jumped into Survive With Friends where we were afraid but we were afraid together. I'll never forget the time we were all sitting in the open exit gate area and Freddy Krueger popped some sort of perk that blocked the exits for a period of time and we all panicked and ran around laughing and freaking out.But then we started playing less because it was frustrating waiting any where from five to fifteen minutes to get into another game if one of us died early and had to sit around and wait for the others.Shortly after The Pig DLC was released a friend and I decided to play some ol DBD cause nothing else sounded fun to play. First game of the night was with The Pig. We knew it was her because we saw the puzzle boxes. I started working on a generator and after twenty seconds i see her about fifteen feet away stalking me and it scares THE SHIRT out of me. I mean I threw my mouse away and half closed my laptop screaming WHAT THE FORK in a VERY high pitched tone. To my credit I hadn't been playing seriously and all other killers (besides the shape but he was tall) had a terror radius that I relied on along with my friends callouts to avoid any surprises. Well that night with the Pig i only played two more games still shaken up. I even had a nightmare that i was being stalked in my own home by Hillbilly and Doctor.That next morning I decided I had to face my fears. No one was online so I logged in and jumped into queue alone. And you know what? I had so much fun. And I still do! I almost exclusively solo queue and now I play more Killer too! Today I bought the Halloween DLC and i had a BLAST playing The Shape no wonder everyone reccommends it! Remember that it is a multiplayer game so expect a certain amount of toxicity but I've found that as long as you throw the ol GG in at the end people seems to hold onto their EZs.This game gets a lot of hate for being such a creative immersive and addictive experience. It's not just one way to play it's many. The bugs have been annoying at times but I think DBD is at a great place right now. I don't play any games like DBD and I wouldn't have thought this was going to be something I'd like but it's one of my favorites to play after a long day in the office and I'm glad I gave it a chance! ),Dead by Daylight

2018-02-04,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,I was really excited about this game for a long time and had high hopes for it. But then the problems started coming in and rather than working to fix them and take into consideration what the community has been saying seriously the developers would much rather make easy money marketing off of popular horror/slasher movie characters and add more stuff that work on existing problems. The problems early on were the lag among other glitches in terms of movment and actions that made things difficult as a survivor. However the most pervasive problem that has not improved in the slightest is the camping from players as the Killer. Non stop time and again there have been Killers who manipulate the game and take away the enjoyment from playing. They have the advantage and are choosing not to play fair and the people who update this game and see this problem consistently have chosen to side with the camping Killers and it appears as though they have gone out of their way to aid them in their slaughter. Maybe instead of adding Killers like Freddy who put everyone to sleep with no means to wake themselves up consider trying to tackle the really issues with the playablity of the game without adding on more issues. Try making it so that if the Killer is within a certian radious of a Survivor that is on the hook for longer than 15 seconds they are immediatley teleported to a different location on the map that is 75 meters away from anybody so as to not put other Survivors at a disadvantage and prevent the manipulation of the game via camping. Because when a Killer camps they do not earn their rank they steal it. If this continues people will see the game as worthless in terms of playing as a Survivor and play as the Killer. But once eveyone plays and camps as the Killer who will they play against? No one. There is nothing wrong with adding new content and creating new fun and unique experiences for players but it should not be the only thing the people updating the game are willing to do. This game needs alot more work and time needs to be spent fixing these issues not brainstorming new ways to pump money out of players via a broken game by adding one shiny new thing.Also on your stream don't say for people to play another game. Beacuse when you show that level of insulting indifference to concerned community members that is just what they'll do play a different game. So be careful what you wish for because it's starting to become true.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-23,0,0,139,False,Not Recommended,The Dev decided that the survivors should not win anymore. There is also no reason to play anything else than the HAG since you cannot save someone from the basement. She can camp without even staying near her target since she can teleport. So no more saving peeps from hook guys cause she can pop out in your face and hit the target again 9 out of 10 times. Is the game even tested by the devs? Are they even playing their own game from time to time? I don't understand why they wanted to kill their own game but if so ... they are doing a splendid job at that. I'm out ...My last review This game is great chase the puny survivors and sacrifice them to the terrible Entity or strive to open the door by repairing generator to get out of the killer's grasp ... and maybe if you there help your fellow survivor to do the same.This is one the most addicting game I've played so far.

2018-03-18,0,0,285,False,Recommended,I am going to recommend this game but please be warned that if you dedicate a significant amount of time to this game you will get frustrated.What I like This is a great game to play with your friends (Survivors up to 4 including yourself) There are some jumpscare moments. Forces you to use your brain and outsmart your opponent. Licensed Killers! Plenty of survivors to choose from.What I don't like Match making is horrendous. (I'll explain below) The game can be unbalanced allowing for a severe advantage over your opponent (killer or survivor) The is fun untill you pass rank 12 (for me) it just feels like a grind after that with rare matches actually being fun.Matchmaking A lot of killers will dodge lobbies if they see Survive with Friends (SWF) They will dodge the lobby for a lot of reasons. Who knows. Survivors will Disconnect mid game if they feel like they are being treated unfair and that screws your entire team. Sometimes you will be matched with higher ranked people and that makes the match a bit more challenging. Sometimes this game feels like lobby simulator after rank 10.I thought the Overwatch community was toxic but this is by far the most toxic community I have ever been a part of. Post game chat is cringy as hell.Honestly it is a fun game and I will continue to play it because it is a unique game in that they really don't have any REAL competition.

2016-11-03,0,0,197,False,Recommended,This is a great game that incorporates a unique 4 vs 1 playstyle. You get very different perspectives and thrills whether you play as the survivor or killer. The game provides a ton of replayability as you try to unlock perks. The game can be very grindy as you attempt to unlock all of the perks you want but the addition of the shrine helps reduce the amount of hours needed.This game does have some flaws. Game lobby wait times used to be unbearable but have been improved greatly. The matchmaking system has seen better days as I often get matched with others nowhere near my rank. There are lots of goofy bugs that work their way into the gameplay but overall I still have a blast playing.Ignore the toxic community that constantly complains about this or that being over powered. The devs have specificly tailored the killers to have the advantage by taking away a lot of the advantages survivors used to exploit (jungle gyms infinites). This doesn't bother me as much as the killers should strike fear into the heart of the survivors. Although it can be very frustrating when you get dominated by a skilled killer who is 10 ranks above you.The devs have put out some great DLC that keeps the game fresh and are constantly tweaking the gameplay based on user feedback.I would definately recommend this game. I would ignore many of the negative reviews you see on here. As you can see many of them have 100 200 or even 1000 hours poured into this game. Yeah its not perfect but its certainly good enough to spend a couple hundered fun hours with.,Dead by Daylight

There is no way to stop them and there is no way to catch them unless they make a mistake which is pretty hard to do.The Devs promised they would fix it back when the game was first released but they didn't.

2016-08-29,0,0,98,False,Recommended,"I would recommend this to some people but would warn that this game is more of an early access game.Edit 10/25/2016 Many of the bugs I originally complained about have been corrected and the game is starting to show direction for how the game play is suppose to be. Survivors are still very similar though and the game now has an impossible grind if you want all of the perks/abilities in the game. Also stealthy players are still not rewarded by in game points at all and in fact aggressive teams get much more out of each match.One positive I did not mention before is that this dev team is on par with the one for Warframe and what I mean by that is that they are very active with community and are always sharing what they are working on at least every 2 weeks.Original review This game is in Beta even if it is not official and I mean a real beta. What the game promises and what it can do now is fun and will only get better but there are MANY bugs that aren't addressed fast enough. The game still feels like it is trying to figure out how its own system for points perk progression and game play work. While I am enjoying the game I am also at least once every time I play getting frustrated by any number of issues that the game has right now.The above statement sums up my thoughts on the game. Their are many bugs like the many issues with matchmaking hit boxes wonky game mechanics and skills/perks not working. Also the game seems confused on what the focus is either its getting the most points so that you rank up or its the interplay with the killer and trying to survive/kill.What the game really lacks a good reward system for being a stealthy player and one that focuses on the objectives. you have four different things that you can get points in and they are capped at a certain amount. What is worse is that 2 of these are very hard to get points in so with the cap on each type of points you usually only do well if you survive.If you never interact with the killer and only get generators or heal teammates you will not rank up at the end of the game and may even go down a rank. What is even worse is that if you die helping out the team by being a distraction or getting people off hooks it almost seems like the game punishes that kind of behavior netting you much less points than the people you saved. The reward system is not robust enough to support different play styles and makes it so during some games you try to get into trouble just to get points and get enough out of the match.My final complaint is that each survivor feels the same. Each ""unique"" perk that a survivor can learn can be taught to the others if you play enough and other than these perks only the cloths/gender is different. If each survivor had other unique stats it would help change up the game a lot.",Dead by Daylight

My earlier review of this game was heavily negative due to what I felt was the broken nature of a few of the killers.

The newer killers are fun to fight against although I have yet to find someone as The Pig. In short this is definitely a better game than the one I experienced in the past.,Dead by Daylight

2017-08-10,0,0,17,False,Recommended,When this game works the way it is supposed too it really is good fun. Some survivor's I've played against have been very great people others not to much. The game is based around a killer trying to hook survivors and sacrifice them to the entity. The killer is OP. And when something is OP you nerf it right? Well that's the problem with this game. Survivors have too much of a fighting chance and great perks to accompany their use of items. That seems to be the general feel of the killer community but because there are 4 survivors to every 1 killer killer nerfs are imminent when survivors feel the game is unfair. The game is based around unfairness . I like the game enough to leave it a positive review but this game could be so much better.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-21,0,0,88,False,Recommended,A great game with brilliant caring loving developers. This game started out to be a bit of a mess with many missing features and bugs but the developers made sure to fix all problems as fast as they could and when they patched the major problems they decided to reward us with amazing DLC characters each killer has a unique playstyle and each of them are brilliant and fun (however some may be way more powerful then others) and each survivor has a unique feeling with each of their teachable perks giving a certain way to gain your currency and increase your rank.

Great fun with friends as well as solo. Only downsides are the community it doesn't run very well and the time it takes to find a game as a survivor can take a while at higher ranks unless you enjoy playing with 300 ping. If you're hesitant about buying wait for a sale. It very commonly goes for $10 whenever it has the chance and I find it to be a steal ) Hope this helps whoever reads this.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-28,0,0,23,False,Recommended,"Game is clearly not balanced correctly without any knowledge of how to play I can wipe teams as the killer and rank up easily never having to worry about losing items or what comp / perks the enemy team has. As a survivor not only is the game stacked against you massively (in balance terms and in mechanics terms) but you will be punished for doing well too. One match I managed to survive and activate 2 3 generators myself got an item out of the map and helped an ally off a hook only to be deranked. There's no leniency if a teammate leaves either you are down a person with a massive disadvantage and dying or leaving will result in you being deranked and losing your items. Having the killer host seems like a reasonable idea until you play against a killer from another continent and it's clear they have no handicap from hosting in another region while your entire team of survivors rubberbands into trees and away from escape ledges. This game clearly needs a lobby type game selection or at the very least some way to specify what rank / level you'd like to play with. I see far to many people lobby hopping but I entirely understand why if they want to rank up at all they have to make sure they don't play with new players or really anyone with low ranking these people tend to never help teammates and hide during critical times when the killer is in a known location far away and should be repairing generators or planning to rescue their teammates. Also none of those new people should have to play against a killer with a full very rare perk set especially if they have few to no perks to use themselves and little to no knowledge of the killer's perks. This is a game it will never be easy to balance I'd even argue it shouldn't be balanced as a healthy sense of fear is really what the survivor's gameplay revolves around. That being said the game should be fun for both sides. Playing survivor feels fun but is a bit frustrating if you hope to keep items or rank up. Playing killer is fun but feels far too easy and a bit stale I had to do very little hunting and searching and spent a lot of time hauling people to hooks. I'll absolutely agree that the killer should have an advantage but specific strategies seem to have some advantages that are a bit too much against certain players having a bear trap under a hooked teammates with the trapper camping nearby means you will have to coordinate with a random person to have one person distract the killer while the other rescues which might be literally impossible depending on the cooperation of the random people you are playing with in a match since there's no way to tell a teammate this in the game but if you were on a VOIP chat system with a friend you could easily manage to communicate that entire plan before trapper could even find a bear trap. Seems like the discrepencies between players very familiar with the game's mechanics and the maps and people that are not along with similar discrepencies between players with VOIP systems and players entering queue alone with no communications have caused some disagreements in the game's community on how this game should be balanced. Many experienced players love the newer changes eschewing exploits that saturated high ranked gameplay and applauding the higher skill bar of playing a survivor but for others it's left some rough edges.The developer has stated that they're going to be tweaking the game's balance but only after the dust has settled from their more recent patches with bug fixes and exploit removals. I'll likely update this review when they do but for now I'm a bit on the fence about this game. I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a really fair and balanced game or anything to play competitively but I might play a bit if it if they can find a way to make the game revolve around something other than ""hook camping"". There seems to be no advantage to helping teammates at the moment as the risk (getting chainsawed or walking on a trap) is far greater than just going and fixing a different generator.Update I wrote the above review when this game had beed fully released for only about a week I haven't played it since but I doubt my review reflects the current state of the game.

The game has little to no future and even the strongest killer (The Nurse) is now getting bullied.

Gotta picture my excitment here at the start of the month i finally bought a gaming pc that could play this. I download it play it and the next day they announce MYERS!! my fav movie of all time and the icon is coming to the game i was so pumped!! So I will say first things first the learning curve sucks for this game! They dont hold your hand you have to pretty much figure out most of the game. At first i had no idea what offerings were etc. over time the better i get im really starting to enjoy this game. I was a little disapointed with the myers halloween update. For $7 I would of liked maybe a few more versions of myers mask and maybe larie strode from the zombie movies as well would of been cool. I understand people hate campers next to the hook after the killer has hooked you but as somone who plays as the killer its annoying how easy they could get off that hook. I really think the developers should fix that!! Make it harder for people to take other people off the hook. Maybe throw a skill check in there while taking them off the hook and if u miss they die! Feel like that would solve the huge ""camper"" issue. Overall i love the game awesome job!! Hope to see some more horror icons pop up in future updates.

At around game 20 30 (you lose track because of how many times you'll die and jump out of matchmaking) we made it rather far. One of the few times this happens to us with only one generator left to turn on the Wraith goes balistic on us. He weeds out the teammates around me as I attempt to close in and unhook them. Inexperience leads to failure and then I listen to my roommate yell behind me as he's hooked and saved and then hooked immediately after. I'm the only sacrifice left I see the sign that I can escape through the hatch but not having covered enough ground to know where it is I just sprint around searching until the Wraith catches up with me. As I jam the A &amp D keys with both hands I'm able to get away from the killer two separate times until on the third time he picks me up starts to carry me in circles once more reaping mad XP because of this and then he suddenly drops me...I see the prompt for the hatch and I freeze up. The Killer is just staring down at me for what felt like a whole minute and then I press the space bar and escape. Our jaws are on the floor at the mercy we had just witnessed. It having been a minute since everyone else died and I was playing struggle and cuddle with the Killer it was just him and I in the chat box afterwards. He says ""lol I felt like you're actually pretty good."" To which all I can say is ""Thank you."" He quickly replies ""GG man"" and I stumbled with shaking fingers to type ""you got your XP I got mine... GG man."" TL DR This is my first review I have no hours in the game but if you stick it out for the rewarding moments you may actually play with a human being and not a psychopath who stares at you after he's hooked you. 7/10 broken moments terrible button mashing unrewarding item system unique perks the most rewarding wins I've ever experienced in a game makes for great stories.",Dead by Daylight

This is me getting 15k bloodpoints plus. Pallets were shrunk to near non existant. Can't even escape through windows anymore. And any response you ask for all you get is ""get good"". Well sadly enough not all of us are top tier 1000 hours into this game. Start listening to the real majority of players and stop listening to the killers who rank up super fast into the top 5%.I rarely write reviews but after a couple hundred hours into this game i regret buying it. The community is straight up toxic if a killer doesn't kill all 4 survivors a ""gg"" is few and far between.And if you do survive and make it out you don't even get to rank up a pip. Even if you hauled ! # getting generators running.Balance for this game is WELL overdue and the community refuses to admit it. I personally have held off purchasing the addons as i see them as a waste of money at this point.If you want to be shafted by admins every step of the way then this is the game for you! If you want a community of killers that will automatically assume you have a group of 4 overly qualified players on survive with friends. This is for you!In reality as not every killer realizes sometimes when you queue as 3 friends you get a brand new survivor that isn't a pro.

It seems like a killer has a way harder time to pip than the survivors do even tho stealth survivors are a little ed aswell because they don't get that many points as they needed to rank up in the new Emblem system that they implemented.Biggest t about this game ? THE COMMUNITY. Out of 20 matches you play a day (doesn't even matter if you are survivor or killer). you have at least 16 people insulting you in the end screen for something you did or even didn't do and they are just mad they lost. XD So many people who think they can insult people just because they are hidden behind a screen and that wouldn't open their mouth if you stood infront of them. I'd ban all of them in a banwave just because the internet would be a better place. Now i don't say don't state your opinion but if you are trying to insult me and use a different language than english or russian at least try to think about that i can speak more than those eventually The game is full of those people. I know you have those everywhere but this is a pathetically huge amount in one game.And with this huge disbalance between killer and surivor and the community + the fact everytime that there is a patch that fixes stuff something different breaks i can and will not recommend it.

If there is any survival/killing game with bright future then i think that i found it. I'm giving 9 5 points out of 10 just because of few annoying hitboxes and glitches. Pros + Amazing atmosphere+ Gruesome killers with amazing special skills+ Genuine soundtrack + Nice looking graphic (not best but for early acces game still good)+ HillbillyCons Few glitches and sometimes annoying hitboxes Not very funny survivors (atleast for me) And medium amount of content (but it's still early acces) Jake Park,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-04,0,0,179,False,Recommended,It's amazing! I am strongly RECOMMEND it to whom thought this game play is very singluar.I heard many voices telling that it is a game which it is a lot more fun to watch others' playing rather than yourselves. But that's totally not true. It seems like quite easy and funny by watching those online show however when you first try this you will be shocked definitely. I died many matches before I got into it and I believe even played up to 100hr cannot ensure that you can escape confidently because 1. devs are debuffing human all the time to make it scary to you. 2. Getting familiar with the all of the maps ( geographys and landmarks are mixed together and sometimes might be sent into a rare map which is very difficult to escape). 3. Although there are many stratergies( we called them TAO LU in Chinese Lol) we are playing with other people for sure which means killers might change themselves by situation and human would thing like a killer that is very fun in deducing opposite side's mind. 4. Every killers have different skills or say talent some might be weak in veterans' (Old Driver's) consideration and the new released one might be too powerful to escaped from it but they all have their own blind spots and advatages utilizing and adjusting these things slightly would cause unexpectable effects! And even the least powerful killer in this version would still daunt you when facing it.Last HAVE FUN and DON'T PANIC to have a TRY because DEAD IS NOT AN ESCAPE and HUMANS are always VICTIMS.best wishes good luck!,Dead by Daylight

Trust me!I played the game about 350 hours and all I can say is Unfortunately the developers patched and updated the game more and more to its death like it is now.Every update making the bugs more worse and don t fix them instead.I can list a few ""bad"" things the game crashes a lot and your offerings (which can be very valuable) are gone with the wind... bugs sound pallets hitboxes laggs weird stuff too points are not shown or counting correctly and so on... can t find a lobby for hours. (alone and with friends) if you find a lobby either the ping is catastrophic or you get disconnected or dodged by the killer as i said before updates are not killing bugs they cause them most of the new killers and survivours you have to buy they sell more and more stuff before making the game works correctly after at least 2 years of release the community is one of the most toxic i ve ever seen if you play fair you get bullied by the suvs and if you play unfair you get more bullied by the suvs or killer the ranking system is complete t and resets every month so rank 1 have to play with rank 20 players and unfortunately many more problemsAnd the best of all ""I think we did a pretty good job so far"" xDIf everyone would work like the dbd devs do then good night...",Dead by Daylight

They have improved the lobbies and I can say that I can smoothly go from one game to another without bugs. One of my issues with the game is that some of the loading times are unreasonable and by the time they are done you either have 1 person with you or your a one man army. The devs have said they are aware about this bug but personally if I worked there I would say that this should take priority. Besides all of this the devs have ""done a pretty good job so far"" and should continue working on bugs and fixing them. At the current state 6/10.

2017-08-28,0,0,549,False,Not Recommended,"edit Just yesterday the game director responded to a player's letter regarding the issue of Killer being extremely frustrating to play (due to SWF Survivors basically controlling the game). His response was ""I don't agree with you. But if it bothers you that much how about you just play Survivor instead?"". Aka ""I don't give a and you're wrong.""Decide for yourself whether you want to support that kind of attitude.Overall an ambitious game trying to blend horror and asymetrical PvP.Despite not being 'scary' per se once you played a couple hours the core combination of the near invulnerable killer searching the map for you as you try not to fail suddenly appearing skillchecks whilst hearing his heartbeat come closer... Still gives me the one or other adrenaline rush. Which is clearly a good point.However more fan of being a killer myself you run around setting up traps or ambushes chasing survivors down and both gameplay scoring and fun intentions lead to you preferring to play with your enemies instead of murdering them flat off. It's a feature that Evolve sorely lacked and that's well done here.However there are a few major downsides to the game Occasionally the game simply freezes. This reoccured at semi predictable patterns and frequently ruined otherwise fun rounds.The game's network bases on P2P centerd around the Killer. Whilst that means Survivors can't abuse ping spikes to teleport about it does mean if the Killer has a crappy connection Survivors are screwed by THE KILLER teleportin around and frequently getting stuck on corners.Gamebalance is made and broken by the items and offerings (one use items) players bring into the match. Some perks make the Killer beyond unstoppable (i.e. a perk that lets Shape one shot assured kill any player he comes close enough too) some items can have the survivors win the game near instantly (the famous 4xSparePart troll that lets the Survivors instantly finish 4 of the 5 generators required). Whilst this does prevent the game from being stale at any point there's just no fun for both sides if one side brings a broken combination of items.Survivors WILL troll a killer if given the chance. It completely breaks the immersion of a horror game if Survivors employ seemingly nonsensical tactics and teabag you from the other side of a fence knowing that due to their perks or map layout they can easily escape you if you try to go around/over it. Whilst we could still argue that this is part of the gameplay it evidently stops if you run into those that will simply afk in a corner of the map for a hour forcing you to play Hide'n'Seek. And personally I do not enjoy having to literally chase the Survivors out the exit gate either. Because you can rely on the last survivor on the map going to wait at the exit minutes if necessary to keep teabagging until you force him to actually end the game.There can be an argument made that this game is starting to lean on the P2W side. Killers are not created equal. Some are very evidently more powerful then others. Of course given the game is alot about not minmaxing your worst but instead toying around with your prey (from the killer's perspective) you can definitely pick one of the weaker killer's and have fun with it. But the mere fact that some of the new DLC killers are notably on a higher powerlevel then others and cannot be unlocked (except for being able to find rare offerings that let you play as no perk no item DLC killer for a single round aka test run) other than with money strikes me as a potential issue.Overall I think this is evidently one of the 'better' 1vsMany action games out there. As for the horror part it's about as good as a non unique story driven horror game can be nowadays. It's just the list of minor issues above that really make me go 'hmmm' on whether to give a positive or negative recommendation. And given there will always be enough people upvoting everything I'll go with downvote here.",Dead by Daylight
2018-01-31,0,0,361,False,Not Recommended,Game might seem fun at first but after several hundred hours i have really begun to see how incredibly unbalaced the game is. In low tier killers seem OP and survivors may get steamrolled.In higher tiers killers are not this scary incredible force they ought to be. High tier games are survivors playing grounds with killers being juked by exploits of many poor game mechanics. Devs have proven time and time again that they do not care about fixing the game rather than spitting out new poorly made dlc (i mean come on just look at Quentin Smith) and making quick bucks. Game had really big potential but devs refuting to fix the problem with their game has ruined it for me.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-29,0,0,632,False,Not Recommended,This game is hard ofr me to easily rate as I find it fun to play aswell as a very anoying game at times. The point of the game Survivor Fix Generaters and escape death. Killer chase people down the entire game and hurt them alot and put them on a hook untill they die. Not much to go off of there until you meet the Killers who put you on a hook and camp you until you die. But no to say you have the Survivors who take the Survivor off the hook right infront of you then they both end up with a stat that gives them a timer before they fall to the floor so they can run away until hit agian or if they are healed before the time runs out. From that I will give it a thumbs down as I just do not understand why we have thingsl ike this.,Dead by Daylight
2017-02-05,0,0,295,False,Recommended,This is a really fun game especially either as a Killer or a Survivor. It is really rewarding when you do your objective right.THE COMPLAIN I HAVE IS THE MATCHMAKING. Aside from it sometimes bugging out and returning me to the lobby or showing infinite loading screen. The BALANCE with other players specifically the killer I don't know how many times I had to face a high rank killer those red ranks Rank 1 mostly and the worst part is my party were like me low ranks the highest probably Rank 18. The only solution I can think of is to grind this out and level up your character till you get your perks but playing against high ranked killers make the grind even harder when you've got a bunch of low ranks versus a high rank killer. Not that it's always in the favour of Killers though there've been times were its Low Rank Killer vs High Rank Survivors. The matchmaking sucks for both ends especially for the beginners as they are forced to keep losing until they grind out their chosen character's level as if this game wasn't grindy enough. This is game is really fun gameplay wise but matchmaking ruins it I won't recommend this game till it gets fixed. UPDATE I tried playing again and it seems they fixed the loading screen problem the UI is more sleek now too. As for the matchmaking I think the only way to fix this is to A) Grind your chosen character and with his/her bloodpoint use it to upgrade your other characters or B) Spam killer and do the same. Then when you get bored use the other characters to mix it up rinse and repeat then suddenly the matchmaking isn't so bad. With this I think I'll recommend it now.,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-28,0,0,1187,False,Recommended,The Huntress is destroying the game for novice survivers. some killers are using overlays to help with aiming which isn't considered hacking but definitely makes it harder for people to duke. After allot of pratice against the Huntress (her style is allow different to other killers) you can survive the game but it wont be busy. I still believe there should be more of a penalty to the speed for perhaps an exhaustion debuff like the nurse has after throwning mutliple axes. my original post was made in haste. I hope that survivers will not turn away from the game and practice duking some more.,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-30,0,0,168,False,Recommended,"This game is an excellent asymetric 4v1 horror game with a problematic community. You can play as any of 8 killers (at this time) each distinict in appearance speed and mechanics. There are also 8 playable survivor characters that are less varied but like the killers have some unique perks to unlock that act as a signature playstyle and each survivor is unique in apperance. Controls and mechanics are simple and easy to learn the survivors need to open the doors and escape the killer needs to kill them all. Despite this as this game is all online PvP there is a steep learning curve for new players that is ultimatly quite rewarding once you put the time in to learn. All matches are ranked so your pefromance will dictate your ranking in every match and your mechanics which dictate performance are different for survivors and killers (at this time). Now the bad. The community is flat out terrible. Ultimatly there are two communities depending on whether you prefer surivor or killer and they hate each other with a passion. I would stay away from the discussion boards unless you are looking at announcements much like you would stay away from YouTube comments. The anger and attitude is even on the reviews for this as each side has play strategies that the other side feels is cheating or is unfair. If you see references to ""camping"" or ""looping"" that is what I am refering to. The lobbies can be long depending on the player make up at that moment some people will disconnect from games to try and screw the other side or avoid losing items. There are occasional bugs but the developers are constantly working on this game.Ultimatly this is a fun game. Give it some time to learn to play ignore the rude folks and give it a go.

This game produces some very interesting situations and even though sometimes there are minor balancing problems this is well thought out.TechnicalThis game still has a lot of bugs even so long after release.Some of these are minor and do not much harm besides making the game feel like it is of bad quality. For example laggy menus temporary freezes in the game menus inconsistently disabled shortcuts for exiting menus and abysmal loading times and bad performance in general. These things make the game feel very cheap.Other bugs are more annoying like inconsitent state of ""ready"" signs in lobbys sometimes the lobby system is completely broken without some kind of explanation why it did not work other games usually dsplay some kind of message indicationg the source of the problem.Almost game breaking bugs include the fact that the game interface especially activation of buttons is very laggy and causes me and others i have talked about to completely mess up our actions sometimes not being able to escape beecaus the interface just switches over from ""disable trap"" to ""unhook"" wchich completely screws you or the escape tunnel not being able to activate even when it is open and standing directly on top of it. The quick tme events on the generators are equally frustrating if there are lag spikes in the network these minigames are imposible to solve and they are laggy in general I feel at least 1/10 second of lag after pushing the key and seeing the needle indicator stop.SummaryWhile this is a really nice game concept and the setting and mechanics are mostyl well thought out and engaging and the graphics are very god in my eyes this game is sadly a very low quality product from a technical point of view.

2018-06-06,0,0,1060,False,Recommended,Now i'm gonna be honest this game is hard and some days even for good players you can have a really frustrating session. They are trying to make the game more friendly to new players but in my opinion you shouldnt buy the game unless you're a patient person or you've watched quiet a few videos of reasonably skilled players ( i recomend HybridPanda or Ohmwrecker's play style as a good example to new players). This way you won't buy the game become enraged and never touch it again a big mistake new players make. For those get into the game dead byb daylight provides excitement that can leave more serious players sweaty after a close game with either killer or survivor. There is a vast variety or playstyles killers and perks that allow for varied games to prevent a feeling of repetition. Though some playstyles are toxic (such as being targetted all match by the killer or have him stay near the hook you're hooked on and for survivors using strong items and perks to their advantage and worst of all teabagging a killer) most games you will play will be fun and fair. The game isnt perfect ( no game is) but i've played it for 500+ hours and still aren't bored... all it takes is persistance to get a decent skill level at the game before you can access the games full potential. So learn the game before you get it and i hope to see you in the fog some time soon.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-18,0,0,188,False,Recommended,Ok i orginally posted a negative comment about this game for personal reasons that this game was bad. now im changing it to postive for a personal reason that has proven to me that this game had light at the end of the tunnel. or sould we say the Darkness at the end of the tunnel since this is a escape or be killed game. Now my Orginal problem with the game was Camping Crying baby hiders and Glitches. Now im changing my Personal Negative side of this game to postive because it has been shown that the devs do care and im going to explain why. im also going to point out at all the people who are crying and complaing and giving this game a bad review for stupid reasons or just cause they are upset.The reason i give this game a good review now and think all the other bad Reviews are stuipd is cause what the devs are trying to achive For example this game has been out for 2 week if the devs Didn't give a about this game then they would be trying to fix it. we saw in the first week they did do a patch but it not the patch that the people wanted. but people are crying cause they want what they want and don't care if the games runs or not. For example the patch we did receive was to fix Gliches and visual Issues or problems that were easy to solve and quick to fix this doesn't seem all that great to most cause well half of us are ing and crying about Party system and cheats or Window Hopping. The other reason is cause the Devs have said it themselfs multi times what they do plan on doing those who are crying and saying the Devs are Quiet have never ever made a game in their life if they have done that or been in a company that does game production they would know very dam well that most Big companies wont just spit out t that doesn't work not stating that compnays haven't ether cause some have Examples would be Esports and of caorse other compnay. The fact they go to lengths to tell us what they have planned is better then nothing i think. to even go on twitch and tell us though that also states that. so thoses who are crying that they don't care this game has only been out for 2 weeks. Name one game that was created and didn't have issues when it was released. cause personally i can think of many multiplayer games that had the same dam issues and im not going to name off a list of them. so all thoses who are critizing saying this game is horrible when really this game is not even close to that. does the game have overpowered Perks on some survivers. yes. Does riot Games Make overpowered champions when they are released.... yes. Did ESO do great when it first released. no. Did blizzard World of warcraft really do great when it was first release.... no. the point im making here is people are bashing and thrashing games now a days that are quicly released with issues or things that do need to be fixxed over time. For bashing on a game that was only released 2 weeks from now is Slightly Stupid and yet immature cause none of this really happened to big time games like League of legends or world of warcraft at it's time. yes people Cried and threw tempertatrums when things were not fixxed but in the end they loved the game and still played it and didn't bash it like it was no ing tomorrow. My personal Belief is as long as they are trying to fix this game it a game that has a chance to Grow into something that is amazing just like what World of warcraft turned into and like League of legends. (Also i know im comparing this game to Big time companies nows that do dam ing well for their games and that not everyone likes these games ether. but my point stands that even those games where not as big as they were when they first started and also had it haters. This game is no exceptions so keep that in mind when deciding to rate this game bad or not)As far as everything else goes like i have said the Devs themself at least try to fix the game and thoses who understand how games creations works for multiplayer those will understand why patches can't just be thrown out the snap of ones finger unless you love to play none playable games instead. just keep that in mind.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-17,0,0,584,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight was and still is in my opinion one of the best multiplayer horror games. Even today almost after two years I still enjoy the game a lot. The game does have it bugs so there is that to keep in mind but I think that with the new updates coming the game is definitively progressing forward.Pro's The Perk system Its a lot of fun to play with friends online or KYF(kill your friends) The amount of content maps customization killers and items make the game last a lot longer without getting boring even if you only have the one objective.Con's Playing killer against organised survivors is frustrating. You cannot kill them without camping and/or tunneling unless you are very good at the game. Rank reset is problematic because when this happens all the high ranking survivors and killers get in games with new players which isn't very fun for the new players. I'm a survivor main but I have to admit that it is easy to let the killer chase you and keep him on you the entire match whilst the other survivors focus down the generators.All in all Dead by daylight is a great game to play with your friends and even solo. If you look past the bugs and sometimes toxic community this can really be a great game for you. Buy the game with a couple of friends and give it a shot your going to enjoy it.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-21,0,0,1917,False,Not Recommended,Survivor Review (When I was a survivor main) The most difficult question I can be asked about this game Do you reccomend this game?It's a fine line a very fine line.Dead by Daylight oh what a ride. I've experienced it all From Facecamped after being immediately chainsawed (At the start of a game) to pulling the last survivor not five feet away from escaping to his death.This game is an 5 player Survival horror game. You survive and you kill. There are many different kinds of players in this game Tryhard point fanatics incompotent allies The almighty professional you name it. The game is a current war between those who mainly play killer and mainly play survivor. They argue over what is fair and what is not. The community is mostly a toxic cesspool over how much the game needs to be fixed. Believe me it definitely needs some fixes but not all of what people whine about.A typical game of mine (As survivor) is as follows.Immediately after spawning I go straight to the closest generator.While fixing the generator I need to watch out for the killer see if he's a sneaky one.While doing this I need to do mind bogglingly difficult (I play the game constantly on around 15 25 FPS) skill checks at random.Rinse and repeat.Some variations of this are The killer hangs a friend and you go to rescue them.The killer chases you until you can juke them or escape.The killer catches you and hangs you.As a killer You just generally hunt down and hang survivors.One thing you NEED to know before you buy is that camping soft hardcore or even insidious is basically cancer in this game.After the killer catches a survivor almost all killers stay within the general vicinity of the hook the survivor is on making it near impossible to save them. Some killers literally stare at their victims until they die. Most times the killer patrols the nearby area. Things tend to turn out that when the victim is actually saved the killer just comes straight back immediately targets the victim because they are already injured and an easy target and immediately puts them back on the hook which kills them faster.Is this game fun? Sure. I enjoy killing people as much as the next guy. The moments that make the game worthwhile are the times when you're an inch away from the messenger of death and he didn't even know you were sitting in the grass right in front of him when you dodge his blade at the last second or get saved by a friend taking the hit for you when he literally hits the locker you are hiding in then walks away.Is it repetitive? Yes very much so. It's made in such a way that it becomes a familiar rythm a routine that one enjoys.Is the game hard? For you? you'll probably be fine the game has a ranking system that matches you against similar skilled players. Me? Well I have a computer under the minimun system requirements. I get about 20 fps and I basically have to predict skill checks to get them. The game is very harsh for me. Despite all that I have been rank 1 (the best) multiple times and I have an extensive collection of look perks and my pride and joy prestige items. You can definitely do the same.Is it worth buying? If you have friends who will play with you definitely. If you plan on playing solo know that the game is basically much much more difficult in most aspects.What is my main goal in the game? It depends on you do you tend to prioritize progess perks and items? You'll mostly be there for the Experience (bloodpoints). Are you a violent sociopath? You're gonna wanna get as many mori's as possible stab people for fun etc. Do I reccomend this game? Begrudingly I wouldn't give up those 400 hours of brutal salt filled low fps days even if I could get them back. They were too much fun.*EDIT* It was my comptuer that caused the FPS issues and 100% not the fault of the game. So don't worry about that. I've since earned a higher quality system and it runs fine. Killer Review Coming back to re evaluate this review 800 hours later from this point on.Don't play this game. Particularly if you wish to play as the killer.It fails to deliver what asymetrical games promise many weaker units against a stronger single unit. Instead it is many stronger units against a weaker single unit. Killers are not killers. They are the true victims. Victims of poor game balance overbalance of the multiple and a sour point when it comes to the developers publically announcing any plans for QoL improvement. The game director told you himself Play survivor or go play a different game.I wrote this section after playing mostly killer for those 800 hours after playing mostly survivor for the first 400 hours. You tell me how differently I reviewed the game in between playing both sides Mathieu Cote (Game Director)'s opinion If you don't have fun in this game don't play it go play sid 5.,Dead by Daylight

2018-03-21,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Had a match where this Claudette sprinted towards a locker and hid in it so I hid in the locker next to her. Next thing I knew she gets out and starts giving away my location to the killer by repeatedly opening and closing my locker.. so I got out and she jumps back inside the locker next to mine. I started spamming open and close on her locker and kept pointing to it in case the killer was around to take care of this cheeky little troll. She just stayed inside there for a solid 20 seconds. Guess she was laughing her butt off cuz I was too. Lucky for us the killer wasn't around. That just made my day. This game never fails to amuse me Then I had another match where the instant I loaded in all the other survivors disconnected at the same time so it was just me and the killer. Either the killer was braindead or he just wanted to toy with me because after he caught me he would spam kick a generator and wait for me to escape his grasp. Then he would be right up on my and down me again. There wasn't an option of finding the escape hatch. The game wanted me to do five generators all by myself. I laughed my butt off and left the match. Well that was a first.. there's a mix of surprises in this game which keeps its entertainment value. This game is a memorable one.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-24,0,0,1183,False,Recommended,Atmospheric asymmetric gameplay which has hidden layers of strategy. Has the classic slasher feel down to a tee.Updated 14/03/17 The devs are trying to concentrate on too many things at once (balancing console versions new killers/survivors bug fixing cosmetics etc) and so updates are not only few and far between but also riddled with bugs. With the community also tearing itself apart I can't recommend at this time.Updated 07/08/17 After getting through a rough patch the game is back in a better place. More frequent updates with more community involvement through challenges with rewards if the community completes them. Also 'cube' updates provide a clear focus on what areas of the game they are improving (e.g. the 'Victory' cube focused on win conditions). There are still plenty of bugs to be ironed out but they don't detract from the experience as much as they used to.,Dead by Daylight

And its even better when you're able to juke out the killer during a chase. Some people claim that Friday the 13th is way better than dead by daylight. The only thing I believe is better about Friday the 13th is how many items you can get. Other then that dead by daylight is way better because you can actually get away from the killer. Most of the time in Friday the 13th the killer will stay on your tail until someone else distracts him or if he just gives up running after you. And that happens rarely. Dead by daylight can feel repetitive at times but overall i feel dead by daylight is better. Definitely recommend both games they are both good.

2016-06-24,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,"Can be fun usually isn't.If you'll hear me out let me explain why it almost always isn't 1. Community toxicity Essentially the community of this game as with most MP games is extremely volatile and toxic. Some examples of this are Racist homophobic trash talk almost always ensues after a match even if everything went normal and fine When you reach higher ranks in the game you get more frequently matched with people who will camp you on the hook until you die ensuring most likely 2 kills and thus ranking up. Rank 1 people are 40 50% campers ruining the feeling of accomplishment and genuine increase in difficulty by ranking up. Any exploit/bug/nerf/buff that is added in a patch will be all you encounter. The current exploit of the month is flashlight saves buffed to basically guarantee the killer drops a player not even a second after the pick up animation finishes and you can't look away until you are 99% blinded and finish the locked animation.2. Bugs Bugs Bugs I have no excuse/explanation why there are still day one style bugs in a game that has been out this long. I don't genuinely play this for the horror element but all it take is one bug and poof you will laugh and chuckle and any tension is gone. Also there have always been game breaking bugs that rarely get addressed. Absolutely astonishing that anyone could have a product not in Early Access and be in this state I would be ashamed as a dev. My current favorite bug just for reference which has been around since the inception of the game is pallet slamming killers is a show. There is like this gamble that the killer might still hit you while being stunned teleport through the pallet to your side or something else but there are genuinely too many pallet related bugs to list.There are literally memes about how buggy this game is. (""Pretty good job so far"")3. Repetitve Lack of Variety There is a lack of replayability that you will probably find around the 20 30 hour mark pretty quick. There is one mode that's right one. It's fun for a while but once you grind up to a decent rank you will encounter the above stated toxic people and lose interest fast. But don't worry you can come back again in like 6 months when you forget about the cruminess and are massively deranked and play it like new again until said ranking is achieved remember how frustrating and unfun the game gets and swear the game away again. Trust me I have done this in excess of 3 times. I'm a glutton for punishment or something just save yourself the frustration.4 The Unspoken/Unenforced Rules So there are a few code of conduct rules that are only enforced by the good part of the community so everyone can have fun in the game. They are as follows hook a survivor and leave them don't camp but come on back if they get unhooked if you'd like heal the injured players whenever possible don't heal them if the killer is approaching as you can lock the heal y in place without their consent make sure to unhook survivors while the killer is away or not in line of sight to give both of you a chance to escape without chase do not body block other survivors or work with the killer to kill othersKnowing all these rules and playing by them ensures that pretty much everyone has fun and that the game is fair. When you start out after the initial learning curve of these rules about 80 90% of games following these rules. Around when you reach rank 12 or higher about 30 40% of games follow these rules.5. Most Importantly The fun goes away it really does. I love what this game tried for and hope that one day the game will actually fix itself somehow but the devs don't care (look at the patches they add it seems they test them less and less and rely solely on the most whiney community members for input) and I have very little hope remaining that it will actually be the case.The only suggestion I would have to aide the game is to implement mechanic's that actually enforce the game's unofficial rules not just point incentives that people stop caring about pretty fast in high ranking matches. That or fix ranking somehow but I have little hopes for that.TL DR I got camped 5 out of 6 matches today on the hook then got trash talked in the lobby for being bad somehow. Fix the bugs fix the game mechanics will that happen I sincerely doubt it. Go watch someone play it on youtube it's the only way to enjoy the game consistently. Recommend HybridPanda on YT he's very good at the game and somehow doesn't rage 99% of the time.",Dead by Daylight

2018-03-03,0,0,22,False,Recommended,"This game is by far my favorite game on steam. The idea of a 1 v 4 hide and seek killer v survivor is a really fun concept. This game is fun to play as both survivors and the killer. Personally I think it's more fun to play as the killer. If you're new to the game I think the killer has more power and wins more. But the more skilled survivors I play against the harder it is the play as the killer. This game is definitely worth the $20.Pros game is fairly balanced (I never find myself winning ever game).The community is helpful in my experience. In a lot of reviews people talk about a ""toxic community"" but I've only seen a handful of trolls.There is a lot of strategy. This game isn't just about running away from the killer. From auras to perks to teamwork and more there's a lot of strategy that can be put into both the survivor and killer. This game is definitely as fun as you make it. Cons people rage quit mid match (and sometimes before the match begins) too much. You have to buy a dlc for every killer/survivor combo (only one killer and survivor comes with each dlc). And then The DLC's are $7 each. Too pricy they need to combine DLC's or make them cheaper.Every so often you find a killer that camps hardcore. A solid number of bugs the exist and slow response from devs.The last thing I have to say about this game Don't take the game too seriously.

If you are playing with friends it gets harder to get into a server as the number of players in your lobby goes up which is backwards. I was trying to find a game with 3 other friends and we ended up finishing a short 30 minute film and we were still searching. If the creators really care about the game they should focus on fixing different aspects of the infrastructure of the game rather than creating DLC and ignoring the pre existing problems.Other then that the game is great! The gameplay in Dead by Daylight allows for different games everytime and guarentees various thrilling moments as you go aganst different killer's and play the map with the generators in different locations every time. The gameplay is rarely ever boring and if you play as killer you never have to worry about getting into a lobby because you create it and each killer has vastly different gameplay styles whereas the survivors just have 3 unique perks.GET THIS GAME7/10 Great game Dire need of bug fixes and system improvements.,Dead by Daylight

From time to time sometimes you deal with face camping killers or trolling survivors. It happens but nothing is as satisfying as killing a trolling survivor or successfully escaping a face camper.

2016-08-31,0,0,474,False,Recommended,Last review June 24th 2017Well a year has passed since DBD came out it dragged me back in since they were researching how many survivor wins vs killer wins so I went back playing to contribute meanwhile I found out they fixed a lot of things (except the random terrain merging bug) and added a lot of things and to my biggest surprise most killers stopped with the camping! So I decided to buy all the missing DLCs to see what they have done... I really like the new killers and maps. Each one adds more diversity to the game. I also learned that the real key for liking this game is not to get salty. Even if I lose I can rate a game 5 stars because I had fun if I had fun. I'm aware now in terms of horror gaming it just doesn't get much better the thrill is all here. It's the voyage that matter most more than the outcome we all die at the end anyway D second review November 19th 2016After mor than three months I will now change my review and the rating because I simply don't feel the love for this game anymore as I did back then... finding a match as a killer has become very hard community is full of trolls devs feels annoyed and annoying I'm not watching the twitch anymore it's a waste of time. Devs have promised us free dlcs and free stuff but now they they've seen how many people play their game they want to sell us every form of garbage packaged as paid DLC. Ok the prices are low but what you get is even lower in terms of value. I'm aware being responsible for such game requires a lot of work and listening to a toxic community that always cries no matter what the devs do. It's a nightmare for them and on the other hand it's a nightmare for us playing against trolls. This game has such opposing poles like Evolve that is bound to create hate when they clash i.e. in almost every match. also gets repetitive as hell and is destined to fail if it goes on like this. Another thing devs are giving uber prestige awards to those who prestiged but they are not aware that the vast majority of those who prestiged did so only because exploting infinites as survivor and camping as a killer. Not that I care much about the rewards I just think it's not fair and I absolutely hate campers and exploiters of infinites and especially teabaggers. In the end I had my fun I invested quite some hours in the game also idling and waiting for matches in the lobby. I liked the game too much at the beginning but I'm tired of it now the magic is gone the love is gone. Idk if I will ever be excited again to start up this game because it does not feel exciting anymore but more like frustrating instead. One last thing I may change my review in the future to positive again if I will feel compelled to do so. One never knows what the future holds. First review September 1st 2016I love this game and it's getting better and better with each update. Looks like the devs are listening to their player community in making it a unique fun and very scary experience that everone who likes horror games must experience. I found my heart racing like crazy! Such rush of adrenaline as you try to get out alive! ...or that feeling of satisfaction every sacrificed victim brings to the killer... I played many horror games in general but this is definitely the best multiplayer horror game I know of. There are still some basic issues that should get fixed tho but don't let that scare you away this game is highly recommended!,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-11,0,0,75,False,Not Recommended,"As much as i've enjoyed the game I cannot recommend it with the dreamcrushing ""lose all progress"" bug. I bought into the game thinking ""oh this sort of thing would NEVER happen to me"" only to have the game wipe my progress 2 times within a 2 week span. The customer service is... automated for the most part. They only confirm your emails once sent and have no problem ignoring any other context that the email has. Ive been waiting for my first set of bloodpoints for nearly a month now with no update except for ""Hello We are currently looking into your issue and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience! BEhaviour""Which is another easily copy pasted email that is sent to everyone with this issue. This update was sent to me 2 days after my submission and has left me 20 days in the dark with no further updates.An alternative to this horrifying bug is to constantly manually back up your cloud data after every session in order to avoid a complete wipe. But unless you do it after every round of playing theres always a risk you might lose SOMETHING. Personally though I dont think for a paid title (that were paying for with hard earned cash) I should be obligated to do ANY sort of manual work when they have servers of their own. This is especially true knowing how many other multiplayer alternatives there are out there who dont have such a frustrating bug.All in all Fun game (especially with friends) ruined by a frustrating bug that ruins an experience so focused on progressing individual characters and killers. Not to mention you lose your competitive rank if you're into that sort of thing.",Dead by Daylight

2016-10-17,0,0,93,False,Recommended,I can't reccomend the game right now only because of the infinitives. If you do not know infinitives are these parts of the map that are at every single generator they consist of barriers and windows. If you do not know the windows and barriers are easy to cross if you are a survivor but takes forever if you are killer. So all they have to do is knock down the barrier and keep running over the barriers and windows and you can't die. You just got to wait for the killer to be stunned then run away. Since I really enjoyed playing killer originally this makes me heartbroken. Now I am forced to give this a bad rating just because I can no longer play killer. Behaviour Interactive please fix these problems.Update They have had tryed to fix these problems to the point that if you get good enough you can but the survivors can still counter (ON SOME MAPS! Can't stress that enough also the Halloween DLC killer is broken with the stalker perk (Seriously it just shows the killer the survivors location).But knowing all this it is still a good game just fix the problems please Behaviour Interactive try your best.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-18,0,0,802,False,Recommended,Alright children get your popcorn its gonna be a long ride so first off i've been playing dead by daylight since like june 2017 i just got back into dead by daylight heres the part of the killers normal killers trapper the trapper is one of the best free killers its probally the killer everyone has played if they have played killer before. The wraith The wraith aka BING BONG is very bad he eats pallets 24/7 if he wants to get someone while uncloacking just body block the guy then you'll be out and hit em. the hillbilly the hillbilly requires lots of skill mainly used to get around the map fast and scare survivors in rank 1 the hillbilly is your worst enemy he is kinda like leatherface.the nurse Alright the nurse requires lots of skill but is very rewarding dont expect to just play the nurse first time and get a kill or two the nurse requires memory useing add on can mess up that memory a true nurse killer wont use add ons mainly because it damages there memory and could make them lose maybe (.the huntress requires some skill not as much as nurse still is rewarding unlike the nurse the huntress is a little faster and can throw projectiles this makes up for her being slow she has a lullaby that can be heard from a distance if you hear the heartebeat RUN that means she right up on you.The cannibal The cannibal is great for camping but only scrubs do that playing leatherface requires making decisions if a survivor is close to window or pallet mallet if you have time use the chainsaw chilli boy doesent require much skill if your a pleb you use insidious with a reved chainsaw outFinally but not least THE PIG opinion time i think the pig is a great stealth character and is basiclly hex ruin as a killer putting traps on survivor slow down the game a lot im not gonna tell you how she works but just use the traps every once in a while dont use them all at the startPros_____For killers pallets getting removed a little )For killers terror radius is a little broken (For survivors Borrowed time saves life )For survivors gens get fast with gen rushing squad's ) (Cons_____This game can be a little buggy (killers can lag swith (the player base will slowly die VERY SLOWLY (For killers most survivors are great and expect to get your butt kicked when you see 4 jakes with boxesTHE END,Dead by Daylight

After 2 weeks i tried to play a match and matchmaking couldn't find me any match. But when the new update has come out (A lullaby for the dark) the game found me matches and i played a lot SWF. Then i played for 100+ Hours and i like it soooo much. Only three problems about this game 1) Matchmaking is bad so when i play a match my teammates have rank 20 and i have rank 12. 2) The game files are in yor computer so when reinstalling Dead By Daylight or Windows all your progress is lost. 3) Laggy matches. Killers host the match so when you see a laggy killer and you press Alt+F4 an lose 3 pips well that's not funny at all In conclusion that uniqe concept of horror game is godd but it laks some fetures. I recommend this game . I give 10/10. Thx for reading and i recomend it ! Update After some months the game is still my favourite but the community is dying every day even with those new features.

2018-04-19,0,0,554,False,Recommended,For what it is a horror game that simulates both the hunter and the hunted this game is very good and very fun but...It SUCKS being a new player. Veteran players already have a HUGE advantage over new players in mastering the mechanics and maps of the game but as a new player you're going up against people who ALSO have full perk setups when you're starting out with none (in beginner matches). If this company wants to net gain rather than net lose players they would be well advised to try and bring a little more equity to the new/early player experience. Perhaps implement perk limitations by match Rank (1 perk max for Rank 16 20 2 perks for Rank 11 15 3 perks for Rank 6 10 4 perks for Ranks 1 5) to help make low rank matches more competitive rather than the bloodpoint farm they often seem to be for veteran players.I'm recommending this game but with a WARNING to new players. Just go in expecting to get crushed (and sometimes trolled) for your first many games and you'll have more and more moments that are remarkably fun in a way that is unique to this game.*EDIT*Since my review there have been some updates to the way matchmaking and ranking occurs that help remedy my earlier complaint about early matches being unrelentingly imbalanced for the new player. The situation has changed for the better. The developer has also been very timely with the release of new costumes maps killers and survivors which is admirable.,Dead by Daylight

2018-01-06,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Deep down there is a very fun game at the core of Dead by Daylight. Unfortunately it utilizes a perk system which means until you've played the game for hours other players including your opponents are going to have mechanical advantages over you in game such as seeing you through walls getting buffs to their movement speed and increasing the time required to complete quicktime events required to win the game. You are expected to spend hours completing games and gaining xp (Which will not carry over between individual characters) just to end up on a level playing field with experienced players. There is no way to play online with random players without running into this problem. Unless you have 4 other friends who also own this game and are willing to play in private matches I cannot reccomend this game to anyone,Dead by Daylight

He'll survive no matter what. As others spent hours being seen in high school. He spent hours becoming invisible and avoiding danger. And it doesn't matter if it's dangers in the hallway or dangers in the woods. Survival is key. As other employees panic when terror infects them Dwight makes use of his disturbing teen experience.

This game doesnt have maps as big but it is still very balanced and alot more details in the texure. Even on medium the graphics are still pretty amazing. I reccomend to grab a friend because there is no voice chat in the game.

Nice ing game.Have I mentioned the devs way to balance is to add perks that counter sometihng which ends up doing 2 things A. 90% of perks are useless 2 are must have no matter what (DS and SC for survs Whispers and perk to stall the game like ruin for killers)B. You need to buy the DLC or wait for RNG shrine to give you an option to buy a perk you absolutly need to play the game like Franklin's demise or BBQ right now for killers.

2018-02-01,0,0,475,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a neat ol' ""horror"" game where 4 survivors go against 1 killer all of which are players. The survivors are tasked with repairing generators and opening the exit doors then leaving and the killer has to stop that from happening and slaughter everybody. ""You put horror in quotes! You don't think it's scary?"" After 100 hours the game is less scary and more spooky. It can still be unnerving but if you hide in a locker the entire game your team will lose so acting scared gets you killed. Once you start acting brave you slowly realize ""Hey this isn't so bad!"" and decide that your team needs you working otherwise it's game over. There are scary moments like when you realize ""How long has Micheal been stalking me for?"" or ""Where's the Wraith?""But regardless you are tasked with dealing with your fear for the greater good. All the killers are unique but there is a tier list and such based on their skill caps which makes the game sound pay2win but all the high tier killers are actually without DLC's. + the pay2win part is in a game that is already $20 so hey what can ya do? There are perks that you can unlock for each killer and survivor so you can make your own builds and such however you want to play. If you just throw perks together chances are you'll get boned but that doesn't mean there are few working builds you can make TONS of them based on your playstyle. Regardless sometimes you get sadistic teammates and altruistic killers but the majority of the time it's you in a horror movie having a grand ol' time. 9.5/10 Leatherface needs to be removed.",Dead by Daylight

2017-12-02,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly this game isn't really skill based or ""asymetrical"" at all. An asymetrical player v. player game consists of a single entity that is overpowered and a group that is extremely underpowered but has the single unit bested in numbers. This game does that all wrong. The survivor team is overly powerful in the fact that they have perks that can make it 100% impossible to kill someone in the end game ""Borrowed Time"" being the biggest example. And for killers like FREDDY FRICKEN KRUEGAR (a killer who is literally known for making his own rules) this game just simply doesn't do justice. Ususally I find survivors to just run circles around the killer and stick around at the exits just in sake of taunting the killer because of his/her weakness. All in all I feel as though this game is a disgrace to big horror characters like Michael Myers Leatherface Freddy Kruegar and now Jigsaw. I honestly find it to be quite a disgrace to the horror genre as a whole a genre that means very much to me. This game seems to be much more about the pallets than anything else. I do believe that this is a good concept for a horror game and even that it was great in its earlier stages but as it is now it seems a lazy excuse for bringing great characters to a situation that makes them look like idiots. I hope that this game can one day be great because as I see it now I wish i could return this game with all of its extra DLC because I feel that the $60+ price tag for this game and all of its extras is just not anywhere near worth it.",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-16,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,It's fun when you can actually find a lobby. There are some frustrating mechanics when playing the killer such as spots where it's impossible to catch survivors if you're playing a certain killer and if they play ring around the rosey with a window but I only play the nurse now so now I have people complaining about me breaking game mechanics rather than the other way around.Edit Nurse was nerfed there are still spots survivors are immune game is too easy for survivors at high ranks.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,151,False,Recommended,A really fun atmospheric game that needs some further development. The inability to form a friends match is a real bug bear. My friends and I tried for half and hour to randomly meet up in a lobby! if you dont know 4 people with the game the lack of in game voice or chat can deminish the team experience. Once these are added and alittle more map variety all are fairly similar in look and art style I would definitely recommendUpdate the matchmaking has definitely improved no more long wait times to find a game.You can mostly meet up with friends for a game.Still no in game chat developers feel this would give too much of an advantage to the survivers.This game still gives me the willys when im being chased its really good fun when it works. And mostly it does. Play with friends and use VOIP youll have a blast,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-18,0,0,2621,False,Not Recommended,I love this game The game and The Last Breath update/Free DLC is fun! People are complaining about bad matchmaking today (release of The Last Breath DLC) when yeah it is terrible at times. But well worth the wait. Slow matchmaking on a Play for Free weekend + DLC release day is expected just because it will have more traffic than usual. But regardless I think this game is fantastic! I play both Killer and Survivor and love both equally people who are also complaining are mad because they aren't balanced. But they aren't supposed to be it's an ASYMMETRICAL game. Anyway I think it's great and would recommend it to everyone that likes Survival and Horror games.Edit on Jan. 9th 2018 I now have 1720+ hours in the game I have put about 800 hours into Killer the rest into Survivor. I occasionally enjoy this game but it feels completely different from when I left my first review. There are still some bugs that exist since the beginning (Pallets that spawn incorrectly and missing textures only one two or three people loading into a match instead of the required four and so on.) Most importantly the Devs need to rework their maps currently they are way too RNG based and a few game mechanics need to be fixed (Decisive Strike Survivor Perk Instantly Throwable Huntress Hatches (Due to Add Ons Flower Babushka &amp Manna Grass Braid along with the Perk Tinkerer) Bloodlust needs to either be slower or Bloodlust Tier 3 needs to be removed. I do recommend this game for a group of friends who would play it for fun and not competitively otherwise the community is terrible.Edit on July 31st 2018 (Changed to Not Recommended) Great community 10/10 would NOT recommend. Survivors or Killers complain about every single thing you do you can't make anyone happy if you're buying this game for KYF I recommend it. Other than that the community turned it into complete garbage. Do note that there are still some amazing people out there in the game but you get more bad than good. Also yes I still play the game but I won't recommend it for new buyers.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-21,0,0,176,False,Recommended,"9/10I throughly enjoy this game. I feel that the game is balance it rewards smart plays punishes bad ones. I hear a lot of negative thoughts on the game and what I have to say in regard to those? 'You're not doing it Right'. ""The Killers are too Weak"" Correction you're not playing them right. Playing the killers requires thought before action play mind games with the survivors. I see a lot of killers attempting to just straight up chase and kill like the climax of a horror movie you need to build up to the climax where the survior is desperate to leave. Make them panic make them make choices faster you need to control both sides of emotions and thoughts ""Survivors are too Weak"" Survivors also have to play mind games this does not mean find one spot and jump over it constantly you will die this way to a smart killer. The flashlight 'does' work but you need to know how to aim at the face not wiggle it around like you're shooing the killer. The medkit is helpful because that means you won't get hit once and fall next time the tool box may not seem like it speeds up repairs but it does.Overall the complaining of this game gets me pretty down the developers are pretty good they can add a few features and tweak a few mechanics but I throughly believe this game to be good.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-24,0,0,298,False,Recommended,"I nominated this game for ""The Villan Most in Need of a Hug"" award. At first this might sound weird. But look a the backstories of some of the killers most notably the Hillbilly. Anyway this game is fun. It's hard to get tha hang of but then once you get it you can get twelve thousand bloodpoints per game easy. I mostly play survivor because I play with my friends but I'm much better as a killer. Both sides are balanced as the survivors if they know what they are doing can easily hide and not get found or if they are found get away. The killers are balanced. Trapper can place traps in random places or stagegically to catch the survivors off guard but the traps can be sabatoged and avoided. The Hillbilly can knock people down instantly and traverse the map quickly but if you avoid his chainsaw he becomes stunned and that can make the difference between life and death. The Wraith's stealth abilites can be seen through by using premonition and spine chill and if you don't have those his breathing is quite loud. The Nurse's teleport is easily avoided and can stun her letting you get very far away. And finally Michael. The one eveyone has been compaining about. Sure he's annoying. His first stage he might as well not have a heartbeat and pemonition and spine chill don't work. But he's slow and can't lunge very far in that stage. His second stage increases that heartbeat range and his speed but it's still not as fast as the other killers. Now the third stage is a bit of a weird one to try and give reasons for it being balanced. It's instant knockdown super fast and normal heartbeat. But it dosen't last forever. And if you can escape and hide from him you can waste it. Then he has to waste more time stalking people to fill that bar up again. The survivors on the other hand aren't balanced. I mean that in the way of one survivor being better than another. Claudette's self heal is definately better than Dwight's prove thyself. But I do recommend it. Get it. Play it. We could always use more survivors in our ranks.",Dead by Daylight

It's decent fun but the queue balance is awful. you will constistantly be placed against players with much higher level survivors and killers. So you may have one or 2 perks at level one each with a few common add ons they will have 4 level 3 perks and 2 add ons with one possibly being a very rare (or both). playing a new killer or survivor will feel impossible because certain perks are required in order to do anything. and matches arent selected by rank of killer vs avg of survivors.

2016-08-20,0,0,424,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Dead by Daylight is a 1 v 4 horror survival game that really needs more things to be added. For example singleplayer. Bots would be great. Also some minor improvements and changes could be made. The Nurse has a stupid amount of bugs like teleporting THROUGH THE MAP and getting stuck in places that not accessable. Michael Myers should be changed a little bit too. His ability to mask his heartbeat is incredibly useful but also very unfair. Most of the concepts and killers are based off of real things. Most likely. The trapper is a big hulking dude that has a large machete like weapon who has extreme loyalty to a family memeber and also wears a mask. The hillbilly has a hammer and chainsaw a covered deformed face and hangs people on hooks. If that's not Leatherface from Texas chainsaw Massacre I don't know what is. However it is nice to see some creative twists on the originals. I'll always like the originals better but these look alikes are also very good too. In conclusion this game could use a lot more polish and added stuff but it is SUPER FUN to play with a group of friends. You can find videos of people playing it together just having the time of their lives This game could be much better. I'm just gonna wait for Friday the Thirteenth.Update.

2017-08-09,0,0,965,False,Not Recommended,Absolutely love this game as a former L4D player.It's fun to play both sides especially when you get at one side vs the other.Pros Great concept graphics gameplay mechanics.Cons Aside from cancerous players (people who DC killers who face camp) there are some server issues I consistently experience when playing with friends (lobby host for Survive With Friends disconnects before game starts).EDIT All my stuff was deleted/wiped with new update. This is a consistent problem for a number of people and I think it's a shame. So I'm done.,Dead by Daylight
2017-04-02,0,0,140,False,Recommended,The game is a bit wobbley but executes it's mechanics very well. the game is tense and stressful and gives you a good rush as you're running from a killer. However it's a bit unbalanced. it has serious issues when it comes to Killer balancing. though the devs are pretty ambitious when it comes to new tricks for killers which i can applaud. as a survivor your issues come from getting caught. base line. you'll complain about the killers being unbalanced but in reality it's a massive game of hide and seek. if you get caught you lose. so once you learn how to properly hide from and evade the killer. you're golden.TL DR Has it's flaws but is fun overall once you grasp it,Dead by Daylight

They don't care about the community or listen to feedback. It's all about the $. In one of their streams they said they haven't had to put ANY overtime into this game! Even when there was game breaking exploits delayed patches (waited over 3 4 months for it to come out when it was promised) and players unable to play due to freezes!

I am a huge fan and will continue to be it has it's flaws of course. The SWF option is still very broken and refuses to work I hope they get to that soon as they claim to. Aside from the occasional laggy killer the broken SWF and toxic community the game is loads of fun has interesting lore and the DLC is also very cool.,Dead by Daylight

2018-06-17,0,0,109,False,Recommended,Hey you Before I bought the game myself I played it for free when the had this special deal going. When I played it for free I had enormous amount of fun playing the game with friends and other people from the DBD community. There were great killers and a lot of nice people you meet in a match however now I bought the game most of that seems to have disappeared. Killers are camping in your face or so close nobody can come near you when your hooked. Other Survivors take longer to rescue you or don t even come to help you (this could be because of killers face camping ). I am not saying this goes for everyone there are still a lot of good people playing this game who don t. It just now I bought the game it seems I am getting placed into bad matches. I am recommend the game just because I had a lot of fun playing it however there are some issues with this game but then again every game has it s issues.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-22,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Currently the game is unplayable if you try to join a game as a group of three or more. You'll sit in the matchmaking queue for over 30 minutes to no avail. The devs haven't said anything about this problem even though it's a common thread on the forums. If you're looking to play as a group don't bother with this game.Edit Survive with friends has been fixed so I can now recommend the game.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-15,0,0,277,False,Not Recommended,Really tried to like this game. If you haven't put in 200 hrs you're going to get outmatched constantly. Experienced players have so many perks (which many are shamelessly OP) that it's impossible to have a fun experience as a new killer or survivor. I played survivor for about 55 hours and match making kept putting me in games with killers that have hundreds of hours and all maxed out perks. Then I tried to play killer and was again matched with survivors that have hundreds of hours. If you haven't play for hundreds of hours it's too late to enjoy this game. Unless you enjoy waiting 10 mins for a game and losing very quickly. I'm finally giving up on this game. Maybe they'll fix their matchmaking. Expect to run into cheaters as well.,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-16,0,0,83,False,Recommended,This is a hard one to swallow but i'm still recommending it. I love the game and the gameplay is good especially with a group of friends or if your alone its still as enjoyable (so long as your the killer and not some pub group).It's just the developers haven't been making the best decisions for the game. I can understand the paid dlc for the new killer and the charcters so that they can make more content and new maps but the cash shop they've put in is a step too far in my opinion it feels like Smite's unlocking system (which would be fine) if they didn't already have paid dlc for the game. Still though other than that this game is still worth picking up in my opinion even with its poor development team it has given me and my friends a good laugh a few scares and thats what games are for really at the end of the day enjoying yourself so I'd still recommend it.,Dead by Daylight
2017-12-31,0,0,699,False,Recommended,Product received for free. CURRENT REVIEW. 1/31/2018The game is fun but as you get higher up in ranks the balance issues become quite glaring.You can do well with the Killer but your success more hinges on survivors making bad plays rather than you making good ones. Don't get me wrong you can definately tell a difference between a good and bad killer but the survivors dictate the match.If they play overly altruistic you can capitalize on the time they waste but if they use their time wisely the gens will be done in a very short ammount of time. Survivors can ultimately bully the killer at higher skill levels tea bagging and taunting all along the way. A competant team of survivors can easily get 3 survivors out alive if not all 4 against a killer equally competant.Killers have some tricks they can perform but most of the cards are in the survivors hands.It is fun it is also very frustrating at times the toxic community ( mainly on the survivor side ) make it even more so.It's kinda weird when a game makes you feel bad for the killer.OLD REVIEWI deleted my last review but it's still acurate.Basically if you are good at survivor you're permitted to be a total butthead and unless you're facing a perfect killer player AND they are playing nurse they can't do anything about it.Have fun with the survivor bias and the buttheads who play them.I've played in a lot of toxic communties (WOW LoL Dota 2. . .) but this is by far the worst and it all comes from the killer having NO recourse agaisnt cheap and lame survivor tactics and survivors having a way out for just about anything the killer does. As a killer you can't even facecamp ( which is pretty much the lamest thing a killer can do ) and get a kill 100% because of borrowed time aka get out of jail free card#213375689127 for survivors.It's a fun concept but the incompetance in the management ruins it.,Dead by Daylight

I might have little time on the game but here's my experience with the game.Overall rating 8.5/10Pros Intense atmoshphere An AMAZING price for the amount of content it offers Its a good game to play with freinds OR by yourself Prety bug free. (there are some but few and non game breaking) really good net code (it blows some triple A titles out of the water) Decently sized comunity so it doesnt take to long to find a match Comunity is not to toxix (you will get the occasional try hard who is a stuck up Not an extreme learning curve but enought to actually feel like you're improving The graphics are amazing The game is well optimized (i got an alienware aurora r6 pc for the hollidays and its held this game up well!. My specs are at the bottom of the review)Now for the cons. There is no tutorial so you kinda wing it and hope you're actualy helping the team or playing killer right It's a bit pay to win with Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers If someone disconects there isnt much of a penalty so far ive only seen people get instant losses when the dc so no real punishment The level system could use a rework since it forces you to choose a main between being a killer or survivor then proceeds to force you to choose a main beetween each character of said choice Leather face is literally a reskin of the hillbilly but considerd a different killerThats prety much it.

When I started it was fun but the more I've gotten into it the more monotonous it is and the community is purely toxic. You have a bunch a people who only want to play survivor and a bunch of people playing killer and both sides are screaming at each other about how unfair the other side has it in terms of tweaks to the game. The biggest flaw I'm finding right now is that you have killers camping survivors that they hooked moreso since they implemented the emblem system. It makes the game excrutiatingly boring. Assuming you don't want to screw over your team if you're hooked you're just sitting there staring at the killer. If someone else is hooked and camped you're just performing endless skill checks on gens with no one chasing you. If I could get my money back I would.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-13,0,0,178,False,Recommended,Amazing game but not without a few hitches. It's very immersive fun and interesting once you get the hang of it. Matchmaking at present can pose a steeper learning curve for new players (recommend playing with a friend) due to high ranks vs low etc. But that presents another problem in that the lobbying of the game is cumbersome and it can take a long time to get you into the game. The Devs have acknowledged this and considering Survive With Friends is fairly new as well as the game itself it's understandable that tweaks are being fixed.I appreciate the continued updates from the Devs &amp their livestreams where questions from fans are answered (can attest to this mine was!) and they provided a lot of information on upcoming releases (chapters bug fixes etc.) as well as answering questions and taking into account player problems and feedback. Mattieu has said he reads the steam forums a lot (lore especially) and that sort of interaction with Devs/ open communication is appreciated.tl dr Very good game a few problems but it's a new release &amp Devs have acknowledged and said they are working on fixes.

2016-06-14,0,0,1095,False,Recommended,ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT UPDATE 11/25/16 NOW 400+ HRS IN....Yeah still crack addiction....IMPORTANT UPDATE 9/19/16 &amp HUNDREDS OF HOURS LATER...Dead By Daylight equals crack addiction and I ve spent far longer playing it than I thought I would largely due to its continued popularity as it s multiplayer only so unless the devs can add in the ability to play solo w/ bots (which would defeat the whole purpose of a game like this but would still be nice for when there are no longer peeps playing) there is no other way to play it.Granted getting my Dwight Fairfield to P3LV50 was so maddeningly frustrating at times when considering the fact that I didn t procure the sprint self heal or sabotage perks even one time (for reals I don t recall them having ever been made available to me while leveling ) that I felt like throwing my controller through a window then throwing the remains of that window through another window. But that aside who would have thought that starting up generators and tipping over pallets as a survivor for hundreds of hours could be so fun. Generators are typically how you ll survive a match and you need to power up 5 of them to activate the exit doors of which there are 2. There s also the exit hatch that can be seen once enough generators are powered up and you can either use a skeleton key in advance to escape though those are an ultra rare item or you can survive long enough to be the last survivor and it will open for you if you know where to find it. Being a killer can be fun too but in my opinion the nurse is totally unbalanced and against her the pallets are virtually useless.One of the best things to have come from this game for me besides fond memories and the lingering creeping dread and tension of trying to survive is the fact that I ve spent far longer leveling up characters in this game than in any other I ve played to date which now makes me feel that leveling up a character in a different game will no longer be anywhere near as frustrating or as time consuming as it sometimes seems to be.Behav10r simply put you have made the best 4v1 survival horror game to date please make more in the future (oh and be sure to make at least one of the male characters have an immaculate Dwight like stache) ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM LATE JUNE/EARLY JULY Do you like cornfields? Do you like powering on machines? Junkyards? Estates? Chainsaws? Hooks? Sacrifices? Perks items burnt offerings hillbilly killers crows and quite possibly pooping in your pants? Well my friends if you can say 'YES' to any of those things then you'll love this game. It looks good plays great and killing or being killed has never been more fun.,Dead by Daylight

2016-11-25,0,0,5,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Really starting to like this game. Playing as the survivor is very intense and addicting. Stealth is the name of the game so you better be patient or you will end up on the hook. Level up your character and get perks and items in your inventory that you can use to help you escape. You can also play as the killer and use different items and perks to get the survivors and kill them.It could be a bit buggy sometimes but its worth the money try to buy this game with friends.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-15,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Very fun 4v1 game. Surviving with a group of your friends is exciting and fun and playing as a killer when no friends are available also has its own thrills. Playing as a survivor can be repetitive but the experience is way better with one or more friends. 10/10 would get shooketh by the wraith again.PS. Please add killers like Hannibal Lector Chucky the doll Frankenstein Damien Thorn (the omen) Ghostface (Scream) Samara Morgan (the ring) Jack Torrance (the Shinning) dracula or the xenomorph (alien). Any of these killers would be really cool to play as and avoid!,Dead by Daylight

Lobby uncontrolled leaving good players leaving and restarting matches to match up with better players (bad). No friend option for public matches (bad). No in game chat or voice within distance chat (biggest pet peeve).Most of the things I have listed are bad but I feel they will be fixed.

There's issues with balancing of every aspect from point balancing to character balancing this game is always updating and coming up with patches in response to player criticisms and demands (to some degree). It has every issue any multiplayer game has considering that winning is dependent on your teamates making smart choices and not putting you in an easily defeatable position or D/C early.

2017-02-17,0,0,408,False,Recommended,Hello my current name is Xyltice and I would like to adress an issue that has plagued some peoples computers ever since the new Valentine's day/Chinese new year update came out.Some things to note is that I currently have 286.1 hrs on the game I will give this review a thumbs up (even though I am adressing issues) and that the issue I am talking about no longer effects me (It used to and I don't know why).So let's now dive into this review.Dead by Daylight is an indie multiplayer horror game based around a person playing as a killer hunting down the 4 survivors who are also being played by other real people. The killer has to hunt down the survivors beat them down and put them on hooks. Whilst the survivors have to power up 5 gens out of 7 open an exit gate and escape.In it's days prior to the new update Dead by daylight has it may have been buggy or laggy at times but it was a god damn fun game to play with a balanced addicting levelling system. You could expand your playstyles by levelling up your chosen character or pick a new one to play. This goes both with survivors and killers.The graphics are neat especially after the new update and there is quite a lot of content for $20 if Dead by Daylight was still in the state it was before the update I would've suggested this game to everyone. But now I would only suggest it to people who have really good computers. And heres why.Frames. Dead by Daylight for me runs at around the 30fps which is considered a requirement for most games have 25 frames and you will start feeling like you are lagging and cannot control the actions of what you would normally accomplish at 30 frames. So when the devs decided to update their game with new graphics mechanics and content. People's computers couldnt take it. And are now playing at 10 20 frames.This is a huge problem as yes it may affect a little portion of the fanbase but that means that they can't play anymore. I thought I had this problem as well as one time I was playing nurse (one of the killers) and couldnt hit most of my strikes. For now I don't have this issue yet other people still do. This isn't something that can't be fixed easily either. But I'm just here to give a review.I do not reccomend most people Dead by Daylight in it's current state. I would've prior to the update but unfortuneatly that is not the case. Only buy this game if you know you can run it. Otherwise you might regret paying $20. I don't know if this issue still exists but I will still give you notice. I hope this Warning/Review/Adress helped you and I hope you have a nice day. Xyltice,Dead by Daylight
2018-06-04,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Good game only a few new issues with this new update and killer. 1st The new killer is kinda Op as set with the best perks he is unbeatable as well as this his throwable splash area is huge I think as I've had two games with him and the throwable is a big issue. 2nd There seems to be a glitch or latancy with jumpping over objects example is when I tried to vault a wooden crate my character seem to repostion which gave the killer a massive window to kill me and down me. 3 The perk Deerstalker is really OP as well as other perks that allow the killer to see suvivers through objects within a medium range which is annoying for some maps. Lastly the kills that have a sneak like mode example The Pig Amanda Young he crouch is highly annoying at the fact that a game basiced one sound and heartbeats to take that away from the suvivors renders some games pointless I've had many games where The Pig mainly has been able to kill a whole team within minutes of the game starting.These are something that I see are letting down this game which is sad because for the most part it is fun and all around enjoyable just these problems drag it down.Face Camping needs to be address too.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-18,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Great game and great graphics. Well worth the money and time spent on this game.,Dead by Daylight
2018-07-15,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR Game gets repetitive very fast and it's not competitive by any means. Developers can't fix core problems instead introduce OP perks to make things more balanced and that leads to unfun experience in my opinion. It is also very close to P2W experience because some ""meta perks"" are tied to DLC character's. Also there are no dedicated servers the killer player is always server host so expect some laggy games with people that have poor connection or do some intentional lagging/cheating. So this game is one of those games that is great on paper but have poor execution. Don't get me wrong this game is really fun for few hours and could be for even more if you have casual mindset and just want to play something to pass the time. The thing that get me hooked to this game the most was character progression and leveling. I often found myself in situation where I just played another match because I wanted to see if perk I want will show on next level up but this can take you only so far. I bought the game because I watched one of the streamers I enjoy to watch playing this game and population was quite high. Huge mistake got hyped and I regret it highly. It's like the first time I got baited into game like that but lesson learned.I played survivor mostly and the game boils down to constant repairing generators runnig from the killer for a while getting hooked and repeating the whole process. Forget about stealthy plays this is not what the devs are aiming for in this game. Killers have plenty of ""wallhack perks"" and can spot you easily or they are aware you are near them. Here is the latest dev stream where they talk about it https //www.twitch.tv/videos/283820197?t 55m48sThey so called ranking system is pure abomination. If you want to rank up you have to forget about your main objective of the game escape. No no. You have to be chased or help people that were hooked and/or heal them. If you do your job and fix generators as fast as possible and escape you will not get enough match points in ""emblem categories"" to rank up.This balance problem is tied to another problem called ""toxic survivors"" friends join lobby as a team to play versus the killer. They use flashlights to blind killer so he drops person he was carrying to the hook. They also body block him and distract whole game and run in loops to waste his time etc. while someone is doing generators. To make it worse survivors have some nasty perks too and by nasty I mean unfun for the killer for instance they can suddenly escape from the killer grasp on demand (and that can lead to killer camping the hooked survivor and ignoring everyone or focusing one survivor just to get the kill imaging you are the person that gets treatment like that zero fun guaranteed).The perks topic is a big beast that have many more problems but it shows the balance approach of the developers. They will throw more and more perks to balance the game instead of trying to fix the core problems. And here is one thing I wasn't aware off this whole perk system is very close to P2W experience. Each character in game have 3 unique perks you can level that character so the perks get unlocked for other characters ( 20h). But some character's can be obtained only by buying DLC. Some can be bought for in game currency but it takes very very long to get enough to buy one! In my 50h game time I gained 7k of that currency it takes 9k to buy one character. If there are multiple perks that are currently meta or must have prepare your wallet and some time cause even if you buy character you want you still have to level him up. And you if go for specific build you better start prying to the RNG gods right now cause the perks you are aiming for may not show on that character in the next few hours because they are random. There is also this thing called Shrine of Secrets that once per week have 4 random unlockable perks to buy just for 2k in game currency what a deal!So the last aspect I really don't like about this game is that there are almost no graphics options to set in game. You can chose between low mediun high ultra only. This game is on Unreal Engine so you can change some settings in config file but man this speak miles about those developers. Game is out for 2 years now. There is not even borderless window mode.On closer here is a video I just found from someone that was playing this game a lot it shows how this game is on higher ranks and how developers approach this game https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 4kwvMKjXp94 I wish I would find it before I decided to buy this game.",Dead by Daylight

Finding a match online requires queuing about 15+ times and often after being matched your game is dropped and you have to return to the menu and reinvite your friend(s) to restart the cycle. Basically a total disappointment when trying to play alone because I only have one friend. The game itself is very interesting and well done but again the online matchmaking is garbage and makes me want to die by day light .

2017-12-30,0,0,634,False,Recommended,"I really liked DBD! It had a very promising concept upon being released and held up to its name. I used to think that the killers were rather powerful since I had been playing with a smaller group of people but upon playing the game online with rankings and others in a full team I do think that the killers stand less of a chance against larger groups of players. This especially goes for those working together in a chat.I think what really helps would be a customization center that the killer could establish or one where survivors establish and killers can peruse for matches based on those settings. Things like Perk limitations rankings items maybe. I hadn't noticed this so called ""toxic fan base"" yet but I don't disagree that it exists. It is a game that is highly based on having friends to play with and outside chat so I would definitely suggest this game more for players with online friends willing to join in on the fun. Maybe even a group of five so you can have a killer with you versus a stranger if you're willing.TLDR good game but could be a bit more balanced maybe with new configurations depending on preferences.

Since killer mains won't show any empathy towards you in the forums if you're looking forward to play as a solo survivor I wouldn't suggest to buy the game in its current state. Playing with a lobby of friends is highly encouraged and enjoyable though you will either way stumble upon one of those killers aforementioned.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-18,0,0,265,False,Recommended,"Game is decent but there are numerous problems both on the ends of survivors and killers.Problems for Survivors The basement can be OP as hell depending on the map and the killerThere are some incredibly useless perks that either need to be removed or changed (almost every single non learnable perk) which can lead to some really stale builds especially in higher ranked play. Not that it's necessary that you run meta perks or any perks at all but 95% of people doThe map design for The Game is absolutely atrocious and is nigh unwinnable when up against the Nurse or the Doctor but it's still really strong for every killer except BillyThere is pretty much no counter play against the Nurse (no I don't care that she ""is the most difficult killer to learn"" that's no excuse for making her literally uncounterable and when you get above rank 10 pretty much every Nurse knows what they're doing)The grind is absolutely insane. Look at my hours played. I only have 1 prestige 2 character 1 level 50 character and 3 characters somewhere between levels 35 40. And the rest which make up more than half are at level 0Problems for Killers When multiple survivors run DS and/or Borrowed Time it's probably the most tilting thing on this Earth. Especially in higher ranked play and even more so in SWF when everyone is way more coordinated and knows what they're doingThe grind is really bad just not as bad for survivors since killers on average get more bloodpoints. Again it's still really bad. All of my killers are rank 0 since I only play them to complete dailies. So in case you read my above tidbit about what rank my survivors are and you thought ""oh maybe this person has leveled up their killers as well surely the grind can't be thaaaat bad."" Yes it is in fact that badSome killers are just... way superior to other killers. Since the Wraith got his changes in PTB he's actually viable now but Freddy is still considered extremely weak by most of the community. Leatherface and Trapper (but also the Clown and the Pig to some extent) mostly rely on the survivors making mistakes in general. Also the meta CLEARLY favors high mobility killers such as Billy and the Nurse and the Huntress who has a ranged attackOther than all of that the game is pretty good. It's fun has good atmosphere all that jazz. It's just over time you start noticing all the little flaws and that paired with the toxic community... I'll just say that the salt is abundant.If I could change one thing about the game I wish survivor builds were more diverse (can't really speak for killers since I don't really play them and their playstyle naturally differs from one another since they all have unique modes of movement or attack). If I had complete control of this game I would make it so that each survivor had one unique perk to them (probably whatever their most viable teachable is but never exhaustion perks because any changes to exhaustion would be a direct buff or nerf to that survivor) and then they could pick the rest of their 3 perks (this is assuming that the useless perks are now viable). Then it's probably less likely that everyone is running the same DS/exhaust perk/Borrowed Time/Self Care that you always see because each survivor would encourage a different type of play.",Dead by Daylight

2016-12-18,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I really like Dead by Daylight's concept. It's a fun unique multiplayer horror experience. However the game works against itself in a lot of ways which makes the experience unenjoyable. So here's some things that stuck out to me while playing Balancing IssuesI can tell that there was a lot put into trying to make it so each side has an equal chance of winning but at the moment I feel like the level 1 survivors/killers are way too underpowered and cant do anything while the higher level ones are over powered. I could understand this if there was a matchmaking system that paired people of similar levels together but there isn't. It's totally random from all that I played. Survivors all leveled up with items could be against a beginner level 1 killer that has no experience yet so that could use some work. Also killers can just camp the meat hooks they hang you on until you die instead of looking for others and giving people a chance to save you. It's funny for a bit while youre the killer but a real unfair experience for survivors. I should mention that I think the logic behind it is that while the killer is camping the meat hook he's giving the other survivors time to restart the generators (which is their main goal) but that takes ages while the time it takes to die on a meathook is probably a minute or less. Traps take too long to get out of and can stop you from helping people off of meat hooks with no way that I could find to disarm them. I'd like to think you could disarm them and maybe my game is just glitching but I couldn't find a way. Maybe that's because every time I saw a trap it was placed below a survivor hanging on a meat hook so my only option was to try to unhook them and step on the trap in the process... It'd be nice if I could take the time to disarm it and then attempt to save them. It'd take me more time and leave the player vulnerable but give them more of a chance.Quick time events are an interesting mechanic. A lot of the time they work fine and are very similar to Resident Evil 6's. However sometimes they don't give you enough time to react at all which can be a pain because they occur so frequently and make you lose progress on the activity you're performing I think it should be one set amount of time that all the quicktime events take not varying. Or at least not so fast that you just can't press the button in time. One last gameplay element that I did not like but I understand is how congested the killer's first person viewpoint is. The survivors play the game in a third person perspective so that they can see around corners while the killer is in a limited first person. But I felt that this first person was almost too limited as if they had zero peripheral vision. Probably locked at 60 or 75 FOV which just feels far too narrow for me to enjoy. It's probably just to make it so survivors can have a chance of not being seen but I wish it felt better to play.Matchmaking Perhaps my biggest problem with the game is that the ""Survive with your friends"" matchmaking system just flat out doesn't work right. You have to keep readying up and unreadying to restart the search and hope that another party with enough available slots searced at the exact same time as you otherwise you'll find nothing. This is very frustrating as in order to play with my friends I had to babysit the ready button instead of being able to sit back and let the game find a match by itself. We only got one game in an hour or two.Controller SupportIn game the controller support is fantastic and works like a charm. However the main menus pause menus end game screens etc cannot be navigated with a controller. This is a little annoying because I can't sit back on my bed and enjoy the game fully I have to keep getting up walking over to my computer and using the mouse before and after a game. It's not a huge deal but it's definitely a pain and full menu navigation with controllers would be a very welcome addition.OverallDead by Daylight is a creepy multiplayer horror experience that'll keep you quick on your feet and playing match after match if you're looking to play by yourself and you can look past the problems I mentioned above. Personally I wouldn't buy it until they patch in some balancing and fix the matchmaking issues.",Dead by Daylight

The queue times are horrible maybe it's because of my level or maybe because I only played killer I got matched against really high level people who clearly knew every inch of every map and every single place. I've heard of those infamous loops in the game certain places in the game where the killer can't catch a survivor no matter how hard they try and I found that this made the games so very boring. Some minor problems like not having fullscreen windowed changing sensitivity etc. The biggest minus was after the game though the community is absolutely disgusting. I got alked about being freeweekend player doing bad even told to uninstall the game and kill myself by higher level players. Apparently it's too hard to find people in my own ranks or other free weekend players.Overall the idea of the game is nice but the points I've made turn it in to a big minus.

This game was fun for a short while after purchasing while still trying to figure out how to play for first 10 rounds or so. I dont even want to play this anymore. There is no reason to fear the killer at all. It is just survivors pallet jumping (or window jumping) in a circle taunting the killer round after round. Of the few time that you actually hook someone you get abused in the chat whiule they insta unhook thier teammate and run away. It is just one sided game afer one sided game after another. Additional OP perks for survivors continue to be added to the game and remove all hope of ever reinstalling. Really regret not getting a refund at this point. It was a cool premise and sounded like a fun game.

But this game does have its serious issues and i can tell you everyone feels this way the matchmaking in this game is horrible i was a level one huntress trying her out and a i got a premade of prestige 3 survivors with toolboxes they repaired all 5 gens in less then a minute leaving me to do nothing i couldnt kill them cause sprint burst and borrowed time easily let them escape its frustrating trying to level up with this matchmaking it should be off the survivor or killers LEVEL not the ranking im really good at this game so i usually can get from 2 4 people every game but sometimes its frustrating when i have to hunt them down with only 2 level one perks while they hae 4 level 3 perks that on my perks other than that survivors usually have an extremely unfair advantage of crzy broken items or stupid op perks that dont let me even get them on a hook (obsession im looking at you) while killers normally have a hard time trying to even catch someone because of looping sprint burst or god forbid the flashlight that blinds you in .001 swcs for 5 secs...other than that this game is great and i wont ever stop playing just wish the devs would look at the survivors and nerf some stuff and buff a few killer perks.

2018-01-26,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,TL DR this game should be more about hiding than running as instead of being scared of the killer finding them survivors are mildly inconvenienced when found.This was once upon a time one of my favourite games Back when there were three killers four survivors and the game was about hide and seek (minus the Wraith which was reviled for being able to sneak up on you. Oh the days.) Now the game is less about that aspect and more a third person combat game. If you see the killer you distract him stun him waste his time and even rescue your friends right from under his nose. You don't hide any more especially with the advent of the new killers. Like really? A killer with literally zero terror radius?In my opinion the game should be less about the rescue and more about the chase. Killer perks should be focused upon catching survivors rather than finding them while survivor perks should be focused upon hiding rather than running. When it turns into yet another merry go round the map's obstacles followed by body blocks from your friends once you're rescued to even have a chance at getting away the game loses its charm. All in all continually making killers harder and harder to avoid rather than trying to hide in a variety of ways forces the hide and seek concept to become a racing game ruining the entire horror aspect.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-03,0,0,251,False,Recommended,Love the game I play a few matches every day. So many different builds and techniques you can use. The only thing I did not like (the whole reason I am writing this review) is that when you are in the dying state (crawling) you are unable to use a key to unlock a trapdoor (to escape and win). The trapdoor should be pretty easy to open realistically I would think. At least let the trapdoor become unlocked (maybe the door still closed but another player can lift it up if it is deemed too heavy to lift in a downed state) Because 1.) It is impressive to find and crawl to a trapdoor AND have a key equipped and 2.) kinda saying that a paraplegics can't open a damn door.,Dead by Daylight

In SWF matches the skill and loadout required by the killer is so much higher to pick apart a group of survivors coordinating themselves on voice basically good luck unless you're using top killer builds.

2017-09-16,0,0,406,False,Recommended,I originally wrote a very bitter review about this game because after 100 hours of playing all my progress was reset. After about a week I started playing again essentially giving up on them to restore my stuff. After another 50 hours or so I had much exceeded what I had originally (what can i say when I was knew I was trash didnt even understand how to get points) and though bitter still kept playing. Around 50 more hours (200hrs) or so I had 90% of all I could want and they awarded me 8million bloodpoints to compensate me for my lost stuff originally (probably twice what I had spent from what I can guess) so I just kinda level'd up killers (really more of a survivor person) and a survivor even though I had one with all the skills I wanted.Here I am at 270hrs now and idk its a pretty fun game. Annoying sometimes but generally its good.

2018-03-08,0,0,285,False,Recommended,Honestly the game in its current state is pretty good and about a year ago i would have given this game a negative review. So let me give some pros and cons of the game in its current state.ProsA wide range of killers and survivors this gives a ton of personalization in builds.Great early game experiance your first games will have you terrified skill checks will be hard because of shaky thumbsA great multiplayer or single player game as a 4vs1 game you have somthing to do while your friends are gone.The game recieves updates and content regularly content is typically paid DLC it is relativly cheap (&lt 10$)There are systems in place to allow you to play survivor and get all paid perks same for killer but less extensive.Does a good job of recreating modern and classic horror monsters.ConsNo innate voice coms. This is a huge problem because of how much of an edge players get for being in voice together. The game should have it by default plain and simple.Balance is 100% in favor of the survivors but that doesn't mean the killer doesn't have the ability to win. Often times everybody wins.The game forces you to play ranked and for some people that is relativly stressful especially because of how the daily system works forcing you to play people you dont have leveled up.Peer to Peer host servers you can see your ping but it can be a problem finding a good match especially if you're from somewhere like australia.The game does have a habbit of just being buggy with connections and loading which can be very frustrating as this game revolves around using 1 time consumables that just get eaten when the game doesnt load.,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-26,0,0,264,False,Recommended,Game is so good that I bought it for me and 2 of my friends.You find yourself playing it for hours and hours.You can play as a survivor or as the killer.It's a 4v1 game where there are 4 survivors and 1 killer that's objective is to try to sacrifice all of the survivors.The survivors objective is escape. To do this you have to fix 5 generators and open one of the 2 gates (or both) OR if you are the last one and there are atleast 2 generators done you can find a hatch where you can escape.Some cons though Game save file wipe can happen randomly and it takes BHVR about 1 2 months to compensate you.Though you can prevent this by backuping your save regulary/using MLGA that shouldn't be the users responsibility.

2018-04-01,0,0,38,False,Not Recommended,"This game has the dumbest matchmaking system in the univers. It's season based and will match a novice with a long time player. only buy it if you know EXACTLY what you are doing and getting to if you already know every single perk item and build in the game. The matchmaking will match you with a killer who has played the game for 1500 hours just because they haven't played killers a lot since the last reset. That is just ing ridiculous. I have about 10 hours of gameplay at this point and it was just back breaking.Moreover because its killer hosted if the host has a connection 4 players will experience lag and people WILL lag spike you because they can and because the player reporting system does not seem to work at all.If you have 4 friends and can get your custom lobby it'll be a more leveled playing field it'll be nice but if you're going to be going on this journey on your own the volume of you'll encounter is not worth the trouble there's tens of thousands of games on steam go play something else.The game is not fun anymore after my past experiences these experiences were soo incredibly poor that it makes it not fun to play. 3 consecutive matches with either crazy lag or 1000+ hour players shouldn't be a ""common"" user experience. At this point this is not a game that is worth ""learning to play"".If you have it you're probably good at it but if you don't just don't bother at this point.",Dead by Daylight

2018-03-01,0,0,309,False,Not Recommended,I had to rewrite this after experiencing both sides of the world. Dead by Daylight was fun and is FUN with friends. Without friends it's a bit of a contagious disease of saltiness. Because no side is truly balanced there is a lot of people who take advantage of what the DEVS allow in their game and PC people have more punishments than console. Lol. I own it on both a console and the PC. Body blocking is allowed by either side and so is camping tunneling slugging and a whole bunch of other messes that can just make the game play for a survivor (usually) or a killer most unpleasant. Survivors can pallet loop killers to no end and it's not fun but it's a style to survive as long as you can. So you have to deal with it basically because they don't have any other means they made flashlights only for people who can time it just right and who know how to do it with math equations going through their brain. Nothing is like unqiue anymore between killers or survivors all perks can be shared. Only people who havve unique abilities is killers whether it be blinking instadowns chainsawing etc. Except Freddy Poor Freddies only can tunnel in order to get things done because well...freddy is hated by DbD xD. I genereally feel bad for both sides now of the coin due to the game being...well it was so fun in the beginning. Now it's just cancer I can only stand like 2 3 games because most people that host as a killer have terrible ping for someone like me who lives on the East Coast in the middle of no where. So I can only reccomend this game if you want to play with 3 or more friends. Or if you just want to be the ultimate killer and stab everyone. I can't promote the solo play. Maybe I should play CIV 5 though. kek.,Dead by Daylight
2018-04-01,0,0,465,False,Not Recommended,I absolutely love this game... i'm not great at it mind you.. rather mediocre in fact. However the game play is absolutely great. The reason I can't recommend the game is because of the community. The community for this game is so toxic it's atrocious. Survivors endless loop and body block they taunt the killer relentlessly but if you as the killer does anything tunnelling camping and the like you're a worthless PoS who can't play the game and they hurl insults completely ignoring all the crappy behaviour they did during the game.The same goes the other way if you're a survivor the killer will do everything they want and try to call you out on the things you do.I have chosen to no longer engage in the community before or after the game it's truly a shame.,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-29,0,0,628,False,Not Recommended,In it's current state i can't say i recommend this game. There's just too many balance issues that make it unfun to play as killer.

2017-08-21,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Fun for a laugh but the matchmaking ranking and frequent disconnects limit the replay and competitiveness factors.Matchmaking Appears to be mostly random. For example as a rank 18 level 12 killer with a tier 1 perk I was placed against rank 1 players with four tier 3 rare perks. Makes it feel super punishing as a new player.Ranking Anyone that accomplishes the bare minimum could attain and hold max rank with the major limitations being access to perks and addons and less emphasis on skill. These need to be unlocked by points and unfortunately it seems to be points efficient even if you don t accomplish the primary objective of the match (aka you can still get a lot of points if you lose ). Sometimes matches turn into points farming sessions instead of a survival thriller.Disconnects It felt like people were disconnecting from almost every game so I started recording them. On average over twenty games a player disconnects once per game. I don t know if it s an issue with the game connectivity/bug or if it s just bad manners but the game is clearly balanced around 4v1 and having players(s) DC makes the game less fun for everyone that s left.The ambience artwork and music are all great except for the occasional janky animation. The Huntress is wicked fun to play and sneaking around as a survivor is intense. A lot of work has gone into making the game feel eerie moody and creepy but it s too easy to have sessions reduced to mechanical points/rank farming or for everyone to give up because the first survivor hooked rage quits.I ll come back to the game for sure if they implement harsher disconnect penalties an actual ranking system ladder that lets me compare my skill to the rest of the player base (instead of just time played) and maybe some basic balance stuff that seems standard in other PvP games (like diminishing returns on abilities/mechanics like flashlight blinds and slug mode for both the survivors and killers).,Dead by Daylight

2016-09-18,0,0,520,False,Recommended,From my standpoint of this game. Now we all know there are no perfect games and there are games that seem to have some problems. Well Dead By Daylight is a game that has some problems with it's community and it's developer views. It seems as if when someone goes into the forums stating they have found something either OP or a bug that the developers must drop whatever they are doing at that current second to fix it. Well the developers do listen to the community a lot and I give them credit for trying to make everyone happy but the changes sometimes implemented are incredibly biased to one side sometimes. Now onto the game yes the game has a really great concept and gameplay is fun. However I don't agree with all of these new exclusives coming out into that game that are only available for people that went to a PAX or a twitchcon that's a down point from my point of view because not everyone has the ability to fly to a twitchcon or PAX just to get some exclusive codes for their favorite game. Overall the game is okay in its current state.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-27,0,0,975,False,Not Recommended,"I would like to say this game is awesome I would like to say this game will give you plenty of good times but I simply can't. The concept of the game is amazing but the developers sadly have no idea what they are doing. During the past year I've had high hopes for every patch only to be sorely dissapointed every single time it gets released. The developers behave like they graduated from their programming education 6 months ago and the insurmountable amount of bugs in the game show it clearly time and time again. Moreover the bugs are often literally game breaking and these bugs often take very long to get fixed.The balancing of the game is also terrible and balance changes are often made by introducing a new mechanic that in their theory should ""cancel out"" the other terribly balanced factors. As an example I will mention bloodlust. The pallets in this game are mechanically terribly designed making a chase that takes forever possible. But instead of taking care of how the pallets work and where they are placed they introduce another mechanic bloodlust Making a killer get movement speed over time which takes care of the issue of unending chases but doesn't deal with the actual problem of pallets.These kinds of ""fixes"" happen time and time again and only shows that the creators have no clear understanding of the basic functionality and essence of their own game. If you want another example I can mention hook camping and borrowed time another ""fix"" that works in this way temporarily solving the symptoms of the problem but doing nothing to the cause of it.In its current state you simply cannot play the game anymore if you run the game on a Windows 8 system and has been like this for a month. I doubt they will ever be able to fix this issue due to their incompetence and the fix the developers have given is ""Update your OS to Windows 10"". Amazing fix right? Go pay 200 something dollars and you can play our game!Another bug that happend about 10 months ago made it possible to have almost constant wallhacks on every killer (and also be practically invisible on some killers that shouldnt be) and it took 3 weeks for a completely gamebreaking bug like this to get fixed.Needless to say I'm dissapointed that a game concept like this has ended up in the hands of what seems like children with no actual knowledge of designing games.",Dead by Daylight

Just about every match keeps you on the edge of your seat whether you're playing as a survivor or the killer.

The hitboxes are unbelievable on top of that a killer doesn't actually need to hit you initially just look at you by the time the weapon is about done swinging. The maps oh boy.

Starting out (as a killer or survivor) you have no tools to play the game really. In order to get what you need to have any chance of success (or to have any fun whatsoever) you have to play match after match where the outcome is predetermined (you lose).

2016-06-25,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,UPDATED 8/20/2016I can no longer recommend this game bugs and matchmaking aside the community is incredibly toxic.An overwhelming majority of the players you will encounter will not even attempt to play the game legitimately and will instead abuse every game mechanic they can in order to win. The rank system only perpetuates this toxicity and as you progress through it you will encounter more and more players who make it their goal to create a stalemate scenario that basically holds you hostage until they decide they have farmed enough points.I don't know how much longer I will be playing this game. I do love it and those rare games where people aren't being scum and very fun win or lose.Beyond that I would not buy this game right now I was lucky and got it on sale when it first released I am probably going to end up returning the second copy I bought for my wife.Update 10/19 with the upcoming DLC I thought I would update my review. Unfortunately the game has not improved this is more the fault of the community than the devs but they are not without blame. Infinites and stalemates still exist attempts to fix them have been half hearted at best playing as killer is like being in 4 abusive relationships at once and playing as survivor consists of extended wait times because noone wants to play killer.Will you get $20 worth of fun out of this game? Probably but the cost of chemo will far outweigh the value of this game.Community is still terrible at this point the fact that certain issues haven't been fixed is just an insult to the players. The developers seem lost they clearly hate the Nurse but they can't remove her from the game so they make her unfun to play and design maps that make her worthless.Update 8/16/2017Game is still and community is still aweful. Don't buy it the developers don't give a .,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-21,0,0,1444,False,Recommended,"30 hours in and heres what I took away from this game. It's not done bugs are game breaking and nonstop. I just spend the past 2 hours to get into 3 games with a friend with multiple platform crashes inbetween. Once you're in a game more bugs will also break the game. Midheal with a skill check at the 10 'oclock position and you'll fail as soon as the meter starts and be unable to heal again. Significant studdering and latency issues between host and players. Honestly I regret this purchase and hope in the future the devs will fix all these gamebreaking issues. In its current condition it's unplayable with friends and solo play is ""meh"" at best.Update 2/28/2018I'm glad I kept going with this game as it has come an incredibly long way since I first wrote this review. The game stability issues are non existant aside from it being Peer to Peer which of course causes issue if the killer gets upset and leaves. The game is still not friendly to newcomers and is incredibly grindy to unlock abilities but deeply rewarding if you enjoy survival horror.",Dead by Daylight
2017-09-18,0,0,453,False,Recommended,After playing for about 10 hours I can say that this game is pretty good......I only play as a survivor because it is much more challenging and you are constantly on the edge. I read that many people dont like it because it is very hard for the survivors but in my opinion it should be like that...in every horror movie most of the people are dead at the end but some of them escape...its the same in this game. When I started to play I didnt escape for the first 20 or 30 games I played but now I am lvl 13 and in the last 10 games I escaped 5 times. You just have to be patient and learn how to play ),Dead by Daylight

2017-04-04,0,0,709,False,Recommended,I'll try to write a review for those trying to decide on if they should purchase this game or not.Firstly the cost. buying the game when it goes onsale is more of a deal for yourself the game is only 29.99. compared to some of the newer titles that's 50% on an average new title.I think cost might be important for some when they are concerned with the cost of the game to gauge value with per buck.Now let's talk about balance. There will be mixed thoughts on this so I'll only provide my own based on my own experience. I've played both Killer and Survivor. When going against a group of very skilled Survivors with equal skill of a killer I would have to say the Survivors have the upper hand.Take into account that this review was written in mind of patch 1.4.2. 1.5 would have supposedly even the playing field a bit with the new rage mechanic. Which allows the killers to gain speed while chasing down a survivor. There have been other changes to help out the killer as well.Now let's talk about the broken parts of the game. The major broken part is the networking infrastructure. There are no dedicated servers or a server farm hosted by Behavior. How it works is the Killer acts as a host and steam provides the service of match making. At the time of writing this review Behavior is working on their own back end to facilitate better handling with match making. Matchmaking for queuing up with survive with friends now is broken. It takes along time for SWF (Survive with friends) that is queuing up games with your friends and issues can be described in more detailed by the developers. But Single/solo queuing is no issue.the Matchmaking needs optimizing because the ranking system has not been fully tweaked against correctly portraying a person's skill in the game. Again the developers are working on these aspects in the game.After all of this I think it's quite clear if you are expecting immediate results from the team on improving the game you might become quite disappointed. But if you're patient enough I believe the game only gets better here on out.Last and foremost let's talk about the community. I believe owning the game will quickly reveal to you your triggers and patience level. I found that alot of players complain about certain aspects of the game and how players play to exploit the pure advantages either the killer or survivor has. People are easily triggered when they are the first found by the killer in the match or if they have been the first to be eliminated. People are upset easily with the camping with killers near hooks. Hooks are where the killers sacrifice players to eliminate them. Camping the hooks make it difficult for other survivors to rescue their friends. There's easily and most commonly will be some toxicity. People just get too angry at this game's certain aspects.The developers just hired a community manager therefore the devs will be more listening to the community and be able to communicate back.I hope this review gives you some insight on what you are getting yourself into when purchasing the game.Even with all of the flaws even ones that will be corrected in due time (just requires some patience) I believe the game is worth the 29.99.Sept 18th 2017.I'm updating my review because I left the game about when Friday the 13th was released. Didn't have a need to go back to play Dead by Daylight.They recently released 1.7 patch to change the game mechanics further to even the playing field. I thought I would give it a try and killer feels more powerful now. There are still times when I still feel being out runned by survivors. There are a ton of good survivors out there keep that mind when playing killer. You'll eventually end up against them and it's really difficult to take them out. I recently also purchased the DLC Spark of Madness because they buffed the killer Doctor too.I've recently started playing Dead by Daylight and have to say having great fun once again. What I enjoy most about this product is that the developers are always making tweaks and adding new content. If I can recall correctly just remember when purchasing this game don't expect competitive level of balancing and tweaking to the game this is what the Devs said. They primarily want to make a fun game and not focus too much on e sports quality direction.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I love this game I think it hs a lot of promise and I enjoy all the different varieties of ways that you can play and how no one game it the same as the next and after putting in so many hours its still as fun to play as when i first bought it. However the game has added a killer which is the most played by far for very good reason. The huntress. She is the most used killer due to the fact she is the only killer inn the game(aside from the clown) with ranged attacks. It requires no real skill to be good with her as a simle point and click is all it takes to incapacitate a survivor without any chase required. The fact is the game may pride itself on its well spaced maps but many parts of the maps are linear and for a killer who can throw projectiles in a straight line it makes capturing survivors far too easy. I think the premise of a killer like her is interesting but it just doesn't work she is far too easy to play and far too easy to win with. Until she is severely nerfed or removed i have to say don't play this game cuz 90% of your games will be against her and you will lose far more than you win even if you are a pro survivor.,Dead by Daylight

2017-12-26,0,0,49,False,Recommended,"Gameplay is average. Probably significantly better with friends but I have none of those. Decent performance on my hardware (See profile) but do be expected as the graphics aren't the best. Cons There is no matchmaking. Your rank is irrelevant and is not taken into consideration properly. It's pretty much just if you are 10 or below you are matched with 10 or below. Considering this game has 20K+ players most of the time THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.Second thing. PEER TO PEER. STOP IT. Half of the matches have 200+ ping so you just lag around and eventually die because of it. Either this is the matchmaking to blame matching me with foreign players or most of the players hosting have internet. Please add a filter so i can filter out lobbies with 100+ ping. Third. Developers can't seem to make up their mind who has the advantage. So with every update they might give survivors or killers a significant buff or an insane perk or they might do the opposite and nerf one side into the ground. Fourth. The devs just spent their time making cosmetics to sell so they can not only bathe in money like they currently areBut now they'll have enough money to wallpaper their house with it too. (""BuT yOu DoN't HaVe To BuY iT"" you say Clearly missed my point)tl dr The game really isn't that good. I'm not going to give it a negative rating because the problems lie mainly with the developers and the cancerous community not the game (Worse than League or CSGO this takes the cake for me) But unless it's on sale or you have 3 friends (I don't) then don't bother.",Dead by Daylight
2018-05-26,0,0,86,False,Recommended,Okay first off Take every review with a grain of salt. A lot of people are angry because of reworks and the Developers are getting hate because people can't solve their own problems. People don't want nerfs that hurt them or buffs that help the enemy and get angry and frustrated that the developers are actually TRYING (Not always succeeding) to help balance the game and make it a fun experience for all.That being said the game is quite fun. Gameplay is a system of cat and mouse chasing where you must repair the generators and escape without being caught and killed. This vanilla experience is altered as you will gain perks and items to use against the survivors or killer which alter gameplay. Overall the game is quite interesting based on the unique take of the multiplayer horror genre. Make a game where you aren't getting scares from things jumping out but the everlasting dread that creeps into your heart when you are finishing a gen and slowly hear a heartbeat.... Walking towards you.... It knows where you are... and it will get you... or they will walk past you kick the gen and keep going as your friends across the map just blew up a generator three times in a row like idiots. The game is not traditional horror as you aren't scared by the killer you aren't scared by getting caught. The scare comes from progression towards the exit and somebody alerting the killer and leading the killer to you.Killers have a harder time then you would think however. In a one versus one match Killer just needs to find the survivor and hook them once. However with four survivors all of them being able to do generators means that the killer has to be cunning and use their ability to mess with the survivors keep them off generators and keep them away from the exits. These are more often the masochistic players as they are basically gluttons for punishment from the community. The DLCs are great and hold amazing perks behind them. With some you get amazing perks such as BBQ and Chili from Leatherface which increases Bloodpoint payout the currency of the game then you have some like Myers whom are higher levels of play killers that have abilities that are amazing. The only exception is the Nightmare on Elm Street DLC and the Cosmetic DLCs. When Freddy was introduced he was viewed as OP so he got nerfed to Hell but is currently facing a possible rework. Then the Cosmetics don't do anything. If you do want to spend money on this game for cosmetics go with Charity Case it is for charity so good cause am I right?Now you are going to hear the community is toxic. Yeah that is basically it as a lot of players will be total jerks and will leave you behind or will have bad manners and teabag. However that is only around 20 40% of players and honestly everyone else is pretty open and cool. 20 15 is the learning period for new players now and is where you will make most of your friends or meet the cool and friendly survivors even if some of them are quite angry (I apologize in advance if you see me in game I usually get angry because I just get tunneled so hard around half the time and the other half people teabag)This game is a great game overall and is just limited by the Development team and how the player base is overall shattered and confused. If you are looking to buy this game wait until there is a sale pick it up for around ten dollars and see about getting your friends to join you. If you really love the game and enjoy it buy DLC packs and help teach the next generation of players. If you hate it just refund it and write a review detailing what was bad and what was good that will help give out a pro/con for the game. I praised it but I didn't give it much flak. This is because I think that the game gets too much crap from people who are angry at the developers or people who play the game and don't like specific things. My recommendation Watch some videos of gameplay for both Killer and Survivor. If you like what you see try it out. If you don't like it refund it then write a review with pros and cons.

2018-09-26,0,0,37,False,Recommended,Awesome game. Fun to play. My only complaint is the Auric Shards. Basically the only way to buy the cool items and those shards are bought with real money. Thre's still some items that can be obtained with other means but all the really cool ones are behind a paywall. But since it's all cosmetic anyway it doesnt really effect the gameplay and the game is still solid.,Dead by Daylight
2018-09-26,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This game is probably in the top 10 games i've ever played but it's learning curve seems to be too steep for newbies like myself which made the game a lot less fun. I played this game for a few hours and I thought i'd encounter another trash player but nope. I always got pitted against and with people who were much better than me and i'm not normally bad at these kinds of games it could have been the time i played it or the server/region i was playing on but in my experience it sucks to suck in this game especially since nobody else does. I'd recommend the game if you're rich or really want this game and have the skill/patience/friends to deal with it but if you don't then i'd suggest finding a better game and/or cheaper game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-01,0,0,60,False,Recommended,"I enjoy this game. I really do. But it has some issues so here's what I think Pros +Great gameplay on both sides. The game feels balanced and it takes an extreme amount of attention to detail to play either side.+Leveling system that works well+""Randomly"" generated maps+Loads of content Cons Lots of issues 3 of 6 matches I played failed to load me in and several times the game would ""break"" when trying to enter Quick Play Adding PAID DLC for a game that is super buggy and not even in full release? Seems kinda greedy if you ask me Very repetitive People online are awful they are either way better than you or way worse (ex. I played a game where I was playing with 2 level 20 survivors and the killer sat staring at a wall picking up and putting down traps) Games feel short Spend more time loading than playing Confusing lobby screenOverall I can't recommend this game to the serious gamer who wants to make the most out of their money. With the game still in development it is of course expected to have bugs this would not be an issue if the devs weren't releasing DLC that requires payment. The concept is original and exciting but it gets very repetitive very quickly. I hear playing with friends has some issues and it isn't really fun by yourself. UPDATE AS OF 3/23/2018Okay so I played this game with friends and alone. Overall they seem to be pretty on top of bug fixes and the games is surprisingly fun.

2017-12-01,0,0,103,False,Recommended,Dead by daylight is one of the most best anticipated horror tittles to be played still in the year 2017 even though it was released only last year it is still doing well for itself! Even though with every single patch and/or update brings a ton of new and improved content and also the most annoying bugs in games. It is good that the developers kinda listen to the consumers and try and fix these bigs before they get more out of hand then they already are. I purchased this game only a couple weeks ago on the pc after having it on xBox One S I purchased it during the halloween sale it was worth the purchase possibly worth it even without the halloween sale mostly because of it being a more affordable pricing range over the other games that have been released these past years!I would definitly recommend this game to people that are looking for an affordable horror tittle that is worth giving you time too. I wish good luck for the years ahead for this game!,Dead by Daylight
2017-07-05,0,0,645,False,Not Recommended,I used to recommend this game now I do not.this game used to be very fun as a killer and as a survivor. Now the Devs have nerfed the killers and their perks to the ground and buffing the survivors and their perks to the extreme. There is no fun in playing as a killer now and playing as a survivor with their overpowered perks make it escaping with flying colours. As a survivor all you need to do is earn points by doing most actions in the game objectives helping teammates getting chased and earning points is pretty easy. Ranking up as survivor is a walk in a park and have a variety of escape perks that waste the killer's time easy.As a killer it is not rewarding to play anymore. The ranking system is changed instead of blood points it is how many times you hooked and kill people. So if survivors just keep on pallet looping like they all do on these survivor sided maps you do earn blood points but do not proceed to ranking up at all until you hook them. Killer perks have been nerfed to the ground as well and it makes it even harder to kill. Brutal Strength that was always used because it was so good against pallet looping has been nerfed and will never be where it was. Killers have animations that create time gaps for survivors to get away which was fine before but now that they got stuff like sprint burst dead hard decisive strike it creates way bigger time gaps and loses the survivor easy. Especially in Survive with Friends. When survivors are in groups have and communication it makes the game 3 times as hard to play. You have to make no mistakes at all in order to rank up or break even on pipping.I do not recommend this game at all in it's current state. It is way too unbalanced for an asymmetrical horror game. It is suppose to be killer be super strong and survivor should be scared but now it is killer the one getting bullied and survivors are the ones controlling the game and the horror game has turned into a competitive ranking game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-09-19,0,0,44,False,Recommended,This game is more disadvantageous to the killerHowever in most games one player often gives a person the motivation to choose a killer because he or she is often sacrificed for each game.Developers need to supplement existing killers more often than ever rather than producing more killers.anyway the game itslf is good,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-23,0,0,851,False,Recommended,I definitely got my $20 worth in playing this game. Though I am not a hardcore active player I do enjoy playing occasionally.I like the thrill of the chase to where your heart is thumping trying to get away from the killer. I enjoy the stealth play to keep from being found and the bravery/stragedy needed to save your teammates. I don't always escape sometimes I may run into some unfair situations but that just keeps me moving forward to another match and do better. You can't always win.My dislikes are mostly how others' may play the game (toxicity) but that's just how it goes in games like these. It's not always going to be fair fun and your way. I am out here to have fun and some just don't see it that way. To each their own. Yes there are some bugs glitches etc. But these Devs and their staff try their best to approach problems and find a solution. It might not be what other players agree with or like but they do what they can. They have been generous enough to give free items cosmetics maps survivors killers etc. in the game to keep us motivated.With a little over 500 hours in the game I will say that Dead by Daylight is my favorite go to game of all. I am glad this game was made and I look forward of the things to come in the future. I totally recommend it for anyone who loves the thrill of the chase hiding seeking and sacrificing.

Killer and Survivors both seem to be balanced out unlike freaking Friday the 13th.Really like how the game is all about teamwork and everyone does their best to help eachother. Wish survivors weren't so toxic to new killers though.Game gives me a lot of spooks and thats all that matters to me besides being able to help others out and work as a team.The atmosphere is incredibly oppressive and dark.Music is your classic 90s horror music and I really love the chase music that plays when a killer has spotted you and is coming for you.,Dead by Daylight

2017-06-07,0,0,293,False,Recommended,"This is one of those games that you play/watch for the first time and think ""This is a great concept! This is so fun!""And it is a fun game surely but not without a lot of annoying bugs and toxic players.As survivor you will notice quickly that the game is heavily in the killer's control because a lot of players don't work together. This is because there are 2 emotes to signal to your teamates and that is it. /As survivor you will run into more annoying gameplay mechanics such as ""Hook Campers"" (This includes the lowest ranks and the highest ranks.) These campers are the biggest downer sometimes. The killer will hook and survivor and just decide that your death is more important than anything else. This deprives you the killer and all other players from getting a good amount of points. People on the game's forums tend to pick a camp this includes the ""killer"" or ""Survivor"" camps. This utterly blows my mind because there is no reason for this. I think we can all agree pallet looping is just as bad as face camping. There are other methods to fighting this cheap tactics. Such as just letting the guy camp and do generators. This works sometimes but people just tend to be altruistic. I like saving my allies. Most killers will discourage this. There are also a million bugs that will drive you up a wall.Now that my rant on the bad is done here is why I reccomend the game. Firstly this is a truely unique game. I love how simple the concept is. It's easy to play hard to master. Makes for a fun late night game. You'll grow numb to the scares very quickly. The perks are actually well thought through and make it fun play around and change up your playstyle. Killer's being in first person make it fun by playing on his tunnel vision. However the killer might hear you and then he just needs to follow your tracks. Survivors have a lot to worry about but there is nothing more satisfying than finding skilled teamates who think alike and work together to get everyone out alive. I said some bad stuff in this review but I do love this game. I have about 200 hours on it and I've only owned the game for a few months. Very Addicting!",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-03,0,0,136,False,Recommended,I have never seen a game that FORCES you to work as a team... until i played this. The way everyone works as a team (most of the time as far as i have seen) is amazing! To escape and live you have to work as a team by instinct and knowledge of the game there is no text chat in game or voice chat only impulse and again knowledge. Survivor is fun to play as because you have to constantly be on edge of the killer and focusing on the objective/teammates.Killer is the most fun in my opinion because you get really have to get the FEEL of the killer to properly win.Knowing the map what youre playing against your objective etc all amazing features of the game.The bloodweb(or skilltree type thing) is completely random this prevents people constantly getting the best perks and pushes them to adjust to the new perks and opening up new playstyles.TLDR 10/10 VERY VERY FUN i do reccommend buying this game,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-09,0,0,54,False,Recommended,"This game has so much potential to be an incredible game. Having played this alone and with friends on this and a previous account I probably have 50 hours. Not a great amount to say I'm a know it all but I understand the basics of a good game. Dead by Daylight is a game where its a 4v1 Killer vs Survivors. Now. Onto the actual review.The game has Is Pros and Cons.Pros Unique game Fun to play with friends Easy but enjoyable to play Choice of characters and Perks to play the game how you want (Stealth Speed Saviour)Cons Killers are op and normally end up targeting a player (Part of the game but ****ing fustrating) Player base on killer side is normally of a ""as long I kill someone I'm happy"" this leads to camping.. and it sucks! To many killers with overlapping features (Invisibility and one hit weapons...) The amount of hooks in each map is too many. There has been one time in 50 hours of gameplay I have wiggled off the shoulder. Even with offerings to lower the amount of spawned hooks it is still way too many.The list for both can go on but overall the game has something for everyone. I do wish that the Killers were less over powered when it comes to abilitys because playing this game and being the first to die multiple games in a row it is the most fustrating thing!Either way It is definetly a game to get if you enjoy tense moments and a good laugh with your mates or to blow off some steam and kill a few people.

You will usually encounter some form of toxicity no matter what you play. If you have thick skin and laugh at people who rage at you then this game is for you!,Dead by Daylight
2016-11-25,0,0,401,False,Recommended,Ill say a few things about this game. That alot of people have already said.Pros Solid (Yet slightly repetitive) gameplay tense moments when you have no clue when the killers gonna pop out Interesting semi depth to killer gameplay Mind Gaming your prey to get them on hooks smart trap placement sneaking around as wraith chainsawing strange angles as hillbilly etc.Cons Repetitive gameplay Pretty bad community (There's still a few really nice killers/polite survivors out there atleast I dont ever see them Majority of people i run into are rude/gloat) Questionable perk balance (Decisive strike NOED STB4L+Unrelenting etc.)It's worth picking up if you have a few friends to play with or like playing psychopathic killers TL DR Don't have the highest hopes but it's worth a go.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-31,0,0,963,False,Recommended,The game is not very balanced. When you start playing you might feel that killers are overpowered but it's actually the other way around. Survivors usually eat the killer for dinner at high ranks. The survivor community is also very toxic and bash the killer for any stupid reason they find in the end game chat.When new killer DLCs come out the new killer is usually pretty overpowered the first couple of weeks after which it usually gets nerfed.Still the game is pretty fun to play which I guess it's most important.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-15,0,0,1,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Love it. Just want one more thing... More new play modes and new maps. Such as Multi killer Mode which one game you can play with 2 or more killer more than 5 survivors and wider map.Or timing hide and seek mode which the killer have to find survivors within the limited time.It keeps players play longer and will increase the amount of new players who interesting to buy this game.The idea of this game is already great but it will feel like lack of challenge when you keep playing it.Sometimes it might has too small amount of online player so you can't find the match and wait for too long.Because of that I meet with the same killer and were killed in a very short time over 4 times. lolSo I just recommend to add more challenge in it coz I'm going to buy it but feeling little hasitated.,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-27,0,0,661,False,Recommended,Let me start out by saying that I do enjoy this game extensivly and I do find it to be a fun online team based horror game where you and three others take on a random killer and repair generators and not get sacrificed or where you take on the role of the killer and hunt down to sacrifice four survivors to please the Entity. Whilst this game is very fun to play especially if you play with your friends the community on the other hand is very divided. On one side you have the decent players who can take losing well and be good sports. On the other hand you have people who disconnect from matches and harass other players.However this applies to most games and shouldn't really be a factor in deciding if you should try the game for yourself. It can be a ton of fun at times and is stressful in a way that doesn't feel overbearing for the majority of any match. Sure you're gonna encounter toxic players every now and then but most of them aren't like this and the devs are actively trying to mitigate this toxicity by introducing changes to promote a more pro active system.Some killers have recently recieved buffs that have greatly inproved their viabilltiy as killers in general and most of these changes are ones I welcome openly even though I don't main killers that often feeling like the killer is an actual threat is far better than running from a killer who isn't good at their own job.The game still has a long way to go before I would consider it to be even close to 'perfect' but trust me when I say that this game is slowly becoming the experience most players want it to be and I am glad the devs are listening and are doing what they can to fix it as time goes on. It may not be perfect but I think the devs deserve a pat on the back for doing a pretty good job... so far.,Dead by Daylight

2018-04-03,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is an incredible game. The graphics are higher end for todays market and the gameplay is supurbly balanced. I come back to this game again and again because of the unique horror experience only Dead by Daylight has been able to offer. I feel truelly horrified playing as a survivor. The progression system and the cooperation between survivors are the highlights of my gameplay. Acquiring and upgrading abilities helps give some edge agaisnt the killer. Playing the killer on the other hand is an incredible power trip and has plenty of its own upsides including its own rewarding progression system. For horror fans or for those who long for progression and achievement in their terrible life.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-15,0,0,1991,False,Not Recommended,"Clunky but fun. the character models have giant collision boxes. often two survivors can't fit between a tree at the same time as they are running away even though visibly you could fit 3+ survivors in the area.It's more than what i'd expect for a 20 dollar game as far as gameplay goes but there are still some bugs to iron out. The ranking system is pretty meaningless when 1 person disconnects and another dies instantly as the game starts for some unknown reason.Overall I feel it is pretty well balanced between bad guy and 4 good guys. It won't seem that way when you first start but it quickly becomes a mental game of tag when you're chasing someone or being chased. Predicting people's movements will win you a round as you take someone to juke city.Check to make sure group queue has been implemented if that is important to you. For now you can only solo queue as survivor.Edit 9/29/2016 The bugs that really broke the game are all gone. There are still a few issues with things like getting promts to come up for disarm vs unhook. But overall the game has improved drastically. The survive with friends mode is functional finally after the last update. Queue times are longer but at least the matches are closer in skill between survivors and killer.Edit 10/29/2016 Matchmaking and DLC The Halloween DLC broke matchmaking completely. Everyone wants to play Michael Myers so the queues for killer are very long. 20+ minutes at peak times. Since the queues for killer are so long the matchmaker is just slapping together anyone to fill the survivor lobbies. Every game I see brand new players being matched up against killers with hundreds of hours more experience. The score screen is toxic with veterans raging at new players. I can't recommend this game to anyone in it's current state. The Halloween patch made this game mostly unplayable for me... during Halloween sadly...Bugs and Exploits They are exceptionally slow to patch out bugs and exploits. The Hillbilly had a bug with one of his addons that allowed him to keep someone permanently in dying state. Games took only a few minutes until he had everyone dying on the ground with no way to revive... I ran into several people abusing this and ruining games. It took the devs more than a month to fix it.The Trapper can place traps directly under a hooked survivor. They are almost impossible to disarm and after the most recent update you can no longer unhook the person on the hook until you are lucky enough to get the ""Disarm"" prompt to come up instead of the ""Unhook"" prompt. You are forced to walk back and forth in circles around the person on the hook until the correct prompt displays... This seems more like a UI issue to me but it's been a problem since beta... which tells me they have no plans to change it.Potential for Pay to Win The base game is $20 which seemed more than reasonable at the time. The first DLC was also free. It seems that every ""chapter"" after that first one will be $7 though. They plan to release several chapters a year. We're currently at $30 altogether. The DLC are optional but if you want to play any of the new killers or survivors and their associated perks you will need to buy it. The Halloween Chapter introduced new killer and survivor perks that are much stronger than most of the ones that came with the base game. Some people might call that pay to win...The Nurse Chapter was also quite necessary at release though it was free. She was broken overpowered for a few weeks. If you are reading this and disagree that the nurse was overpowered just keep in mind that the Developers said she was OP on their Twitch stream...Edit 11/3/2016 Added TLDR. This will be my last update. I don't see myself playing this for much longerTLDR The core cat and mouse gameplay is fun. I originally recommended this game because of that. I still play it after 400+ hours but that is only because I still have friends in the game. After dozens of patches and a few DLCs I am changing my vote to not recommended.The slow response to bugs and exploits was understandable early on. Some of them are/were quite gamebreaking though and easy to abuse.The game's matchmaker will break every time there is a new killer released. Brand new players will be matched against killers that have a thousand hours or more. It WILL BE UNPLAYABLE for a couple weeks every time this happens unless you have a 4 stack of survive with friends.I'm seeing a pattern of pay to win with the killers. Both the Shape and Nurse are/were way more effective than the original 3.",Dead by Daylight

Survivors are toxic entitled little everything is super unbalaced survivors get EVERYTHING when killers get NOTHING. This game is digging it's own grave and the Developers don't even care they will just tell you to play Civilization V.,Dead by Daylight
2018-04-05,0,0,124,False,Recommended,The game is fun however balancing is a big issue. Most games seem to be survivor sided as the killer can only get good to a point based on their ability going up against 4 survivors.Quick points Pros Characters (Survivors) All survivors bring helpful perks to the table allowing for diverse amounts of strategies.Characters (Killers) All killers play different from each other due to their powers.Maps All maps give survivors a number of ways to hide from the killer and traverse the map.Character Progression The bloodweb system is quite cool as you don't know what perks and upgrades you will get when you go for your next level up.Cons Pallets These are extremely helpful for survivors to escape the killer as the killers are generally faster than them and will eventually catch them. However the amount of pallets there are on the map are absurd at times and between them and windows survivors can perform the strategy of pallet looping meaning the killer can go through a whole match without getting a single hit.Survivors The survivors while they do bring perks these perks can be learned by all other survivors meaning that by the end of the game if you max out all your survivors there is no variation between them apart from looks. Killers at least have unique powers.Ranking system The ranking system does not seem to work in the slightest...it is supposed to mean that a rank 15 killer goes up against survivors around their rank. I just had a match where I went up against a rank 16 rank 7 and two rank 1 survivors...doesn't seem fair.Killers apparently aren't allowed to do their jobs? A complaint i've seen go around is that people are annoyed when killers camp dying survivors. From the survivors perspective yes this sucks as you basically have no way of getting healed from other survivors. From a killers perspective this is a double edged sword. While yes it may secure a kill you are not going around trying to stop other survivors from completing their objectives. There are more reasons survivors get angry but I won't get into them.The game itself is a lot of fun for both survivors and killers as long as you are willing to take the time to practice and understand the roles and playstyles. Don't just go into this game expecting to win (if you do then good on you) but go in to hae fun if you aren't having fun look at what you did and what you could do better for the next time.,Dead by Daylight
2018-01-20,0,0,907,False,Not Recommended,This is an exciting game filled with not only fun frustration and stress but also elevated heart rates defeat and a grim sense of satisfaction. This game is not as scary a horror game as it portrays itself much of the tension and excitement is there but fear and/or fright is usually replaced by annoyance tiredness or positive pleasant feelings such as a sense of safety while in certain terrain. I heartily give this game a thumbs up for the enjoyment it can give but I give warning to those who expect a sense of power and/or fairness on a consistent basis. This game is not for everyone but it is exciting for many. The community is extremely turbulent and conflicting die to the current state of the game.

2018-10-26,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"Frustrating game with a large skill cap in terms of learning the maps RNG spawns builds. Really big sink hole for time to get the required perks as each character needs to be roughly leveled to 40 to unlock the character specific perks. You have multiple in game currencies which all can be used for buying in store items skins to even perks to save you farming them. Events provide freebies so not everything cosmetic wise is locked under lock and key DLC characters might as well be a must have if you truly want to be able to play with a competitive edge as usually the new perks keep a decent enough impact on the game making the DLC worth getting.The biggest crutch which is ruining this game is the fact that the servers which are used currently still are peer to peer which means that one of the players in the lobby are hosting (the killer) which means that the ranked match making means nothing for a good part of it whether its genuine lag or not people with the lag have the full advantage and if you leave due to them cheating by using a lag switch or w/e else you're the one who is penalised for it at the end this is the furthest i've ever gotten in the rank system was rank 11. 3/5 pips and its practically unplayable for the most part as most of the ""Killers"" have obsern lag and the only thing their doing is killing my connection to the lobby.

2018-11-12,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Its kinda weird if you combine genres like horror and online together all that comes to mind would be the classic Killing floor series or the Left 4 dead series. But this game is here to say that a genre like that is deffenetly possible. Dead by Daylight is one of my favourite horror games out there for sure. The game doesnt have the best looking engine for sure really looks bland and not pushed to its full potential but everything else in the game can push this fact to the side. Yes its really scary yes its kinda hard to master at the start and yes its absolutely fun ! There is a big variety of killers with their own ability and play style and on the other hand there is a big selection of survivors that have their own special 'perks'. The in game goal is to activate 4 generators (+3) that open the door where you escape from simple right ? not really the killer is constantly breathing behind your necks and haunting you using his abilities and traps.... (i have to mention that like every game if you dont play tactically then its preety unbalanced).... but if the survivors play smart and 'out smart' the killer with their perks and different items located on the map then its a win ! ( its good to mention that for begginers even if you kill one survivor its a good win for you because you get rewarded preety nice). The character design and the map design in this game is preety nice but as i said ... not the best engine out there. Another thing about this game that i really like is that every single character and killer has its own backround story.... there are even allot of horror movie characters for example Freddy Kruger Micheal Myers Leatherface and The pig from the Saw series. I can deffenetly recommend you to try this game a bit ! its even worth for the current price or even the discount price.,Dead by Daylight

However in the past couple of months the Devs have killed it in fixing bugs in this game. It seems like they actually care about how the game is to the public so they stepped it up and are ironing out as many bugs as they can and that makes me happy. Don't get me wrong the game is still buggy but it is miles better than it was before Summer began. I play both survivor and killer about 60/40 for survivor to killer. They both feel so much better and they gave a ton back to the community for the anniversery event of the game. All in all I definitely recommend the game now and I would 100% suggest giving it a try.

2018-02-11,0,0,741,False,Recommended,A very exciting and fun game but people's experiences may vary depending on their idea of a good time. Survivor is fairly easy to play and in my opinion can be more fun than killer at times but don't let that dissuade you from trying killer out. Playing the killer can be very stressful and difficult at times but the better you get the more fun and rewarding it is to destroy teams of survivors as your favourite killer. Definitely reccomend it to people who like progression teamwork and being in control.,Dead by Daylight

Dev doesn't listen to the actual community instead they listen to the minority who cries about things being OP when they don't want to learn mechanics. Forums are cancer. Mods are biased. You can get warned for calling someone stupid but have full on flamewar and just have your post closed without even a slap on the wrist. As a survivor unless you SWF you will have a hard time. Unless you SWF or get a baby killer you will almost always have a toxic game as 2 and 3man SWFs will sandbag and BM you if you play solo. Camping Looping Slugging and Tunneling are dev approved ""strats"" yet are extremely toxic and the dev knows it. Extremely long Queue times as killer despite rank. Be prepared to wait 10 60minutes depending on your location just to get trashed by a 4man SWF on comms.

2016-09-08,0,0,399,False,Not Recommended,From what I can tell so far this game rocks! If you have 4 other friends who are playing with you. If you don't you're pretty much doomed to wait in the lobby until 4 other people want to play and a killer hosts a game. I've been dropped from a few games as well. I think there should be some kind of offline version for people who are new to the game since every matchup I've been in so far is with and against seasoned players with seious perks. That all said I do like this game and the ability to go between keyboard and controller when playing. If/When they fix the bugs and add an offline version I'll totally reccomend this game to others.Right now? I'm trying to find 4 people to play with so I can actually enjoy the game.UPDATE Now with the ragion lock I'm doomed to only play as survivor. There are almost no players in my region that play as survivor and lots of people playing killer. Makes those events that call for you to play both near impossible to complete without outright paying and that sucks for people like me who live paycheck to paycheck. I'm willing to spend for the dlc when I have it but to have to buy outfits others can outright play to get just sucks. I shouldn't have to wait 1 2 hours to get a full lobby when others can get them in a few minutes just to play for 5 minutes and do the wait all over again.,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-15,0,0,738,False,Recommended,It is a fun game when you actually get to play it. I love everything about this game EXCEPT all the bugs. Seriously I'm not one to complain but I have purchased the Deluxe pack and all dlc content with the exception of the killers outfit pack. My only complaint is the game is sometimes impossible to join...by sometimes I mean 85% of the time I try to play the game I get the 'Infinite Loading' loop and I have to force close the game and reopen to find that if I want to try and join a game I have to go through Survive With Friends and join Solo. Even that method does not always work. I have followed suggestions on reloading my game cache and I have adjusted my steam connection settings to no avail. The reason why I still recommend this game is because I believe the devs will eventually fix this issue and the game will be fun to play again. My best advice I could give is hold off on buying it and keep checking the updates and discussions and once they finally address this issue go balls deep.*UPDATE 12/31/16*I cannot recommend this game until the devs fix these f***ing server issues. Seriously guys get it together.*UPDATE 2/21/17*The server issues have been resolved for the majority.

2017-07-10,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,I was between the choices of whether or not I should recommend this game but unfortunately I decided not to recommend it I will tell you why with my mere 35hrs of experience.Firstly this game has too many DLCs as of 2018 I remember last year there wasn't that many DLCs but that's not the point I have had this game for 1 year or so and everytime the developers release a DLC there will be a new survivor and a killer and most of the time you have to learn and adapt to the new killer's or survivor's abilities also there's an increasing number of the cosmetic DLCs as well I started feel that DBD is gonna become the next Payday 2.Secondly during my time playing I had a lot of laugher and satisfaction as well as anger and frustration but the latter outweights the former it's primarily owing to the slightly unbalanced ability of the killer a very obvious example is the Huntress' hatchet throwing ability which is a ranged attack method that has almost unlimited flying distance unless got stopped by trees or walls none of the killers has that kind of ability except for the Huntress .Thirdly I don't really like the lobby mechanism that DBD uses because I always got assigned to servers that have over 200 ping to me I hope the developers can add a server browser so that players can choose servers that have the least ping to them simply saying give us more freedom to choose our server of choice.So in conclusion I won't recommend DBD unless the problems mentioned above are stopped or solved this is my review of DBD after 1 year of gameplay.,Dead by Daylight

Maining killer can be depressive after lvl 10 There is NO official server (this is a bad thing because the servers are hosted from the ""killer"" Pc allowing them many options to ""cheat"" like lag switch and so on ) Espect to find toxic and egoist players Grinding feels exhausting without boosters Lastly the bugs and hitboxes....

It's fantastic with friends and has more than 10 people playing. Thanks for coming to my TedxTalk You know how games typically get better from release from each update? Well Dead by Daylight (DbD) likes to defy convention. With each passing update with their lengthy download times new bugs are inserted! Have you ever wanted a generator to sound like wood snapping when it's kicked? You got it here in DbD! You want intense music to play for you when your killer is chasing someone 5km away? Come to DbD. You want developers that respond more to positive comments than the negative criticism? BUY. THIS. NOW. While sitting in a lobby do you want the constant POP POP POP of fireworks in your ears. Well you don't get that because the Chinese New Year event has passed. You also missed out on a cosmetic that makes one of the killers look like she has a receding chin. Do you want to be a part of a community so toxic that it makes CS GO look civil. WELL. You've come to the right place.I used to be deeply involved with this game. It didn't start too long ago and I told myself not to get hooked that I would only get hurt in the end. BUT DbD was good to me and I saw the red flags more as quirks at first. ""I'm sure it will change for the better."" I told myself. Alas they kept heading on a busride to Rock Bottom. Did I mention the bus was on flames? Well it is. I decided to hop off the bus before it reaches that destination (if it does). It's not my responsibility for DbD's redemption. On its way down I'm sure it saw Friday the 13th (the game) coming back up. DbD could learn from Friday the 13th if it wants to be the game it was once before. It could learn from its mistakes. Unfortunately I'm beginning to lose hope as DbD tries to don something shiny and new instead of working on what it has so far. Maybe one day DbD will work towards being better. Maybe its code will be untangled and be able to flow with a new creativity. However I cannot support it while it still on that bus to Rock Bottom. At this point I wouldn't suggest this game to a friend. Would you set your friend up with that guy who you KNOW is addicted to drugs but swears he's sober and getting better? Yeah I wouldn't either. When DbD can prove that it's striving to improve I'd be willing to give it another chance. Until then I think if it's best if we play different games (Like Civ V). &lt /3",Dead by Daylight

2017-06-06,0,0,686,False,Recommended,This game is amazing. For a game like this the devs really had to walk a fine line between balancing and rewarding teamwork and not punishing players who choose to not help their teammates. You are left not knowing if the strangers you got teamed with will help you survive or leave you to die. It's half of what the game's about and gives it a good amount of depth in an otherwise basic game. UPDATE Matchmaking issues seem to be mosty resolved now (11/23/17). DLC doesn't create a wall. You can play with anyone. It doesn't matter if you have the DLC or they have the DLC. It really only has an impact on the characters YOU can choose from.Overall Dead by Daylight it worth the money. I would defiently reccomend checking the system requirements and ensuring that your PC can handle the graphics. This is an issue that I ran into when the game first launched.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-14,0,0,81,False,Recommended,This game is terrible.,Dead by Daylight
2018-03-20,0,0,986,False,Recommended,"Dead by Daylight is a game I've put a LOT of time into since its release and always end up coming back to despite its rough edges. The asymmetrical multiplayer/horror genre of game is pretty niche and while there have been a few other attempts at it none have really taken off like this game has. I was pretty excited when it first released and despite it's horrendously buggy and unbalanced debut it was a blast. I mean at that point nobody really knew what they were doing anyway.The gist of the game is 4 survivor players try to repair generators scattered around the map to open the exit gate while a killer player hunts them down in an attempt to ritually sacrifice them. There are a wide variety of killers with different playstyles to choose from and while the differences between survivors are largely cosmetic there are a wide variety of perks and abilities you can unlock to change up your playstyle a bit as well as good map variety.However while the game has come a long way it can still seem a bit unpolished at times. It can still be a bit buggy especially with graphical glitches but it's rarely anything that ruins the game. The balance is also hit or miss but honestly it's probably better now than at any point in the past. It's not really a competitive game at heart anyway despite the ranking system. But on the flip side that means that play at higher ranks between veteran players is where a lot of the balance issues become glaringly obvious. But that's a whole other discussion in and of itself.To be honest the biggest turnoff would probably be the community but that could be said for a lot of online games. But due to the nature of the game with it's opposing roles both ""killer"" and ""survivor"" mains constantly antagonize each other. I play and enjoy both sides personally so my advice would just be to ignore whatever negativity your opponents try to berate you with and play the game how you want. It also helps that you can choose to just hide the post game chat completely and all the salt that comes with it. This game can be a bit hard for new players to get into especially once they start playing against players with a bit more experience as there's a lot of meta tactics that you might not be aware of that can make the game seem quite frustrating if you don't know how to utilize/play against them. But once again I suppose that could be said for most online games.All in all there can be a bit of a learning curve and while the game can certainly feel frustrating at times it's still a unique game experience with tons of replay value especially if you like horror aesthetics of it.",Dead by Daylight

2017-02-01,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Rated it poorly on my first review. Main complaints were issues with match making. Since then they have made an effort to address the problems. Game is definitely much more enjoyable when you're in a premade party. Without in game voice chat the killer can easily dominate a team. If you're in a group on a discord server the scales balance out. Much care went into the map designs which are dense with detail. The leveling system involves too much grind for the pay off (a new skill or a good item). Mechanically the game is sound. My only complaint being that a killer is not effectively penalized for camping hooks. New characters/killers can be purchased through an in game micro transaction system. You can get the full experience even without them but if you're going to buy one I recommend avoiding the hag and the nightmare. In their current state they are not much fun to play. The game is well worth its current price.,Dead by Daylight

It's built so you really do need to play together to win. It lets you play as survivor or killer or both. There are tactics to learn tricks to discover and it gets your adrenaline going.

2017-12-23,0,0,865,False,Recommended,Highly addictive and spine chilling Dead by Daylight is super addictive and fun to play.It will constantly keep you at the edge from start till the end of the game.In this game there are 4 surviors and 1 killer.The survivors's job is to repair 5 generators and the killer's job is to stop them from repairing the generators and put them on the hooks(eventually kill them).This sounds easy but it's not easy as it seems.The killer got tools to find survivors and stop them similarly survivors also got tools to evade the killer.It's basically the the skill of survivor vs the skill of killer with a bit of luck in it.. Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be solo.Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone.Overall the game is fun to play and you will never get bored once you get the hang of it.Every game is different since you get different players in every game with different play styles.The only thing that remains same will be the sense of forboarding and dread.Also this game is super fun to play with friends.. The only negative thing that I found about this game is the lengthy matchmaking system time and peer to peer hosting with lack of dedicated servers which leads to latency problems if killer's connection is not good. .Also new players prepare to get frustrated a lot till you get enough experience.You simply can't expect to out smart a player who had put a lot of time in learning his game.As I said earlier it boils down to the skill of killer vs skill of survior..Also player complaining about camping killers can be duped all it takes certain perks which you will learn eventualy and skilled two survivor one to distract and one to save.Just give some time watch youtube videos and learn from it..This game can't be masterd in 24hrs you have to play at least 100hrs to get the hang of it.So the player whoare not patient shouldn't buy this game.This game is not for you.This is my personal experience it can be learned in less time also it depeds on players.. And finally don't be a sore loser learn to respect the skill of other.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-21,0,0,77,False,Recommended,"Hello There Reader of Reviews. I wasn't to enthusiastic about this game at first it seemed so simple on the surface. You play as either the Killer or The ""Survivors"" and the goal is to either Kill everyone or to survive. Pretty simple on the surface. First off Survivors is in quotes because I like playing the Killer and there shouldn't be any survivors... and usually aren't (Hail Freddy ""The Nightmare"" Krueger). That's not all there is to it though.You can spend points to get perks to make things easier for you or harder for your opponent. Addons for your medkit or Tollbox to make healing and repairing the generators easier or faster. There are skill checks to see if you mess up fixing the generators causing more damage or healing and messing that up. If you are injured you leave bloodtrails and grunt and grown giving away your psoition... On the killer side... You can hook people chase them down stab them beat them and just generally make the players life miserable all around. Don't want to kill your victims right away... leave them crawling on the ground bleeding out and move on. Maybe someone will heal them or maybe not either way your having fun! It seems simple on the surface kill or escape but for the survivors it's all about teamwork you aren't getting out if you can't or won't work together.. for the killer.. its more tactical they all have powers and abilities and if played right.. no one is getting out alive.I'm loving this game simple on the surface... and yet nuanced... give it a shot play both sides and have some fun killing.You can play against others or with them in randoms. If you have the urge you cann Kill Your Friends (no points) One annoying piece though you have to steam invite your friends to play with you after every single round.",Dead by Daylight
2018-11-21,0,0,16,False,Recommended,Why this should win better with friends This game is very fun it has many suspenseful moments many suprise scares and with friends that just doubles the amount of greatness. you can be a survior with friends or you can kill your friends! the game in a nutshell is this four surviors enter a map and have to complete generators to escape! Watch out though another player the killer tries to kill the surviors trying to escape. Each survior and killer have their own perks abilites to give them an advantage. There are also offerings that spawn more chests in or increase the likely hood of a map. I totally recommend this game because it has hours and hours of fun.,Dead by Daylight

While I highly prefer the console version of Dead By Daylight (as you get two chapters for free there that you have to buy on PC?? wtf) the PC version is also a fun way to pass the time. Plus you get the option to tell the killer how to play at the end of the match and pretend like you're not salty.Everyone knows you are though.I love the Pig so much talk about wife material. However I won't ever buy her on PC because I already have her on console and I'm broke. On PC I just faff around and slap pallets on the killer. It be like that sometimes.Disclaimer I received this product for free because a friend bought it for me not because the devs gave it to me or I stole it or smth.

Now I don't mean like it's horrible or anything like that but the community itself at least a good chunk of it is WHY I say this constant fights against the others side name calling toxicity things like that. I'm just gonna stick to the game itself and try to be as unbiased as possible.Have there been any bugs since I've played this? Looking at my hours it would be tough to say that the game is perfect and has no bugs however the only bugs I've experienced were WAAAAY in the early days of this game and the devs? Pretty nice people trying to fix bug mistakes the second they learn about it just that they give the update to it a while later somewhat causing different bugs but hey progammers know that pain. Can't make anything perfect.So how about gameplay? Well it's a 4 v 1... well no more like it's suppose to be a 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 in some instances but more times than not 4 v 1 either play as a killer or 1 of 4 survivors trying to kill the survivors or escape from the killer. Perks that help with escaping with killing for being un noticed and general things that help in the game. So the areas you play it in are randomized but there's always like a... ""base"" kit so to say to help keep your bearings somewhat and a general idea of where some things are. Many different killers to choose from that fit how you play. Survivors are more or less ""skins"" however at least get all of the characters to level 40 that way you can get that characters ""Perks"" to help in the game itself. There's... not much to say in story as it's just a multiplayer player vs player interaction though there is some character backstory to HOW they got into this situation for the survivors and killers themselves and some for certain items. Can you get your moneys worth? Ok for the base game it comes with 5... 6 survivors at base And 5 killers with different playstyles and able to unlock ther killers or survivors just from playing the game a bunch and all for just $20 american dollars which is pretty cheap. Most of the dlc is just 1 killer and 1 survivor for like.. 7 dollars which isn't much if you don't WANT to sink a lot of hours just to unlock one or the other though im not saying TO buy the dlc if you buy it just if you enjoy the game but want to play as a different killer or want to play as a new survivor that option is available to you.TL DR $20 Dollars were well spent DLC is there incase you want it still a toxic community",Dead by Daylight

2018-12-11,0,0,291,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I've devoted a sizable portion of my life playing this. It has without a doubt had it's ups and downs. Game balance is a very tenuous thing and it's constantly shifting one way or the other. At the start of every event and when new dlc are released connectivity issues arise in abundance. The issues normally persist for a day or two before being fixed. This happens every single time without fail.On nearly every major update something significant breaks as well. For example what should have been a minor audio tweak turned into a survivor bug that instigated the chase music at random intervals even when the killer wasn't even remotely close to you. It took the devs over a week to fix that.This game has it's issues and flaws I will never deny that. That being said this is by far one of my favorite games of all time. There is something special about this game I don't know if it's the haunting acoustic intro music or the incredibly intense adrenaline scares caused by Michael Myers appearing out of nowhere or any number of other awesome things. This game is fairly easy to pick up for beginners on the survivor side. It's pretty much pressing the M1 button and trying to stay away from the killer (tip if you are being chased aim your camera behind you intermittently to check and see what the killer is doing.). I feel like the killer side is a lot more difficult to grasp for beginners. Each killer has a different power/ability that is wildly different from each other. It will take a lot of time and experience to fully grasp and understand each ability. I will say that the community can be fairly toxic. I honestly recommend hiding the after game chat if you don't want to see some pretty hateful stuff. Solo queue survivor can be a pretty stressful experience I personally recommend finding a group of friends to play survivor with it will likely make things more enjoyable.Re reading this I realize it sounds kind of negative about the game but in my eyes this is just healthy constructive criticism. I'd like to reiterate that I could not possibly recommend this game more. Slight disclaimer this game was gifted to me by a friend over a year ago (nearly two years). I typically only play survivor with a group of two or three friends and those games have been some of my best experiences in recent memory.EDIT Just some grammar fixes.,Dead by Daylight

2017-05-07,0,0,553,False,Recommended,"Well now that i passed the 500 hours line guess it's time to do a proper review for this game DLet's start with saying that Dead by Daylight unlike the game name itself and the tags is not an horror game. If you are searching for a scary game that's not what you are searching for except for some nice jumpscares when killer is Micheal Myers/has Tinkerer and pop up from behind a wall.It takes more the shape of a competitive/cooperative (at least on the survivors side) game and will make you sweat on your keyboard both as a survivor while trying to escape the killer and as a killer when chasing down survivors.Game mechanics are well balanced even if the killer sometimes has more control on the result of the game than the survivors.In the overall the experience is very enjoyable and I would recommend it.Something else?Oh right... THIS GAME NEEDS DAMND DEDICATED SERVERS. I'm tired of having to switch several lobbies before finding a killer with a decent ping becouse yes it can be incredible but real every game (even ""ranked"" ones) is hosted on the killer's pc.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-22,0,0,1491,False,Recommended,I've been playing this game basically since it came out. I've seen it all. The good and the bad times.1) If you hate bugs game breaking glitches laggy teammates and opponents you might wanne pass on. I'd say 8/10 matches go quite well maybe a broken animation or a bit of lag but playable. The rest well from hilarious glichtes that dont break the game to lag and bugs that might just throw you out of the match I've seen it done it suffered from it.2) Ignore post game chat. It's most likely just a killer complaining about survivors being OP or a survivor complaining about the killer camping or a survivor sandbagging. 3) Rank means nothing. You can be rank 1 and still be bad at the game or a rank 20 after the rank reset and own every match. 4) The community is ok.5) By default almost every newkiller dlc release will have everyone complaining about the killer being OP just because no one knows how to play against them.6) There are two types of survivors A the newbie not knowing how to play the game properly wanting to win the match by crouching along the edges of the map and hiding in lockers. B The 1000 hrs + player who know dont care about surviving but about completing objectives saving teammates and mostly playing with the killer until they get caught or escape.7) If you see a streamer show off a bug that breaks the game be prepared you wont have normal match until its fixed the Devs like their holidays and week ends ++ They put out new killers quite regularly. Not always a good thing.++ New maps are free. Yeah!++ Active community++ Cometics but you can get some from playing the game Bugs dont expect them to be fixed anytime soon Bad game mechanics (camping infinites) Killer favoured devs Cosmetics It aint really scarry...You gotta like the gamemode.

2018-11-21,0,0,336,False,Recommended,"Pretty much the best ""Play a slasher movie killer"" game out right now. The game constantly updates with balance changes and new characters which can be good and bad. Every 3 months or so a new DLC comes out for $7 with a new killer survivor and map. While you can pay for it you can also earn shards in game to get it without paying which I appreciate. If I could mention one thing that could presuade you not to pick this up it is this. This is a very toxic community or at least it can be. I recommend having your steam profile to friends only and ignoring the after lobby chat that way you can mostly ignore the toxicity. (When i first got the game it was in the process of getting review bombed because of an actually needed balance change.) This game takes awhile to get used to and even longer to get all of the perks you want. Despite this it is a lot of fun as both survivor and killer and it is a lot of fun to survive with friends (even if it can lead to some irritating killer matches if everyone's on discord). You can even play solely with friends with all the perks available which is always fun to verbally taunt each other while chasing each other. Basic outline if you have at least one friend who can show you the ropes and if you can get used to both roles this game will keep you entertained for a long while.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-02,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Good game but not the best. I was excited to check this game out. It seemed like a big change from your standard FPS/MP game. The first hour was spent figuring out why I couldnt get the game to work after install. It had something with my firewall blocking it because I wasn't running it as an admin. After screwing around for a while I was finally able to log in and pick a character. Sweet! Went to check out the tutorial and the game crashed. Ran out of time to play for a bit. Later that night I managed to log in and decided to screw the tutorial. I would have to figure it out. I decided to play as a survivor thinking that the worst thing that could happen if I sucked would be that I died right away. Luckily the controls weren't that hard to understand and it worked perfectly with my XBOX 1 control. This game made me jump consistently while I played. There is nothing like the Oh S*** feeling you get when you hear that creepy music getting louder and louder. I was almost sold on this game. Except it started to get a bit repetetive after a while. There were a few different maps and being hunted by different bad guys was pretty awesome. Then I tried to play the bad guy. I logged in and waited... and waited. It dawned on me the community isn't big enough to consistently provide you with matches if you are the villan. People would come in then they would pop out. Eventually I gave up and went to be a survivor. Bottom line is that if you got it on sale then lucky you. Would I pay the $20 price point and then more to unlock characters and villans? No not going to. Its half a game and they want to nickel and dime you in order to expand it.,Dead by Daylight

The lobby wait times (especially as the killer) however are a major problem I have waited as long as 38 minutes for a match (as the killer) which in my opinion is unacceptable.

2018-11-21,0,0,211,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a good game all around because it's thrilling and really gets the heart racing at times. Over time you'll get better and learn more about the game and it's mechanics. It's gotten to the point where I can tell who the killer is in the first minute of the game without actually seeing them just because I know their mechanics so well. So just for your information DBD quickly changes from a horror game to a competitive ranked game.PROS Genuinely scary gets less scary over time but still scary if you're not paying attentionFun game the developers do a good job with updating it.The developers are really when it comes to people ragequitting so you won't have to deal with much of that(if you report it).CONS 90% of the community. If you play DBD you need to have tough skin and you can't let a bunch of toxic s get to you. Basically don't give a to toxic s.Sometimes the community complains about new killers and gets them nerfed even though they don't need to be all they need to do is get better. (That's why Freddy sucks now.....)Finally most of the new characters come from DLC and cost money which is rather annoying. I understand making the licensed killers cost money but not the ones they've added like Doctor and Hag.So my advice to you is to get DBD if you like both horror and competitive ranked games have tough skin and make good choices about DLC. For example the main thing in DLC is killers. Research a killer and make sure you really want it before getting it.That's all. Enjoy DBD!,Dead by Daylight

Dead by Daylight has a very good atmosphere as long as the game is played properly. Sure there are those people who are toxic and joke around the whole time but all games have those people. Even when you lose most of the time you would have had your thrill and fun before you lost.Overall Pretty good game takes some time to learn may get repetitive If you are planning to get Dead by Daylight you should get it on sale.

2016-07-02,0,0,1014,False,Recommended,"I've played this game somewhat consistently with some breaks since its release back in 2016. Sure the game isn't perfectly balanced and probably won't ever be but it's really fun nonetheless.Most people complaining about certain mechanics being ""OP"" probably didn't even play when actual unfair mechanics existed such as infinites no hook respawns (basically you can't hook anyone) 20 second cooldown sprint burst crazy pallet spawns and so much more. The game is in a much better state now than it was before.Another common complaint is that the game is ""unplayable it's so buggy"". The fact of the matter is the game is really not buggy outside of a few major bugs which I have personally only come across a few times. Sometimes they accidentally introduce a new bug but they usually fix it within a couple days. The real issue is the lack of servers. If the killer (killers host the match) has a high ping things that registered as happening on his end may not match yours. This is an actual problem but the devs have added a way of checking the killer's ping beforehand so you know in advance to search for a new game if the latency is bad.That might seem like a lot but with those two things aside the game is actually really good for what you pay ($10 on sale is almost nothing). Because playing as survivor and killer is so different each side is like a game of its own. This may be somewhat biased but in terms of gameplay matches almost always play different from the last and to an extent you determine you how you want to play. Every killer plays very different from each other and different perks can really change how you play. If you are new to the game there are perks that can assist you. If you are more experienced there are perks that can be pretty helpful in the right hands.Even though I have played this game for quite some time I still learn new things here and there and still have room to improve. The game might be a little hard to pick up if you're a new player but it's gonna be a while before you truly get bored of the game. DBD is not for everyone though. There isn't really another game to compare it to as there's not really many 1v4s. But if the game looks interesting at all to you I'd give it a try because I never thought that I'd still be playing this game when I bought it back in 2016.",Dead by Daylight

Balanced matchmaking once you get out of rank 20 15 (starting ranks).Have to add that the monthly rank reset is a poor design choice though because it pretty much moves all players within 5 ranks (10 15) instead of 15 (1 15) which leads to relatively unbalanced games for a week or two.,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-24,0,0,44,False,Recommended,A fun game where you can be either a killer attempting to sacrifice four people to some supernatural being or a survivor trying to fix generators and just stay alive and escape. In my opinion this game lets people with various playstyles choose their favourite role. As survivor you have to sneak around and play with team as you recieve additional points for healing or helping players which have been caught and hooked by the killer. It is good for people with good mechanical skills since if you are not good at it the skill check minigame while fixing generator might be annoying untill you have trained a bit. As killer you are a solo player. You have to think ahead and use your resources to raise your chances of killing all the survivors. Camping hooks and just mindlessly following whoever shows around will not help you succeed. It would take too long to explain everything but you should note that this game is more than meets the eye. The community can be pretty toxic on both survivor and killer side but that is disease which affects any online game nowadays.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-14,0,0,27,False,Not Recommended,"Edit I no longer recommend this game and I shall tell you why but first let me tell you a story on how I found this game (Also ignore what I said at the top it's my original review it no longer applies. Also TL DR it's a rant if you get offended or triggered please end your existence)So how did I find this game? Well it goes back to roughly mid April of 2016 where one night me and my friend (Who shall not be named) where looking through our queues to see whether we could find a good game to look forward to or play anyway I stumbled upon this game ""Dead by Daylight"" the name intrigued us both and we both watched the trailer. I didn't take much interest into it as Assymetirical (I believe that's how you spell it) horror games don't interest me anyway my friend is really intrigued by this he then does some research on it and it turns out it was coming out in June which was close to when we where looking for games anyway a month later give or take he pre orders the Deluxe Edition (Which has no value anymore considering all you get is art and a soundtrack). Not knowing that if you did this you where then able to and two other people enter the Beta (Which I will get onto later) he then sends me and another friend a key (This other friend is not going to be named again). Shortly after the Beta begins we are excited to play it and what do you know? It's a decent game! Besides the horrible optimization and frequent bugs and crashes it was good. This then prompted me and my other friend who played with us to pre order the game and so we did when then waited about 1 2 weeks for the release once released we downloaded the game and began playing it it was fun lots of hype! Shortly after I write the review at the top. A few weeks pass and me and my friend (The friend who bought the Deluxe Edition) and we would play it whenever we wanted to we then heard news of a new killer and we where excited we played as and agasint the new killer it was fun for a while. And then... It stopped. What stopped you may ask? Well the fun aspect I didn't find it fun anymore. And NOW we get into the review (I know right finnaly?!). Now I have to keep this short as Steam don't allow in depth reviews so here goes.Toxic CommunityToo little variety of killersToo many survivors (In my opinion)Horrible optimization (LITERALLY getting 80.C on my GPU in game on medium settings at 30fps for a game that is in Unreal this in my opinion is unacceptable)I don't know about update frequency due to me uninstalling the game months ago so please tell me how that is in the comments. But from when I used to play this game good updates weren't frequent and pointless ones where.Also this isn't Team Fortress 2 what's the point in paying for cosmetics? (Irony)As a whole I don't recommend this game there isn't much in it for me to enjoy and even if I did come back to playing it I wouldn't enjoy even most of my friends who bought don't play it anymore.Well what do I know? You may enjoy it but I don't just get it on sale.

2018-11-21,0,0,193,False,Recommended,"A very fun game with somewhat overly simplified mechanics that lead to problematic gameplay and toxicity. Toxicity in the community is primarily generated (no pun intended) by pitting two factions of players against eachother while each side utilizes the mechanics aformentioned to accomplish their respective objectives. However one way or the other the game tends to be lopsided favouring either Killers or Survivors depending on the most recent rebalancing.Stalemates are a commonplace element a prime example being the ""Hatch"" where standoffs hold the game indefinitely on the last survivor and the killer staring eachother down at point blank. If the Killer hits first the survivor can Escape due to a small window of oppritunity if the Survivor jumps first the Killer can Grab them within a slightly larger window. Similar situations are frequently found in simple Killer strategies such as ""facecamping"" and the like or the lack of consistency in element functionality. Where struggle meeters stick and animations lead you into comprisming situations despite not making much sense visually (ignoring pallets strange misses etc).While a point of contention there is little to do beyond radical redesign to alleviate these sort of interpersonal challenges beyond continued refinement of the games infestructure and a close monitoring of the hosts Ping prior to the match (some abuse of ""lag switching"" does occur and a laggy host will completely break the game).Over all Dead by Daylight is very enjoyable sometimes more in simply filling out the Bloodweb than actual gameplay and the most important thing to do is remember not to respond to Toxcity with Toxicity as tempting as it is. Unfortunately the community thrives on that cycle and in a strange way hates itself more with every Trial completed.So have fun be well and try to laugh at the absurdity of it.

2018-09-02,0,0,371,False,Recommended,"This game is a very skill based game in which both sides require diffrent skills. This is a very fun game that in my opinion never gets old. One problem that stood out to me alot was how killer chases could last for a very long time in the higher ranks (around 15 1). Both sides have their toxicity as face camping is prevelant in the killers and t bagging is common in the surivivors. Both sides have their issues but I'm going to stay neutral because as having many hours on both sides I will have to say that both situations are annoying. I do understand that survivors looping is the only decent way to not die but for killers it is very annoying and time consuming. And on the other hand face camping or just proxy camping (patrolling general area) is annoying on the survivor side I do understand that people don't buy games to be told what to do. Everytime I play killer there is always something ""wrong"" with my gameplay that causes me to be **** on in the end game chat over maybe staying 20 metres within the hook area. Survivors act as if everything that happens is the killers fought. Lets be honest would you want to be looped flashlighted body blocked and t bagged as killer? No of coarse not. Some face camping is WELL deserved. In ending this game is kind of set up for the survivors to win. *Feel free to share your opinions with me*",Dead by Daylight

As a survivor it's pretty easy to find other players and the lobbies fill up fast. As a killer I have to wait a few seconds up to 20 minutes for other players sometimes (but that is rare). So far I've bought every DLC wheather it's worth you have to dicide on your own. You'll get a new killer survivor and a map every time. I'm enyoing the game and I want to support the devs so I've bought all of them. Pros quick funny rounds (normally 10 to 20 minutes) constant support and balancing of the game events (dopple xp Halloween Christmas)Cons sometimes toxic players especially if you winning a game as a killer or if you don't help these players (even if it's impossible in certain situations) sometimes you have to wait a long time before survivors join inIf you enjoy asymmetric multiplayer games I definitely recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-01,0,0,920,False,Recommended,After over 200 hours of playing the game I would have to recommend not buyting this game as its best spent somewhere else. This game is full of bugs glitches and a really unbalanced game as a whole. I really wanted to like this game but I just can't.1. Good luck finding a lobby you can spend 10 20 minutes trying to find a game becauase of Failed Lobby errors and the ones you do find there is probably a 70% chance the killer is going to back out.2. Matchmaking is horrible in this game. If you are a new player rank 20/level 1 be prepared to get slaugtered by a rank 1 killer with full perks on a consistant basis. so much so that you will wish you never bought the game so save your salty tears. 3. Team play is virtually non existent The game is supposed to support team play but it never really happens... get hooked? chances are you are not getting saved.. working on a generator? chances are your the only one becuase.. one teammate is playing dwight and hiding in the basement locker. one is doing nothing but runing around trolling everyone trying to work in generators and the other one is just crouching in a corner waiting for everyone to die so they can take the hatch.4. Game play is really unbalanced in favor of the killer. its understandable that the killer is supposed to be scary overpowering and survivors should use stealth to avoid the killer but once the killer sees you just consider yourself caught 70 80% of the time as they have nerfed most of the things available survivors can use to get away.5. Glitches galore. Not only do you have to worry about out running the killer but you also have to worry about getting stuck in the gound being uable to get healed when downed unable to pick up survivors unable to hit survivors in some instances on staircases.I feel I could go on and on about the issues but at this point I just said why bother as there are too many to mention and this game is not worth the time. These are just some of the glaring issues this game suffers from and I havent even mentioned the hacks.This game is a beta at best that was presented to us as a finished game... its not! IT's a RIPPPEdit this game has definately gotten better with time but it still has its issues with cheaters glitches and exploits. also all the now its like you are almost required to buy all the dlc to even start having fun.,Dead by Daylight
2017-11-24,0,0,350,False,Recommended,They are too much complaining about OP killerinos. Everything i wanted to say is that they just used to successfully escaping every match (except for the cases with campers) and they have forgotten that killerinos in this game are only to kill survivors. They are being toxic at killers but they become mad when they get killed. If you like this game and ever wanted to play just buy the game and have fun but REMEMBER THAT u have to forget about community you play for yourself not for themselves. still a nice game,Dead by Daylight
2018-11-22,0,0,229,False,Recommended,Very fun game on both sides killer and survivor The rounds are pretty short most of the time There is no in game communication so you don't need to put up with the salty community before the game ends Sure you still face balancing issues and sometimes pretty long queue times for matchmaking. However the developers still listen to the community and show this game some love. Most other studios would release a sequel game so thumbs up for that.,Dead by Daylight

2018-09-22,0,0,68,False,Not Recommended,"I've previously played this game on PS4 for 100 hours. I like the concept and the gameplay progression loop but you need some patience with this game. Disregard any review telling you that killers are overpowered they have absolutely zero idea what they are talking about and are new to the game. There are certain add ons that can make killers more effective and even then a well coordinated team of survivors will destroy Killers (except Nurse which should have never existed). And I'm not even factoring in the possibility that the survivor team could be all friends communicating over Discord which makes the odds of the Killer winning next to none (except again if you're a good Nurse). Survivors have many many tricks they can pull off on you due to the very limited nature of how you are able to interact with the environment and game as the killer. Break a pallet? Locked animation makes it easy to be blinded. Pick up someone that you want to hook? You're gonna drop them right away if some confident survivor blinds you with the right timing. There's manipulating the frame rate of the game to achieve movement that shouldn't be possible... it just goes on and on. The thing I hate most of all is this culture of survivor entitlement throughout the game. As a survivor the most toxicity you get is the killer maybe ragequitting which is only amusing. That's it. As a Killer you get hate for being good. You get hate for being bad. The party and their friends will mock you for being terrible even though the results screen clearly shows you only have 1 or 2 perks so far for that killer with common add ons and a low rank to boot. The only reason they got matched up with you is because they probably lost enough on purpose to smurf on newer players during a free week. When survivors use techniques that quite a few admit are stupidly broken such as looping Decisive Strike Self Care Balanced Landing Adrenaline Sprint Burst Dead Hard and Urban Evasion it's fine deal with it. If Killers use (god forbid) BBQ &amp Chili Hex Ruin Rancor Enduring Hex No One Escapes Death Thanatophobia A Nurse's Calling and Monitor &amp Abuse they're a horrible piece of that is ""cheap"" a ""camper"" and/or using a ""crutch"". There are simply two different communities playing this game and constantly clash in the most toxic fashion I have ever seen. Me? I'm just trying to have fun with this game and I'd really like to play Killer more than survivor but the amount of times survivors have acted like they were hot after a game ended because they were using unfair advantageous communication is ridiculous. Most of my good games as Killer were against clearly poor players but my games that weren't good were blowouts by Survivors that shouldn't be at my rank. Honestly playing Survivor is like a pleasant stroll on a mildly downward paved sidewalk with the occasional misalignment but playing Killer is a jog up a steep hill and that never changes.It's fun but there should be not only an option to turn text comms off (first game I've ever wanted that because it seems like people actually play this game for the purpose of wanting to shed their toxicity because they've had a life recently) but Behavior Digital Inc. needs to crack down on survivors being OP. When you pass a skill threshold that isn't particularly high the Killer really needs a miracle to win.Unless you're Nurse. Delete Nurse.Edit Never mind this game is designed so that if you main survivor you become a genuinely awful person.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-21,0,0,52,False,Recommended,Yes some of the reviews that say the community is toxic are true but isn't that every other game nowadays? Aside from that the game itself is a +1. Playing with friends is almost a must as the game otherwise is pretty boring communication as survivors is something that is often overlooked. Private matches are fun to mess around with friends also however there are still bugs after all these years that are quite annoying when you are playing a online match. One of my biggest 1's of the game has to be that the host is always the killer and if they disconnect or have bad reception it affects the whole game. Overall the game is a great weekend game to play with friends!,Dead by Daylight

Laughing your off when a friend randomly steps into a trap. Or when you are sprinting through the map as Hillbily and then someone just randomly walks right into your chainsaw. Myers moonwalking.

2018-06-28,0,0,186,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Fun and enjoyable game been playing this since August 2017 (on Xbox) and came to PC some time in August 2018 or July 2018. In total I currently have 464 hours. Love the game It's fun but the community is weird as hell. There's some people who think survivors are still way too OP and there's some people who think killers are way too OP. I personally think survivors need no nerfs and killers need major buffs with the exception of Nurse Hag Spirit and Billy. I'd rather not go into what my buff ideas are. Fun game buy it when it's on sale. Good luck in the fog.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-22,0,0,44,False,Recommended,"Although it has its moments Dead by Daylight is a solid game and is even better with a squad of friends. I have put 40ish hours in already and see no reason to stop now. One frustrating thing that affects gameplay is the server lag. It can cause the killer to catch up quick or hit you through/over a barrier since the animation of you hurdling can hitch. Other than that I have not experienced much frustration online.One big change they could make is the lobby/invite system especially when you have a team of four survivors. There really isn't a need to continuously invite each of my friends after a match. If they added a ""stay as group"" feature to match making that would be amazing. Honestly no other complaints really. It is rare that I spend the full price on a game these days and have it be fully worth the price. This game is it. If you are new I suggest playing as the killer online first. This way you can see what the killer sees and then when you play as a survivor you know where/how to avoid detection. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an adrenaline experience online. 10/10 for me!",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-25,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I can't recommend this game. I honestly can't. Don't get me wrong it's an amazing concept for the game and it *can* be genuinely fun. But I honestly think the devs of the game want you to not have fun. Playing killer is one of the things that attracts people to the game because everyone wants to be a murderer. But the killer is just bullied. The killer is always at a disadvantage because the survivors can run in loops that are impossible to break if you don't have certain perks. Generators get done way too fast and make the killer's game a stress fest. Killers are forced to run the strongest perks (That require dlc and tons of grind if you don't get lucky with the shrine of secrets) to even make the game fair and even then it's RNG if you have a good time or not.Lastly the community of this game is insanely toxic. You'll get people that will disconnect the second you down them you'll get the people that flame you for doing a certain tactic as killer (Which sometimes feels required to be successful) and then you'll get the survivors that will run circles around you taunting you instead of ending the game (Because the survivors can actually hold the game hostage and force you to dc by just simply not escaping). TBH I think what the devs should do is remove the killer's aura perks buff the survivors stealth game and remove the loops completely. That way it becomes the game it's trying to be the ""Hide and hope he doesn't find you because if he does you're dead"" game.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-25,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Much better than Friday the Jason imagine using this game as an output to release all your anger to the world just by being the killer (preferably Michael Myers) and kill each and everyone of the survivors. I MEAN FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!!!,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-21,0,0,170,False,Recommended,I wanted this game on release but after careful thought and watching youtube streams i realized this game is NOT ready release game. It's an early release/beta disguised as a ready release game so i didn't get it.fast forward to august 20th. free weekend. hellyeah.so i downloaded it and spend the past 15 hours playing it straight and have come to the conclusion that this is actually worth the price tag which even when it's not on sale is like $20.the premise of the game is simple. you have a team of 4 people who are trying to escape a map before getting killed or sacrificed by a demon killer / monster thing.the game gives you options on how to try and beat a map. i've seen people forego saving others to start the generators needed to activate the exit doors and then whole teams try to save people who get caught by the monsters.the monsters themselves are pretty well thought out and with the recent update one of them can shift through walls which means you have to get good at juking and not being so readable. with the original few monsters you could throw things in the way to slow them down. The main issue with the game is that the server is based on the person who is playing the monster instead of actual servers. other issues include buggy maps and some necessary balancing tweaks. I have won matches against level 20 and up players when i was level 1 because you have to be unpredicatble as both a human and a monster. another issue is the lobby and waiting area is you might wait anywhere to seconds to upwards of 10 minutes to get into a game and those games range from 5 minutes to 40 minutes.The developers are constantly working on and updating the game and for $20 give or take that beats out some AAA games. if you have the bill to spend i'd get it. the game can only get better and once you get the hang of your role and how it fits in with your gameplay the game itself becomes quite enjoyable.7/10 because of tech issues meh graphics balance issues that will most likely be addressed with upcoming patches (at which point i'd move it up to an 8/10),Dead by Daylight

The community has become so toxic it makes me sad. The majority of the survivors I play with/against are pallet hopping squat ghosting griefing pos. I don't blame killer mains for being brutal ""face campers"". I would throw these idiots on the hooks myself to help the killer at this point.I blame half of it on the devs for not fixing some of the core gameplay issues. They got close to greatness but I've lost faith that they are actually going to change anything of value this far from release.The other half goes to the trolls who are so focused on point hoarding they try to justfy their behavior by telling others they just need to git gud aka exploit every whatever they can to ruin the experience for everyone else.This game has lost it's original spirit. Now it's about the same as every other online experience full of 12 year olds who know your mom.I got my moneys worth at least.Original After 300+ hours of play I still catch myself holding a breath as the killer passes mere inches from my hiding spot or leaning into the screen to look around corners looking for survivors. This game has great elements Well designed music/effects that raise your heartrate and inspire paranoia/fear A wide variety of playable characters to match your style Many maps and variations of each to keep the element of the unknownAs usual the main issue with this game is *some* players. Do yourself a favor and skip the aftermatch chat 99.9% of the time. Whoever died/loses whines about it being unfair/how dare others not save them/they only died because X didn't or did Y and it's not fair. Whoever wins acts like they are pro level and you must be an idiot for not winning. There's the Youtube troll vid crew being well you know.AKA The usual multi online experience.Yes. This game has bugs and balance issues but the devs do regularly put out patches/updates in addition to new survivors/killers/maps/perks stirring the pot frequently. No. It's not perfect. No there is not reward/reason for ranking up yet........*hint hint*If you play sans the meta soup it is an enjoyable nail biting experience with a solid group of invested players that will keep you coming back for more.",Dead by Daylight

2018-11-20,0,0,147,False,Recommended,At first time i bought this game it felt like a game where you just run around do some objectives and avoid getting killed and i found it boring and dint touch it for nearly a year although it is exactly like that in the paper this game offers a lot more.Pros The Perk system is awesome there is so many perks that will litterly change your entire role and ability in the game. Ranking up your survivor/killer is actually pretty simple and easy it doesnt take intense grinding to get someone level 30 etc. i have 34 hours in this game and i have one survivor at 30 (Meg &lt 3) And 5 killers being level 10 while spirit being level 20. Leveling up in this game is definetly not hard at all. The offerings / items gives advantages to your survivor and killer. Overall gameplay is amazing although it sounds repetative and boring the game is very intense considering there is no in game chat and every survivor / killer plays different and that makes every match incredibly unique.Cons The community is a bit toxic you have salty survivors while also having farm friendly killers that will ruin your experience. I did put in game voice chat not being a thing in pros section but i do also have to put it on cons considering this game would be more fun if we had any type of communication in the game just like in Friday 13th but devs wanted the players to experience the game with you not knowing your teammates so it would make it more intense whitch i do agree it does make the game intense but they need to add more animations off you trying to tell what you want to say. Right now as far as i know there is only 2 animation for survivor pointing and waving to yourself. There isnt any spesific animation for saying heal me stop dont go there etc. so it needs those kind of animations. (Well heal me signal for survivors is T bagging yup its T Bagging) Some of the perks are ridiculously overpowered and it makes you nearly impossible to be killed or not to be killed. Its nearly impossible to find a loby with a stable ping and if you level up its nearly impossible to find a lobby. Some of the mechanics does not work as they intended i seen people getting hit while throwing down the pallet i seen people getting hit by killer altough there was some range between them.Overall 7 10 as long as there are lobbys with stable ping and mechanics working as they intended this game is awesome. Ofc there is nothing to do for toxic players but is there a game with stable/friendly community nowadays?,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-16,0,0,395,False,Not Recommended,It's been almost 2 years sense I reviewed this game I'm trying to be fair with this updated review but I still can't recommend the game for various reasons. For starters you will be dealing with a toxic community of both survivors and killers. You'll only really enjoy this game if you are playing with friends however this game can also ruin friendships I've nearly lost a couple of friends from this game. In fact someone unfriended me from the game due to them getting killed in a KILL YOUR FRIENDS MATCH! Now lets talk about survivors and killers just in general originally there was only 4 survivors and 3 killers. During this time the game was more balanced and sure it had bugs but they could be managed over time. This was what set the game on the right path. Now the game has over 14 survivors and over 13 killers. So whats the issue here? The game has a lot of bugs and this also leaves the game unbalanced. Survivors can and will always have the upper hand in matches because they have better perks that leave the killer at a disadvantage which also leaves some killers having to farm one survivor just so they can get a kill. Whats even worse is that there will be a new killer and survivor added in december. Developers I'll say it once and I'll say it again fix your game take care of the bugs that your game is running into. Well thats my review for Dead by daylight and I hope this review helps you decide on whether or not to get the game.,Dead by Daylight

Because they both have their fair share of being Overpowered With how the game is currently being handled as of this review it seems that Reporting does absolutely nothing in their current state allowing those that Troll and play ""unfairly"" to see just about if no consequences.There are the types of players that Play Fairly and if you meet these types of player Yes you will have fun with this game but you are guarenteed to also meet players that will Camp hooks and other area's and Speak in a rude manner after the game is done one example I can give is one match I have played we were Ill capable to win due to the killer camping two generators the same general area and then proceeded to mock the survivors for losing.By all means I would recommend this game but due to pretty much my own personal experience with the community thus far I am personally forced at hand to click the down arrow.Edit After a while the game has been getting somewhat better albeit not the best but still good the game does still lack in some areas in terms of balance but over all the devs are working at least somewhat to fix these issues.",Dead by Daylight

Or when I'm crouched behind a tree and they are so close you can reach out and touch them yet they still haven't found you.The excitment is contagious when you play with friends and use third party software for communication.

DLC is fairly priced and the game runs ok. few downfalls are games are hosted by the killer not a dedicated server some lag toxic people that body block you or just lead the killer to you etc. or the worst to me is how killers can now hit you through windows even though they didnt touch you or killers that just down you and then face camp you at the hook.. kids are trash and then talk sht after the game.. all and all the game is great for what it is.

2018-11-14,0,0,41,False,Recommended,Ok i know i might get hate for saying this but i do think this game is worth picking up for its theme alone and that is one of its issue i guess its an assymetrical game where theres one killer who is supposed to be strong and in control of the game and a survivor that is supposed to have numbers and should find a way around the killers streangths yet I come to its downfall for me if your trying to play killer and expect to feel like one i have a bad news for you you wont feel like one at all it doesnt feel the game is in your hands its actually in the survivors hands cause gen rushing is a thing still specially to low level killers that doesnt have hex ruin(which btw just get destroyed 2 3 mins into the game because totem placements are obvious) plus some maps are so big that if the survivors spawn seperately and work on different gens across the map as a killer your screwed plus community is toxic thats one more thing i have read a couple of reviews and most of them are from survivors who complain killers are too powerful they have the nurse they have spirit they have huntress but we forgot those characters have steeeep learning curves aswell and their powers have great weakness nurse gets exhausted spirit cant see survivors while invi huntress has that stupidly huge hum radius. im just saying even if they have played them like 1000 of hours theres still lots of ways to work around their abilities.I wanna stop right there with the community but i can say i can recommend this game because its not hopeless it is an amazing game with an amazing concept maybe someday we can hone this game into perfection where everyone will have fun it is possible to have fun if your even a bit curious about the game id say yeah give it a go just remember the game is there to give you enjoyment and no made up honor rule should prevent you from enjoying it if they are gonna keep you hostage in a game by all means camp that hook. no one should stop you from havving fun except if you cheat then you deserve to be hooked irl.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-22,0,0,181,False,Recommended,TLDR if you're a gamer that's 1). easily triggered by toxicity 2). hates doing the same thing over &amp over again and 3). can't stand occasional glitches/bugs/lag of any sort then avoid this game as you probably won't like it in the long run.Honestly this is a game you'll either grow to love &amp tolerate or slowly &amp painfully hate.Can the game and the community be toxic at times? Yes just like any multiplayer/PvP game can be.Can the game get annoying frustrating repetitive and/or boring at times? Yes however the implementation of new killers/survivors/maps/events which are periodically released within the game can help to break up the monotony of things (as well as playing the game with friends).Can the game get glitchy buggy and/or laggy? Yes on many occasions. And while the devs assumingly do their best to correct any glitches or bugs found in the game there will still probably be bugs and glitches to be found as in almost any game. (And without dedicated servers the lag issues will probably continue to remain)Now despite all of this Dead by Daylight is not an inherently bad game. Sure it could use improvements but it also has the potential of being an enjoyable asymmetrical multiplayer (4vs1) horror game if you're patient and give it a chance especially if you have friends to play it with.7.5/10,Dead by Daylight

2018-12-30,0,0,256,False,Recommended,Ok... this game isn't the best however despite that the game is still fun whether you're with friends or some random people. The community is pretty garbo and can get frustrated easily at the slightest things. I would recommend you at least give it a try once it's free weekend or on sale could always refund it once you've tried a few rounds and find it's not your game. Starting out is hard because there's no direct tutorial (could always go find one on youtube I guess) but once you get use to it and play more it can get pretty fun. There will be moments where you want to uninstall or tell one of your forehead teamates to go shove the doctor's weapon up their bum but hey can't ask for everything now can you? Everyone you play against is going to be different (unless you go up against the same people/with the same survivors) whether their an absolute boosted player or someone who's actually quite knowledgeable about the game. But when you start I recommend trying it with a friend because I can promise you it'll be more fun that way. I personally started this game on my own but once I convinced one of my friends to try it with me we had an absolute blast trolling eachother or making amazing game winning plays that you can be proud of. One thing though I guarentee you're going to get REALLY playing this game at some point but hey that's when you take a break. You can't always have the perfect game and have everything work in your favor nothing works like that. In the end I really do recommend you give this game a try whether you have a friend or not I won't say it'll be worth your time because everyone will expect different things from this game and not everyone will be satisfied but hey you won't know until you try right?,Dead by Daylight

It has a great grind and has 100's if not 1000's of hours of gameplay.I don't recommend it because it is frustrating plagued by t.Infinite loading screens.Crashes.Tons of bugs.Lobbies are ed.Events are usually more trouble for the player base than fun making lobbies take up to 20mins.Rank means literally nothing.As a survivor you will have to requeue lobbies up to 6 times in a row just to get a ping on a killer that isn't 175 800.Killers are laggy asf like they are on McDonalds wifi.Survivors get almost no blood points while killers get a ton and then the devs say the lobbies are due to everyone playing killers...... So buff survivor BP right? Nope.There are a handful of killers that are cancer to play against so most survivors DC. They aren't OP but extremely unfun and the devs know which and have left em unchanged forever.Game runs like on most mid range pc's only able to get 45 55fps on ultra in 1080p. Same PC would get 100+ in BF1 or PUBG but not DBD.4 man SWF groups break the game if they communicate well on discord and relay the killers location the entire match SWF's should be limited to 2 man groups. They also treat solo's like and will hook rush throwing the match like idiots. SWF is cancer for both survivors and killers imo.Overall a amazing game but completely ed at the same time.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-19,0,0,1252,False,Recommended,Currently my favorite game out right now I've been playing since launch when the Trapper the Hillbilly and the Wraith were the only killers in the game and from there the game has made so much progress and there have been so many positive changes that make the game fun to play on both sides be it killer or survivor minus the pallet looping if you're a killer chasing down a survivor but I see why it's a useful tactic. With a wide variety of killers to choose from to play they are all very enjoyable to play once you learn how to use them. Once you get the hang of it and learn how to use lunges properly killer is definitely addictive to play. This game rarely ever bores me as a killer main most matches are enjoyable and if you play as survivor it doesn't really get stale either as there are a wide variety of killers that you could be up against and it could be a really skilled killer which calls for an intense match. 100/10 keep up the amazing job BHVR!,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-23,0,0,1151,False,Recommended,Very beautiful game but every time there is an update it becomes harder. I think the developers trying to satisfy the killer only to play the game and don't think about survivors. Also there are no mods like other games. other games change a little bit every period and they add more things. For example create a mod in kill your friend that let 5 survivors join the game but change the number of perks and gens. Or try 2 killers and 6 8 survivors xD of course this an example.,Dead by Daylight

2018-02-16,0,0,153,False,Recommended,im sorry but iℹ can't listen to you whine anymore. killer is SO much easier than survivor even a 4 4 man swf. do you know why? because killers have the most important advantage in the game speed . the killers are much faster than survivors and so they can catch them. is as simple as that but no killer main has the brains to understand that somehow. this game was actually ALMOST balanced until they added bloodlust which only rewards brain dead killers with even MORE speed which is again the most important factor in the game . ℹ iℹ mean honestly the only thing you do as killer is walk forward . that's it . you just walk forward towards the survivor and you WILL catch them. maybe if killer mains would stop trying to think they can out juke survivors they would waste less time chasing them. its so idiotic that anyone actually thinks the devs are survivor sided and NOT killer sided when they devs removed insta blind flashlights . those were the ONE tool you could use to save someone from being facecamped into death and it required skill and a grind to obtain .,Dead by Daylight

2017-07-10,0,0,168,False,Recommended,Right so the best way i can sum up 80% of my games where a friend of mine wasent a killer i will have to explain the game as a noob and then as someone who knows what they are doing alirght? alright.Noob you run around like a chicken with no head you spot your first genorator you start reparing it suddenly a skill check you panic and fail you decide one of 2 things 1 you hide in a closet and never come out2 you keep reparingim assuming you picked the second one because the first on is boring.The kill comes to you and stabs you you run away in a straight line he kills picks you up (if there was no jake in wich case he whould let you die on the ground) you puts you on a hook and looks at your face for the next 2 minutes while your teammates are dying trieng to save you. rince and reapeat untill you get a fun kill or play with friend in wich case the game can be quite a lot of funSemi decent player so for me this came after 100hours and my computer died on me luckly it was just the mother board so it wasent that bad i found this streamer (NAREJJ YOU BOOSTED BONOBO) i watched him and his tricks and i thougt huh i never did any of that ill try then when i got my pc i tried it and it worked and had lots of fun now lets see what a normal game will bring you.You spwan you know what to do you juke the killer untill you die and he picks you up puts you on the hook if he is fun he will eatiher patrol around so if your team tries they can save you and there is hope or he will just run away completley if you get a facecamper he stares at your face if your friends try to save you you have two options form a swat team and do mission imposible or die and if you do option one but you arent a swat team everybody dies aswell so all in all id say its a good game i wont give it a score because if you need a number to decide if you are gonna buy the game instead of the giant review i just gave (wich was bad but i tried) than i dont know what to say to you but the only number that i look at is its price (and that is the killian exp ) wait i cant end it like that ill get sued well um i guess buy it or dont im not your mother (But i still suggest you buy it).,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-18,0,0,631,False,Not Recommended,Dont waste your time or money. Broken game where skill is punished by Devs and abuse of mechanics/exploits are part of the game which will never be fixed. Most pallets on map have been removed stupid two different kinds of running vaults through window (slow jump 2.1 meters before the window and ing slow crawl through window run vault) window vault in general has been slowed because Devs have to give unskilled killers a handicap and now the doctors map is utterly pointless because you cant hide from the doctor but can only evade him well not anymore and I could go on but short answer is its broken. Not even worth discount cause thats how the Devs get you for more money and refill the player base to get positive reviews then shafts you in the later with another update. Rinse and repeat.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-09,0,0,3291,False,Recommended,Good game that will never live to its potential due to the developers running it.Very unbalanced on each side (Killer and Suvivors).High learning curve not much is done to teach new players.DLCs are usually overpowered then nerfed weeks later to encourage release sales.Very poor character customization all variants (Even DLCs) are mere recolors of pre existing models there since release.Developers never address important issues or questions during streams are avoidant to ongoing problems that are most likely there due to lack of knowledge on their part.Infinites and camping have always been a problem yet never discouraged. Issues still not addressed.Public matchmaking has been horrible from the very beginning. Sometimes taking 5 10 minutes with friends up to 30 minutes as a full group of 4 survivors. This still remains unaddressed.The Killer of each round hosts the game over their network. This causes lag issues and enables cheaters to manipulate the gameplay. Lagswitching also seems to be a popular trend. Nonetheless you are always at the mercy of the host's connection. The developers still won't host the game on their own servers or address the concern of many.When in the lobby the Killer can see everyone it is made very easily for them to click you see your hours achievements what items you are bringing into the round. I didn't have a problem with this at first because survivors had their own way of seeing who they were going to face but they removed the options for survivors and made it more accessible to Killers. This encourages the Killer to adjust his items perks offerings to their liking according to what they see. I play both sides and I think it is unfair. It encourages a bad attitude from the start. Criticize these details all you want but this is the NUMBER ONE REASON that when you finally find a lobby you get dodged by the Killer and waste even more time looking for another lobby. All because the developers won't just make each side equal/fair and unknown to another.After each game your party is disbanded. Again another issue they do not fix.It's a fun game but very broken. I do recommend it yet I'd only buy it on a sale. Oh and the community is more toxic than anything I've played.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-30,0,0,65,False,Not Recommended,The microtransactions and level up system are a tad excessive but the devs offer a creative and playable product in the gaming age of recyling mediocrity.EDIT To clarify this is a casual / party game. Competitive play is laughable as consumables (from a needless level up system) are required. Unless you don't mind losing a couple games for no reason other than people being higher level than you (having access to better perks and consumables) investing a couple hundred hours to max everything and then begining to climb. With the constant addition of killers the game will need to be upkept as certain maps become more appealing or unfun for certain killers.EDIT2 I no longer reccomend this game. After you hit Rank 15 the game consistently matches you with players who have maxed out builds and if you don't have a maxed out build to compete you will need to derank in order to play with other players of the same build quality.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-24,0,0,872,False,Recommended,Although I knew about this game in 2016 I didn't play which I regret to this day. Nowadays this game is pretty balanced and despite what many people say it's not bugged. Not even close. Ofc sometimes you're going to encounter some bug it is still a very good game with a minimal ammount of bugs. A lot of killers to choose from as well as survivors and the developers are all the time putting all of their resources into this game. Every year you're getting 4 new killers and 4 survivors and 4 new maps. Add to that some events and you have a game that you can play for countless hours. Fortunately there are a lot of players playing this game so it looks like for the next few years you won't have a problem finding lobby which is really good. Recently the developers also added in game store in which you can buy with in game currency (with an exception for a few exclusive outfits) outfits for your survivors and killers.I really encourage you to play this game even after all those hours it is as much fun for me as it was in the beginning.,Dead by Daylight

2018-11-24,0,0,121,False,Recommended,Really fun game to play with friends. Usually I am not fan of repetitive games but I love the fact that depending on the combinations of killer survivors and map the game can turn out to be totally different and unexpected. The game is also really cheap to get off sales regularly so it is definitedly worth the fun for the sale price.Negatives are probably that it can take time to unlock the characters without using real money or buying the DLCs as you only start with few killers and survivors when you buy the base game.,Dead by Daylight

2018-10-26,0,0,341,False,Recommended,Alright so... A friend recommended this game to me and I was very hesitant because I'm not a horror fan by any means. I've seen Youtubers play it a bit and never really understood the mechanics until I finally played it for myself. Over 300 hours now invested into it and I can now say it's quickly become a fast favorite of mine. I've really grown to love the game despite its' many flaws. I primarily play Killer but survivor can be fun as well. Even for non horror fans DBD is well worth the time. The developers are constantly evolving the game with patches bugfixes new content seasonal events new cosmetics new playable survivors and killers... There's clearly been alot of work done to get the game up to par and though sometimes the toxic community can certainly put a damper on fun your could and should be having it's not enough to push me away. If anything it just makes me want to slaughter the next group of victims that show up on my screen.
