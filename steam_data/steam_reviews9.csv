2017-10-22,0,0,13,False,Recommended,A simple idea only slightly more complicated controls and options and an extremely high skill ceiling this is a great game idea and it has been implemented in a stellar fashion. My only complaint is that it doesn't have more gameplay modes which would be pretty cool since the game feels almost like how my child like self imagined the Hot Wheels world to be like.8/10 I wish there was more to this game!,Rocket League®

2017-10-22,0,0,1120,False,Recommended,"Where to begin with Rocket League...I noticed that at first sight my thoughts on Rocket League was ""Looks silly and not interesting at all"".Then I bought it to play with a friend of mine and man oh man did my opinion change.Currently one of my top favorite games and after 600 hours of play only I still love every single moment.The only downside personally is that there are no local servers here in South Africa so we're stuck playing on EU servers which hangs around a 200 ping but with it being stable it's very playable. Although this does seem to arouse suspision amongst a lot of people I've played against as they can't seem to grasp how I am capable of beating them with such ping. As I say If it's all you've had to learn to compensate and adjust for the extra ping.What seems to be a very monotonous game is actually a lot broader in the play once you get into it. From double jumping to jumping sideways to using your rocket boost to fly your car is just the tip of the iceberg of what can all be done in this fun filled game that can really touch on your emotions as well. (Nerd rage alert!!!)To just mess around in RL doesn't take a lot of skill or effort but to up your precision you really need to work on it.I normally describe RL to people as ""Soccer (Football to our overseas friends) with RC cars"" but when you're playing it feels like so much more. Having to pay attention to where your team mates are as well as the opposition and continuously having to read the game as there's so much control over how hard and where the ball can be hit at any given stage.With different maps that aren't all the same and with Psyonix building more maps to play on each with their own sound themes makes for hours of fun as well if you also add in the amount of different customisable vehicles that can have paint jobs decals wheels rocket trails etc that can all be customized to suit your own style.So much is unlockable without having to open up your wallet and if you're not a person who enjoys purchasing items in game this will definitely work for you.Even though I'm pretty sure every car is the same when it comes to speed and maneuverability personally each car feels like the do handle different.In my honest opinion all in all a great game and I recommend it.",Rocket League®

2017-10-20,0,0,1761,False,Not Recommended,I absolutely love this game. It's been my favorite game since its release but there is a huge problem plaguing the game right now.The servers. They. Are. Awful.Don't get me wrong I understand it's not as simple as throwing money at the fire but it has been bad for well over a year.In the past year we've seen crates being introduced into the game. I've spent well over 100 dollars on crates because I trusted that Psyonix would put the money to use for improving the game. I know that there is more content but to be completely honest. If the servers were overhauled using this money rather than spent on new additions to the game(most of which are forgotten by 95% of the playerbase in the span of a few months) that would be stellar.New game modes skins boosts hats DLC is all well and good. However I'm at a loss. I'm at the point where playing the game just isn't fun anymore. Whether it's gliding straight through the ball or disconnecting from games completely it's just not the same as it used to be.Like I said before I love this game. Easily a 10/10 title. The servers just aren't up to speed.I as well as a large portion of the fanbase would like to hear at least SOME updates about what you guys(Psyonix) are doing to resolve this. We are truly your fans and we love you.. but you guys need to bring it back around. &lt 3Hopefully we'll see some changes. I'm not ready to give up on this yet.,Rocket League®

2017-10-20,0,0,867,False,Recommended,Don't really know what they are doing with the game right now. I don't know what is up with the ranking system It's all over the place sometimes. When you play doubles sometimes it will be matched likes this (s2 g2 vs s2 g2) g Gold s Silver. It gets annoying when it gets matched up like this it can cause problems like for example toxicity and negative reactions.

The idea of the game is very unique and has paid off well for the developers. The simplisity of this game is it's greatest strength. Although it may be a straight forward game it is hard to master. With great unlockables and hundreds of car combinations this game will provide hours of fun. I'm not a fan of soccer but I love this game. It really is something you must experience for yourself.

2016-02-24,0,0,206,False,Recommended,Rocket League is perhaps the most fun I've had with online multiplayer. It's immediacy in terms of controls conceals a tremendous depth that becomes apparent as tens of hours played creep into the hundreds. The only negative I'd offer is the often rude occasionally toxic player base. There have been a few occasions when I've turned off because of one too many nasty comment or attitude from fellow players.

2016-02-17,0,0,494,False,Recommended,This game is a very suprisingly appealing sports game to anyone who doesn't normally like the genre. Rocket league is jam packed full of adrenaline producing fast paced wild flying action that is very fun regardless of win or loss. However do not let the initial glow of this game fool you for its learning curve is hard to meet. Regardless of its difficulty with practice and patience you will begin to learn the tricky but rewarding skills that are necessary to aerial your way to victory! If you are a fan of CSGO then the learning shouldn't be a problem for you. So pick up a controller or just your mouse and keyboard and start dribbling flying and scoring in this amazing and well made game.Pros Well made Rank system puts you with people moderately close to your skill level Very fun even if you don't like sports games Community (for the most part) is full of wonderful people who are generally good sports and just love to play! Lots of customization including hats! Variety of new maps coming out DLC isn't necessary to play. Cons Learning curve Sometimes lag is an issue causing you to miss shots that look like you hit them. Wasteland sucks XD Can't really think of any more consFinal verdict is GET THIS GAME and enjoy having it suck away hours of your time as you delve deep into the competitive game of Rocket League 9/10,Rocket League®

2016-02-22,0,0,1047,False,Recommended,I would recommend this game mainly because of the just hype and replayability factor. Most of my friends werent good at the beginning but about 3 hours in they started getting the hang of movement and how to play the ball. The great art style I also love the collectable toppers and antennas which are always fun and never seem to run out with the new season 2 if there is anything i dislike about the game i woud have to say i dont have a large problem with the game but i do have a small problem with the ranked U.I and how it is configured I would like to see the game implement a leaderboards type page in the game where you can view all the different ranks and the players in said rank with their stats so you can see how you stack up against other players in your rank or maybe even players in higher ranks. but back to the review. the party up system is very easy and simple. overall great game gamplay is great Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 10/10Ranked/Competitive modes 8/10Playing with friends 10/10 New updates 10/10,Rocket League®

I love the variety of customization of verhicles and all the different game types. Perfect game for killing 5 10 minutes or 5 10 hours. Highly recommend 5/5!,Rocket League®

2017-06-23,0,0,56,False,Recommended,A good game that actually takes a good amount of skill to master and is overly fun once you get used to controls. Also the seperate modes this game has can be addicitive. (I love playing Hoops) The only pet peeve of mine is an amount of the community who can be salty at times. Despite the community Rocket League is a really good game I recommend.,Rocket League®

2017-06-23,0,0,173,False,Recommended,This game is good but it is hard to play with a mouse and keyboard. I mean it is okay as long as the ball is on the ground but when it gets in the air it is very hard to hit if u are playing with a keyboard. So if u are planning to play ranked with a keyboard and u have about 20h into the game then u are problably gonna get stuck in bronze forever and even there it is hard to play but if u plan to play it casually it is a nice and relaxing game.,Rocket League®

There is always a reward for effort in this game whether it is scoring a goal learning how to fly or getting your first freestyle goal. This game definitely keeps me busy when I am bored. Try playing with friends. Whether they are better than you or not as good as you are you can always play unranked regular matches or you can spice it up with Rumble or Dropshot. I definitely recommend this game.,Rocket League®

2016-03-28,0,0,628,False,Recommended,Edit 15 11 2016 Server Issues have mostly been fixed. 100 ms ping is now the norm. Good Job Psyonix!Psyonix when will you be setting up some servers in India? You know the country with the largest youth population.Edit 04/05/2016 Still no Indian servers.To the people downvoting my reviewand this person who is misinformed about the market.Originally posted by ScottytooHotty Although I don't deny there should be servers in India so people in India can play the game but using an argument that they should have servers because India has the largest youth population is a bit ridiculous because it don't matter how many there are if they have no way of playing the game then there is no market there.As much as I understand the flaw in logic of my previous review to underestimate the market in a developing nation like India for a ridiculosly low requirement multiplatform and competitively priced game like Rocket League is denial on your part and on the part of the devs as well.It is because of this large population that India has a huge market of gamers especially consoles. Mind you that since gaming is one of the fastest emerging markets in India it would be stupid to leave that untapped.I never get a ping lower than 180 and for people with fibernet the lowest is 160. Frankly the 200ms average for most Indians is pretty embarrasing considering the large playerbase. Look at the sales of CS GO in India the reason of its success is attributed to the Indian servers. You can not emulate those sales with 200 ms ping.Even if there were no market which is far from the truth people from India have paid for this game and as such they should be treated at par with customers else where in the world. tl dr 200ms Indian vs 10ms first world player. Stop alienating your customers.Edit 10/05/2015Still no Indian servers but there are some servers under asia south east mainland where Indians get around 140 ms ping.Edit 9/6/2016Forget Indian servers Psyonix has introduced new poor quality european servers on which Indians get 300 ms ping instead of the usual 200.,Rocket League®

2017-10-10,0,0,633,False,Recommended,If you want to play this game competitively it's going to dissapoint you if your ping isn't absolutely perfect. When you have 75+ ping the game likes to dc you for a few seconds at a time at least once a game and it's enough to make you want to pull your hair out. Could be a really good game but the servers aren't good enough to warrant anything more than casual fun.,Rocket League®

2017-10-10,0,0,19,False,Recommended,A truly fantastic game from a company that seems to care about its fan base and the gaming community as a whole. This game can be played in any combination between 1v1 to 4v4 online offline split screen or split screen vs online players and its a total blast every single time.Since it released it has had tons of updates with free content patched in including additional modes and maps as well as some cosmetic options. DLC only includes new car skins so you can stand out and are pretty cheap.Oh and did I mention this runs really smoothly the cars are a joy to drive the camera and controls are spot on really cannot fault this one.If you're looking for a game you can play with your friends girlfriend dad anyone really that can be enjoyed for 5 minutes to infinity thats intuitive to understand easy to pick up and play but hard to master and is heaps of fun look no further.,Rocket League®

2017-10-06,0,0,1022,False,Recommended,This game is one of the worst and best things i have ever spent money on. Whilie I do enjoy it and have fun with friends(most of the time) it is very buggy. I constantly go through the ball because of server issues and the game crashes every 10 minutes since the new patch. It used to be one of the most fun games I had ever played but now it has been ruined because Psyonix worries more about putting out new DLC and crates so people spend more money rather than worrying about the community and listening to their complaints to fix this game's many bugs(going through the ball game crashes server lag matchmaking issues etc.) Used to love this game and now I'm just honestly disappointed.

2016-11-26,0,0,2159,False,Recommended,By far the most addictive game I've ever owned! Other games come and go but I think Rocket League will stay in my Library for a long time to come. With exhibition private casual and ranked style gameplay there is something for the leisure gamer as well as the hardcore competive gamer and everyone in between. The Rocket League developers Psyonix actively work to improve this game with additional content a steady stream of DLC and new styles of play such as Hoops and Rumble. If I could only choose one game to play Rocket League would be that game.,Rocket League®

2016-11-26,0,0,232,False,Recommended,Quite simply a fantastic game. I played the prequel SARPBC and I had hoped that this would still capture the magic from that game that made it highly addictive and fun. It has certianly done that. I've now logged over 100 hours on this platform and more than that on my PS4 version of the game though I play it on the PC almost exclusively now as I have friends that play it through Steam too. I never seem to get bored of it. It's a simple idea and I look forward to each new DLC even if they offer little more than a new car/arena/paint job. It doesn't matter it's always just enough to keep you hooked. Fun to play difficult to master but it will keep you trying to master it. Definitely worth every penny.,Rocket League®

Those games make genres and while Rocket League absolutely does that it does something I've never seen. It created a genre and at the same time made every reason to make another game in its genre obsolete. It's polished so hard you can see your face in it and its still being polished to this day. It's better than almost all $60 AAA titles being released today yet they sell it for 20. Buy it buy it now.,Rocket League®

2017-07-07,0,0,296,False,Recommended,it takes a lot of time to master the game. as in any other sports if you want to be the best (or at least 'decent') at it you're best off practicing and honing your skills through training sessions which are fortunately directly implemented into the game. matchmaking seems kind of broken sometimes as you end up playing against players who are way out of your league thus making it very hard for intermediate players to rise in rank. but as every game is just a 5 minute round you'll get to retry your luck in the next game in the next map very quickly. however it has a very rewarding stat system with which you can customize your car to your liking making it a lot of fun for casual gamers even if you don't play competitive.,Rocket League®

I was also ranking up ocasionally. I joined a Xbox team that consisted of me and some friends and we participated in a few tournimants (we didnt get very far). I eventually bought the game on PC because i was told it ran better and thats where all of the good people played. I instantly saw a differance.

Used the spikes not knowing what they do i ran into the ball it made a wet farting sound and i ran it into the goal. score 1 1 Each round abilities where used that could only add to the carnage with the boot and grappling hook.each ability was good. round 3 it was teleport vs boot. my friend TP'd me i then booted him out of the way and ran into the goal. another score to me. would i recommend this.

I do have to take into account that the dev team (last time that I checked) was 12 people so I have to admit that everything is impressive when that is understood but I still rate a game based on the game itself. There isn t much else to say about this game that I haven t said already which is sad because I wanted to praise this game for what it could be but I ll destroy this game for what it is and I can t quite do that either. It s a good time waster but I doubt that (unless changes or additions are made) this game will resonate within most people to really keep playing and playing and replaying and resetting and playing it again. It doesn t have that charm for me.,Rocket League®
2016-01-22,0,0,337,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an informative game that brings you along side the story of a young hispanic man deep in the heart of 1912 Mexico. As he loses his parents at a very young age he must grow up in a harsh and unforgiving land. At the begining of the game your character is weak and defenseless and you train him and sculpt him into the man you want him to be. Whether he be a good man and side with the Policia. Or go the opposite route and work your way up the chain of command in the biggest gang. This game is story rich and the art style is just breathtaking. If you're looking for another generic FPS go shove am iron rod seven feet up your prostate. But if you're looking for a game that will revolutionize the way you look at games this is the game for you.,Rocket League®

2016-07-18,0,0,91,False,Recommended,Possibly the only Multiplayer I've put time into to play (not including any Valve games). Psyonix took a simple idea Football with Rocket Cars and created a brilliant game out of it. Playing alone is great and all but I personally recommend playing with friends not just for the feeling of glory when (or if) you when but because you can pin the blame on them afterwards.The only issue with the game I have is how easy it is for people to abandon their team mates during the middle of the match. Have had to do 3 vs 2 or 3 vs 1 in Competitives due to how certain players react to going one goal down.Rating **** 1/2,Rocket League®

I score a couple goals to get us ahead but the second we get scored on he abandons the match. Now im forced to 1 v 2 and obviously I lose. The part thats bad is that I was DERANKED due to this.

2015-07-31,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Oh boy this game! I have never been a fan of sports games myself or racing games for that matter but if you are like me that won't matter as you get instantly hooked to the concept of this game. Who wouldn't want to drive rocket powered cars at full speed? At times this game will become super competitive game as you race for the ball trying to make the perfect shot into the other team's goal without them counterattacking at your shot. At other times though it is nice to play with a friend or sibling trying to work together to score. This adds a very fun element and I would know. I always play with my brother in this game and it makes the game even more enjoyable then it already is. And of course there are the funny moments in this game when you ram into people or do a stupid flip in the air or driving on the ceiling! It is always a good time. In conclusion I would highly recommend this game for people who do like racing games and those that don't. It is a unique game that anyone can enjoy and you can rest assured that the team for this game is very dedicated as they are releasing a free update and paid dlc as well. If you have another $20 laying around i recommend spending that money on this game. It is a load of fun and anyone can enjoy!P.S. I recommend using a wired Xbox 360 Controller to play this game.,Rocket League®

2016-07-20,0,0,1482,False,Recommended,I first installed this game as a way to test my PC! Since then I have spent many many hours playing this game. While it's not taxing on a PC I couldn't help trying to hit that oversized ball with my car! I highly recommend this game. It's simple to learn but difficult to master. That's what makes it so addictive. Each match is only 5 minutes (assuming no overtime) so it's good for quick gaming sessions. My only negative so far is not about the game but about some of the players who play it. You should expect a lot of ragequitters (especially in competitive mode). Unfortunately in competitive mode if your team mate decides to quit the game you don't get the help of an AI bot. You should expect many many hours of fun with this game. It's also easy enough for casual gamers to pick up and play. My only advice to you it takes only an hour or two to learn the basics but you will need many many hours before you can truly master what is possible in Rocket League. Most people ignore the trainings and go straight to competitive (bad idea!) or online match (not such a bad idea!). Use the tranings to get better (especially aerials) and also use the custom matches to play against AI bots. The biggest frustration will be trying to land aerials (hitting the ball in mid air). Practice makes perfect!,Rocket League®
2016-07-20,0,0,738,False,Recommended,"Great game very addictive and hardly any technical issues. Sometimes matchmaking is a bit quirky where it cant find enough players even tho there are 20.000+ online but other than that it is pretty flawless.only real notable downside are the ""rage kids"" you can get teamed up with as they will likely abandon the match after you concede 1 goal and still have like 4 5 minutes to play. IMO penalties for mid match leaving should be stronger to discourage this kind of behaviour.But still id recommend this game to anyone",Rocket League®

I think that everyone should have this game in their library! The only thing that I think hurts this game is the A.I. on rookie and sometimes on pro difficulty. I say that because they help the other team score by doing nothing to stop the ball from going in goal and they also hit it in their own goal. Yes this does hurt the score. All in all I truly belive this game is a 9/10! It is a game you must buy and play with friends family by yourself and also strangers! This is a game everyone can get in to! Even if you HATE sports!

Turbo boost into a enemy player to block them from taking a shot drive on the walls to bounce the ball closer to a goal or simply jump and tip the ball into the goal.The learning curve also wasn't that steep for a game like this after a couple matches I felt right at home.,Rocket League®

It's amazing how awesome such a simple concept plays out in 5 minutes of frenzy. Speaking of no game holds your attention better than Rocket League for 5 minutes of fun. It's easy to pick up the game and take breaks in between. You are not forced to ""grind"" for stupid bonuses that give you in game perks because they simply do not exist.The game requires fairly precise skill at times and skill gaps between players are well balanced in ranked matchmaking. Terrible players do not always cause you to lose a game and great players always have new tricks and angles to play.Worth the buy and in the 130 hours I've got on record I can say I would definitely recommend this game to others.",Rocket League®

2016-01-29,0,0,830,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a game for anyone to enjoy. You don't have to enjoy any specific genre of game to really get into this. Obviously saying that doesn't mean EVERYONE is going to like this game. It still has it's community it's just a wider variety compared to a game such as CS GO or League of Legends where they have people who enjoy that specific genre of game. Pros Seasons Mode for people who are either just starting don't have internet or even those who just don't enjoy the online gameplay.(Which I highly recommend playing Online) Ladder System Using MMR for Ranked Gameplay ESL Tournaments Local Splitscreen A big one for me the fact you can go into training mode WHILE looking for a game. Surprisingly not something you see all that often in games. An all around solid community.(Obviously it being an online game you will run into a few annoying players here and there.) Cars are all balanced each having their own hitbox (no extra speed using a different car. All personal preference.) Different types of training to help you get better!Cons MMR System is a little weird meaning once you get higher rankings you can get +2 +1 0 for a win and then drop 12 for a close game ending in a loss. (Hopefully being fixed come Season 2 with the new rankings. Will update Review for the future!) Community can be a little toxic at times in terms of people leaving the game. There's absolutely no repercussions for leaving a game early. You get the lost elo for losing but you don't have a queue to wait in unlike most games with ranked play.All in all. My rating will be a 9/10. I have yet to find a dull point in this game. All games are different in their own way. Not everyone has the same playstyle and it's fun to fix your own playstyle to combat theirs. An amazing game and I recommend it to almost all of my friends. Definitely give it a try if you haven't already! See you on a field. ),Rocket League®

2015-12-23,0,0,15,False,Recommended,When my friends suggested this as a game to play on winter break I thought to myself this looks dumb as I do with most things. But then I played it and realized that it was in fact I who is dumb. Yes you are a rocket powered car (often with a flamboyant hat) playing soccer against other rocket powered cars (also wearing flamboyant hats). You d think logically that this would be a children s game but oh no you would be so wrong. I fear each time I begin this addiction that my heart will explode my blood pressure reaches such a height that I literally think that I think to myself this is it this is how you ll die playing a game where you re a rocket powered car playing soccer. I actually think that that s how great this game is. There are no words to further explain why you should play this game. You just need to play it it s the only way. And if you don t like it you know you can just say hey that guy was wrong but you ll at least be able to say you ve driven a rocket car in a soccer match.,Rocket League®

With a variety of different gamemodes such as hoops there is more than just car soccer. There's no need to always have a group to queue up with. I spend most of my times in 1v1 because the game plays more to my liking at 1v1. Random players in 2v2 and 3v3 are generally fun to play with and I have queued up with many of them after the game and played more. Even if you do not like playing the game itself you can try to get all of the hats and trails and whatnots. I would definitely recommend this game to others.,Rocket League®

2017-11-25,0,0,482,False,Recommended,Now that I've played this game for over 1 000 hours i think It's finally time to write a review.This game is insanely hard to pick up. It takes at least a week to get confortable airialing another month for dribbling passing takes hundreds if not thousands of hours and air dribbling is still hard for me after 1 000 hours. Despite this steep learning curve there is a qualittive aspect to getting better which is unlike any other game. You know when you have gotten better because you are able to do things you have never been able to do before.This is also the perfect game to play with friends. Out of the 1 000 hours Ive played at least 800 have been in a discord call. This game is tons of fun when in a call and the added challenge of trying to communicate is just abnother skill to master.Are there things to improve yes. Solo standard is a mess so game modes are pointless and some items are unobtainable without spending money. For aestetic items this would be completely fine but some cars can only be obtained thorugh cases which seems a bit unfair. of course you can profit from trading and afford almost anything but that takes time that some players just dont have.Other than that this game IS my favorite game of all time and it will take a lot for me to change my mind.P.S.

2016-02-05,0,0,14,False,Recommended,Pros I'm not really sure why but this game puts me at the edge of my seat. It's a game that makes me turn my controller like a steering wheel even though I know that does nothing. The fact that it's based off of soccer literally anyone can play this game. It's so hard to be good at this game that it doesn't really matter if you do bad. You'll see people mess up way more than succeed. Which makes this game so easy to pick up. Matchmaking is easy and quick The amount of customization for your car is incredible The price of the game makes sense for what this game is. This isn't a game that should cost $60. Cons Because of how simple minded this game is it doesn't really keep me playing it. When you have someone on your team leave and is than replaced by a bot the match is pretty much over. I've seen bots knock our ball into our goal more than once. Overall Rocket League is a fun game to play if you just want to play something that's exactly what it says rocket cars playing soccer. There's nothing more to it. While this isn't nesscarily bad it doesn't exactly keep me playing for hours and hours. But if your looking for a game that has a couple hours of intense fun with friends it's a great game. And it's not $60! Rating 8/10,Rocket League®

While you only have exhibitions and season mode to tide you over offline this game was made for online and it has a pretty lively and active player base. Just beware of leavers and just like LoL or DOTA 2 people can get toxic when tilted.But seriously this a great game. It's balls to walls action with you and your team trying to outscore the other team in a game soccer with cars. It's easy to play has a nice tutorial and is great for quick gaming sessions if you have a tight schedule the matches are only five minutes if you don't mess with any settings.

2017-03-13,0,0,11,False,Recommended,It is a fun game. The physics are nice but can be a bit annoying if you keep missing the ball. You can get good at it though but then it might become less fun? idk.The mods are just the best though had a lot of fun trying out the different options in them.While some are unplayable others are just hilarious xDOn the scale of 10 Graphics 8 It is nice but the spectator view makes it look wrong.Music 7 When you open the game EVERYONE knows it is RL but as you play it no one does. Content 8I think they are making the most of it and still growing. Controls 7 Some stuff about them are just stiff it takes a lot of time to understand the way to jump correctly.Camera 6Maybe I'm using it wrong ? but the switch between Ball Cam and Normal Cam makes the game a bit confusing and once you start thinking in this kind of game it loses its touchGameplay 8It is a lot of fun the idea and the execution just fun D I'm making this since I'm bored enough to level my steam account V xD,Rocket League®

They've really helped to cultivate a very active and grateful community. It's an extremely satisfying game with a steep learning curve but once it has its hooks in you you're playing every night with friends to get better and better individually and as a team.

It might not be a very long lasting experience for everybody due to no story or any level of achievement beside Ranking but with friends maybe it might just be the game that will forever be in your ""Favorite"" list. Althouth i would suggest not buying it now due to the big amount lagging in servers. After the DLC ball is clunky teleporting or changing directions mid air servers get stuck in loading process (and you DC after 5min.) you get DC'ed mid match and get ban for ""Leaving"" the game.Overall GREAT game but just wait for the patch before buying or it might ruin the first impression.EDIT DON'T BUY THIS GAME. As of 2015 09 02 7/10servers are lagging or not even connecting.. Wait for patchesEDIT2 As of December 23rd the lags are preatty much gone but there are still couple of things that are not prioratized (instead they focus on DLCs. But since the lags are gone IT'S A MUST BUY GAME!!! Super addictiveEDIT3 i don't know why maybe because of creates or general popularity but 99% of community is just super toxic.

2017-06-25,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a very fantastic game on any platform it has a copy for. the PC edition of this game really is no exception at all. Almost every single thing about this game is done right. graphics are no dissapointment and look great. Gameplay is smooth regarding acceptable internet connections are being used. If not playing this game can be a struggle as ping over 100 practically becomes a challenge for the player. Ranking is fair and skill can be shown through advanced movements such as ariel shots. Ranked play is a similar experience to standard play however and i hope that it could be made different in a way that creates a method of clearly distinguishing the two different modes apart. customisation never falls short and is phenomenal. other items may use cases but they do not provide and advantage to the game and nor does the DLC that this game has to offer practically its all cosmeticI would recommend Rocket League to those who are soccer/football fans or those who like the idea of playing sport with vehiclesrating 8/10,Rocket League®

When you start you spend most of the time chasing the ball then it evolves to just being able to finally hit the ball and then you learn to rotate setup teamates.

2017-05-05,0,0,420,False,Recommended,"Rocket Leagues basic idea is so simple. Football with cars. At first I was like what is this manchild game but decided to try it. The game itself is well made from controls that are on point to the optimization and graphics that make the game good looking and playable even with potato computer. There are tons of different customization choises and many car bodies you can choose from. You can make hentai car with octopus topper rastafari car with Jamaican flag and Rastahat or trippy car with animated everything. Choise is yours. But 99% of players play with Octane Dominus or Batmobile because muh metacars. Gameplay is super fun but be prepared to suck in the first 100 hours you play this game. But the satisfaction you get when you hit your first aerial instead of spinning out of control in the air sick juke you did or that epic save that saved the game made me fell in love with Rocket League. You'll get most out of this game when you play with friends because communication teamplay and rotations are super important in higher level of ranked. And ranked brings us to the community of Rocket LeagueThe community in Rocket League is just like in any other competitive video game. . Solo ranked can be harsh because of ragequitters and whiners too. I'm that guy who spams ""What a save!"" for and giggles and oh boy the enemy reactions are sometimes hilarious. Few examples of comments that I got into my profile because of that "" *ng salty kid.....it's sad that trash ppl like u can play any games. you should sit in a ing corner all day long.""""This guy is the reason everybody hates the rocket league community""""If somebody knows this guy irl please kill him. Reward All my skins""TL DR Play with friends or hide chat if you can't handle What a save! spam and play only with controller.

2016-11-25,0,0,958,False,Recommended,Now I must start off by saying I love this game not only can you play with mates in the many different match up types but you can also test your skill in competitive mode. Plus you barely bump into the same people so you never know what sort of players you will come up against.Where I have a problem with this game is with the community now not all the community as majority is overwhemingly great and friendly but I have noticed the Cancerous community is hiding within Challenger II and Challenger IIIPersonally my highest rank has been Challenger Elite but have versed many in the Rising Star rank and have been majority nice.This part of the community in hiding is mainly in Doubles you know the guy. He doesn't do much all game but because he scored the goal off your great cross he will blame the lose on you. Not only that but he will probbaly tell you that your utter or to get cancer and die or simply kys.Now what actually annoys me about this part of the community is I know im at the game but thats why im in Challenger X and not higher why do these guys think they are gods gift to RL? I mean they call me but in the spectrum of skill they are also I will close with also adding if you are one of those people that blame your teammate and after the game you write your witty comment in chat then quickly leave looking like a big guy... the other 3 are wondering why your such a scummy Best part is you go check their steam profile to see that its private... what a ing loser. 12/10 Gameplay10/10 Community** Denotes community that isnt playing doubles and between Challenger 2&amp 3,Rocket League®

2016-12-10,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,"Unfair automated banning system that gives no warnings and will ban you for using a word on their ""mysterious secret list of words.""When they accept someone's money and give full text chat to their very competitive game...1. They should expect their will be some harsh language at times. (in my case it was retaliatory as I was faced with a very disrespectful teammate)2. They could do what countless other games have done and simply not allow words from their mystery list to be sent through their chat system. Heck that would be a perfect time to issue a warning to a user if they try to send such a word.3. Most games that offer in game chat give a disclaimer that they can't control what others say. If they can't handle the reality of online video game chat then take it off of your game. Leave it to the in game emotes.I find it absolutely condescending and disrespectful to their PAYING customers that they would treat them like children. As if not every single one of the people in their company who play their game haven't used a choice word or two to someone else in an online game. Pure hypocrisy from the developers/publishers.The money people spent on the game should at the very least have bought them a warning before the first strike ban.If they ever fix this system and issue an apology to their paying customers for how terribly they've handled this I will change the review back to a positive vote like it was previously.As it is if they want to keep their system of giving the middle finger to people who supported them with their money then screw them.They built a competitive game and provided a chat system. They then allowed the chat system to be filled with nasty comments over the course of two years. Then in their arrogance they assume their player base is visiting their site and reading every single update to the game. So they issue an update banning people for doing what they have been doing since the game came out which they have allowed to carry on for the two years the game has been out.Most people reading this will ignore this final point. but here it is anyways...I'm not even necessarily that bothered by the system... I'll say it again... I am not even necessarily that bothered by the system. HOWEVER it's the implementation that is particularly offensive to me and I'm certain countless others who feel they have been effectively given a bait and switch. Or in another analogy this is sort of like entrapment.They set the scene by fostering a vicious community that is Rocket League players. Then after two years change the rules to initiate bans on people who have been operating in the community and who came to accept it for the cesspool that it is. If you want to change it up fine... change it up. But you owe (yes OWE) it to your CUSTOMER base to make a much better effort to gradually implement the change. You Psyonix are responsible for the toxic community that has been Rocket League online. Don't suddenly try to pretend like you didn't foster that aspect of the community since your game was released.Psyonix should OWN what role they played in this situation and they should have done a better job about respecting the players who have grown accustomed to it over the years. That means a better slower transition in implementing their system.",Rocket League®

This has happened to me multiple times where everyone will have 30 60 ping and then 1 guy will have 150 ping and it will make the game close to unplayable because your car will stutter drive sideways and you will be stuttering 1 second and then the next second you will have been blown up and scored on without even seeing another car or the ball.

There are some people who are good at Rocket League some who are goddamn awful and most can get better if they put a few hours into it (I've put 150+ hours into mine and I'm still learning new things). The point is Rocket League is not for everyone. But it's cheap and always a good laugh even if you don't persist playing it.As a mid level RL player who isn't really into competitive games unless it's Smash Bros or Mario Kart I love this as a good wind down and I hope you will too.Review Scores Entertainment Value 82/100Graphics/Art Style 95/100Audience Range (likelyhood for you to like it) 78/100Learning curve 65/100Unbaised overall opinion 75/00Biased overall opinion 96/100,Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,567,False,Recommended,Can't say much more than what's already been said about how fun this game is. Despite being the same 5 minute game every time it always feels unique and enjoyable. What appears to be a simple fun arcade game is also a complex tactical thriller with a high skill threshold that produces endless enjoyment. And it's cheapFor new players I strongly recommend playing the vs ai season on the highest difficulty until it feels easy before switching to online. It will help you enjoy the experience a lot more if you pick up some skill before entering the salt mines of casual and competitive playlists. Also learn not to ball chase early as you'll become better at anticipating where the ball is going and positioning yourself for saves clears shots etc. You will also be a much better teammate if you don't spend the whole 5 minutes trying to hit the ball. Also I find the best way to combat the toxicity of the chat is to not chat back and just throw if someone is being a *** in casual play,Rocket League®

Most fun when you play with friends.It's like FIFA but with rocket powered flying cars. Game is simple. Play as a team score goals by hitting the ball into the goal with your car. You can jump flip use hte boost fly explode opponents etc. There are a lot of modes which include time warp basketball rumble (you get random superpowers).The game has a great community workshop where you can download tutorials for specific skill etc. There are a lot of customisation options provided.The learning curve is high and I highly recommend that you finish all the tutorials first. Your playstyle hitbox acceleration etc all depend on the car you have chosen (some are free. rest are DLC). There are lootboxes (can't be bought.) which can be used to unlock items (requires a key which needs to be bought). The ping is usually really high (teleporting balls cars etc),Rocket League®

2016-07-08,0,0,1890,False,Recommended,I reccomended this game because it's a good game but it's ranking system is bulls***. I'm saying this because when you play competitive there are no fair match ups. There are two different ranks on here which is the level and the rank for game modes. When you search for a game it goes by your rank but it does not match you up with the correct rank. When I play doubles my friend and I are the same exact rank. When we search for a game the players that it finds are either higher ranked or lower ranked this us. There not even on the same prospect rank. To explain how bad it is even more and all of this was before the wipe and it still happens after the wipe is that when I first played solo duel and got to prospect one it put me up against a guy on the gold rank which I don't even know what rank that even is. I am level 29 and only have around 100 hrs of gameplay on here but they need to fix the ranking system matchup because of how stupid it has to act plus at times when I play my car gets hit by nothing and moves somewhere for no reason or the ball goes in some other direction where it shouldn't have because of the way it was hit.,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,1241,False,Recommended,Honestly at it's core it's a sports game. Maybe one of the most fun and involved sports games ever made. The devs are constantly trying to improve and add more to the game and they haven't really screwed anything up yet. Sure sometimes (a lot of times) I get in a match where my team has no chance of winning...but on the occasions when it's the other way around it totally makes up for it. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fresh new game with competitive and sports elements. And please try your best not to be toxic. There's already too many of those people. lol,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,23,False,Recommended,"Reluctant to play to now a favouriteThe best way I can describe how I was reluctant to play Rocket League at first is you know when a show just gets a massive following out of nowhere like Breaking Bad Game of Thrones Rick and Morty The Walking Dead etc etc and the fans are just annoying so you avoid it like the plague? that was basically it for Rocket League. EVERYONE plays it. EVERYONE doesn't shut the ***k up about it. Instead of canerous MLG COD videos creeping their way into my reccomended videos it was then replaced by cancerous Rocket League videos.Being more fair when you take the fandom out of the equasion I'm not a football fan Actual football my American friends not the rugby with The Road Warriors' shoulder pads that you call football and i'm not a racing fan let alone a huge car person in general i'm more into my bikes so naturally the game didn't really appeal to me but I eventually looked into it more and took notice and I am so glad I didI quickly turned from ""this is stupid"" to ""Ohhhhhhh... Okay. I get why people play this now"" and I still enjoy it.It's a fast paced drving game where you ram a ball about into a net or hoop and score amazing goals from fluke skill or little skill but having the guts to get in there during a scramble for the ball. I've had a lot of planned goals accidental goals and semi planned goals that didn't go as I inteded but still went in and it is an amazing feeling.",Rocket League®

I'll continue to play the game but only on Rocket Labs playlist (the one playlist now that will have non standard maps). But again I can't recommend this game to people anymore.Oh yeah and there's purchase keys to open crates which don't show you the odds of getting certain items in it which I'm not a fan of.This was my old review Simple concept but perfectly executed.

2017-05-10,0,0,75,False,Recommended,A truly fun game for all to play especially with a group of friends. The gameplay is somewhat unique and is like something you've never played before with a mixture of two genres. Mass customization is available for each car however it is still limited in certain areas as it is not entirely a racing game where an entire vehicle could be modified in various ways. One thing that i personally dislike about this game is the matchmakings whereby you will not be put into a match against other players with your similar level or skills. I really hope this part would be fixed or the game would just seem unfair. Overall it's a wonderful game.,Rocket League®
2017-05-10,0,0,1241,False,Recommended,"NOTE I am on windows 10 and the PC version of this game This game is my favorite game to date. It's tuns of fun competitivley when you have to train. But you will want friends to play with If you are just interested in playing it casualy but thats not a bad thing. It's a blast to mess around with friend flail about while missing the ball completely and its super fun to play it seriously too! I myself play this game as much as possible and do it competitivley but its not required. I remember the good ol' days of sucking and just laughing with my friends while we lose to actual competitive teams. For 19.99 USD this game is so worth it! I personally have over 800 hours on it and there are lots of people with lots more. The game is demanding a good computer if you want to play it on high quality settings but with some help from youtube and low settings you can play with 50 frames on a laptop! I myself play on a laptop but am going to get a better computer soon. One thing to say to new comers the way to lower your settings is Options &gt Video Render quality is the most important along with resolution. But too low of a res will make it unplayable I suggest on a low end computer lowest settings possible and then go up slowly to see what it can handle. NOTE it will have worse preformance online so if it runs fine in free play mode that does not automatically mean you are good. The best way to test your setting for camera is in free play mode however. (high preformance lowest high quality highest) I run with render quality on Preformance render details custom (uncheck all boxes to the right) and the rest lowest. (one of them has not ""high preformance"" option so set that to preformance) from the internet i have found a way to disable some effect in the game files and I also set rocket league to high priority in task manager (which on some computers makes fps lag spikes but not mine) Anyways my conclusion BUY THIS GAME YOU WONT BE SORRY",Rocket League®

2017-11-24,0,0,963,False,Recommended,Deceptively fun. I bought this game in the spring of 2016 and I cannot imagine a day I would ever stop playing it. From the outside the game looks silly (and it can be) but while playing it is surprisingly exhilerating pakced with fast paced technically challenging action. If you're a casual player don't worry the skill floor is very low. If you're more competitive also don't worry the skill ceiling is very high I'd say 2.5 years after it's release we're still trying to find that ceiling. For such a simple premise there is an incredible amount of mechanical complexity. Pros Extremely fun. Easy to get into (low skill floor). Incredible opportunity for growth (high skill ceiling). A blast with friends. Lots of in game options (rebind keys camera settings etc). Has a basic tutorial. User customizable training packs (and a way to share/browse other training packs). Lots of customization options. Cosmetic unlockables awarded for playing. Large player base. Multiple game modes (soccar rumble dropshot). Play with teammates (2v2 3v3 4v4) or solo! (1v1) Save replays of matches to capture the coolest moments! (Especially useful if you like to share game clips as you can rewatch the action from any angle or even in slow motion!) The game keeps track of stats! Wins/losses shots on goal goals saves clears demolitions distance traveled etc! It's got a ton of stats it keeps track of and those can be fun to look back on. It feels like a team sport. You don't (usually) go and completely dominate a match on your own. You set up passes you bump opponents out of the way to clear a path for your teammate whose dribbling the ball things like that. When you start to have some synergy as a team it is really cool and that's where some of the magic is that makes this game so good.Cons Some people aren't nice (but you can turn off chat also in my experience this is rarely an issue). There are loot boxes (they're really only for cosmetic items there are a couple vehicles in there that might have slightly different stats I don't recall but nothing to put you at a disadvantage.) Even without the loot box items there are tons of other cosmetic items that aren't in the loot boxes.I can't recommend this game enough. At it's core Rocket League is six cars and one ball in an arena. For a moment forget the added flair all the cosmetics the crates the alternative game modes perfection is achieved not when there is nothing to add but when there is nothing to take away and 3v3 soccar is absolutely perfect.,Rocket League®

2017-07-09,0,0,246,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an amazing game and is by far a must have. When I first heard of the game I thought the idea of playing soccer (or football for you non americans) with rocket boosting cars would be a dumb gimmick so I assumed the game would just be a fad and quickly die out. But it didn't and I was eventually convinced by a friend to get the game and it immediately became my favorite game and I would say it has been my best purchase due to the fact that the game has never gotten old and has continued to be fun.

2017-04-30,0,0,122,False,Recommended,Product received for free. hello my name is Triiipl3Thr3t.I have been playing rocket league for years on console and now on PC! rocket league has had a big impact on console gamers as well as on PC gamers.while hitting a ball and making goals in the air like a boss there is one thing that is really important. And that is the communication in Rocket League. Phyonics has tried to fix this in the passed but they failed. sadly phyonics doesnt really care about it as mutch as we do. Us human gamers depend on communication when it comes to games like this one. Although Rocket League has had a big impact on the steam community. So i will say that I strongly reccomend this game to every one out in the steam or gaming community.,Rocket League®

Boy was I mistaken. I have to say that I don't play this game very often but it is very easy to pick up on and play. Mostly my 6 yr old plays this game and she has a blast. The ability to have customizable cars is nice so that she can have her car decked out how she wants while I can have mine. Overall a great game to unwind with! One downside while playing with bots is that they have a tendency to do dumb things but that is to be expected from AI at times.,Rocket League®

2015-12-07,0,0,4,False,Recommended,I vastly underestimated and nearly wrote this game off as being just another streaming trend but a couple of things piqued my interest and ultimately convinced me of its substance and fun factor.1. I played many many hours of botmatches in a little mod for Unreal Tournament (2003 &amp /or 2004) called Carball when i was in school.2. The interesting DLC and some really great ideas for car customization.3. It was on sale.I don't think i would have bought it and all of its DLC had it been full price but i gave it a shot when i was on sale. I played it with my wife and one of our friends using Xbox One controllers and the Wireless adapter that recently came out. The controls worked perfectly and we all had a really good time.It may seem at first like it was mostly luck but i found myself (as i usually tend to do with competitive multiplayer games) discovering some nuance in the strategy and placement of the ball and vehicles and began to really take a liking to it and score a lot of goals. The meta game is not as complex or interesting as others like BF or CoD but its casual to get you in then really exciting when you are able to out menuver or trick someone into giving you the goal somehow.I really like the customizability of your cars and hope they expand this a bit. The feeling you get when boosting to the Rock boosting sound customization is really great as your going for a goal and the hilarious effects of the Junk blowing out of your with the nuts and bolts boost are exactly whet they need to expound on to keep me interested for the long haul.My only gripe is that the car physics feel a bit flat and boring. Stale even. I would like them to be a bit more bouncy and dynamic like real or RC car suspension.I think its worth a shot expecially if you have fond memories of Carball for UT.,Rocket League®

2015-12-07,0,0,56,False,Recommended,Honestly after playing this game for as long as i have and getting into it at what seems like late in the game. I have just some basic remarks on the quality and gems of the gamePros Getting started into matches isnt that bad yes you will lose alot at the beginning but matches are quick and you're sure to learn fast Controls on pc i feel are easier than controller (i've tried both) and essentially straightforard Community is good most people are supportive in team play and console and pc players alike get along Cars do little more than show experience not outweigh opponents. my favorite part of this game is that the cars simply show how much you've played and dont force players to commit long hours to unlock cars with perks. everyone comes into each game level (in referrence to to the cars) even Doesnt take long to become pro my hours played should show you that 26 hours in and i have a pro ranking games are short (5 mins) so youll end up playing more games than you even realize and level up quick Cons Sometimes when starting a new game the server will pop you into a lopsided affair (not always) but on occasion ive spawned into a game that was 0 6 with few minutes to go. the game rectifies this however rewarding players who make it to the end with points regardless Fading community this may not always be that case but at peak hours the game maybe has 55 000 60 000 people online and about 8 000 to a match type. Overall This is a game worth buying to anyone casual or MLG. you can have fun and the competition is as hard as you make it. more people buy it so we can keep this matches going.,Rocket League®

2016-07-17,0,0,274,False,Recommended,This is easily one of my favorite games. The matchmaking needs help but it's not as big an issue as you would think.It's definatly worth the money but if you don't have a controller be ready to buy one. Playing with keyboard and mouse is not hard. But a contoller makes things so much smoother.Gameplay 10/10 (Once you get used to ball cam)Graphics 10/10 (Looks good and runs great)Music 10/10 (fits the style of the game)DLC 5/10 (The cars you get from DLC are just cosmetic which is good. But having to pay money to unlock achievements is annoying)Community Non Toxic (never had any bad experiences myself),Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,285,False,Recommended,Rocket League is basically football where the players are cars with a rocket boost. The main mode is 3v3 but there are others as well including 1v1 2v2 4v4 basketball and ice hockey. That's all there really is to it. It works it's fun. It's easy to learn but difficult to master.The community can be a bit toxic at times but it's fine for the most part and you can disable chat as well as mute and report players. There's also loot crates but they contain only cosmetic items and there's a decent amount of free stuff as well so loot crates don't really matter.All in all it's a pretty good game that's easy to pick up.,Rocket League®

Better stick to my PS4 for now.,Rocket League®
2015-12-26,0,0,94,False,Recommended,A great game to play with friends or you can just go lone wolf. This game is so addicting when you have so many customisation options and a huge variety of cars as well.

2017-11-22,0,0,121,False,Recommended,I didn't know if this game would be worth the money at first. I thought it would be fun for a couple of hours and then I would just get bored of it. But it is probably the game that I go to most of the time now when I just want to jump right into a fun game session. I definitely have put more hours in to this game than I thought I would and I don't really see myself getting bored with it any time soon. It is very nice to just be able to jump in to a game quickly and the matches do not last forever so I don't feel like I have to put in a long time commitment when playing. It's a great game for casual play.,Rocket League®
2017-11-22,0,0,482,False,Recommended,I have played an abundance of this game and even though the rank system has had their ups and downs throughout the seasons I gotta say that this is a superb game. One for the books. We go to the bar and my boss has a gambling problem and then there's me hitting crates for the chance for a sweet new item to show to you guys. I may not be the best but I give my best. Awesome game overall. Would recommend it again and again for anyone. Although fair warning there be trolls out there that make this game very underwhelming for brand new players whom try to find a reason to like the game. Other than that it's competitive for those who are competitive fun pretty chill for those looking to put in a quick game or two before work. Many different mods to choose from and game types to play.,Rocket League®

2016-08-19,0,0,73,False,Recommended,I really like this game because it unites elements from football and racing games although I don't like to play one of them. This game is really fun thanks to the precise controlls via controller and thanks to the lovely but good graphics. It's really hilarious to play Rocket League with your friends because then you really feel the emotions of football including happiness while scoring a goal or feeling nervous when you lead 1 0 and the last 10 seconds begin while your enemy is pushing hard. I can recommend this game to everyone even these people liking to play rankeds because the competetive mode is a huge challenge especially in 1vs1.,Rocket League®

2016-08-19,0,0,87,False,Recommended,Way too much fun. Lots of options for competing from single player season to multiplayer 2v2/3v3/4v4 ranked etc. In addition to the standard soccer field layout there are other specialty maps including one where the ball becomes a hockey puck a basketball court with hoops to score in and others. Matches are 5 min each and so it's great for hopping in for a quick game. One thing I don't care for is that teammates/AI can leave/join in the middle of gameplay would be nice if they did substitutions when the ball isn't in play. All in all definitely a fun time.,Rocket League®

A game doesn't always have to be complicated the simplest of games are better ones. No hard thinking you just play it.Althought rocket league is a simple game you still have a lot of skilllevels. Wich makes you want to get better and strive to be one of the better players.Like every online game the community isn't always the best but I have a feeling that like 90% is really nice.If u doubting about this game I should say go for it!It is not a waste of time and the more you play it the more fun it'll be.,Rocket League®

2017-04-22,0,0,889,False,Recommended,Where do I start with Rocket League I Guess I'll start with when you first start. At first you play against bots just learning the controls. After like 3 games with bots you'll feel confident into playing in normals solo or with a few friends. Prepare to have your kicked. I ran into a few Season 3 Grand Champions and I was destroyed. But ether way win or lose You'll have fun learning more and improving to strive to as best as you can. You'll run into a few Shi people here and there but it's best to just mute them so you wont get tilted or angry with yourself if you make a screw up while hearing or reading what they say. I could honestly continue but there's so much I could say. TL DR Fun with friends Bull pinchs and hitboxes time to time Mute flamers and toxic people.,Rocket League®

I've spent almost 500 hours while writing this review and I cannot say that I'm growing tired of it yet. They say that for every $ you pay for a game you should get 1 hours of playtime that you enjoy out of it. I've gotten that more than 10 times over.Then fun thing with this game is not that you just play soccer or basketball the fun is when you continuesly try to become better and doing things in the game. You always thrive for perfection and it's a great feeling in this game. Whether it is becoming a better goaltender or a pro at aerials. It's always something and that makes this game so incredibly fun!,Rocket League®

2017-03-19,0,0,53,False,Recommended,From PS4 experience and the current experience from PC i can give some sort of review for this game and hopefully you all will read onSimply put it's just football with a car instead and obviously the aim would be to score goals to win when the game first came out it was great for noobie people to play since everyone was round your play style and level so it got easier to get better at the game. fast foward a bit and now you have more smurfs than players (smurfs are people who make new accounts and loook like noobs but are really good at the game) if you want to be able to go on competitive and have no problem then you need some good amount of experience on the game before even trying to go compet.the amount of things you need to learn if you want to become a very good player is vast and can take hours to master depedning on what you want to learnwhen it comes to compet the community you will come across will talk and a lot of it one small mistake and you will get everyone on your team hating you the amount of talking on this simply game is amazing haha.up until recently you are now able to open crates by buying keys which gives you customizerable things for your cars or a new car if you get addicited to the game then you probably spend loads of cash on crates and all depending on luck you might get nothing or something really goodmy conclusion is that it is a very good game but if you want to become really good and get high up in the ranks in competitve then you need to put time and effort into the game or you will get no where in the game overall very addicting,Rocket League®
2015-11-22,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fine example of a AAA like title at an awesome price!As others have said easy to pickup and play with alot to master. Great graphics and excellent playability. Even if your not a soccer fan I recommend checking this game out!Arena car game with great game mechanics and high quality cinematics that will keep you coming back for more.

2016-05-13,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a unique concept that pits the base of sports rules with the awesomeness of cars. The controls are easy to pick up on but take a while to master in the right combination for ultimate control over your vehicle. This game is great for 5 10 hours of binging. But after that you may want to check in once every few days and only play a match or two. With new game modes coming out periodically it gives a little replayability as you try to master each sport. However it can get a little dull in between. Fantastic if you can pick it up in the sales. Eitherwise it's just about worth its price tag.,Rocket League®
2016-05-12,0,0,45,False,Recommended,That game in rocksAwesome game with potential risk of becoming a maniac or choleric.

2016-05-14,0,0,120,False,Recommended,I would have never bought this if I wouldn't have gotten it at first from PSN plus on Playstation 4. I mean soccer with jumping cars? I'm glad I did though. Easy purchase on the PC side soon afterwards.It's flying RC cars trying to score goals sometimes ramming each other. 2v2 or 3v3 are the most common match setups. 5 minute matches. It's easy to reommend Rocket League if you're the type to go for a little bit of player versus player excitement now and then. Twitch skills not required. While the skill ceiling ball control wise is really high especially when it comes to reaching very high flying balls reaction time needed is pretty fair. Situational awareness is at least as important as reflexes.Main draws of the game + 5 8 min matches for the most part+ Very competitive+ Great responsive gameplay+ Physics based+ Easy to start with but has an incredibly high skill ceiling+ All DLC is cosmeticSome things that might push you away from the game It's still basically soccer even if with flying exploding cars. Very scarce single player content. If you don't want to play with and against others online the game is NOT for you. Controller pretty much required. If you get frustrated with lacking team coordination you will get frustrated with Rocket League in general. 2v2 or 3v3 are the most popular options so being able to at least read the intentions of your teammates evaluate and possibly even trust their team performance is important.,Rocket League®

The pro scene is entairtaining and filled with talent. In short if you don't have a lot of free time in your day and you want a very competitive game with a nice community then you can't go wrong buying rocket league!EDIT After reaching Diadmond last season and already spent nearly 1000 hours in ths game I can safely say that this is my favorite game in my catalog !,Rocket League®

2017-04-17,0,0,18,False,Recommended,I'm not generally into sports games or car games but I love this game! It's simply a blast to play.This game has tight controls that allow players more skilled than me (which is most of them) to do amazing things. It's still fun even if you're not that good. Graphics sound and music quality show an attention to production values and there are tons of unlockables and achievements. It supports split screen multiplayer quite well including local multiplayer vs online players. I was very happy with how it played on my Steamlink and Steam Controllers.It doesn't really fit into the genres of games I normally prefer but this one was a pleasant surprise. I recommend this game without hesitation.,Rocket League®
2017-02-26,0,0,24,False,Recommended,A must try for everyone. This is is how one can define addictiveness. The game is polished to its core and a blast to play. It's easy to learn and tough to master.

2017-02-26,0,0,368,False,Recommended,"This game is great. The physics are realistic and challenging the controls are joyfully complicated yet simple. Everything about this game is high octane fun. The hype in this game is damn near incredible. I would go as far to say that the concept is so out of this world that it's nearly perfect for those who want a mix of sport and racing and ing rockets.The community can be dreadful though. Players think they're good but they end up being terrible. Everyone is a ing ball hog I was just in a game where I was able to come around and I was lined up just right for a save and a teammate rammed me to get to the ball which he promptly lost and we got scored on. Needless to say I was fuming.Let me explain my position I do not consider myself a ballhog. Hell I don't even consider myself to be good. I trust in my teammates. If they're closing in on the ball I'll go back and defend just in case they lose it. If I can't get the ball to the goal on my own I pop it into the air and center it (to the best of my ability) so a teammate can bop it in. I play this way with my friends as well as strangers. Because that's how this game works. You work as a team and you win as a team. Sometimes that means you don't get a single goal. If you want to buy this game I suggest that you get the ""Call of Duty"" lone wolf mentality out of your skull. Otherwise you'll have a lot of off people typing in the chatbar.",Rocket League®

2017-04-15,0,0,2,False,Recommended,I've been playing Rocket League for nearly 2 years now ever since it was free on PS4. I love this game. I decided to pick it up on Steam so I could play with some of my PC friends. Still a great game but Psyonix really needs to put in some work on controller support. The game automatically detects a PS4 controller and it works great except for the fact that there is no vibration. 360 controller also works well but the vibration intensity is very low and inconsistent. Vibration is an important source of information when playing this game I would really like to see this issue addressed.,Rocket League®

2017-04-15,0,0,179,False,Recommended,Why Rocket League is a great game with friends! I wrote a previous review Rocket League when I had 20hrs and my point of view on this game has only improved!I'm just gonna state some things in this review I decided to buy this game for pc because I wasn't able to play with my friend on Xbox (the platform I originally bought it for) I'm only lv 30 in this game to run this game at 60fps you will need at least a CPU around the i5 series and 2GB VRAM I play with a controller and there's nothing wrong with keyboard and mouse but I would say a controller would be better. this game is fun and is awesome with friends Rocket League is a game that you will clock a lot of hours on Rocket League's community can be toxic RL's trading is a crucial part of the game (cosmetics etc.) you have to buy keys to open crates (you can't earn keys) this game gets incredibly fun when you get good at it to play with a Xbox controller you will need a USB adapter for Xbox controllers they are on Amazon if you can't find it locally. To play with a PS4 controller just grab an android phone charger (chargers are around $10). you can use PS3 and Xbox 360 controller but I'm just saying how to do it for next gen and if you don't have a controller pick up a good controller for around $70aud. (around 80usd and 47euro),Rocket League®

2017-04-19,0,0,96,False,Recommended,This game was very fun at first it was all I could ever play. I had a friend that was incredible at this game and he basically carried me to wins but when he stopped playing so did I. It gets to a point where winning seems impossible unless you just have natural tallent or you just practice enough. If this was the only game I was allowed to play I would find some way to get great at it but I have other better games.1 Year Later I decided to give this game a chance again and it seems a lot better than it did a year ago!!100% reccomend!,Rocket League®

2015-12-27,0,0,424,False,Recommended,So in my first review I didn't even attempt to actually put effort in it and I didn't even spell my crap right but I decided to eventually atually give this game a real review.Spent a lot of time on this game in my earlier days of steam despite my laptop being horrible at least for this game. I got something going after a while as I only did 1v1 then I realized that 1v1 is boring compared to the other ones tbh also if I lose when not doing a 1v1 then I can blame my teammates cause that's what everyone does in this game that has a big ego.This was when I actually started getting good at the game and also around the time where people slowly started to see trading as 95&amp of the game and really only played just so they could get more items to possibly trade even more. Then I eventually started to get bored of it unlike most people who play this game as most people didn't even care about playing just trading which made multiplayer worse tbh because people would rather spend most of their time on fancy little add ons to your car that you will barely even notice or care about during gameplay and was really only used to make yourself look good in front of other people. Positivies Good for casuals and more serious players attracts to a large variety of people Unlike other items Cars actually effect gameplay aren't just for looks Great with friends and online friends and it's really easy to meet people and add them to your friends list Once you start playing it's hard to get off it get's you addicted for hours Great online gameplay there has been so many games that I played that has horrible online gameplay and it takes forever while this game it's simple and fast to get on and start up a game and it works well as long as you don't have absoutle garbage internet. Training mode I ain't a huge fan of it but I made it a positive as you can design your own training thing that other people can play which is a nice touch that improves the game No dumb gimmicks just a simple good game you can play for hours Varitey of modes in case if you get bored of the traditional 2v2 or 3v3 Makes you actually use your brain and stragety despite it being such a simple fast paced racing/sports game makes you remember that you are actually playing a sports game as it is Soccer but with cars. The definition of a good sports game that doesn't try to replicate of what it actually feels like to play the sport.Negatives Way too many copies of decals that already exist but that are for different cars seems like a cheap way to fill up the item slots that are for crates Season Mode even though this is on the negative side I kind of enjoy the season mode but just because it's entertaining to play does not simply mean it is good they could improve the season mode in so many ways and make it better than what it is now they even could make it work for online but maybe I am just expecting too much out of a side mode 1v1's can be annoying to play at times as you could be the better player overall but if your internet goes bad you make a mistake or your finger slips it could mess up the whole game for you. The mode just feels like a repeated procress waiting for someone to make a mistake that's all it is from my expierences from the game mode which gets stale fast. Obession with trading this isn't really a problem by the creators themselves however they do promote it by making most updates revolved around items making people spend more money and making them more addicted to training even longer and makes the game feel like it's just all about trading and you end up having people who spend 90$ of their time just trading and not actually playing the game which can be annoying if you are just that person who just wants to do a few games but the person in your party just wants to trade then when you do trade with them they take 30 minutes to decide if they actually want to accecpt the trade or not since it's that important to them and wastes everyones time especially if you are in a huge party. Not being able to choose what you get in crates I know some people will try to counter this argument by saying people would always just choose the good items but here's the thing that's true and all but they could easily do systems where if you do certain tasks for example get a 3 game win streak in 1v1's or a different mode then you get a crate full of rare items and you get to choose out of those then you could make bigger tasks to get the better crates with better items and you could always do a thing where every 20 something games you get a higher leveled crate. I can kind of understand why they have it the way it is but it just bothers me that you are paying money to open a crate that might contain an absoutle garbage item in it and it just feels like crap tier gambling for items that aren't even worth like $1.99 and if you have high standards like me I wouldn't even consider some of the better items worth $1.99 while you got other people who will pay $25 for a heatwave which is to me tbh. Like many other games they are just trying to get your money with a cheap tatic. I know so many people will disagree with me on this but that's just my view point on it anyways gonna get to the next point now instead of continuing to complain.Honestly most of my complaints are on the community and there isn't many flaws on the game I can think of at least right now in the review but honestly it's uncessary to complain more about the community as the review is intended to be about the game.Overall the game is obviously good and I can see why this is seen as one of the best games in a while. As it's probably one of the best if not the best sports game I have played but there is a few problems with the game but mostly the community as like most fanbases it get's worse as it grows.9/10 idk why but I slowly lose intrest in it but I ain't gonna use that against the game much as in a quality view this is one of the most well established games I have played.,Rocket League®

2015-11-12,0,0,116,False,Recommended,This game is exactly as fun as i thought it'd be. Id highly recommend it if you want to play a really great demolition soccer game as you really feel rewarded with everything you do and after each match. It has a high level cap and i really like that feature however once i reached level 20ish and got all of the cosmetics i started to feel less and less rewarded so there is that i suppose. Another thing i noticed is that the ranked systems a little messed up as to where if you win you get points but if you lose you lose double the amount of points you can win so i didnt like ranked too much. Those are pretty much the only negatives i can think of but other than that this is a really fun game that fits the term easy to learn hard to master perfectly as there are so much mechanics ways to win positions etc. Overall a reall great casual game that can also be extremely competitive.,Rocket League®

It's good concept for a game but it has a terrible community terrible matchmaking. skill levels and in game economy is way out of proportion. spent over 50 dollars on cars and keys yet the mk2 versions are so rare that its not even worth it. this game is no longer fun for me the developer is just selling out to companies that wants to produce ad dlc.,Rocket League®

2016-09-14,0,0,416,False,Recommended,I would put this at a 9/10 Well worth your money. I have put well over 66 hours into this game and have felt satisfied every second of it. Just to give you a comparison COD BO3 is $60 and has offered me less than half of the entertainment that I got from this game. Not only that but the constant updates show that the creators really care about how their games turn out. On a scale of 1 10 I would put this at an 9/10 because the only flaw would be it's standard controls. This game is still amazing.,Rocket League®
2016-09-14,0,0,497,False,Recommended,I have never played a game with this level of replayability. It's incredibly easy to pick up but has an almost nonexistent skill ceiling. After playing for hundreds of hours you are always learning new things and improving. The gameplay is incredibly fun and intense and includes many game modes to vary up the game a bit. I have run into a few issues with connectivity but it's nothing major.If you don't like crates or microtransactions then don't buy them and stop whining.,Rocket League®
2016-09-14,0,0,71,False,Recommended,Honestly this is an amazing game. Epsecially with the new addition Rumble where you get Mario Kart like powerups to only boosts your chance of winning. Hoops the basket addition is also good. And the hockey puck is pretty cool and that means a lot coming from a Canadian. If your reading this without a copy of it in your library I recommend that you stop reading and get a copy now. 20 bucks may seem like a lot but you won't be dissapointed. Thumbs Up.,Rocket League®

2016-09-14,0,0,9,False,Recommended,"Ever since the game's release even after all the rave and hype in the internet (especially 9gag) back then it didn't help me buy the game. I thought to myself ""well all you're going to do here is just play football the difference being cars instead of some football player like FIFA"". But then came a sale one year later. I was bored. It was nearing 1 am and I was window shopping in Steam this is a bad combo. Then came out my wallet to get my bank card to buy the one game I'm trying to avoid purchasing. Still bearing doubts I bought it and played it right away after downloading in a few minutes BECAUSE I WAS ING BORED.I go through the usual steps tutorials then exploring the menus bought some DLC cars from the garage and then I went to find an online match. I play for what I thought were a few minutes...aaand it was 6 am.If you're competitive and love to destroy your opponent's vehicle this game is perfect for you.",Rocket League®

2017-11-25,0,0,503,False,Recommended,"This game is phenomenal and I couldn't recommend it enough. It's just clean classic fun and a great destresser after a difficult day at work or class. The developers continue to put out new content through cars and maps. The pro competitions are amazing to watch and Psyonix continuously puts back into the community from the in game purchases. All of the dlc's outside of the actual cars have been free to the players (maps hoops rumble etc.). It's one of those games where you say ""I can play a match or two and then go back to being productive""..... and then its 5AM. It's at a great price for the content and when its on sale there should be no questioning the purchase because it is worth every single penny. Great game Great community Stupendous developers (especially in today's age of early access and dlc's being more content and more money than the base game).",Rocket League®

2017-11-25,0,0,418,False,Recommended,"Personally I'm not very much into football or racing games. That's my bias going into Rocket League. I started playing Rocket League alone and the concept was basically a child's idea of cars and football. I've also seen this game before even in Quake 2 mods back in the day. I don't know at all if it was the same team on its origins or if it's just common inspiration but in any case the idea for the game is easy to come up with. Which isn't a detractor. It's a fun idea.The car controls are very responsive. If it's not doing what you want it to do it's because you're not doing it right. It has a very long learning curve but it feels pretty rewarding all the way. There's a long way to mastering it though which is not a bad thing and you can appreciate the skill other players have in their maneuvres on your way there.The graphics are nice nothing suuuper amazing but it looks cool again like a kid's imagination so there's no downside there. When I started playing it only had football 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. Not being a big football fan that was kind of boring for me especially with the framework laid out. Recently they added extra game modes which are also fun (basketball hockey football with powerups and dropshot). Dropshot especially is a great addition especially for the football impaired such as myself. There's a lot of players online still so you won't have problems finding matches. The game makes some extra money on DLC and Crate keys which give you cosmetic stuff. I mean they need to pay for the continuous support and the servers right? But after buying the game you don't have to spend a penny more unless you want to.Overall it's a good simple game with great controls and gameplay cool graphics. The only detractor is a bit of a skill gap for the first time you play it online. You have to work a bit to get the minimum skills to be effective in game. I hope they keep adding more game modes I mean I'd even enjoy an actual racing game from these little cars. Oh. Gamepad extremely recommended. I think it would be nigh impossible to do those moves with keyboard sensitivity (the game sometimes involves flying through the air)And now a personal rant about online play Also guys please stop ending your games with ""ez"". Especially when you won 3 2 on overtime. But in general. Just respect your oponents and give a GG. Even if your team sucks. The oponents aren't to blame. This game's community isn't very toxic but you might find a here and there. But there are a lot of ""ez"" peeps around.",Rocket League®

2016-07-16,0,0,1496,False,Recommended,"First you get this game and you feel like ""Oh funny... It's football and it's cars and it has rocket power! At first it really is just that a bunch of cars boosting over the field shooting the ball to whatever direction they are driving at the moment.But then quickly you realize that there is more to Rocket League that you can actually pass to your teammates or fly to get these damn balls that are up in the air.As you become better Rocket League shows that it really is a game in which team play tactic and skill is needed. All of which will improve while you re playing.There are however some drawbacks.Of course there are always toxic people and Rocket League is no exception in this regard. Nevertheless most people are really nice and polite.In unranked games the matchmaking can be really unfair sometimes so that you get matched with people 20 lvl higher f.e. It is not that often though normally your opponents are at a skill level similar to yoursIn ranked games it sadly is(/was?) possible to boost and play as a highly skilled player with a low lvl/ranked one and meet weaker opponents this way. This however is going to be fixed anytime soon (or it already is... idk I don't play ranked that often that i would have noticed)The game was developed for controller. It doesn't mean it is impossible or really bad for mouse and keyboard and it isn't that much of a disadvantage for normal players. You won't be able to dominate the tournaments without a controller though.Nevertheless I can just recommend this game as it is easy to learn hard to master but always a lot of funIt is football... with cars... that can fly What else do you want from a game? 69/69",Rocket League®

2016-07-18,0,0,919,False,Recommended,One of the best games I've ever played. The game is easy to pick up but hard to master which suits the type of games I like to play. Matches are relatively short (5 minutes on the clock) which is great for people that don't want to have to spend long periods of time on the game. Even then however it's easy to get sucked into the game and play for hours without noticing. The matchmaking system is pretty fair and whether you play ranked or non ranked matches you'll find plenty f people worthy of playing against. Definitely a game worth buying full price or on sale.,Rocket League®

2017-04-24,0,0,445,False,Recommended,"Is Rocket League worth getting? Ofc why not?Well to be more serious I rather reccommend you understand that this games requires a lot of practise and need lot of patience.How long does it take to get used to the game? It takes around a month to be able to hit balls as you want it to go.So you are telling me this game is hard? I wouldnt say hard well rather this game is real enjoyable when you start scoring goals. But please keep in mind with out putting hours into this game this can be real hard and also know you need to practice this game at least an hour a day to really be good at this game.Is it a pay to win game? No its not! Thats the best part about this game. This game is purely based on player skills and the ability of not getting tilted so easy.Why do I see lot of Chinese ""Not Recommended""? All those ""Not Recommended"" are because of the servers in China. They are not allowed to play with regular servers. So they need a VPN to play this game.

2017-06-15,0,0,1329,False,Recommended,In the Age of Ancients the world was unformed shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons. But then there was Fire and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold life and death and of course light and dark. Then from the dark They came and found the Souls of Lords within the flame. Nito the First of the Dead The Witch of Izalith and her Daughters of Chaos Gwyn the Lord of Sunlight and his faithful knights. And the Furtive Pygmy so easily forgotten.With the strength of Lords they challenged the Dragons. Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales. The Witches weaved great firestorms. Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease. And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own and the Dragons were no more.Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon the flames will fade and only Dark will remain. Even now there are only embers and man sees not light but only endless nights. And amongst the living are seen carriers of the accursed Darksign.Yes indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead. And in this land the Undead are corralled and led to the north where they are locked away to await the end of the world... This is your fate.Only in the ancient legends it is stated that one day an undead shall be chosen to leave the undead asylum in pilgrimage to the land of ancient lords Lordran.So overall it's a good game there's a lot hard bosses but eventually you'll get to the end of it if you work hard enough.,Rocket League®

2017-02-13,0,0,65,False,Recommended,I love this game I honestly do. But I really can't stand the players you get teamed up with in random matches.Some of them are fine they're trying their hardest and doing a good job I don't mind those people at all. They're fine and if I lose while playing with them it doesn't bother me.But holy some players are a bunch of idiots so I thought I'd write some advice here instead of a full blown review.Tip #1 Just because you CAN hit the ball doesn't mean you SHOULD hit the ball. If the ball is right in the center of the enemy goal you see me racing towards the ball to score and get us the winning point. DON'T HIT THE SIDE OF THE BALL AND SHOOT IT INTO THE CORNER. WE DO NOT GET POINTS FOR THAT. YOU'RE SCREWING OVER YOUR OWN TEAM.Tip #2 Same goes for flying.Flying is cool and fun I get it. But winning is even more cool and fun. So if someone is about to score don't fly towards the ball and mess up the goal. Tip #3 Don't.ram.your.teammates.Much like team fortress 2 the people who are the same colour as you are your TEAMMATES NOT ENEMIES. YOU CANNOT PASS THEM. IF YOU HIT THEM WITH YOUR CAR THEY'RE GONNA FLY INTO THE ING SKY AND THEN CRASH LIKE AN ANVIL. I know you're in a hurry to hit the ball but watch where you're driving. Tip #4 Sitting under the ball while it's in the sky is not a good plan.Everyone is doing it it's like a party down there while the ball is just floating in the air. Atleast try to hit it while you're driving towards it instead of standing still and looking at it like it's an animal at a petting zoo.So yeah that's pretty much all I had to get off of my chest. Hopefully atleast one of you read this and gained some wisdom on how not to play. And hopefully somebody can relate and have a laugh at this. Peace out.,Rocket League®

2017-11-23,0,0,554,False,Recommended,This game has managed to remain in my favourites list from day 1. It's always amongs the first 5 to be installed on any of my new computers. The good points of this game A gameplay of car/soccer that was never done before and to me is a soccer game that is more dynamic than Fifa. A dev team that is always trying to fix bugs Constant updates and new contents for cars skins and modes. Both Competitive and Non competitive environments.While the game can be a bit slow to pick up since the Tutorial and first non bot game can be very different it pays off to not be discouraged about being bad at first. You might not like the game at first but keep at it and play with friends and you will come to love it.,Rocket League®

It takes a little while to get a hang of it but once you start to understand how your car works and how the physics of the game functions it becomes AWESOME! Different game modes different team counts and different ways of scoring.

2017-01-16,0,0,7,False,Recommended,INTRODUCTION I really like this game specially when playing it with otherfriend in a lan party or online or even on split screen. You can play up to 4 players with Steam or XBOX controllers plugged into the computer. The idea of this game its pretty basic soccer with cars but in game its so much fun. ASPECTS I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME The game is really simple to understand for new players and the interfaces are pretty user freindly for the ones who just bought the game to understand and locate certain tabs quite easely. Customization in this game is on point. There are a huge amount of cars to choose from ranging from the Batmobile going all the way to the Delorean Time Machine from the Back to the Future movie! And aside all this car models you can also change the color scheme to fit your own style with the option of changing the wheels model add a custom hat and even changing your antena for some cool flags. Te game does not require a very high end PC fortunatelyI do have a good PC to run this and other games at the best graphics and the best settings but even if you don't have one you can still play with some solid 30 to 35 fps which is not the best but it gets the job done. ASPECTS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE GAME I'd like to see an update that include more gamemodes or if the developers think that they can't add more for the price even a dlc will be welcome. Controls may be a little difficult to learn at the beggining. I'm not talking about the basic controls i'm talking about more complex moves to score a goal or to play as a goalkeeper.,Rocket League®

The game has consumed me i even started my own Esports Team and changed my focus on trying to get recognized and go pro! I still have a lot to perfect and learn and going pro is a big task for a 15 year old but anyways if it makes people wanna drop everything and play and wanna go pro its worth your money and time.

I have played many hours and i plan to play a lot more. And the people that think that the crates are bad. They fund the events and give you items. Of course it costs but so do the premium cars and the soundtrack. I dont see people complaining about that. Its youre choise to buy them or not so dont complain if they are in the game.

2016-07-05,0,0,40,False,Recommended,70% thumbs up 30% thumbs down!I ll keep this short for you by sticking to the facts based on my own experiences. At the time of this review I ve got 38 hours in. I ve played online &amp offline in all game modes possible.To be fair the offline mode against All Star Bots is just as much fun as playing online against the masses.The game is fun fast and furious. Even down right frustrating at times no matter what mode you re playing.The game is very well done and has that just one more turn infectious quality to it.The arenas you play in are gorgeous.They have stadiums from Fallout s wasteland to Tron s digital grid.(However they need to design more stadiums. I like a lot more variety in competitive maps.Some new cars wouldn t hurt either.)THE COMMUNITY I have a lot of respect for most of the people playing. But I have an utter distain for the bags you will come across eventually if you play long enough. Those are the people who want to win at any cost. If they can find a way to cheat to achieve this objective they would. And I ll be honest. First they aren t as good as they think they are. If they lose it s not their fault but the fault of others. Then there are some monkeys on the opposite side that get mad if you demolish them. Like I m not supposed to hit you off your mark so you can continually score easy goals? Get real. Then you see a stream of crying comments that do nothing but make you laugh out loud. It s a game man! They treat it like it s the end of the world. So to be frank I blow em up again. Refuel. And blow their a$$es up again! Think I m mendacious?Look at some of the discussion threads in Rocket League. You actually have a guy posting an ad for people who know what they re doing . How the hell do we know this jerkwad knows what HE s doing? LOL! It s comical man. But that too is what makes the game so much fun. And once you get the hang of it you re ranking top dog at the end of just about every match.In closing if you re on the fence about RL I d get it if you like cars sports speed and competition! As a whole you ll LOVE the community of gamers. And if you find players that really torque your shaft do what I do. Blow their a$$es up! This is the only game I ve played that made me realize It s not whether you win or lose but how you play the game isn t a senseless aphorism after all.*And a tip for new players. Don t chase the refuel deposits. FOLLOW THE BALL!Happy Gaming.,Rocket League®

2016-09-22,0,0,62,False,Recommended,If you haven't bought into the hype yet you need to do it right now. Rocket League will be remembered as one of the best games of this decade because it does everything right. Here's a bunch of things that make Rocket League an excellent game Easy to play hard to master. It doesn't matter if you just want to play a game evry once in a while or go all out and become an e sports player Rocket League has you covered equally well in both departments Lots of updates! Rocket League is still being updated with bug fixes new arenas and new game modes all of this for free. The devs are also super nice.DLC done right. DLC in this game is purely cosmetic and is very reasonably priced. The DLC doesn't lock anyone out of anything so you can still play with friends that don't have DLC. Good performance. Rocket League is an Unreal Engine 3 game which means that most computers will handle it and on top of that it's also very well optimized so you can be sure to hit those sweet 60 FPS. Nice community. What? An online game with a community that isn't 100% cancer? Yes my friends the Rocket league communit in and out of the game is super friendly and laid back just very very sarcastic (What a save!).Cross platform play! Yes this is one of the few games that offer cross platform play so you can play with your friends on PS4 or Xbox One! This also means that there's always someone to play against. Local coop. Remember playing couch multiplayer? So do I and I miss it but Rocket League does local multiplayer and does it well even supporting multiple screens if you have them!Play with anything. Mouse &amp Keyboard? 360 controller? Xbox One Controller? PS4 controller? That controller you ordered from china? Yes rocket league supports them all!So there you go I just gave you a whole bunch of reasons to buy this game and if you need another one is its price. 20 is a bargain for this game and it also goes regularly on sale you won0t regret buying this.,Rocket League®

2016-09-24,0,0,93,False,Recommended,"As a non European non South American soccer is the most painful sport for me to watch. I don't understand it at all. I don't understand why billions love it. I don't understand why FIFA sells so well every year. I don't understand the World Cup or the soccer hooligans or why the timer counts up to 90 and doesn't pause when the ref blows his whistle.But I can understand why people love Rocket League. The devs took a deceptively simple idea and turned it into one of the best multiplayer games of all time. The short 5 minute matches are always action packed and it never feels like it drags on too long unless both teams are awful and go 8 minutes into overtime failing to score on each other.Not only is the physics based car rocket soccer Kerbal Space Program flying demolition derby Dukes of Hazard Spiderman Messi simulator gameplay deep and compelling but the devs have put more love and support into this game than most devs do with their families. The level of free support is almost unheard of I say almost because I can't think of any other examples off the top of my head but I don't want to have someone say ""Well actually...""I've never had more fun playing a video game with my friends than I have had when playing Rocket League.

2017-05-07,0,0,15,False,Recommended,You launch the game expecting some sort of tutoral right off the bat. Nope! Start screen leads you to antother screen where you have multiple options to choose from. luckily if you hover over the icons it tells what it is. If you can figure out where the tutorial is your ready to play. or if you like figureing things out start a new season. ether way its the thrill of an actual ball game.your body is pumped and when you trick shot into that goal OOOOOOHHHHHH THAT SCREEM AND AMAZMENT YOU GET!its also quite cool that you can cotomize your car. But you have to earn your customizeations first. all in all heres the overveiew Pros 1.Adrenalene all the way2.Get to play with firends and share the exitement3.online or AI you choose4.Controls are easy weather you play controler or not. That is very rare in a game!!Cons 1.Camra is a little hard to get used to. (lukily they have settings for that)2.It has TONS of dlc (1.00+ real money) for costomizetion and you already bought the game for alot of money.3.people are jerks online. (although thats kindive in all onlne games /)All in all i would recommend this game if you like sports looking for some adrenaline and there is something missing in your life. Probibly its rocket leauge! This game you can play for YEARS,Rocket League®

2017-05-07,0,0,217,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Very addicting game that I've played for about a year now. The awesome physics and intense gameplay make this a very fun game to play for hours at a time. The ability to customize your car with hundreds of different color combinations and accessories like flags hats and wheels for each of the two teams (orange and blue) adds a lot to the game. It allows you to spend time and have fun on something other than just straight gameplay. Sometimes I spend almost as much time customizing my car as I do playing the actual game! Rocket League is a great game to play with friends and provides hours of enjoyment. This game is still one of my favorite games to play to this day! I would very highly recommend it!,Rocket League®

2016-10-02,0,0,11,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is an Arena based football simulation with a twist Instead of your beloved players running up and down the pitch show us those crazy skills you get cars that can boost spin fly jump and skid....Firstly I'd like to say this game has a crazy high skill ceiling for those who do not know what that means.. basically you can learn the mechanics and play in such a way that you'll be able to Lob that unsuspecting keeper from your own goal. The game itself is pretty much straight forward and your objective is pretty simple. Although as it says above I've only played the game for a limited time I did also own the game previously.Rocket League is a really fun game to play as a solo or even with a group of friends it has many modes to offer as well as ""Ranked"" modes for those who enjoy a somewhat competative scene.Pros Free to play and by this i mean free to play and not pay to win. Semi Casual fun Many localised Servers ( Pretty much every continent is covered) Some Customisation ( Colours Aerials Tires Booster Trails. It also offers premium item shop cars etc)Cons Player Matchmaking is sucky You will face many opponents of a much higher Class/Division than yourself The day I got the game my first match was against a Veteran A Semi Pro and a Pro. Customisation is limited although I put this as a Pro it is also a Con. Limited Replayablitiy Although the game is really fun you will find yourself replaying the same arena's and getting sick at some pointOverall I love the game And will continue playing it however it is not a game I could play everyday just simply because after a couple of hours a day it gets boring. For the price I'd say its worth it and the game is still been developed by this i mean they are adding arena's making adjustments etc.",Rocket League®

Its soccer (or football depending on which side of the pond you are on) with cars. Just like top gear but you have rockets and can jump like speed racer. So i download this for the free weekend and skip all the tutorials and dont even bother looking up the controls. I go straight to the online action. One match and i was hooked! I bought and paid for the game on the spot and it is my new favorite time waister. If you like soccer or hockey or basketball (they are about to add that with a dlc) and you also like cars then this is the game for you! The cars in the game all look at home as a hotwheel car. you wont find any liscensed vehicles. But no matter they all look cool and really only for looks. the car you choose does not matter. Yow wont find any pay to win here either. Just pick a cool car and have fun!I give Rocket League 5 out of 5!,Rocket League®

2017-09-24,0,0,660,False,Recommended,TL DR buy it but dont play with ps4 kidsRocket League is an amazing sports game. It's a game that you can either pick up every once in a while or play it religiously. Sure at the beginning of the game there is a bit of a grind to get all of the default cars/decals/etc and there are many other items available through crates events and DLC. The community is okay (there are some toxic players but many players in this game are pretty nice) but make sure to always have a teammate to queue up with. The rank system is kinda messed up as it could take multiple games to division up but then you could lose that division with just 1 loss. Also there is a new ban system for blacklisted words! Most other PC players don't care but PS4 and Xbox kids probably will report you for anything that their mommies don't wanna see on their screen. OVERALL a very good game I would recommend it to casual gamers competitive gamers people who like sports/cars/action people who are ready to have their life sucked into the black hole that is Rocket LeagueEasy to learn Hard to master will keep you coming back for hundreds of hours most addictive muliplayer game ever.,Rocket League®

2016-04-22,0,0,847,False,Recommended,I've been playing for a while now and honestly I thought I would be bored at this point. I'm not ) Most of the community is friendly and thankfully we cannot communicate with the PSN players so the 12 year old's trash talk is rare. This is a very enjoyable game ESPECIALLY when you have that awkward 45 minutes when you need to be somewhere and you don't have the time to jump into an RPG or something. Games are on average about 7 or 8 minutes including replays. I HATE sports games and thought this was one of them but its not. This game is for anyone who likes to play games regardless of your preferable genre. I also bought it at full price BUT its almost half off this weekend...GET IT OR REGRET IT lol...,Rocket League®

2016-08-30,0,0,407,False,Recommended,Part of me doesn't even want to write this because this game is already so huge and so well reviewed. But lets be real The game is difficult. There is a learning curve. You almost need friends to play ranked. Most teammates are horrible and do not want to play like a team. They wont defend if you ask they will try and hit every ball you do. Get a mic. It's going to take maybe 10 games to understand the physics of the ball and even then you'll still play games where you get your handed to you. Losing 6 0. It happens.I Love this game honestly. Matches are quick so I can jump on play 3 games and be done and have only used 20 min or so. They are constantly adding game modes and fun updates and are usually free. Good Game..Good Company.

Now a select few of the community were especially welcoming they must have seen my low amount of hours for my rank since i switched from PS4 a month or so ago. These wonderful people even gave me a few nicknames like Smurf Dog Cheat Perro Luck KYS GG EZ etc.But seriously it's a fun game.

2017-08-31,0,0,680,False,Recommended,How about this Every time a game is about to start and I see that we're playing on a standard vanilla map it lights up my day. Because the core game the physics the mechanics etc. are so well balanced that no gimmicks at all are required. Rocket League is just a really compelling competitive experience with a perfect learning curve and an impossibly high skill ceiling.,Rocket League®
2017-08-30,0,0,377,False,Not Recommended,I've put so many hours into this game. It's a really addicting and fun game and great to play with friends. But I'm giving it a thumbs down because recently every match I play has been glitching right when I'm about to hit the ball. I say glitch because it seems like lag but my ping it in the 20s everytime and it only happens when I get close to the ball. It makes the game unplayable since I can no longer make good saves or shots on goal. So I do not reccomend this game as you might experience the same issues I have.Edit Like I said above I dont think my internet is the cause of this problem. My PING is consistently in the 20s when I play and I make sure that I am recieving quality internet speeds from my ISP.,Rocket League®

I don't remember having this kind of fun with videogames since I was a kid. The controls are really tight. You can get really comptetitive even if you're usually not in other games. I haven't played a single game this much since WoW and that was only because Blizz laced it with crack. This is actually a good game with challenging and rewarding gameplay with a strong ""just one more game"" factor.EDIT 2 I've had this game for two years now? It's still the only game I play.

They constantly break the MM system I have to reenter games atleast 4 times to get a good match as most of the time i enter once the game has finished.

2016-07-21,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Imagine your copy of Burnout 3 did a dragonball z style fusion with FIFA or PES. You load up your new game and you are boosting around the walls of an arena flipping around and hoofing a giant ball at your opponents goal. All of this is happening whilst your car has a ribbon on top and poops rainbows out the back these features only anger your enemies further as the goals keep piling in. Pros Lots of customization A suitable soundtrack Responsive and well thought out controls Easy to get into difficult to master Decent updates at decent intervals Developers seem to actually care Practically glitch free Rewards players that work together Several practice modes to improve specific skills In game quick chat menu for that extra layer of tactical playCons Style of cars and whatnot may not be to your taste Music can be a bit samey but when you're in a game you tend not to notice The program for putting players against those of a similar level is quite inconsistent (teams of rookies versus veterans and masters for example) The amount of ragequits I've seen in this game is just baffling. If your opponents score 2 or 3 in the first minute and a half you can expect your team mates to bugger off and leave you with AI companions. How do you expect to improve if you leave every match where your opponents are more skillful?,Rocket League®
2016-07-21,0,0,64,False,Recommended,I love this game and I hate it at the same time i love it because of the capacity it has to keep challenging you and to keep you engaged in trying new moves and new ways to score the coolest goal you ever scored but i hate it because when people say it's hard to master it's really freaking hard... I mastered Dark Souls way faster than this game (which i still suck) just be prepared to try each new move like 200 or 300 tries until you can finally pull it off 20% of the times you try it. Its really stressful if you're trying to be good at it but if you're in it for the lolz you'll just knock the ball around and have a few laughs along the way.Kinda overrated even though i like it just know what you're getting into don't expect to be good with only 50 or 60 hours of gameplay unless you're like a talent at it right away,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a 'just 5 more minutes' game but amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!All in all i'd completely recommend this game to anyone whether you're a casual player or very competitive!,Rocket League®

It's a really good game to put your time into especially after the Rumble update. Sure there are a couple of that try to make the game less fun for you by talking but there aren't many. Other than that the game is perfect and there aren't any hackers. Not that I've seen anyways because there isn't a good way to hack on this game.

2016-09-15,0,0,467,False,Recommended,"The good Rocket League is a LOT of fun for casual and competitive playing. Four modes to choose from plenty of arenas (both official and experimental) and tons of customization to be had with unlocks! The game is well balanced and everyone is on equal footing at all times. I highly recommend this game in lieu of regular sports games that come out every year because it is quite the breath of fresh air and it keeps on getting better with every update!The bad The first 10 hours of online gameplay (actual time played in matches) during any given week is when you'll get your drops. After those 10 hours are up you'll probably only see a Championship Crate or two every couple of hours after that and MAYBE you'll get lucky and get a rare drop maybe. I really dislike this system and think this is the worst feature in the game. It doesn't make the game any less fun to play but it's just frustrating because it would still be a lot of fun to receive duplicate items to at least trade them in for a single item of one rairity higher.The ugly Microtransactions have been added since the last ""Rumble"" update and a lot of people are pretty upset about it. Personally I am not too upset because I do not to buy keys for TF2/CS GO etc.. but I don't support this decision and their excuse of funding the prize pools for competitive tournmanets I couldn't care less about the people who play competitively for money. And like many other reviews have already said had the customization items found in creates been added as a small paid DLC like previous ones I would've had no problem buying it.Misc Psynonix needs to tweak their Save and Epic Save detection because I believe ANY ball clear from the goal line should be considered a save. There are plenty of times where the ball is rolling on the goal line or an opponent is sitting on the goal line and the ball is flashing as if it is about the cross and I come and knock out and I get no Save or Epic Save and no Clear Ball either. I believe that these two ""moves"" should be tweaked so they are awarded properly.Demolitions are another thing that should be tweaked. You get zero points for crushing an opponent and I believe it should be worth 10 points per demolition just like a First Touch. This would especially make using the Fist power up in Rumble a lot more fun to use and encourage players not to use it just to get rid of it.",Rocket League®
2016-09-18,0,0,383,False,Recommended,I love this game and how weird it is with the mix of cars and soccer. Plus there are so many things you can learn and do here! p,Rocket League®
2016-08-01,0,0,240,False,Recommended,I fell in love with this game the moment I started playing with it. I'm a big football/soccer fan (or whatever you call it) but I haven't played many racing games unless you count Mario Kart Double Dash and that weird Crash Bandicoot racing game I used to love in elementary school. It takes lots of practice to get better at it but it's not like the boring hours of grinding in RPGs or anything. This game makes hours of practice only feel like a few minutes. I'd definitely recommend getting this game. It's well worth the money. I bought it on sale for 50% off and I think it would have been worth the full price if I didn't buy it on sale. My computer isn't one that'd be praised by PC master race elitists but it can run this game with all settings on high without a problem. Sometimes the game crashes in the main menu but never in game. The only other complaints I have is about the match making services. You're often paired up with people that are not at your skill level. The servers are also pretty laggy at times. Other than that this is a great game with amazing graphics and gameplay. I'd also like to add that I'm playing it with a mouse and keyboard and I have no issues doing so. I'm really bad at flying but that's my own fault XDAre you still reading this?

I played it and 60 minutes in it's already #2 on my top 3 favorites list and that's really saying something I've got quite a few games..Basically this game is really easy to learn not too much of a learning curve just know how to do most of the actions and you're golden you learn as you play and you actually have fun while you're learning. Which to me most games dont land that one.The mechanics are very unique double jumping cars flipping around driving on the top of the cage scoring goals in backwards. I mean this game screams sucess.I haven't really touched multiplayer so my review isn't based on that yet. But as far as the single player goes.PS. The rookie bots are kinda stupid.

2017-04-06,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a fantastic multiplayer romp that is pretty basic at it's core but is unmistakably well executed. In an average game you play in teams of around 3 4 players and yeah it's pretty much football with a strong resemblance to the car football played in some Top Gear episodes with other gameplay quirks such as boost and air manoeuvres.The game offers a variety of customisability for your car with different paint jobs accessories and bodies. Most of these you collect as a form of random drop the more matches you play although many of the rarer and exclusive items can be bought as DLC these are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay in the slightestst. If you get bored of the standard game modes there are also a variety of others as well as being able to set up your own customisable modes when setting up a private game. The Servers are very good and I have not had any major lapses in connection of late.So all in all this is a very good game although you may want to wait for a sale in order to get it for a bit less money as while you will definitely get a good few hours in it you still likely won't get quite as much as other titles in the same price range.,Rocket League®

2015-10-25,0,0,125,False,Recommended,I've been playing this for over a year now. How wonderful.Positives Players control cars tha fly via rocket engine. Fun and ridiculous. The visual style is pretty and still runs at 60 FPS. Thanks Unreal Engine. The controls are very tight and responsive even if you're using a keyboard. The mechanics of the game are easy to learn hard to master. It's great for parties as it supports local split screen play. Sadly with PC you can't use keyboard and controller at the same time. There are a ton of customization options for your car. All of them are just cosmetic and don't affect gameplay at all making it more skill and team based.Negatives The AI is not very bright and tend to swarm the ball like a pack of bees. This super linear behavior makes the singleplayer Season mode frustrating at times. The competitive ranking system is picky and truly frustrating to work with due to the fact it tracks only wins and losses. There will be many times you'll jump up a ranking tier only to lose a game and go straight back down usually to get out of a tier you'll need a big winning streak. Fancier cosmetic items come in crates similar to CS GO and keys that cost real money are required to open them up. I personally find it ok since profits from key purchases help fund eSports prize pools.8.5/10 A solid game with a solid community and a supportive team of devs behind it.

2016-03-28,0,0,319,False,Recommended,Rocket league is one of the most refreshing games I ever played due its simplicity in gameplay but rather high learning curve. Let's take a basic look at the game Gameplay This game is essentailly Soccer/Football with race cars.You can play solo or with teams and the objective of the game of course is to score against the opposing team with the ball. Now Psyonix (Developer) has implemented various game modes and maps to make the game more interesting such as hockey mode but for me I stick to the basic game as it is also the most competitive. Controls Game can be played using a controller or keyboard + mouse. Personally i recommend you use a controller if you have one. Music/Sounds There isn't really much to say here the majority of the music you will hear is through the main menu with the genre mainly being electronic. Either you like it or you don't but you can always disable the music through the menu. The sounds are rather excellent most cars and boosts have thier own unique sound. It is quite immersive to hear the crowd chanting when you play the game especially when you score. Story The story is non existent don't buy this game if you're expecting a great story. Monetization So the main way this game makes its money aside from the initial purchase is through DLC in the form of cosmetics. You can buy different cars boosts paints etc. The DLC is rather cheap but the good thing is that this game is NOT pay to win and your DLC has no real effect on the gameplay of others.Overall this game is excellent and quite cheap. Buy this game if you like cars and/or soccer. I do want to warn others about something though this game is really reliant on good ping to fully enjoy the gameplay. This game also does have some server issues but it is slowly getting better. Highly recommended.,Rocket League®

It has many different game modes for when you get bored or frustrated playing a certain game. You can play competitively to rank up and earn season prizes or casually to just mess around. It has a steep learning curve but with time and practice youll see improvement. It's not always easy to get the right hit on the ball or land that freestyle goal but the it's the difficulty that makes it so satisfying when you finally do. All in all this game is a really well made game with loads of options as to how you want to play. Definitely give it a try.,Rocket League®

2017-08-13,0,0,2425,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an excellent multiplayer game that envokes competitive gameplay and a fun environment with friends. The game mechanics are good and once mastered makes for a great gaming experience. If you play in the online matchmaking the community can be quite salty. Thankfully the developers have implemented a new system to deal with this. So far it looks to be rooting out the riff raff. I highly recommend this game to anyone of any age.

Over 50 hours later... well damn if I don't like football this game is balls literally. It definitely takes a few kicks and explosions to adapt. Until about 15 hours in I was able to call myself a capable player but only after a struggling period of ups.Great graphics colorful dynamic vivid.Great music not as a standalone soundtrack but a rather excellent ambient element.Toxic community no good game comes without it's toxicity don't get caught messing up in a ranked match you'll be in for some destructive criticism.Nice DLC unlike many other games that poorly rely on micro transactions this game has a fine implementation of the loot chest mechanic. It's all visual so you won't depend on loot drops and microtransactions to kick This is the first game of it's genre and will remain a staple for years.",Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,382,False,Recommended,Once a buddy of mine came to me and told me that a game about cars playing soccer with rockets was tons of fun and super skill based without the complexity of street fighter. I laughed at him because it sounds absolutely silly and I hate soccer why would I want to play a soccer game?Well here I am 300+ hours later telling you that friend was very much right. This game is easy to learn difficult to master. Before you go away thinking you don't want to be competitive you'll be right at home too. What's interesting is that beginners play their game which is actually really different than higher level games and somehow everyone has a lot of fun.This game has all of the features local online local + online multiplayer customizable cars customizable game modes oddly shaped maps. This game has everything EXCEPT IT DOESN'T HAVE A MASTER VOLUME SLIDER I MEAN REALLY.... anyway that's minor.Furthermore this game has excellent support from the devs which keep adding stuff in.

2017-12-05,0,0,592,False,Recommended,"I totally love this game. It's easy to learn hard to master fun and highly competetive.However I hate this game's community. I've never been told to die or kill myself as often as in this game which means a lot considering that I also play League of Legends quite a bit. If I want to tryhard and climb or even just focus on improving mechanics/positioning i'll need to mute other players most likely because for me it is highly distracting and demotivating to hear someone about every small mistake I make. Blocking the communication entirely through muting them is not always a great solution though for it can be helpful to know certain things your that your mate wants to tell you.(""I got it""""I got it""""I got it"")Don't get me wrong. Not every match is unreasonable toxic and it extremely depends on the time you play (during schooltime and in the late evening/night the majority of those young raging fellows won't be around). It can be mildly entertaining aswell since those sorts of exaggerated flaming occur mostly in the losing team (and you'll win tons of games where the opposing team is too busy blaming each other).I'd recommend just avoiding random teammates if you are like me a bit sensitive regarding insults. Grab your friends instead when you can you won't miss a thing.(Come to think of it this statement is applicable to almost any multiplayer game)",Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those rare gems from every era that consists of such smooth and intuitive gameplay that speaks to everyone and yet has plenty of depth for those who seek it. No matter your skill level there is something innate about rocket powered cars smashing into a ball rugby style that appeals to the very core of every one of us. It's ridiculous it's tense it's exciting...it's fun. If all that wasn't enough the developers continue to pump out amazing content in the form of cosmetics arenas and modes of play to keep the game crisp and interesting. For all of that Rocket League warrants my time to praise it because it's a triumph. It's an instant classic. It's a treasure for the ages.,Rocket League®

2017-11-30,0,0,977,False,Recommended,I've been playing Rocket League since the beta. It is likely my most played game right after World of Warcraft and StarCraft. Started out on PS4 after couple of months moved onto PC. Easily one of my top multiplayer games ever. If you have a friend or two to play with the fun factor multiplies by 10.PROS+ Highly polished+ Devs communicate with playerbase (reddit is very active)+ Easy to learn but skill ceiling is high+ Local multiplayer!!CONS Lootboxes (cosmetic items only no effect on gameplay) Playerbase can be quite toxic especially on competitive playlists (disable chat and you are good) Some people are having trouble with serversNOTE Controller is highly recommended.,Rocket League®

2017-11-27,0,0,9,False,Recommended,I would reccomend getting a controller for this game. Heavily. The keyboard controls inhibit gameplay (with the exception of more accurate movement on the ground) and limit the camera (there are 2 views on keyboard straight ahead or ball cam. On a controller you are allowed to tilt the camera in any direction from either of these viewpoints). The keyboard also causes far more problems for areial movement as opposed to the controller. This game also has excelent controller support and if you plug in a ps4 controller (the only one I've tried as of yet) it immediately maps the controller to the game.0/10 on keyboard8/10 on controller,Rocket League®

It's fun playing with friends it's fun playing by yourself it's fun customizing your car it's fun collecting new items it's fun trying to get a higher rank in the online competitive mode it's just plain fun. It can defnitely be frustrating at times but that is true for all sports games. Psyonix keeps delivering new content and the game continues to stay fresh. I'm not very good at video games in general but somehow Rocket League is able to make me feel so proud of myself when I'm able to make a backwards goal or ""epic save.""

2017-04-15,0,0,310,False,Recommended,The game is really good. Be prepared it has a steep learning curve. At the start you struggle to hit the ball but once you get the hang of it you get improved every day and end up doing incredible air goals. It's a very fun game especially playing with your friends. Totally a must buy!,Rocket League®
2017-02-01,0,0,103,False,Recommended,This game is what happens when you give a LOL player a ball and put him in a room with a DOTA2 player that swings a sack of salt....yeah just try to imagine that. Hilarious. Okay however the gameplay is highly addicting. You start out not knowing what the hell you are doing chasing a giant ball around a court...with your car. Your rocket propelled car. And then you try to get that ball into the enemys goal. Like with your car. But since you're a rookie you probably won't hit that ball...like ever. Good thing is the others won't hit it either so it's driving around 5 minutes per round trying to hit that ball or other players no matter if they're tammates or not as long as you hit SOMETHING!Later as you advance through the ranks and learn the ropes you'll start to actually hit stuff with your car! Sometimes even things that move! Like your own goalie for example. After a couple of hours then you finally learn how to fly and hit more things. Maybe the ball even! And score! And afterwards you start to learn how to actually be usefull for your teammates! And then when you advance even further you'll realize that your teammates s**k. All of them. And that YOU are the only person on the field to win that match for your team since everybody else is just plain incompetent. Thats why you'll leave every match early. Even when your team wins. Since a victory is only a victory if you crush your enemies 10 0 or something. Well this describes the usual progression in Rocket League. And even if the community might be as salty as that room you put that LOL and that DOTA2 player in after they realized the doors are locked and they will probably starve to death and have to kill each other to survi...you know what I mean. So even if the community might be salty at times and progression really depends on skill and more than often of the teammates you get overall it is freaking awesome to play just another match and maybe hit the ball.Give it a try. You don't like sports? Try it anyways. You might realize that THIS is a kind of sport you could actually enjoy. I mean you don't have to REALLY move or DO anything...you can sit and press buttons...and hit stuff with a car.,Rocket League®

2017-08-07,0,0,1935,False,Recommended,I've played the game long enough for you to trust me on this (over 1500 hours). It is a very addicting multiplayer physics based sports game at its core but that does not tell the whole tale. Besides the varitations of the core game mode Standard 3v3 you'll also find fun and Casual modes like Rumble Dropshot Hoops and the hockey like Snow Day. Customizable Battle Cars and hours of intense multiplayer gameplay await. However you will suck at the beginning like most and find it difficult to get off the ground but if you find any enjoyment and stick with the quirky car soccer long enough you will see your progress start to soar and get hooked as I did. The deveolper (Psyonix) has done a great job of supporting the game since it's release by adding free arenas free modes free customizations/items paid DLC and a crate system as well as fixing issues/bugs in a decent time frame. Overall the Pros outweigh any negatives. So if you're ready to get out on the pitch and blast some balls into the net I can't wait to meet you in matchmaking and crush your dreams.,Rocket League®
2017-08-07,0,0,921,False,Recommended,I've spent over 600 hours on this game and I'm still enjoying it. The new crates cars and updates keep this game interesting. I find the occasional toxic player every few games (just mute them) but that comes with all competitive games. The learning curve for this game might make this game frustrating but if you put time and effort. You'll for sure have endless hours of playing this addictive fun game. Defiantly try it out!,Rocket League®

2016-04-25,0,0,0,False,Recommended,I liked the way you could customize your cars abilities! I also liked the game modes and maps. But the only annoying thing about the game was that when people charge into you you flip over and they take the ball and score it! I also disliked that sometimes when people run into you you might blow up. Those are my pros and cons.

Its's over the top gameplay and great mechanics make it incredibly fun.There one major flaw though the amount of content available is rather low.

2016-04-25,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Wonderfully designed game granted to give you hours of fun! On top of being crazy fun its not too bad on your wallet and so well optimised that on my 10 YEAR OLD desktop hunk o junk computer can run the game in its lowest settings at a steady 70 FPS!!!!!!! The only downside to this wonderful game being that it can get old if you play it too much as there isnt much to the game other than its base gameplay. Though the quick matches are perfect for killing a little time and playing every once in a while! The game is fairly simple and easy to pick up. The controls aren't frusterating in the slightest an in no time you'll be scoring with the best of them!I rate a solid 9/10 for this amazing game! (would have had a 10/10 if it had more game modes),Rocket League®
2016-08-15,0,0,155,False,Recommended,I think i have played enough of this game (70+ hours) to give a well informed review.I love this game so much. It is just fun. It never gets boring. And I mean never. Every match is something exciting. Theres nothing better than scoring the game winning goal or blocking shots on your goal. Its highly addicting. My friends and I all love this game so much and I would reccomend this to anyone. One of my close friends hates sports games (Madden FIFA Etc.) but LOVES Rocket League. It is very different from any other sports/car games Ive ever played. Also I think the price is extremely fair. Serious 10/10. (I think that Rocket League should be added to the 2020 Olympics),Rocket League®

2017-12-11,0,0,25,False,Recommended,Very fun game that I would recomend. Best playstyle is PC with a controller If you do not own a controller I would not reccomend this game. The keyboard mouse controls are clunky and don't really work. If you do have a controller this is a great game that is extremely addictive. You find yourself playing match after match and you can really sense your improvment. There IS a high learning curve but once you master it the game becomes much more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this game.,Rocket League®

2016-12-29,0,0,1206,False,Recommended,This game has to be the most addicting game ever. As soon as I started playing my friends and I never put down our controller for a good week. The multiplayer ranking honestly isn't very good and the algorithm behind ranking up or down seems to still have issues. Though seems to be improving over time and the game is being updated constantly.,Rocket League®
2016-12-29,0,0,4,False,Recommended,Rocket League is simple well balanced fun accessible and cheap ( $10 when I bought it). This is a game that can be played competitively or just casually with friends. A round just lasts a few minutes so you can squeeze in a lot of games in a short period of time. All the unlocks are purely cosmetic and all new game modes are unlocked for free.Rocket League also makes me fully aware that I am an uncoordinated piece of trash that will never be good at this game. To be clear that is not the games fault the physics and controls are very intuitive and smooth but I still manage to screw up constantly. You get occasional lag issues but its not very frequent. I'm pretty sure I'm going to waste a large portion of my life trying to get better at this game.Its hard to find a game this cheap that can appeal to such a wide audience. Definitely worth it.,Rocket League®

2017-05-05,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. So let me start off my saying I'm not into sports games or driving games. I get that that makes it a little odd to try rocket league but I've seen loads of people say that despite loathing both of those they absolutely love it.My main issue is matchmaking. So as a ""novice"" I was regularly up against ""pros"" ""masters"" and ""veterans"". Now whilst I get that that's not an indication of skill but rather time played it made the matches feel lope sided and not fun at all. Rather than being thrown into a match in a few seconds I'd rather wait a few minutes and have a much more even match. Also I was often put into games already in progress on some team 0 4 that I guess someone QQed out of. I'd rather it work like most mobas in which every game you play you start at the start and if you leave you get a deserter penalty and keep doing it and it'll eventually result in suspensions. Though I do have a little sympathy for them considering how terribly matched most of the games I was in were.I wasn't that keen on the camera either I was forced into using the ball tracking one too often to be able to tell what was going on when I'd much rather have used the regular one and just been able to zoom out a lot further. Though perhaps this would just take some more getting used to and the game is definitely very skill based.There's loads to like in the game though. The mechanics are just right and they've clearly spent along time refining it and getting everything to work really well together. The driving feels good even to someone who doesn't like racing games. Unlocking something after every match felt really rewarding. The customisation was great and as odd as this might sound some of the hats and things made the cars quite cute. There were numerous maps with nice themes. It in general ran pretty well (despite my bad computer) though some maps were worse than others.So given only the couple gripes and the lots to like the thumbs down might seem odd. Truthfully I would have much rather given it some sort of middling rating. But the fact of the matter is that while I'm glad to have tried it I have no intention of buying the game once the weekend is up even on sale and so can't really give it a thumbs up.However if they ever made it into a real life sport (should the world become some sort of post apocalyptic disaster land) I'd probably rather enjoy watching it.",Rocket League®

2017-05-20,0,0,553,False,Not Recommended,"I have to say I'm on the fence with this game. It is a great game and I have gotten multiple hours of entertainment out of it for a mere $20 game. Very much worth every cent. The gameplay is fun the visiuals are creative the maps were great untill everyone ed and we got stuck with just the same field reskined in 20 different ways..... The mixture of game modes are also very well done.ServersThe issues are the servers mostly. It has been months now since I have had a game where I didn't get a random ping spike or packet loss during a 5min match. I'm not the only one that has issues with their servers as you can see complaints about them mentioned over and over in the negative reviews of this game. Match MakingThe match making is a joke at times and being just a casual player like myself you will end up hitting a wall. As you will end up becoming ""Master"" rank and get stuck with season champions constantly.CommunityWith the mixture of poor match making and unstable servers the majority of the casual players have just stopped playing leaving the usual problem with most competive games these days toxic players. I love going into a unranked match and being called a ""useless quot for not saving 1 goal as my ping jumps betweeb 400 700ms. Good times great memories. Either that or you get that one guy constantly trying to sell or buy something off you during a match and spaming friend invites even when you declined them.With how the game is currently going I would have to say that I can no longer recomend it to people sadly. Hopefully they will at least look into better servers espically if they're so keen on holding tournaments. I would hate to see such a great game die out due to neglect (I think that is the correct word).",Rocket League®

If you're thinking you'll only have a quick few minutes to play a game each match is about 5 minutes. Never ending fun! I would buy this again if I need to!,Rocket League®

2017-05-06,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Instantly Addictive!!! This is a fun game... High Impact Excitement and will have you laughing and screaming and cheering almost immediately. It has a semi easy learning curve (I say semi because while you'll get the hang of the game in mintues it may take a bit longer to get your timing down). (Note The game recommends a controller (which I do not have on my PC... but don't let that bother you the only time I could see the need for a controller was trying to keep an eye on the ball before turning around. However... at one point I seemed to always have my eye on the ball no matter which direction I was facing. I'm guessing I 'accidentally' hit a key or something just didn't take the time to find out which otherwise... Mouse and KeyBoard work great).In truth this game genre isn't really my cup of tea but Steam was offering it for free for a few days I'm looking for something new to get in to and after watching a YouTube video for gameplay I figured... 'Why Not'. Now it's on my WishList. I may not be ready to purchase the game right now but that has nothing to do with how much fun the game is and with several ways of playing (Local LAN Random opponents (Real or A.I.) and my person favorite Tournament Play) I'd guess it will provide hours of fun and even when you get a bit bored you'll come back every few months just for the quick thrill.All in All... Great Game Highly Recommend!!!,Rocket League®

2017-02-04,0,0,490,False,Recommended,Awesome game. If you like short exciting multiplayer games you can't do anything wrong here. It has a big playerbase and a lot of people online at all times so most of the time you wait like 10sec for a game. If you like to play competitive there's tons of options.I suggest playing it with friends although it is also good when you play with randoms. Only complaint like in all games most of the players tend to be mad when they lose. Important you NEED a Xbox 360 controller (or something else) to play it. It's not good at all with keyboard.,Rocket League®

Fairly skilled to get the ball in mid air and be accurate with it (nothing crazy though) Fairly cheap but rarely goes on saleCons The crossmix with Playstation net has pretty much crippled you as psy players 95% of the time are utterly worthless. Literally unplayable if you go over 100 ping. The ball physics are absolutely broken. Matchmaking is as balanced as a 3 legged dog. The single player is a joke (Bots are incredibly easy even on hardest settings) The servers are a pile of trash with numerous cut outs.Honestly the game is pretty fun nothing amazing nothing special.,Rocket League®

2016-09-04,0,0,570,False,Recommended,At first I was skeptical as to the depth of strategy in this game however my doubts were soon to be revealed as nonreal. At the surface Rocket League may appear to just be car soccer but the level of nuance packaged throughout is insane.

I took a break from it in season 2 we're now in season 5 when I returned. Still I get matched up with people who've spend 1000+ hours on the game meaning they absolutely WRECK my fun as I can't keep up with the ever improving community.That's the only con I can think of.

2017-11-26,0,0,825,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the best sports game I've ever played. Unlike most other sports games you have control over all of your actions. There's no auto dribble or assists. Everything that your car does in game is directly controlled by you. Because of this the game is extremely easy to pick up and play but extremely hard to master. Add to that a variety of fun gamemodes some great cosmetic customization and a (mostly) great community and you have one of my favorite games.But with all that being said I do have one major gripe with the game. It does contain lootboxes (though the contents are only cosmetic). These lootboxes can contain things varying from rocket trails to extremely cool looking car bodies. While there are randomized cosmetic drops available through standard play the contents of the lootboxes can only be obtained through opening lootboxes or trading with someone who has. Personally I don't want to pay to have an unknown chance at getting something I want and I can't support this form of gambling. However all items are cosmetic so it shouldn't affect gameplay.,Rocket League®

There are a few different modes other than just the normal soccer game there is a hockey one (there is a big puck rather than a big ball) and there is also a hoop one where you have to get the ball into a hoop (like basketball) rather than the goal post. There is also a Rumble mode where you get a power up every 10 seconds and can use that to score a goal or mess with other players. Overall it's a very nice and exciting game.,Rocket League®

2017-01-13,0,0,505,False,Recommended,"Rocket League has this type of perfection for it you dont need to be good in the game to have fun but you need it to see a ""progress"". Stuff like flying in this game takes patience and most people dont realy have that much.This game is better be played with a good friend or good friends because it can get very frustrating in ranked games. If there is no one or you dont like to play with random people you can play in a 50 Match or somewhat tournament against the KI of the game.Playerbase is also very hmmm how do i say it ""spicy"" often you get BM'd (Bad Mannered). If you miss a shot or something they will press their salt in your wound be ready for that.Besides all the bad stuff i said about it it feels awesome to make a goal or do a perfect pass.If we take a look at the graphics we see good lighting and nice effects i endure the nice rainy stormy animation. (rain and thunder is just in one arena/map right now!). There are also maps that play in the night (the desert map has big flud lights wich looks stunning to me).Now we take a look at the sounds and music. As we start the game ""feeling good"" music is hitting us sad thing is the same song will greet you every time you start the game /. But dont worry there is a whole playlist in this game with great music so it wont loop over and over (oh god that would be horrible).Scoring a goal makes a cool ""explosive"" sound and starts a cool background song to make you feel all good about yourself or the enemy cause they probably scored bAnd every save will do the same i think on both will say the narrator/commentator his thing like ""SAVE!"" or something i cant remember right now....sorry.And you got stuff you can collect for your car! (There is also a plunger!!!)Overall this game needs concentration and patience if you want to be good and stuff (but in wich game you doesnt need that? you just feel it more in this one). It makes fun and doesnt consume that much time since games normaly take about 5 9 minutes. mistakes or spelling fails in this text can be kept. i hope my review was helpful for you )",Rocket League®

2017-01-16,0,0,349,False,Recommended,Got like 5 people to buy this it is amazing and you won't regret your purchase. The hours of competitive matches and replay time possible is a stunning feat in itself for such a basic idea of cars with rockets soccer futbol hockey or basketball type gamemodes.Cons Some people might be better than you are Matchmaking could be a little better. Customization paywalls. (there is a ton of customization without pay so don't get me wrong. For some items there are keys and it costs 1.99$ US per key to open a crate to get an item you already have or don't care for. The Other option is to buy DLC and sometimes it's cool other times it's meh.) MAPS ARE RESKINNED ( This is just a personal thing to me. I don't mind new maps but when they reuse a base map that is obviously a circle with a bland background and the new ARC Base map is also that same map just reskinned and with a new background I think the game mapwise is stale. I think there could be a lot of crazy things that the devs could integrate to make things interesting like ramps and moving parts in the map to change the game drastically.Pros You can train a lot (and with the recent update training is a lot easier to find with different game integrated community maps and zero update times for these maps.) Replay Value Competitivity Since there are mainly humans to compete against online the game varies with a plethora of outcomes.Anyway I did get this game on sale and saw it as a good deal for the price. I wouldn't reccommend purchasing this game outside of it's sale period because you'd be wasting your money that you could have saved for extra DLC causing you to spend even more money to get nice things in the game or it could have gotten rid of your chances for saving up for another game that you were also looking forward to purchasing. Hope my review somewhat helped you make your choice. Cya!,Rocket League®

2017-01-16,0,0,5,False,Recommended,The game runs smoothly on my PC (i7 6700 GTX 1060 (6GB) RAM 32GB Windows 10 64 bit).I've played single player mostly. For someone like me who isn't very good at sport games or actual sports playing against AI is fun and challenging enough. I tried multiplayer jumped in mid game and got my a handed to me by opponents who actually know what they were doing. Still fun though ) The game may seem simple but there are some strategic aspects to it and you don't get very far by just chasing the ball blindly. I bought most of the DLC cars. While they are cool the cars given in the main game are nice enough already. So if you don't want to pay for the DLCs you don't have to. The difference is purely aesthetic.One small downside though. Team colors are locked to red and blue as the dominant hues so color customization for your cars is restricted within these ranges.If you like soccer and racing you'll enjoy this game.,Rocket League®

Incredible support from the developers with well thought out (read cosmetic only fairly priced) DLC.My only slight critisism (and this is not really one of the game per se) is it does attract the odd one or two toxic player(s) in competitive.Highly recommended.,Rocket League®

2016-08-15,0,0,1204,False,Recommended,Incredible game with incredible developers. The hours spent speak for themself but Rocket League really reminds me of how games used to be before this wave of EA and Ubifails.Psyonix are possibly/probably the best developers in the industry right now. Not only have they created an amazing game they listen to the community around it and release regular free updates with new maps and content. The DLC's are nicely priced too and fun to liven up the game if you hit a dull patch (for some reason). There are only three downsides to RL. The first is the players. You can end up playing with some really toxic people and even team mates who won't forgive a mistake. And while I'd love to say that it's the minority of players it really isn't. Toxic players would be understandable at a low/mid level but playing at anything Expert and above it's baffling to still see them. Second is the matchmaking while its not particularly common you can end up against or with people playing at a very distant level whether that be lower or higher and this gets frustrating after a while. The third is in relation to players again people just leave games constantly normally as soon as they're losing (made worse by the AI being dreadful). And quite often will leave just before the end of the game so they avoid another loss on their record. So to sum these up the game is solid but the people playing ruin it. Rocket League is a shining example of easy to learn but hard to master. It's enjoyable right from the get go even when you struggle to hit the ball at all. But it seems to me that the better you get the more fun it is. To sum up I can't believe anyone has given this game a negative review it's absolutely worth buying and is more than worth the money.,Rocket League®

2016-08-15,0,0,689,False,Recommended,Rocket League is probably my favorite game in my Library right now. Long story short if you have any passion for Sports or Racing you have to try this game!Now to my pros and cons!PROS Soccer with cars nuff said. A great game for parties friendly play etc. due to its ability for up to 8 people to play together. So much customization! Tons of items to discover along with rare painted ones or ones that track your stats! Not to mention how many DLC there are. There is a very high skillcap but the game is still accessible to new/inexperienced players. Ranked play! Its a beautiful game overall!Cons DLC are pretty expensive but I personally don't mind because I was able to get them all lol. If you don't take the time to learn mechanics the skillcap hits you like a truck. It took me 100 hours to really get into the special mechanics and learn the physics. Can get boring if not with friends. Randoms are often times trash (at least in my case)FINAL THOUGHTS Overall this game has brought me more good memories than bad and it allows for people to build their mechanical skills in great ways. Thanks for your time!,Rocket League®

I spent more than a hundred hours on it and it's a fantastic multiplayer game to play with your friends.Like all multiplayer games based on a simple concept it's very hard to innovate and keep the player interested outside of learning to get better (which is pretty much half the fun of it all) so after a while it gets very repetitive but some will surely find a way to play the game for up to thousands of hours. Get the game when it's on sale with a couple of friends it's worth a try at the very least.,Rocket League®

2016-05-25,0,0,53,False,Recommended,I've only managed to find a few small flaws with the game one of them is that some cars are just not as good as others if you factor hitbox (boosted) turnrate and handbrake turn speed into your considerations there are clear best cars and always will be but some of the ones that are lacking could probably be fairly easily brought up to par (with minor buffs to the aforementioned attributes). I'm sure they'll sort it out as they see fit. All of them are viable some just a lot more so than others.As a second flaw there seem to be some weird issues surrounding USB devices with no clear solution. Even original xbox controllers disconnecting and then reconnecting randomly the left stick suddenly not working in menus stuff like that which seems to be related to other USB devices connected to the system but a game flaw nevertheless.The soundtrack is pretty garbo imo interchangeable radio tunes. Lots of people like it and that's the point so who am I to disagree? I just turned it off.Addictive as virtually limitless skill ceiling from what I have seen my only regret is that I waited this long to get the game. My thumbs hurt.,Rocket League®

2016-08-20,0,0,1,False,Recommended,My Review about Rocket League The Good Some of the best Addictive Sport Game that requires less tactical gameplay but giving more to the abilities to the players for playing a football with cars . My first impression was very amazed especially when you have to bring the ball to the opponent's net goal like I said before it doesn't require an overthinking gameplay tactics just play the car and bring the highest score for the game it is simple some of my best match when i was scored more than 4 times in less than one and a half minute . From the visual it is really contrast colorfull and great with the big emphasize were focused for the cars (with it's furniture) balls and also stadiums . The Multiplayer was a blast too (although i didn't played it until the time i write this review) but still amazed me .The Bad Although it became one of the greatest sport game of 2015 but some of the problem still exist . Such as the porblem with the friendly AI who didn't give a big support especially for the last minute of match somehow they can put you in a big lose where sometimes the Friends AI Team can make a suicide goal or even not helping you by not giving a 30 70 chance to support us . Summary My Score is 9/10 . GGWP,Rocket League®

2016-09-11,0,0,20,False,Recommended,"Common thought Coming from mainly fps and mmo type genres I can't recall a time where I was ever interested in a sport based game in fact I dispised them. I had to be persuaded just like those I have had to persuade before they realise this is a great game that deserves a chance to prove itself. If you are like I was you have probably thrown this game out the window because you think it ""looks boring"" or ""its just soccer with cars"" and thats a shame and my goal is to help you reconsider.Match Length Each match of Rocket League lasts 5 minutes (Custom games excluded). The match ends when the timer hits 0 and the ball hits the ground or a goal is scored. Game Modes I will start by explaining the non competitive (Unranked) game modes. I won't go in depth but hope to provide enough information so you get a rough idea of each one. At the time of writing this review there are 8 modes which include Duel (1v1) Doubles (2v2) Standard (3v3) Chaos (4v4) Snow day (Ice field with a puck instead of a ball) Rocket Labs (Experimental wierd shaped maps) Hoops (Basketball court with the hoops elevated) and Rumble (A new game mode which gives players power ups every 10 seconds which can effect both the ball and other players).I personally prefer Duels and Doubles as they require more effort on my part. Standard is fine and is the most common in the pro scene however I am not a fan of that many cars on the field at one time and usually stay in goals to avoid the mayhem. 4v4 is just a cluster and I never play it. Snow day was fun for about 5 minutes but not something I will be going back to. Rocket Labs can be fun for some random games and provides variation from the standard maps. Hoops was also fun for about 5 minutes and I feel the court is to small and should be made larger or even the same size as the soccer field but that might come across as wierd since a basketball court is smaller then a soccer field... anyway I don't play it and won't play it again. Rumble suprised me actually. It's quite fun and its hard to predict what can happen. You opponant may shoot for goal but then the ball is frozen in mid air for a few seconds which is then saved followed by a punch which sends the ball to the other end. I will be going to Rumble when I want some variation to my game from time to time.Competitive This is where the game gets fun however does have both pros and cons. The competitive (Ranked) game modes include Duel Doubles Standard and Solo Standard (3's but you queue by yourself). Ranks A total of 10 matches are required before you will be placed into a rank. There are 4 tiers which include Prospect (Prospect 1 2 3 &amp Elite) Challenger (Challenger 1 2 3 &amp Elite) Star (Rising Star Shooting Star All Star &amp Super Star) Champion (Champion Super Champion &amp Grand Champion) Each rank within a tier has 5 divisions. Once you have reached division 5 in that rank you then have a chance to move up 1 rank. PROS 1. Its hard! Games that are easy are boring Rocket League is a game that you progressively improve over time and there are always players at your level which means you don't always get owned. When you score a goal or win its satisfying. After 600 hours when I get a goal it still feels awesome. 2. Teamwork and Communication Strategy is definitely something that will improve you game. Pulling off mad plays or passing at the right time then stepping our opponant to score a goal is cool as !CONS 1. sometimes versing unfair opponants where you verse someone greatly better then yourself or a smurf which is incredibly irritating.2. The addition of the Wasteland and Tokyo maps in competitive play. I feel they shouldn't be included as the field is different then the rest of the standard maps. This means some people may get these maps more then others which I feel is unfair. Tokyo being in competitive takes it to another level. The map has elevated sides and is just rediculous. Wasteland and Tokyo should be in non competive only.Final Thought Look the game isn't easy it takes time to get good and a very long time to get great but don't automatically disregard the game as before you play it thats just being naive. I've read some of the negative comments on steam for Rocket League and they are a perfect example. I understand the game isn't for everyone but what I am saying is it is worth trying if you don't like it refund it. I could have continued this review and I am sure I could have written it better I haven't written many reviews. if I can update it I will later but I hope that this helps.",Rocket League®

2016-08-06,0,0,1041,False,Recommended,I'm a competitive person when it comes to video games. So a competitive game like Rocket League definitely appealed to me. Rocket League is a great game for someone who can play basically the same game over again and constantly want to get better at playing the same game over and over again. But that doesn't mean you have to be a competitive person to play Rocket League Rocket League has a semi large assortment of game modes to play casually as well. Overall Rocket League is a great game for the competitive minded player &amp an alright game for casual play. I would try to buy it at a sale.,Rocket League®

2017-07-18,0,0,759,False,Recommended,I don't like racing games or games without some kind of violence so I was extremely skeptical of Rocket League. It was on sale one time for half price and my firend wanted it so I decided to buy it for both of us. Again I was not really interested in it I just wanted to play a bit of multiplayer with my friend but holy crow I have not regretted my decision in the slightest. I have sunk more hours into this game than any other it is just so fast and easy to get into a match. I have Skyrim (+DLC) Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain Fallout New Vegas and like 155 more games that would not total my Rocket League total if combined. Only problems are the fact that some people are quite mean when your skill does not match their standards but it almost encourages you to get better as you go to the store to buy a new controller. I have had a few issues with games freezing or the screen going black in the middle of a round which generally leads to a goal for my opponent(s). I also get kicked from games sometimes which could be my rural internet connection but I would still really like a rejoin button for casual play. (Thay have one for competetive) Oh and if you think these problems are my PC they are not. I have a trusty GTX 980 16 GB of RAM and a i7 5820k.Anyways. I completely and whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone. It geats really fun when you can pull of some more complicated maneuvers. It is absolutely a blast. Psyonix is doing an amazing job with the community and I don't forsee them leaving this game out to dry any time soon.,Rocket League®

2016-02-11,0,0,129,False,Recommended,"Rocket League...Where to begin? This is my first review so go easy on me! I also want to clarify that I have many many more hours on the PS4 version! It's the same game though no weird port issues or anything. The fact that it is cross platform is a solid indicator of that. So play whichever version you prefer! Car soccer. I'm not sure I've come across a game other than Rocket League that can be explained well with two words. You would assume that a game with such a simple premise would lack depth but if you've read about it or heard the hype or even played a friend's copy you know that this game is anything but shallow. Underneath the surface lies a monster!You will suck in the beginning. How the hell am I supposed to get the ball into the goal? Am I supposed to drift? Why is it that when I jump the first time and I hold the left stick in a direction my car pivots around the Z axis but when I use my second jump it then boosts and pivots around the Y axis? How does this make any sense? It hurts your brain! My friends were having so much trouble with this game when we sat down and played it for the first time.I noticed the click came after around 10 rounds. My friends started to hit the ball semi accurately and the control scheme started to make sense to them. After the initial rough patch people hit the game opens up and players cannot put this game down. For the first time in a while I was staying up until the sun rose just having fun with a video game. Pure and absolute fun genuine joy. I kept telling myself that I would only play one more game but I ended up falling asleep with the controller still in my hands. What a video game!On to the rules and mechanics of the game.Two teams of cars try to hit a ball into each other's goal. Each car has a nitro like boost that drains the boost meter which can be refilled by driving over respawning orange dots scattered around the map. The cars can jump and double jump which can be used as a minor boost itself. When a car reaches a certain speed it can destroy other cars if it runs into them. That's about it for the basic mechanics.Rocket League is a multiplayer game. In my opinion it shines (like a lot of games) when played with friends on the couch but online is a ton of fun as well. There are a lot of options and configurations for matches. 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 even 2v4 are all possible. 3v3 is the ""standard"" game mode and in my opinion is the most balanced. There are a lot of maps to choose from but not a ton of variation in design between them which isn't really an issue to me. Matchmaking is alright but sometimes you will be placed on a losing team in the middle or near the end of the match which is pretty annoying. Other than that it seems to be solid.Single player is bizarre mainly because the AI makes such odd decisions. I've noticed that they sometimes blatantly shoot the ball into their own goal and I can't understand why. There isn't anything in their way and I don't think they are trying to pass it to anyone. It definitely happens less with higher level bots. I try to stay away from single player but if my internet was down and I needed my fix I would play a couple matches with AI. Overall wouldn't recommend it.The cars in Rocket League are just fantastic. There are a ton of models paintjobs materials hats rims boost trails and antenna toppers to chose from. The team at Psyonix have been constantly updating and adding content since release and I am always so excited when new DLC is announced. I never get bored changing my paint colors or slapping a new set of rims on my car there is so much to chose from!The music is annoying and weird. There is a singer on a lot of the tracks and her voice gets annoying and grating after a couple minutes. I usually turn off the music and just play my own. The main menu is simple and effective I couldn't really ask for anything more.Overall this game is absolutely fantastic. It is an excercise in restraint a near perfect design that was executed simply and effectively. I think game studios should look at Rocket League and learn from it. Sometimes one perfect idea is better than 50 mediocre ones. Bravo Psyonix.9.5/10",Rocket League®

2017-05-14,0,0,37,False,Recommended,Rocket League in my opinion is a must have if your computer can run it of course. That being said the minimum requirements are pretty low if you had a computer that came out in the past decade. Now here is my overall rating on the game.Graphics 8/10The game looks really good on medium settings for me cause my graphics card sounds like it's killing itself on high. But compared to ultra on other games its up there but not quite. I have seen it on its highest settings it looks amazing none the less.Gameplay 10/10You have probably seen this score everywhere but after 20 hours I'm still not bored. First the modes. The first gamemode is fast paced soccer gameplay with intense matches at times. While advertised the game is not primarly soccer or football for the rest of the world. The game offers basketball hockey competitve (soccer) and a recent additon called dropshot. While they may feel and look the same hockey and soccer especially they're all different enough to feel fun. And the last part is a gamemode called rumble which adds powerups to the gamemodes except competitive. They're like Mario Kart powerups in a way that can help you or get in the way of the other team. The second major feature is car customization. After matches or through crates you will receive a random part like a new car body or decal that can change how your car looks. There are so many different parts that you may never own them all. By doing this you can truly make your car feel how you want. Since the two major teams are orange and blue the car paint will change that's it. But the game allows you to make he cars different for each team. Additional notes The game does have a crate system in which the player after a game will have a chance of receiving a random crate from the many series of crates. You open said crates with keys. How do you get them by buying them. Knowing me I don't like systems like this but I loved the game enough to go into this system. And they give you some cool stuff to. Overall I can't give this a score cause I don't know how to properly but I thought it was worth mentioning none the less.Overall score 10/10To me graphics don't matter as much as gameplay. The graphics look amazing either way and the gameplay is so fun and refreshing you may never stop. I love it so much and for $20 it's worth every penny. If you don't have it go buy it right now I promise you you won't regret it.,Rocket League®

2016-07-27,0,0,149,False,Recommended,No need for explanation on how good the game is so here's a pancake recipe.100g plain flour2 eggs300ml milk1 tbsp sunflower oil (or vegetable) plus extra for fryingpinch of salt1. Blending in the flour Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre gradually drawing the flour into the eggs milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated beat until you have a smooth thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.2. Finishing the batter Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins to allow the starch in the flour to swell but there s no need.3. Getting the right thickness Heat the pan over a moderate heat then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug return the pan to the heat then leave to cook undisturbed for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.4. Flipping pancakes Hold the pan handle ease a fish slice under the pancake then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.,Rocket League®

2017-01-02,0,0,1003,False,Recommended,Rocket league is the best game I've ever played. Simple as that yet it isn't. I wrote a review when I had less than 200 hours in rocket league so I've come back to write another after500 hours because the first didn't do it justice. As you probably know the concept is so simple soccer with cars. But those cars fly now that changes everything. The skill that you can acquire for this game is amazing and it doesn't even take someone who knows much about rocket league to look at an amazing play and know that it took incredible skill which is such a beautiful thing about this game. 9/10 negative reviews for this game start with 'Rocket league is the best game I've ever played'(or something along those lines) why do they have a negative review then? Good question it is usually because of things like bad matchmaking or community experiences or criticism for the crate system. So let's address these one at a time 1. MatchmakingI play on the US east server and I have always had a wonderful experience with matchmaking. People are likely complaining about it for one of two reasons they occasionally have bad games and get blown out and blame matchmaking or they are correct and constantly get matched against unfair opponents(rank wise). Matchmaking can easily vary from region to region on a server region that does not have as many players you will likely not be properly matched due to lack of available players at your skill level. Which is unfortunate. As for the other reason you play good games and bad games like every sport. Because you are not consistent consistency comes with much practice. 2. CommunityAgain your experience can vary from region to region but it is far more unlikely. The community for the most part is very good I have no trouble finding team mates or friendly opponents. But like every online game there are trolls and people out to ruin your experience to gain some kind of pleasure. But this doesn't happen often once you get past the bottom ranks especially. Most of the time (99/100 times) if you ignore them then they won't affect the game's outcome. If you provoke them or encourage them by responding then it may lead to childish bickering and finger pointing and fighting. But can be avoided easily. 3.Crate systemThis is a tough one all I can say is that if you don't like it then turn it off in the settings. That simple.That's itReallyNothing else to itBye........But seriously this game gets more and more fun the better you get and if that sounds like you then buy it! Give it a try if it looks fun to you! If it's not your cup of tea then that's ok! I recommend Fallout 4 or other great games out there. Thanks.,Rocket League®

2016-09-08,0,0,726,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Short review Easy to learn but challenging to master some of the *siiiiick* moves. There isn't much you can compare this game too (or its predecesor) but I will say that the controls are tight and intuitive. It all makes sense you get the hang of it. It can be the chillest game to play just sit back and let your buddies score the goals. Some games can also put you on edge which can lead to angry chat messages and rage quitting. Community can be toxic sometimes personally I enjoy the talk. too damn ez The updates are fantastic. Super excited for Rumble. End note Honestly you can't go wrong with this game. Just know what you are buying into a competitive car soccer match game that are played in small matches. Maybe it's not your thing but if you are willing to try it you might like it!,Rocket League®

2017-01-03,0,0,203,False,Recommended,After hours upon hours spent on this game I believe I can finally give a clear and honest review of this brilliant game.From a first glance I know the game can look fairly basic and looks like the fun could die out fast but may I reassure you and say that is not the case at all.I owned the game fairly early on in its existance and watching it grow into the game it has become has been amazing. At the start the game came with standard rocket league and a basic version of ranked rocket league along with collectable toppers decals and such.After that DLC's started rolling out every couple of months or so. They were cheap and added new car models and the occasional rocket league pitch. The game continued to progress adding new modes (including one of my personal favourites Hoops). Not only this but the game devlopers imporved the ranked matches massively. They also included crates to get rare car models and other collectables.In conclusion this game is definately one of a kind. Its face paced exciting and while you can have off days your skill definetely improves the longer you play. I am sure I will continue to play this game for many years to come!Overall Game Rating 9/10,Rocket League®

2016-09-19,0,0,411,False,Recommended,Rocket League! Where do I begin... Rocket League is one of the most inivative games to push the bounderies of sports. Picture yourself SOARING through the air with your only goal too get that good fast hit past the opponent. Rocket league takes soccer and gives it such a unique gameplay... VEHICLES! Be prepared to collide slide tumble and roll around in one of Rocket League's beautiful arenas! Ranging from sunny skies to skill deciding obsticles such as pillars hexagons and plateaus. Graphics 9/10I'd like to keep this short by saying Rocket League runs beautifully on most computers! You can have it optimized for an older 21st century laptop or desktop. Amazing rain effects and tons of customization to take your style to the next level! Gameplay 9/10You start off in rocket league really doing whatever you want from bot matches to hopping right into ranked (not recommended....) Rocket league teaches you patience and causes you to become an overall better gamer! Gameplay modes include 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 3v3 Rumble 3v3 Hoops Ranked ques of 1's 2's 3's 3v3 Rocket Labs You also have the full ability to host private lobbies with all sorts of mutator settings! From double speed to half... Quad collision effects to none at all! Change the shape and size of your ball to increase the chaotic aspect! Music 8/10Here's the thing... I don't think I've ever played a game and actually desired to find that perfect balance of volume for the games soundtrack... because well... It's AWESOME! Such a big plus when you load up a game to a beautiful symphony of electronic waves pulling you closer to that QUE button...TL DR Rocket League is an awesome new genre of competitive gameplay that you MUST try at least once.. But don't be alarmed when you fail and fail. This is one of those games in which you could spend 1.000 hours and still be working towards getting that GREAT wall shot.,Rocket League®

2017-03-03,0,0,1130,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is the second brilliant game to come from Psyonix the first of which was called Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. Described as ""soccer but with rocket powered cars"" Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams using rocket powered vehicles to push a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online including cross platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions as well as cross play between Xbox One and Windows versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and adding new game modes including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.Pros Tons of cars and personalizationCasual game to relax to but has competitive modes to test your skills as wellGreat audio/soundtrackMultiple game modesFair bit of arena variationCan play cross platform which helps the player base stay high and the queue times stay lowMultiplayerTradingCons Updates are too far and too fewThe matchmaking allows people way above the average skill group in a game play together (think rising star and a prospect playing together against two challenger elites)Voice chat in game is cancerI never played the first installation of the predecessor to this game but I have a ton of fun playing this game with friends and climbing in rank. The game is basically soccer but with cars and boost. The twist on such a simple game is amazing and when I first started if someone would have said that I would have liked the game I would have told them that they were wrong. But in the end I was wrong about judging this game.9.5/10 The game is a ton of fun and well worth buying with or without friends to play it with but it helps so much to have a team that talks together and plays together regularly to learn each other s playstyles and learn about the game together. Overall a ton of fun and well worth the money especially if you can get the game on a sale.SPOILER BELOW An old man once said that really fast cars and big balls don't mix he was wrong.",Rocket League®
2017-02-27,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Fun game but randomly the servers stopped working completely for me and even though I have tried plenty of things people have suggested on the internet I cant get connected to the server. To make matters worse you cant even host or join a private gamewithout access to the official Rocket League Servers so I am completely unable to play with my friends. If they allowed people to host games on their own servers this problem would be fixed.Also matchmaking is bad and you get paired with people way above your skill level unless playing competitively. The game also has a suprisingly toxic community for such a casual game. On top of everything mentioned the game has microtransactions for a game you already paid for and from what I understand some of the cars are actually better***EDIT***Since writing this review my rocket league has suddenly been fixed. Im going to leave that part in though as a warning. Also it wasnt working for almost 3 weeks.,Rocket League®

2015-12-24,0,0,960,False,Recommended,Good game if you have friends to play with if not you're screwed. Match making is possibly the worst i have ever experienced in any game. The ranked play was reasonably good to begin with now there are so many leagues the quality of players is just trash in a lot more leagues so it just takes longer to rank up. Bronze players are just as bad as gold and plat players making solo queue a nightmare. One game you get a reasonable team and then next you end up with players who literally cannot hit the ball. It just leaves you scratching your head wondering how they are in the same ranking. Just the usual case of your rank is determined on how lucky you are to get the team who can hit the ball or not and how badly your team mates screw you over. Overall decent game some bugs that are annoying (server issues downtime that they say nothing about) but can be fun with friends. Ranking system poor.,Rocket League®

There is virtually no limit to how good you can get at the game so in terms of fun playable hours where you continue to advance this game may be #1. I've also never seen a developer support a game the way Psyonix does. They release massive amounts of free new content almost every month including entirely new game types The servers are never down or unavailable and the only time I had an issue with my account which was my fault anyway they went right ahead and fixed it no questions asked.I intend to play another 2000+ hours of this game and that is not a typo.

2016-09-09,0,0,195,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a very enjoyable and fun game. And it s one of the best multiplayer games that there is. It is basically soccer but instead of people playing on the field it is little vehicles/cars. There is also a hockey mode and a basketball mode too (which is also played with little vehicles/cars). Rocket League is one of those games that anybody can pick up play and learn. It can get intense. And it can also get funny when playing the Rumble gamemode. Rocket League is a great game that I highly recommend to any gamer. It s fantastic!,Rocket League®

2017-10-19,0,0,847,False,Recommended,"This is probably one of my favorite games. I started out really bad and now im a little bit less bad lol. The game gets harder the higher up you get in the ranks. Giving the game a solid foundation to competetive experience. When you first start your car will pretty much just be on the ground but as you get better the game becomes more vertical and you learn to ""fly"". I do recomend the product however i feel like the loot crates could have been done better.

2016-09-15,0,0,73,False,Recommended,"I have been playing this game the week it came out on Playstation first and had to get it on PC when I didn't have my Playstation with me. I find the PC version much better as well since it is much smoother and cleaner in a way. I can't get enough of it and play it every single day now with and without my friends for sure my favorite game out there and beats out the big franchises like Call of Duty Battlefield FIFA etc... It s a very simple concept of a game but yet has all these crazy things that you can do in game that can ""wow"" your teammates and even the opponetents.Also the leveling up system is perfect as you don t reach max level after 5 hours of playing but instead takes hundreds and even thousands of hours to complete. Through those hours you'll become what that rank is called like Pro or Master and even Rocketeer once you get there. There is also ranked mode where you go play people in your rank so you always have a fair fight. It's a fun addition to the game and brings the comptitve scene to it as people have to use team work to win and climb the ladders of the ranks.I would recommend this game to people who like fast paced competitive action games and well soccer in general I guess since it is socer with cars. All in all I highly recommend this game to anybody who is thinking of getting it it's a simple(ish) game and never gets old! And considering the low price for it it's a must have!",Rocket League®

You can change the settings of the match things like gravity (Yes I know. shappe of the ball and you can even put the game into slo motion. (I don't quite now why though...)

2015-11-08,0,0,13,False,Recommended,The games is both simple and complex. The rules and guidelines are easy to grasp but take some time and skill to master. You are essentially playing a 3 V 3 cars soccer game. You try to score while preventing your enimes. The twist the ball is completly physics base and you're in a jumping boosting car. Contolling this car and scoring are the real challenge of the game. It's fun and crazy at the same time. The game also visually looks amazing. the lighting makes everything really stick out. The only real issue I have is there isn't much variety. All the maps are the same set up wise (all visually distinct though) so there isn't much to do if you get board with the main set up which in turn makes the $20 price tag seem a bit too high for me. It's definatly a great game to play with friends in bursts. In my oppinion though wait for a sale before buying. It's limited gamepaly makes the $20 asking point a bit too high.,Rocket League®

2015-11-08,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Excellent arcadey sports type. The whole concept behind the game is you're in a futuristic world where people play soccer with rocket cars it honestly doesn't matter.It's car ball.I spent a majority of my playtime during my first month owning it. Somewhere around 24 hours. My point in that is my first 10 or so hours were my favorite hours. The learning curve is probably some of the most fun you'll have in this game. Once you get beyond that and you feel confident in your skills the competitive nature will probably sink in you'll probably anger at minute yet frustrating things. Say for instance your idiot teammate hitting the ball out of the way just before you had the chance to make a game changing goal. Or maybe your enemy is simplying running around the field picking up turbo just so he can demo you repeatedly. Things can get really salty.After you get passed the honeymoon period this game is a great snack if you will.It's a perfect game to hop in just before bed or whilst waiting for something just play a quick match and hop out.However if you have a group of friends to play with that are competent and able you can queue together either locally or online. This feature makes the game much more palatable after having played for a considerable amount of time. The game runs great with splitscreen as well so definitely give that a go during a party.,Rocket League®

2016-09-22,0,0,895,False,Recommended,If you're like me when you check out Steam reviews of games you make sure to check out the negative ones just to make sure you get the whole story. I was curious what negative things people were saying about this game and it seems that they mostly are complaining about the new microtransaction system often making it out to be forced or worse than it is.All DLC that affects gameplay (maps game modes) is included in FREE updates. There are cheap DLCs for different car models.The microtransactions work like this Random drops after games give you cosmetic enhancements or crates. The crates contain more cosmetic enhancements. To open a crate you need a key. Keys can be purchased (I think 1 for $1.50 or 5 10 or 20 for $1 each) or traded for with cosmetics or crates. Keep in mind nothing about this affects gameplay whatsoever. With the trading system if you really want some cosmetic and don't want to spend any money you can trade things for that cosmetic. If you really want to open a crate you can trade things for keys. You are not required to buy anything.I understand that microtransactions have a negative reputation but this game is only $20 with regular and free map/game mode updates. I can't believe anyone is complaining about the fact that the devs implemented a completely optional system that can get them some more money is more than fair.The devs are active on the Rocket League subreddit and multiple times I have seen complaint posts met with responses from devs saying they'll fix the problem and the problems get fixed.This game is extremely fun for casual and serious play. The community all in all is very good and fortunately isn't becoming more toxic with the growing user base. I highly recommend giving it a try and if you don't want to spend $20 on it wait for a free weekend or a sale.Cheers,Rocket League®

As FIFA and racing games where my least favorite types of games I thought I would hate it. Once I played it it was amazing. The Devs actully care about their players and don't milk you for your money. The game is VERY balanced and just needs skill and time put into it as the DLCs are just $2.00 U.S mostly they don't really do much. If you go into bad reviews you will see alot of ""Bad Community"" type reviews but I haven't seen it myself. In competetive it's a little bad sometimes but you can get through it.

Ah nevermind I'll keep playing!!Edit 18th Oct 2015 Asian servers have been added ping is a good 40 60ms so I've changed my review to positive. My general observation is that you won't feel a major disadvantage if your ping to remote servers is &lt 160ms but if it's close to 200 and above you'd best filter out servers that are not close to you. Original review I'm based in Singapore speedtest.net gives me 4ms ping 60 80Mbps download 30 40Mbps upload and yet I am consistently above 200ms to all rocket league servers. I tried cable different locations for wifi nothing helps. Brilliant game but this is absolutely infuriating every single game I am the player with the highest ping always one bar red.Customers in Asia beware.,Rocket League®

2017-07-03,0,0,23,False,Recommended,Rocket LeagueTo begin it is a great game.ProsGood GameplayCool ConceptEasy to pick up and playFun Split ScreenEnjoyable Offline experienceNice GraphicsConsOnline is full of kids that think they are good at the game or people that try way to hardMatchmaking is junkToxic communityEhs...Keyboard controls are decent prefer a controller.Summary I found this game to be great for an offline experience or with friends online. This is a game I always pull up if I have a friend over or have a couple of buddies online. However the community is not the best I wouldn't say they ruin the game but if you play online you will run into them. It is easy enough to ignore them but do keep that in mine. Online Matchmaking As stated several times above the community is toxic. Online matchmaking results in a group of eight years olds yelling at you for not making the goal from a quarter mile away. However sometimes you luck out and it is not an eight year old and is instead a 16 year old teen threating to VAC ban your steam account if you don't give your A game. Like I said easy enough to ignore but it does make me sad to see a great game have such a dissapointment of a community. Controller vs. Keyboard This is a area I actually have a question about hopefully one of you guys can answer this for me. Is it better to use a controller or a keyboard? I find the game to be way better with a controller and would highly recommend having a controller in order to play this game. However I have heard people say using a keyboard is better.Overall I would recommend it. Buy it on sale if your concerned about not liking it. I found it to be enjoyable and not an experience I would avoid. However if your playing to do a bunch of online be aware that the community is toxic and not friendly to newbies. Rating 8/10Note Good game toxic community hours of fun.,Rocket League®

Another .5 off for the lag others cause you should have the ability to kick a player if their ping is at a certain level! Another .5 off because of the lack of different gamemodes its all 1 goal get a goal. You need like a ""Keep Away"" or ""Keep Up"" gamemode. Not rocket league soccer with superpowers or ice. Hoops was a cool idea but still just touching on the outer ""rim"" (no pun intended) of the possibilities of gamemodes!

2016-12-14,0,0,14,False,Recommended,If you're looking for a game that's quick and casual but equally competitive and adrenaline boosting in its style of gameplay then Rocket League is definitely a game for you to add to your collection.When first seeing Rocket League in the Top Seller charts I at first thought that it was just a simple game involving race cars playing soccer. It figuratively didn't exactly sound entertaining in my mind. Then after deciding to just buy it and try it out I realized I was completely wrong and did not waste a single penny on the game.Rocket League is jam packed with competition and action. When you play a single match you'll be so involved in the game that you might not even realize the amount of time that's passed when you play over 5 matches and 30 minutes of your free time just disappeared. The controls in Rocket League are extremely compatible with the human brain so picking the game up and mastering it is possible for anybody heroically lifting the heavy burden of people needing to be experienced racing gamers in order to have fun in Rocket League.What's the greatest about Rocket League is the feeling it gives you when you play a match. When you try it out for the first time you actually don't feel like an insignificant player who's just filling up another slot in a team composition game. You feel focused and you have motivation to try your best as well as practice to get even better. It's true that at first you feel that the ball is untouchable to you and that you can't really do anything besides punt it in the air when all the other players are stuck to each other like glue but the game makes it entirely possible for anyone to skillfully rise from that level and eventually become a flying superstar that backflips 20 feet in the air in order to score a goal. What's the best about this game is how it frustrates the player rather than making the player yell out of pure anger which eventually boils into hatred for the game itself Rocket League makes players feel frustration that rather motivates them to learn from their mistakes and think about how they can do better. The feeling of failure as well as the fear of it is not a drawback of this game at all which is what makes this game such a successful product for casual and competitive players alike. No matter what you won't exit Rocket League feeling worse than you did before you opened it.The only drawback in the game however is its matchup system. While the game itself has a quick matchmaking system that hardly ever tries the player's patience it can be a little rough for those who are playing for the first time. Sometimes a new player will be matched against other gamers who have accumulated skill that flies into a league completely out of the newbie's reach which as a result turns the game into a full fledged 2v2 with the two remaining players struggling to just keep up with the ball. The new players can learn from the pros in this sense and raise their skill cap substantially as well as witness the endless potential Rocket League has in store when they see sick plays and jumps made by the more experienced players but it doesn't nullify the fact that not everyone has equal grounding on the playing field. Eventually though the playing field does gradually beome leveled and when the newbie who jumps for no reason turns into a champion who can barrel roll into a flying ball at a different trajectory and score a goal the feeling of achievement in accomplishing such a feat is just amazing.Rocket League is suited as one of the best casual multiplayer sport arcade games you can have on your Steam account and I expect that it will stay that way for a long time. But that's just my opinion. What would be yours?,Rocket League®

It also doesn't require a super modern computer to play either. You hit a ball with rocket powered battle cars what more can you want?The only con to the game is that while the servers function extremely well the nature of the game does not lend itself to making even minor ping spikes or lag bearable. If your connection isn't very high quality you WILL be swearing at your screen every time you play online as your modem struggles to keep up with the action.

Pros very nice looking controls are easy (full controller support) fast paced easy to get used to Cons the only thing that I would say that I don't like is that matches need to be ranked better.

2016-04-22,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Very rarely do I ever get hooked on a game but Rocket League did it. This game is the definition of easy to learn hard to master. In the beginning it's just fun to play. Soccer with cars right? That's pretty fun to play around with. Later on as you actually learn how to control the car you get a whole new level of satisfaction because you're actually making some pretty cool goals and saves. After 190 hours I'm still trying and pulling off new tricks that look and feel amazing. There's so much room for improvement it's unreal.It's a great idea that was extremely well designed and implemented. I have zero complaints.,Rocket League®

2016-10-11,0,0,11,False,Recommended,First of all if you don't own this game what are you doing with your life??Based on the day I am writing this I have just bought the game this weekend. I have enjoyed it a lot so far.If you enjoy deep car customization you will definitely love this game. You are almost never likely to see a car the exact same as yours. The graphics on this game are pretty decent and can probably run on a potato (havent tested). I do recommend a controller for this game. I played 1 match with the mouse and keyboard and it was AWFUL. I recomend and Xbox controller or a Steam controller. Another thing I like about this game is that there is an amazing progression system. You start out pretty much never to hit the ball but after a while you get goals in every game. One thing that did steer me away from this game for quite some time is the DLC. I bought the game as well as Masamune (A DLC battle car). Most cars are only $1.99. There are actually more in game unlockable cars than DLC ones. One thing that is almost impossible to not buy is the keys. After each match there is a random chance you will get a crate. These crates include performance and visual battle car enhancements. The problem is a key to open one costs $1.50. This can be annoying. I plan to buy a key sometime though in order to open my rare crate. I hope this review motivated you to buy the game and I am sorry the the length. Bye!,Rocket League®

Rocket League takes a big risk creating a fresh competitive game where else could you find so much creativity and competitiveness? The graphics are really cool especially when looking back during plays. You could even customize your car and its accessories. The music is neat but I don't think its anything special. Online being a key part of a game like this's success is pretty on point. Though I tend to be concerned that bots replace players that leave it's better than nothing. I think this game is quite unappreciated for its Singleplayer modes such as the training mode which can actually up your game.Main Graphics 9.5/10Sound 9/10Gameplay 10/10Side Online 9/10Customization 8.5/10Longevity 10/10Creativity 10/10,Rocket League®

2015-12-28,0,0,2200,False,Recommended,"No problem.This is currently my favorite game and I foresee it being 'the one' for me quite a while into the future.It's super easy to just pick up and play but you'll quickly realize that mastering the game is going to take a while. I still don't feel like I'm ""good at Rocket League."" That's because I'm not experience does not inevitably yield skill. Thankfully they let you choose between ranked and unranked matchmaking so you're not always pressured to perform well. Ranked matches have tiered leagues so that you're playing with people of comparable skill (in theory at least).I highly recommend playing with people you know and/or can communicate with via voice chat especially when you're learning the mechanics and strategies. The most popular matchmaking is a 3v3 so if you have 2 friends with mics you're good to go. That said you'll be just fine if you don't have many friends or don't have a microphone.My one grievance has to do with the community. As with any popular game there are some toxic attitudes floating around. You'll inevitably meet a teammate in matchmaking who will get frustrated by your team's performance (but you can't win them all right?). This teammate could do one or many of the following start playing for the other team e.g. shooting on your own goal or ramming you away from defensive positionsspam requests to your team to forfeit the match even if you're only down by 1 goal (this can only happen in ranked play)do ""nothing "" by slowly driving aimlessly around the field and away from the action so that they don't get kicked for being idle (effectively reducing the players on your team by 1)trash talking everyone (just mute the in game mic for this)If this happens just take it easy and don't let it get to you. It's not your fault because it's a TEAM game after all.Rocket League is simply a great game. I recommend it.

2016-11-30,0,0,73,False,Recommended,"I recently bought Rocket League on both PS4 and PC and I ended up buying RL on PC on Nov.25 and I bought it on PS4 a month or two ago... It plays great on both but I wasn't well informed and I missed out on buying the GOTY's. It's a real bummer too because I wanted the DLC's but they're a bit much by themselves especially when I will most likely end up frequently playing as one or two different cars. It wouldn't be too bad if i just bought those couple cars in particular. But now I'll have to waste even more money if I want to get the DLC's later on. As a side note on the PS4 I went in expecting to get the Sweet Tooth car even if buying digital but for whatever reason I can't get that car on my console. So sad.

2016-12-01,0,0,698,False,Recommended,Easy to learn. Impossible to master.You will spend your first dozen games following the ball like a five year old learning to play soccer but without touching it. That's okay! You'll eventually get used to the controls and you'll be hitting it regularly. There's always a new trick to learn and it is exceedingly difficult to fully master this game.Be prepared for frustration as this game can certainly be rage inducing! 1v1 ranked will make you rage like a bull in a china shop so don't leave anything breakable on your desk.The developers are definitely on top of things and they consistently push out patches and updates that bring additional content into the game. New maps and gamemodes (e.g. Snow Day Hoops Mutators Rumble) are constantly pushed out and they don't take the EA path of introducing paid DLC that's anything other than cosmetic.The only issues I have with the game are a couple of physics glitches. Goalposts have wonky physics and balls that hit the inside of the posts tend to bounce out. Aside from that the physics work very well for the most part.Overall this is a phenomenal game that's entirely worth your time and the $20.,Rocket League®

2016-09-29,0,0,803,False,Recommended,Amazing game I cannot recommend it enough! The only issue with it is there are some toxic people that spew nothing but hate fortunately there is a mute button and you can disable all in game chat! Literally spend a lot of my day looking forward to getting back to playing this game! I was bored and looking through reviews on this game thinking that there can't be anyone who dislikes this game and was suprised to see how many people are butt hurt over the crates/keys aspect. Yes this game did implement CS GO style crates that you buy keys to open but you are not required to buy keys and if you don't want to participate in them you can disable them so you don't see when you get one. If you want to open crates but dont want to buy keys then don't trade crates to people who do buy keys and are willing to trade keys for crates. Personally I don't mind spending money on Keys because of how incredible this game is as well as how much enjoyment and game time I get in this game. If you think about it I have almost 313 hours in game (Which is very small compared to some) I paid $20 for this game (Rediculously Cheap I would have gladly paid $60) and I've spent $20 on keys. So you figure $40/ 313 Hours is about .12 cents per hour of Pure fun. More than worth it in my opinion! People need to get over themselves it's a company their goal is to make money. If they really wanted to they could charge a lot more and sell the DLC rather than GIVING IT AWAY FREE. Psyonix if you somehow read this you just keep on doing what you are doing you are doing an amazing job! &lt 3,Rocket League®

2016-09-30,0,0,505,False,Recommended,I have played 109 hours and counting of Rocket League. That is not too many hours and I didn't always like Rocket League but It is so addictive. There are so many aspects to Rocket League that make it great but whenever I try to explain the game to them all I can come up with is soccer with cars. But there is so much more to it than that. There is more to the regular soccer gamemode Rocket League offers Duels 2v2s 3v3s and 4v4s. But there are other gamemodes. Just to list a few Snow day is a 3v3 gamemode with a hockey puck and slippery ground. Hoops is a gamemode with court instead of a feild and instead of a goal there is a basketball hoop. Rocket Labs is also a 3v3 gamemode where you play on experimental Arenas. Psyonix resently added a new gamemode called Rumble Consisting of 11 power ups The Boot (Kicks an opponent s car)Disruptor (Forces your opponent to drive uncontrollably)Freezer (Freezes the ball in place)Grappling Hook (Pulls you towards the ball)Haymaker (Punches the ball)Magnetizer (Attracts the ball to your car)Plunger (Grabs the ball via plunger and cord)Power Hitter (Allows you to hit everything harder)Spike (Attach the ball to your car when you bump into it)Swapper (Change positions on the field with your opponent)Tornado (Sweep up the ball and opposing cars into a giant funnel cloud) Page I got my data from www.rocketleaguegame.com A competitive aspect is also in the game but only the regular soccer version is able to be played on ranked.Overall This game has taken many hours of time and I do not regret any of the time I spent on it. This is one my favorite games I have played. I strongly recommend that you give this game a chance you just might love it.,Rocket League®
2017-04-01,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This is definitely a quality game but be prepared to embarrass yourself completely for a while before you become even slightly decent at it. As it is even though I am a seasoned gamer in general (been playing since the release of the Coleco Gemini) I am absolutely awful at it. I could hold my own at FIFA and demolish my competition at NHL but I will play a match of Rocket League and come out of it feeling like I've been trampled by a pack of elephants. Each match makes you a little better and the feeling that you might one day become useful to your team ensures that you'll keep playing. I haven't yet reached that point but I'm sure that I'll enjoy it once I do.,Rocket League®

2016-10-02,0,0,180,False,Recommended,My story I played SARPBC when I was younger almost everyday with my friends it was fun. I stopped playing it for a while and then Rocket League came we were very hyped about it with my friends and decided to buy it. I didn't like it first and stopped it for a long time then I saw the price pot being 250 000$ and I wanted to play it again and so I did. And why? Well because I'm a very competitive person c And now I learned to love it..Now all I want is to become good (please for the love of god help me) Review It is a very good game on its own genre so it is hard to review but I'll try my best.It is a very original game and thats good.I like how it's very competitive and pretty fast paced but you still need tactics.Althought it's a very good game it has some fowls I'd really like it to have more balanced car system as some cars are available only if you buy them (or trade) even if they don't give you so big of an advantage it would be nice that they would be more balanced but overall this is my favorite game and I love it.I want the competitive scene to be even bigger.I recommend this to everyone they either like it or not.Also its very sad that it is really hard for beginners also try the trainings (the rookie wans are so easy that a 2 year old could do them 100%)Hope that I helped some people to get into this game see ya on the field!,Rocket League®

It's so simple anyone can play it however to get really good at it takes time. Though going into practice mode will only get you so far... the real way to get good is to play and experience! Eventually your mind will adapt to the situations of the game. I am not joking when I say that I know where a ball is going to land based on what position and speed it hits the wall and I've memorized this due to the simple stadiums/maps. A more experienced player shows and it's mostly skill that leads to a victory. This game is perfect for pretty much anyone who is interested in it and I promise none of you will be disappointed.,Rocket League®

I bought this game thinking that I would end up refunding it. Then once I get in it I can't stop playing. This game is very fun to play. They came is about you playing something like soccer in cars. But there is so much more to it. This is a great ahem and for the money it is worth it. But... the only downside is you get like 11 I think cars before you have to buy dlc. And the other cool thing is that you can go online with friends or just random people and just have fun.

2017-08-25,0,0,29,False,Recommended,This game is just downright amazing in the way it has taken a new approach on a sports genre game and plays like an absolute blast. If you have never actually heard of rocket league (how haven't you) to be short its really cars that are able to jump and use rocket boost (which can later be used to use quite a lot of aerial moves) that play soccer the game consists of a few different game modes but generally it is either 1v1 2v2 3v3 soccer matches with 5 minutes to score as many goals as possible but there are quite a few other distinct game modes to take up some of your time.i also want to mention this is my second account owning Rocket League the other has roughly 150 hours on itThe game is quite hard to pick up and learn i have to say but seems quite relatively easy. Once you start learning the timings and when to hit the ball everything starts becoming a blast a play its just about practice practice practice. and with the new custom training mode that has been added it is easy to browse the workshop and find a training routine to practice whatever it is you want (such an amazing addition to the game) I just cant recommend this game enough to try out and is a blast to play with friends,Rocket League®

2016-11-02,0,0,1945,False,Recommended,This is a good game but once you start playing comp you will rage alot. the ranking system is so mest up playing with friends is the funnest with like private matches mutators ect. This game overall I'd give a 7/10 (thats with 1 400+) hours put into (alot afk but enough to understand it) reason being is it's ranking system and macthup system. I'd give casual just for fun a solid 9/10 it's repetative but never gets old thats why I love this game )Small add * I just want to say despite it's negatives it's still a good game and that I love about this game. Last thing I'll put is the community is pretty toxic and full of salty 12 year olds like me and like I said before the gameplay is repetative........i've you've played it for over 1k hours ) But for the starters you can put TONS of times into this game unlocking stuff hats learning new things and tricks I still haven't learned all of em yet.,Rocket League®

2016-04-27,0,0,62,False,Recommended,The idea of rocket powered cars flipping through the air in Thunderdome esque matches of cage soccer sounds like the incoherent ramblings of a madman but it turns out to be just crazy enough to work. Psyonix s Rocket League the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge assisted front flips in an ice cream truck and the white knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense. The fast and fluid absurdity of Rocket League fuses into one hell of a good time despite servers that rarely work perfectly.The main mode puts two teams of three in visually diverse but performance identical vehicles (though 1v1 2v2 and 4v4 variants exist) as they race up and down the pitch chasing the league s oversized equivalent of a soccer ball. The great thing is you don t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple drive really fast around bright glossy neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space.The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call physics plus where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling and ridiculous mid air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do.And those tricks are the first surface scratching glimpse at Rocket League s layer of strategy under the ostensibly chaotic mashing of metal. Tapping your jump button puts you in the air where tapping it again with a direction held performs a somersault barrel roll or bicycle kick. It might sound simple and really it is but timing a strike to connect with a speeding ball and controlling the direction you send it sailing down to precise angles takes some skill. There are real potent levels of satisfaction to be tapped when you see a teammate lining up a shot from the corner and read the situation slamming on the brakes to nudge the pass into the goal with a perfectly timed barrel roll. It s electric.Outside of the frenzied and intoxicating gameplay Rocket League has scant few features to flesh out the experience. The player progression system where winning matches performing in game feats or doing anything really earns you experience unlocks a small stable of goofy cars or cosmetic decals and accessories.It s fun to drive a truck wearing a sombrero sure but because there s little or no mechanical difference between the dozen or so sportsters trucks exotics a few concept models and at least one ice cream truck (exclusive to PS4 players) there s no actual sense of progression that changes how you play a match. And while that s all perfectly justifiable in the name of a level multiplayer playing field I would have loved to see each car carry the strengths and weaknesses implied by their real world counterparts sport cars as speedy but hard to handle strikers trucks and vans as slower but stronger defenders and the balanced but all purpose roamers somewhere in between. It seems like a missed opportunity to add a more meaningful connection to your cars in the garage especially when making a squad to play through an entire season.But there is a separate progression arc found in learning to use the surprising mechanical depth of Rocket League s many controls and flighty physics. Whether that arc takes you through online competitive or ranked matches easy going exhibitions up to four player local cooperative play on split screen or all 36 weeks of a fully expanded season mode the Rocket League experience is always about getting into the next throttle pumping match.And while there are leaderboards to track your statistics and global prowess Rocket League servers struggle to support the influx of PlayStation 4 and PC players hunting for same and cross platform matchmaking bouts rendering most of Rocket League s online features including the online party system spotty at best. Fortunately the AI is formidable on either difficulty setting above Rookie both as teammates and opponents so Rocket League doesn t lose much in a completely offline existence which is good because its online suite is largely unreliable.THE VERDICTRocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just one more match even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great goofy easy to learn and difficult to master action sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.8/10 IGN,Rocket League®

2016-12-25,0,0,565,False,Recommended,It all started so innocently. I wanted to buy the steam controller and at the time this game came free with the controller so I got it. One of my friends played it and I really didn't think it'd be that good because I'm not a fan of games such as fifa or really any sports type video games. I prefer to play them myself if you know what I mean. But I went ahead and installed it and gave it a go on the reccomendation of my friend... it was all over after that. This is not like any other sports video game that I have seen before. It's cars. cars that are rocket powered. (did I mention that you can fly?) The purpose is to drive your car into a ball and get that ball into a goal on the opposing end of the field. Simple right? very. However this game while easy to play and with a easy learning curve is difficult to master. If you are not careful you will become addicted to trying to climb that ranking system. Not to mention due to the rounds being about five minutes (without overtime and minimal replay watching) it's easy to pick up play a few games and then get on with your daily responsibilities. so I guess you could say yeah I think this game is pretty okay.,Rocket League®

2016-08-24,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,This game is extremely good. It started off with some minor annoyances (like 60fps cap) but were quickly fixed. Nonetheless this game is a game you should play with your friends since then is when you will most enjoy it. However you can still play solo as they have a season mode which lets you create your own team and play a whole season to see if you can win.PROS + Easy to play you can get the hang of it pretty quickly (Controller a must though).+ EXTREMELY fun to play (if you're not one of the rage types for the ranked matches)+ Has a decent amount of content for entertainment (various training modes season friendly online ranked online basketball ice hockey...)+ It IS a $20 game they don't do that Hello Games sh*t where they release a broken game for $60.CONS You CAN rage quit in ranked sometimes it gets frustrating. *Not really a con more like nitpicking*I'd like it if they could add some sort of spotify add on or a music detection so that we could play our playlists in the background (I mean on PC you can just download spotify and play it on the background but its not as clean / )EDIT I will NOT recommend this game again until they invest more in their servers instead of adding things like crates skins and crap. It's like Valve all over again. First of all I play US East and South America because I live in Costa Rica. Yet it is near IMPOSSIBLE to get a match in South America where I can get decent server performance. Why don't I mention ping? Because I sometimes get 192 stable ping with NO packet loss at all so the game is actually playable. However there are times where I can have 60 ping and be teleporting all over the ing place. Like what? How does that work? Is it cause they have potato servers? Is it because of my poor internet connection? (Which I find highly unlikely since I have 50mbps download and 1mbps upload with a high end Netgear router and a Motorola modem).,Rocket League®

2016-12-19,0,0,75,False,Recommended,"Pros Takes absolutely no grinding just pick up and play. Games are short so even blowouts don't get aggravating. Matches are action packed and it feels like you can contribute right away. Easy to play but has a high skill ceiling. Tricks highly skilled players can pull off are more impressive than feeling cheap. Community isn't salty in game folks tend to stay silent. Cross platform play means I can go against friends on XBone or PS4. Uniquely suitable for players of all ages.Cons Hoops and Hockey modes aren't as developed. Not a big fan of the DLC and ""key"" mechanics prefer everything to be available through normal gameplay.I think the best praise I can give Rocket League is that it's a game I come back to again and again because literally every match I've ever played has been fun. Jump in and jump out for a quick game or play several in a row for a good night with friends. Excellent game for streaming especially with friends in voice chat. Highly recommended.",Rocket League®

2016-10-13,0,0,338,False,Recommended,Before I say anything let's get this straight.. I don't buy very many games let alone write a review for them.Rocket league is an outstanding game. It truly is a lot of fun and its a game that me and my friends can pop into (no matter the skill level) and there is a mode for us to play where we all have fun. They keep adding new things weather its new cars new modes maps and car modifications. It's always nice to see new things and twists added into the game. The newest mode they added (Rumble) is a total blast and its almost like a completely 2nd game inside of Rocket league and I truly hope that they add more power ups..Now that im done sucking up the the creators for the game lets get serious.. While there have been some great things added to the game their map additions have been lacking. I was no a fan of the Tokyo map that they added but that slowly grew on me.. My biggest issues is the newest map AQUADOME. This map is the laggiest map in the world. The graphcis are rather trash and for a lot of people its pretty much unplayable.. Most people may be saying that thats not a big deal but when you get that map 4 ING TIMES BACK TO BACK TO BACK TO BACK IN THE DAMN RANKED QUEUE.. IT STARTS TO TICK YOU OFF BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT DO ANYTHING EXCEPT SIT THERE AND TRY TO PLAY BUT IN THE END JUST ACCEPT YOUR FATE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE AND POSSIBLY DERANK. Some more people may be saying that thats not that bad either.. but it is when you have teammates who are trying to throw the game or not even playing because they hate the map just as much as you and cant play on it either. like gg guys.. great map. .,Rocket League®

2016-12-19,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,Pros Varied vehicle design and customization while not offering unfair advantage. Does not punish you for your preferred aestheticSeason mode Beautifully crafted arenas across a variety of aesthetic stylesA good variety of sporty musicCons Wonky physicsIrritatingly bad AiPoor sports style ai programming/difficulty rampSolo play mode only your experience will probably be different in multiplayer and can ignore the ai section.Cons details below I won't say that its a bad game but the frustration that goes along with artificial difficulty and other points is more than I am willing to recommend. Might still be your cup of tea but I digress.Physics the cars have very little weight and if you get knocked into the air it can be quite awhile in game time before you make it back to the field. Likewise getting bumped will send you flying. In a game where you get bumped so often this gets irritating rather quickly. There is also the matter that jumps are not consistant your highest jump is different than the ai's and is not consistant between your own jumps. You can expect to jump over the ball because the jump height is suddenly higher by doing the same thing you usually do normally that puts you under where you want to be. You will lose jump offs 90% of the time because the ai can jump higher than you can. Somewhat manageable in positions where you can rocket jump and get a position advantage but that is often not the case. There is also the point that you can hit the ball at full speed and have the game react as if you had hit it going the opposite direction. The AI is bad across all difficulties. If it were consistently so it wouldn't be so bad but the sports programming to make the game harder the closer to the end of a match/season makes it feel like you are alone on your team. Your team will miss the ball or the net while sitting next to it will watch the ball roll past them into your goal pass the ball to the other team and stop contesting it and will occasionally put the ball in your own net. This happens with irritating frequency you will have a 3 0 lead and still lose a match 4 3 in the last minute because your team decided to change sides. That really isn't much worse than human players I suppose but really kills the game when you repeatedly lose because the ai decided it was so and not due to your own error.,Rocket League®

2016-12-20,0,0,15,False,Recommended,I'd have to say this is honestly the best sports game of the year. While I have limited time in it at this rate.... I can also say that it is the most enjoyable sporting experience on the PC if not on the entire gaming market at the moment. It runs unbelievably smooth the net code is pretty much as good as you can expect in a driving game with this much contact involved and you can use your brain quite a bit to get you an advantage as well.... as I have found strategies from various real life sports help a lot if you incorporate them into your quick reaction thinking.

2016-12-03,0,0,157,False,Recommended,"I really hope the lag I got doesn't affect the opinion of this review. I'm gonna try and keep it simple enough for anyone to understand in a peaceful manner.While I do think this game needs some improvements I still think this is a good game. It's not necessarily addicting or completely life wasting in terms of enjoyment but I still enjoyed most of my hours playing this game. I emphasize ""most"" because the game still has issues.For one there's lag. A lot of it. I don't know if it was just my internet or its ability to connect to the servers but no matter what server I joined or what region I joined in my ping would spike tremendously. I'd rather have a constant minor lag than major lag spikes. There have been so many instances in which I'd think I'm about to hit the ball but in reality I'm actually on the other side of the field. It was hard to type that without cussing especially since the lag in this game is especially frustrating due to the immense pressure and excitement the game induces. I still want to emphasize that this isn't a bad game. It's just that my experience was faultered because of my terrible lag spikes.Another thing I liked about this game was its immense customization. There are a lot of different things you can apply to your vehicle like paintjobs tires trails antennas and even hats for your car. Yes hats. However this system is also faultered. When I say a lot of customization I of course mean spending hours upon hours UPON HOURS unlocking these items.The loot system in this game is so bad. You can play for hours on end and sometimes only end up unlocking maybe one crappy antenna. It works the same way as Destiny's loot system (AWFUL). It doesn't matter if you scored 17 goals on the other team and saved 23 shots in the course of a 5 minute game it's still completely random. There's a chance that the AFK guy in the corner could get a loot crate instead of you. I spent a whole day 14 hours of my life playing this game for my whole saturday. You know how many items I unlocked? THREE. THREE ITEMS. IN THE COURSE OF 14 HOURS. ONLY ONE WAS DECENT. I DO NOT LIKE THIS LOOT SYSTEM.On another note I like the modes in this game and I think they should expand it some more. At the time of me writing this review there's Rumble Classic Doubles Duel Snow Day Chaos and Hoops. Most of these modes (except Snow Day and Chaos) are fun to play and I think more modes like this would be fun. Imagine a Volleyball mode were you hit the ball over the net and you could even ""set it"" to your teammate so they could ""spike"" it down. I think that'd be fun.There's not much else to say about the game besides more about my personal experience with the intense lag which I'm sure you don't want to hear. In short this is a very fun game with issues. A flawed masterpiece I suppose. The idea of the game in itself is also likeable and the game has so much potential for growth.FINAL SCORE 8.5/10",Rocket League®

2016-10-31,0,0,1490,False,Recommended,Here's the thing about Rocket League.You need to like getting good at playing games or doing activities to enjoy this game. The community is generally amazing although the occasional isn't too uncommon either but that's just the way online gaming is i guess.Returing to my anterior point the fact is that Rocket League is very fun especially with the addition of Rumble game mode (powerups!) but will get undoubtedly boring unless you start to take it somewhat seriously and start craving getting that little bit better be it getting that aerial just a bit faster learning to dribble better whatever.The fact is competitive play is what runs this game now albeit there is still a large part of community playing on casual. So i recommend this game fully and it is worth every cent of the 19 99 i payed for it and each minute of the 300 hours i've played has been great. The only catch i present is that it will almost definitely get somewhat repetitive if you don't start playing competitive with the objective of getting better personally.,Rocket League®

2017-06-17,0,0,467,False,Recommended,I remember hearing the hype about this game when it first came out and I didn't think I'd like it. About 2 years later down the line I thought it's on sale why not? I 100% recommend this game to anyone. I don't enjoy playing any sports games but there's something about being in a car with rockets and trying to score goals on another team that makes this fast pace intense game so fun! I actually went ahead and bought a bumper sticker for my car IRL to show my support to the world haha. It takes a long time to get the small tricks down and even longer to get the pro moves down. I only consider myself decent and I can beat my friends 1 v 2 hahaha. They hate me on this game when we play against eachother super competitive. Playing against others is extremely fun whether you prefer to play with friends or solo but friends amplify the fun magnitude up to 10x!

2016-12-22,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This game is worth it if you're looking for some simple and compact co op match for 5 minutes. The price is quite affordable even though the content isn't that much. Although the game is pretty simple and straight forward there aren't a lot of things you can do in the game tbh. However given the ability to customize your own car is pretty fun thing to do plus you often get free stuff every match! The community is pretty good so far I have only encounter 1 player who trash talk a lot compare to Dota 2 lol. And one more thing if you have a console laying around use it for this game! It will not make you be better than other player but it is much easier with console than keyboard imo.,Rocket League®

I have reccomended this game to multiple friends and I have heard nothing but good things from it. If I had one quirk it would be the ranking system it is so hard to move up in rank yet so easy to lose rank.

2017-06-15,0,0,273,False,Recommended,Rocket leauge is one of my favourite games of all time. It is the first of its kind and has one of the best devolopers Psyonix. They are one of the best devolopers because they listen to their community more than anything else. If there is a noticable problem by the community Psyonix is on it. the game itself runs up to 250 fps which is more than enough. 60 fps is good enough to play this game. The connection is very good and the servers are very good. Some people complain about the ranking system but i think it is good and it SHOULD be hard to rank up. It is WAYYYYY harder to rank up in csgo than in rocket leauge. But rocket leauge is that type of game. It is 100% worth 20 dollars. So if youre looking for a great game to play buy this one.,Rocket League®

Problem is it's more of a ""hey i don't like these maps"" type of vote but you still end up playing them. My pc sucks i hate aquadome i get like 20 fps its the only map i dont want to play. Second map i play is aquadome. Seems stupid to me to even have a map vote in that case.",Rocket League®
2016-12-07,0,0,765,False,Recommended,Best game I have ever played...period. I do not play sports games...never been a fan. Always played FPS Action Strategy type of games. This game got me hooked from day one. I gave up on every other game. FO4 GTA Skyrim...haven't touched them since I bought this game. It's taken over my evenings. I don't regret it. I love every minute of it. Only complaint is that some players are very immature and either troll or prefer to forfeit than play through a game. I guess that's expected in any game though. It's balanced by the majority of players being class act and I've had some great runs with good teamates.Get it!,Rocket League®

2016-12-07,0,0,544,False,Recommended,I've logged 300 hours approx. In terms of overall enjoyment I've had in this game. I'd say quite a bit even though with the new maps and their actualy awfulness. I love this game the community is wonderful I think I've only ever added someone through a game in rocket league. I always have people sending me invites to play any gamemode whether they are a challenger elite or even a champion. I really could care less what rank you are I just like playing the game. Rocket labs was a great way to introduce alternative maps. However neo tokyo is simply too annoying the bounces are luck based until you hit champion level. Most people won't get that far anytime soon let alone give the effort to get there. That's why I'm very happy they introduced map preferences. Overall I'd give it a 9/10 simply for occasional server drops and or lag from over textured maps.,Rocket League®

2017-06-23,0,0,255,False,Recommended,Rocket league is tons of fun and is great for both casual and competitive players. The game is almost entirely glitch free and hacks are non existent (from my knowledge). Matches are only five minutes long but are extremely intense and really can keep you on the edge of your seat in a close game. The only real complaint I can think of is the match making system being slighty unfair at times matching myself with opponents who are either much better or worse than me. Other than that the game is flawless and definitely worth adding to any PC gamer's steam library.,Rocket League®

After seeing my entire friends list.. people that wouldn't normally be into this type of game people that don't like competitive sports / cars / or using a controller and the picky frugal type that dont buy many games at all. All of them played this game more then any other so I knew it had to be good. I was extremely glad I bought this game..theres an indescribable piece of this game that keeps you interested and wanting more. For the amount of time you'll put into it $20 bucks is more then fair.

2017-06-23,0,0,1633,False,Recommended,I've always loved competitive games and this satisfied my search after I was getting a bit tired of Sm4sh Bros.Game is well made well updated and very fun. Rocket RC Soccer didn't appeal to me initially but once I started playing I hated my brother for introducing it to me. Bye bye freetime XD.The game is primarily multiplayer online based (which is free) but there are some local solo matches you can do. The fun exists with other players though.Constantly being updated Psyonix is adding new features which keep the game interesting. Multiple ways to play multiple ways to win tons of fun.The only down side (is it one?) is that there is a skill tier and if you want to play with your friend who just started playing after you've been playing for a while you'll likely crush them and they'll likely get annoyed.Online competitive is balanced however so new players will play with other new players of the same skill.,Rocket League®

2015-12-28,0,0,289,False,Recommended,Do you remember those days when playing a video game was fun? This game reminded me of those days.No RNG No p2wNo Nickle n DimeJust straigh up fun!I honestly never though soccer with freaking cars would be so much fun I personally hate sports! Yet this game is so much fun!The graphics are amazing the customazation is amazing too. What really make this game stand out is that there is no type of advantage rather you play on console or pc or pc with a console controller anybody can do amazing stunts in this game. One thing I disliked was the salty 1v1 community out there. Some players will go out of their way to turn a game into an ocean of salt rather they are winning or loosing. (I'd suggest staying away from 1v1 unless you're playing with friends or if you can deal with the salt)Other than the 1v1 issue I've had I can't say anything else bad about the game.. well maybe being able to play with people of same level would be nice.,Rocket League®

You can play however you want rank up in competitive or mess around in Rumble with powerups. Nobody is too salty when they lose or cocky when they win because games are 5 minutes and there's no hackers or smurfs.

2016-01-25,0,0,37,False,Recommended,This game is the greatest game ever. For the first little while you'll find yourself randomly flopping around but once you get the hang of it you will have so much fun.GameplayThe gameplay consists of cars that can jump and do flips at your command playing soccer. Online play requires a lot of teamwork to be able to score or defend your goal. If you don't work well with your team you're bound to get dominated. Community The community for the most part are very kind people not a lot of toxic people. Controls/Camera Controlling your vehicle is fairly easy to do but they don't turn very sharply. Some people say playing with a controller is much easier but I still get lots of goals with keyboard and mouse. If you're in ball cam and the ball is high over top of you the camera angle is a little weird.Learning curve So this game has a very big learning curve it's very hard to get used to but the tutorials help you a lot.Audio The menu music is really bad but other than that everything else is good.Customization You can customize your car from its body to the colour of your boost but you can't alter or upgrade its performance so it's a very fair game and no overpowered cars.I think that's about it... 10/10 game,Rocket League®

2016-09-27,0,0,485,False,Recommended,Over the course of your Rocket League career you'll start out by puttering around the field and missing open nets while eventually advancing to flying through the air and dribbling the ball through two defenders. I highly recommend using a xbox360 controller as the controls are basic enough but allow for the high precision necessary for high skill play. There are currently four gamemodes soccer hockey basketball and rumble mode. Soccer is where you learn how to drive your vehicle. Hockey is where you learn how to drive your vehicle on the walls. Basketball is where you learn how to fly your vehicle through the air. Rumble mode is where you forget everything you know and just have a good time with all the wacky powerups.Bring some friends and remember that everyone sucks when they start out but once you score your first aerial goal you'll begin to understand how amazing this game is.Rumble Mode is a good equalizer mode to play with friends.,Rocket League®

2017-03-13,0,0,1572,False,Recommended,"After over 600+ hours of gameplay I can say I am ready for a review. Let me just start of with saying that If you have never played rocket league then what are you waiting for? This game is so popular for a very good reason because it's a damn brilliant game. Everything about it just feels right. The controls are tight and you can adjust the car however you want in any moment of the game it's hard to do at first but once you put some hours into the game the experience is so rewarding and you see yourself improving.Graphics are just perfect too it's not trying to be the next crysis with ultra realistic graphics it just overall looks good with a cool art style and it's perfect for what it's trying to achieve to just be a fun game.The performance for the most part is excellent. I mean this game can run on almost any pc there are some maps wich users with a lower end pc have stated that they get lower fps in. One map in particular is Aquadome. I don't think this will be too much of an issue though as there might be performance patches to fix this and pc computers are getting cheaper anyway so people every day can afford more powerful hardware.One of the things that make this game great is playing with your friends I mean you will have so many good moments from the funny fails to the epic moments it's all worth it. People tend to complain about the Rocket League community for being rather ""cancerous"" but like any game not all people are and the ones who are just ignore plus you can disable voicechat and text chat if you so wish so no problem there.Conclusion This game is the example of ""Easy to learn but hard to master"" it's addicting and faced paced and so satisfying winning a close match.Summary Tight controls and very responsive Generally good performance Addicting and fast paced Brilliant co op play Funny fails and epic moments Frequently updated Near endless customisation Many maps DLC is only cosmetic for the most part and even cars aren't p2w Steam workshop content Trainer with any type of practice you can think of Big playerbaseWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR BUY IT!",Rocket League®

Well there you have it theres the pros and cons but Rocket League is a really fun game to play as long as you are okay with having to have time to practice and dont mind having to pay to get dlc.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who does enjoy competitive online games.If you do happen to buy this game though I recommend using keyboard and mouse because later on when you get better a controller will limit you to keyboard and mouse users.,Rocket League®

2017-01-07,0,0,137,False,Recommended,"It's probably already been said but Rocket League is pretty much a great example of ""easy to get into hard to master."" If the concept of playing soccer with rocket cars sounds like something you can sink your teeth into Rocket League may be for you.Because ultimately what you see is what you get. There aren't many frills or twists here other than car cosmetics (which don't affect gameplay ) although there are a couple of ""extra"" modes such as a basketball variant I haven't really dove into yet. But the core of the game works so well I haven't really felt compelled to try it. The gameplay gets a little more nuanced once you start learning how to get the most out of jumps and boosts but generally speaking you don't have fancy control schemes to memorize like other sports games do. The physics of the game feel and behave like you would expect them to so its often just a matter of how well you can drive and put yourself in the position to make plays.And in a game where everyone is zooming and boosting around making plays in a frenetic match felt very gratifying to me. A quick reverse to nudge a ball into the goal or pummeling into an opponent's car to throw off their shot... great fun. Its also interesting how the dynamics of a match can change simply by switching between different modes as mentioned I didn't play the basketball mode but even going from 3v3 to 2v2 matches can fundamentally change your strategy. The core may remain the same but the game often shows its depth in interesting ways.Perhaps my only complaint at this point is that I don't understand the ranking system. I have a tier that I belong to but no apparent indication of how close I am to the next one or how I even level up. Not a huge deal as I'm not wildly invested in competitive at this point but still a bit odd at a glance.The game may focus on only one thing but it does that one thing pretty fantastically. Definitely recommended.",Rocket League®

2017-12-30,0,0,13,False,Recommended,I have 10 hours in this game and I have been having so much fun and laughter! Rocket League is really simple but can get intense in matches. Base on the type of matches you go in it could be a clusterf*ck with all the cars all over the ball or everyone using their abilities as soon as they get it. You always want to hit the ball just so you could make a nice trick shot into the goal or to make a amazing save. Either way you feel triumph and want to play more. There are these cosmetics that could look pretty good on your Nissan. You could change the way your rockets look have designs or just have a crown on top of your pink truck. There are many types of varieties you could choose for your rocket car. You could get them by playing matches or buying crates with keys which kinda sucks. Some problems I have are the players they could help your team to victory or completely ruin your chances of at least getting one goal. What happens in many player's minds is that they have to hit the ball no matter what! They go straight for the ball. And this is the problem this could ruin people chances of getting a goal because a person decided they could get it but fail anyway. In other cases they might hit the ball into their own goal causing the opposing team to win and making you hate the guy who scored. I guess you shouldn't be mad because everyone makes mistakes. thats what we do. Unless he is trolling then curse the hell out of him.Controls can also get confusing esspecially when you are playing with mouse and keyboard. But once you get use to the controls you could become a pro at it. This game is ment for a controller. Besides those two issues this game has so much that can offer. I recommend this game and give it a 9/10.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,353,False,Recommended,I don't really care for cars or soccer but Rocket League is incredibly fun! It can be dangerously addictive...addictive to the point where after a 5 minute match you start to instictively click to play another even though you intended to quit. It's also a very easy game to quickly jump in and jump out of (if you can break the cycle) because of these quick 5 minute matches. Some people are turned off immediately by the high skill ceiling and there is a seriously high ceiling but everyone gets better the more they play and it can be very rewarding to improve. There is some quick training and bots you can play against so you're not going into an online game blind. I played through some single player seasons against bots before I joined any online matches.Even if you just want to screw around there's always the hockey basketball and rumble modes outside of the more typical 1v1 2v2 3v3 and (the more ridiculous) 4v4 modes. On top of these (in local games only) you can mess around with mutators to change the gravity size of the ball give unlimited boost and a handful of other neat options. There's no reason to take the game too seriously (especially if you're never playing ranked matches anyhow). Even if you typically do play to win and if you're getting frustrated because you're not doing as great as you hoped in ranked matches these other game modes are an easy way to remind yourself why the game can still be super fun even if you're not winning!,Rocket League®

Considering that each match is 5 minutes long this game fits perfectly into the 5 More Minutes Award.Very fun game that is competetive challenging and approachable.

2017-01-13,0,0,451,False,Recommended,This game is simple in concept but extremely well executed.Pros No skill? No problem Need a challenge? Ranked competitive matchmaking Short on time? Quick matches Bored easily? Endless cast of characters in teammates as well as varying gametypes across changing map layouts. Very active user base find a match at any time. A variety of rocket car chassis with plenty of options for personal expression.Cons Because of the game's accessibility and popularity it's played by a wide range of personalities. Not all of the people you encounter in matchmaking will be decent folk. If you like a challenge try the competitive matchmaking servers. The tiered multiplayer matchmaking system offers a great opportunity to push your abilities to their limits and perhaps learn some new ones in the process. If you're looking to goof around a while or test out your sweet aerials there are also more casual servers and even training modes with a freeplay option for all your antics.This game is great if you're just looking to kill a few minutes. With its short match times you're not making a huge committment but the game can still manage to pack plenty of intense gameplay in 5 10 minutes. Jump in for a study break and then get right back into learning about the powerhouse of the cell.If you're binging you'll run into plenty of diversity in your teammates with various skillsets at different degrees of polish making each successive match a mental struggle to exploit the weaknesses of the opposing team while trying to compensate for your own. In other words you won't get bored.This game is worth more than what you'll pay for it here.,Rocket League®

2016-03-07,0,0,5,False,Recommended,"Rocket League can be best described as a competitive wacky simulator game everyone knows how to control the cars but it s mostly boils down to vaguely hitting the ball towards the goal and praying it goes inI m probably the worst player ever in rocket league. I can probably count how many goals vie scored on one hand. Didn t stop the game from being fun though. It s got that ""grab a friend and hit giant balls with turbo powered sports cars with hats"" kind of fun to it.I do wish competitive mode online had a tad bit of gameplay variety to it. With all the different stages there are only very minor differences. I wanted arenas where the gravity was a little heavier or arenas where your boost meter was self replenishing or something with a low goal and a high goal arenas with ramps and gimmicky stuff in the way. Sure elitist competitive people would moan but for god sake you re playing rocket powered car soccer! Let it be weird!

2016-06-23,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Fast paced and fun ruins friendships faster than the enemy team can score.*Edit*After playing it for a little longer here's my two cents As always very fast paced. Team mates vary from complete beginners to very good players. Community may or may not be cancerous but because communication is limited it's not really an issue. Pretty collors DLCs are not a must but they're cheap and some of them are neat looking*and another edit*Yes I do recommend this game because I friggin love the colors and stuff in it. I've nominated it even but for my own category of what it is It's unoriginal.It is a great game to play with good physics and great to toy around. The idea is so simple it's brilliant. But there were many other games like it that didn't make it. This one did.Do I recommend it though? Hell yes it's fun to play. The Devs do a great job at what they do and the eye candy is nice. There is only one aquatic map that gives my processor some trouble but other than that it's very well optimised.The customability in it is decent I'd love to see no limitations as to what decals you can add on cars (there are vehicles that can not be customized with visual items from other vehicles).Other than that it's fun as hell.Would recommend.Overall would recommend.,Rocket League®
2016-11-24,0,0,1312,False,Recommended,The game idea is pretty simple but Psyonix really made it an awesome experience.You can either play it just for fun or really get into it and play it competitive.The matches take 5 10 minutes depending on how many goals are scored but either isn't too long so you can play it whenever you have a few minutes spare time.Solid 9/10,Rocket League®

2016-10-01,0,0,1134,False,Recommended,In overall a fun game. The gameplay is superb and no pay to win mechanics as in most other online games nowadays.The community is quite mixed while one part of the community comes clearly from CS GO the other half are quite pleasant team mates / opponents.What bugs me a bit is that the casual mode if I'm not playing with my premade group ranked is a bit annoying. The range of skill within the 6 players on the field is far too great lately and in most cases not even. This leads far too often to matches that have seen 10 15 players before it ends.The ranked mode is actually quite nice even so some peple try to abuse mechanics to claim pizes they don't earn in 90% you will find yourself in nice and intense matches that are fun to play.,Rocket League®

2017-09-07,0,0,779,False,Recommended,For anyone who doesn't know what rocket league is it's basically football with cars. This sounds incredibly boring however when you add rocket boosters explosions and wall climbing to it it becomes so much better.I got this game when it was in the summer offers and tbh haven't played it much because i found it quite hard to play (yes im a noob) however after plugging in a controler it becomes so much easier and you can actually win so basically just plug in a controller to your PC and your life issues are gone.I thought i would only really play this game on a casual level because when i've played competitive games before the communities are just so toxic. Rocket league is the complete opposite. I play with my friends on 2v2 and 3v3 and just having a laugh and still winning games and even without friends no one really cares if you're good or not.I really like this game because it's just so relaxed and it gives you a breather from the really competitive games out there but still gives you the enjoyment you'd expect from one. Best buy on steam by far.*Edit so now i have over 250 hours and i've finished a competitive season the higher you get the more people care which does lead to toxicity and saltiness but i still have to say that it's basically nothing compared to other big name games out there such as overwatch CS GO etc.Definite need to buy!!!,Rocket League®

This game easily ranks in my top 5 all time. Super approachable. Super Silly. Its cars playing soccer with a giant ball and you can fly with rockets plus you have really great devs and community. OH and cross platform play. And great job by the developers keeping the silly players happy with (free) new modes in wacky arenas (hockey mode basketball coming etc) as well as a growing ranked player base with twitch sponsoring a 75K championship season. The pros' videos on youtube are stunning to watch but the matchmaking has been tweaked to usually give you a pretty even game no matter the skill level.Just do yourself a huge favor and buy this game.seriously.What a Save!,Rocket League®

This is the game that I play most every night for the adrenaline rush and victory thrills. Even losing isn't so bad when the game is close and you still made the amazing plays that show in a replay. Fast paced quick games and with friends the fun factor is multiplied tenfold. Dive in and score your amazing goals today.Pros Intense Action The adrenaline flows as you score a goal then block the opponents attempt and win the game Music Oh my god the music in this game is 11/10 would listen to on repeat all day! Customization Your little RC car becomes a devil with horns a king with a crown or a mariachi with sombrero Graphics The game just looks pretty and flows beautifully as you fly across the field scoring and defending Multiplayer Play with up to 2 and 3 friends as you face off in various modes with fun mutatorsCons Matchmaking Can throw you into some crappy games from time to time Learning Curve Can be easy at the start but spikes in difficulty as you see people flying and your groundedNot enough cons to ruin the experience by any margin just some things to keep note of.

Outside of competative it can be skewed...but thats what non skill based MM will get you its just for fun at that state.I really enjoy the game and if you have no interest in competative the non competative and season modes are perfect and just as enjoyable.There is also a high skill cap basic skills are learned fairly quickly but ball guidance judgement and air hits are something that does take time to learn.,Rocket League®

2016-06-03,0,0,1703,False,Not Recommended,Great game for all the reasons below however if your buying this game for your kids just be aware there are numerous people on the online side of the game who will use very bad words and threats giving your kids a very different experience to the one you'd expect from such a game. so if you want to keep your kids away from anger aimed at them onscreen and some very bad swear words and threats then don't buy or just don't allow them to access the online side. this is the only downside to the game but one I think parents should be aware of before purchasing for their kids. edited my review from thumbs up to thumbs down simply because of the pings and stupid matchmaking. Also there are too many people who blast others for attempting to save shots and not being successful while the person blasting is nowhere near attempting a save as they are upfront failing to score. people moan if you bang into them by mistake and cry like babies and there is a lot of blaming other people because they suck and want to deflect the blame. so be prepared for a cry baby community.,Rocket League®

Remember it's just a game and you'll play better than if you get heated up real quick. Its a mix of driving games sports action and you even get to mod your car. While there are loot boxes you have to pay for keys for this game also lets you trade with other players or trade in items you don't use for better ones. All things you pay for are only for looks and there is no play to win. Great game solo or with a friend or more!,Rocket League®

One of the things i really like about it is that you dont have to be a car nut! Its all very basic in that respect. Just pick a car and dress it up!The only issue i have with it is some of the DLC achievements refuse to unlock. But hopefully a simple update will fix that.,Rocket League®

That may be because i've had time to play other games and get hooked on those however i feel as if the gameplay just isn't unique anymore if you solo queue you will get two types of people. Either the sweaty tryhards who will carry you call you a noob then leave after one game or the people that are mediocre at the game but whenever they get a goal expect to see ""What a save!"" in the chat.

2016-12-07,0,0,723,False,Recommended,I'm playing Rocket League for a while now! ( Level Legend Rank overall Superstar )Firstly I really hesitated to buy this game because it looked a bit 'weird' also rc car football what the hell ? ) But after some friends bought it and told me that they have a blast with it I came to the conclusion to give it a try... and man I don't regret a single cent ( it's also quite cheap ) !Rocket League is an AMAZING SKILL GAME. Yes the learning curve is quite hard in the beginning but it pays out when you see your first aerial goal. Play it with your friends and you will laugh a lot!,Rocket League®
2016-12-09,0,0,931,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the most amazing competitve game that I have ever played. You start out just trying to make contact with the ball and trying to score any goal you can. Later on you will see someone fly in the air and hit the ball. You will then dedicate 100 hours perfecting hitting the ball in the air. Just when you have perfected this you find out you can turn your car in the air. 200 hours later you can hit the nastiest freestyles in the game but your positioning is terrible and you find yourself not being able to rank up. You will then dedicate your life to competitve and become a GOAT. The constant progression makes the game never feel stale and gives you new self made goals each step of the way. Ban Neo Tokyo from your map pool trust me you wont regret it. 10/10 IGN,Rocket League®

2017-07-25,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,BEST. GAME. EVER.Okay okay ONE OF the best games ever. It is just such awesome fun. EDIT (2018) I did like this game and to be honest it is still a great game but OMG the community that plays are the WORST!CONSTANT people dropping out of ranked matches. There is apparently no penalty for doing so because it seems to happen in every match I get into.The worst matchmaking system in existence. Every game you get paired with people who either can't hit the ball or who seem to be able to fly around the arena without touching the floor once.It is INFURIATING! All I want to do is play the game with people of similar skill to myself so I can learn how to improve.They've got their loot box system in order though! That is faultless. Doesn't matter if the game is a good experience as long as they can hook those whales.,Rocket League®
2018-01-21,0,0,1283,False,Recommended,It is one of those games where the concept seems so simple and almost boring yet when you play the game it all makes sense. It is literally football (soccer if you're american) with cars that just happens to have rocket boosters at the back of them. It might not be for everyone so you're either gonna just play it for a few hours and then never touch it again or you're gonna play until your controller breaks (mine did).,Rocket League®

2015-08-06,0,0,49,False,Recommended,Unexpectedly fun.,Rocket League®
2015-08-06,0,0,23,False,Recommended,The premise for Rocket League is as simple as soccer you control a car on a pitch and are trying to get the ball into the opponent's goal while attempting to prevent them from getting the ball into your goal. What make the game incredible and a great deal of fun is the craziness that ensues when trying to accomplish this feat. Cars can drive up walls rocket through the air power slide and blow each other up in pursuit of the ball which often seems to have a mind of its own as it bounces around the arena.A large amount of cosmetic unlockables are awarded as you continue playing but you won't need any motivation to keep queuing up for another game even if you happen to be coming off a tough loss. The game is even better with friends as the built in voice chat can allow for strategy and showering praise on each other for great shots epic saves and more. It's some of the most fun I've had in a long time and it is absolutely worth a purchase.,Rocket League®

One of the things I love most about this game is that the only determining factor in your skill level is the amount of time you spend playing. Everyone is on equal footing (in terms of gameplay) whether you've played for one hour or a thousand. It's also the only game that has ever made me want to be a part of the community between looking for the perfect teammates and item trading. I really can't say enough about this game.

Though it is actually better to play with the gamepad I've been practicing with keyboard and mouse and have been doing very well. There aren't many bugs or glitches in this game which is great and rocket league is always consistent on updating the game if there was. So in all this is a great game to play solo or multiplayer but I much rather prefer to play multiplayer with a friend since you can coordinate more and it is just a lot more fun.,Rocket League®

2016-01-24,0,0,490,False,Recommended,This review is a comparison from the previous game. i've played super rocket powered acrobatic battle cars (long name) and loved it. This game however improved a lot in diferent aspects one of the most funniest games in steam AL bots are better they now can enter in online games no more handicap games (they can score amazing goals against noobs). Customize i like the ideia to create your own car You dont need controller to play this keyboard is fine i do hat tricks all the time believe me (but if u want to do some serious gaming i recommend it) Dont waste time u can do stuff while waiting for a match.Unfortunately theres cons they removed some great stuff from SRPABC but can be patched No Auto goals (theres lots of people who deserve humilation award ) Reward medals at the end of each game. The only award avaible is the MVP award they removed best wingman goal keeper and more... (its always good to have a shelf full of awards)medals can improve moral and performance. its scietific fact All the maps have the same format the previous game had funny maps. i would like to see this in a patch some day but i dont know if its possible. the old maps are great. i think its all i dont remember any more details have fun.,Rocket League®

2016-12-22,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of the most fun games I've been able to pick up and play. You can play with either a controller or keyboard. Being mostly a keyboarder I was surprised how much easier the game is on a controller. There is a definitely a skill wall that you'll need to overcome when it comes from learning how to get your car to fly. That skill alone will allow you to stop way more shots. There are a slew of different game types where the mechanics of the game as well as the sheer gameplay changes allowing for all skill levels and ages. The rankings (Beginner Expert Pro) don't make any sense. They should be based off your individual statistics (Shots on goals assists etc) but they are merely based on time/wins.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,598,False,Recommended,This game has captivated me moreso than League of Legends did in Season 3. With 454 hours in it right now I can say without question that this game is very unique and backed by a great dev team that provides frequent updates and listens to the fanbase. Additionally it has a fast growning eSports scene as well. Above all though my favorite thing about this game is its high skill ceiling. With practice and real dedication you can pull off absolutely jaw dropping moves and dazzle your opponents. Highly recommended I would have still bought the game had it have been $60 new.

There are some problems though sometimes when I try to search a game it takes ages and the point system in competetive got weirder than ever ( *IMO* ). But the game also has a lot of ups aswell. I really love the amount of edits you can do on your vehicle (Maybe a little more presets and it will be perfect) is really stunning the gameplay is really smooth and you can change a lot of settings.

Crimp edges and prick the bottom all around with a fork.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 degrees C).Gently tuck parchment paper or aluminum foil on top of the dough and pour about a cup of dried beans or pie weights on top.Bake until golden brown (about 20 minutes).Remove pie weights and let cool then brush the bottom with milk.Completing the Butterscotch Cinnamon PieYou will need 1/4 cup butter2 cups whole milk1 cup heavy cream1/2 + 1/4 cup brown sugar2 tablespoons water9 egg yolks3 tablespoons corn starch2 teaspoons cinnamon1 baked pie shellWhip creamInstructions Brown the butter in a small sauce pan (heat until bubbles stop and there is a nutty aroma).Heat milk and heavy cream on medium until the edges form bubbles.Heat 1/2 cup brown sugar with water on medium until the bubbles become slow and big. Reduce heat to low.Slowly whisk in brown butter and then the milk/cream mixture. If there are any caramel lumps raise heat until they are dissolved.In a bowl combine remaining brown sugar with yolks corn starch and cinnamon.While whisking stir in half the stove mixture into the bowl (this will prevent the corn starch from lumping).Pour everything back into the pot and raise heat to medium stirring constantly so the eggs do not scramble.Stir until mixture considerably thickens and adheres well on the back of your spoon.Whisk to ensure homogeneity then pour into pie shell.

2016-11-27,0,0,194,False,Recommended,You might think Rocket League is just RC car soccer.. well I mean it is.. and that's what you tell people who ask what the game is about... but it's also one of the most fun 'quick' match type games I've played. 5 minute matches make the match long enough to be considered a match without taking too much time. You can customize your car to fit your personal style your car does technically effect how you play but the aesthetics don't change a thing.. unless you're using the lame ones P But for serious this game is for you if you're looking for a fun match game that you can play with friends or by yourself! #rcSoccerIsMoreFunThanRealSoccer,Rocket League®

2015-07-16,0,0,16,False,Recommended,"This game is pure fun when played with friends and even chaotic at 4vs4. Your objective is to get the ball to the enemy's goal under 5 min using car just like a soccer game but with car. Sound simple but hard to master. As the play require skill and in depth understanding of how game mechanic work. You have to use advanced technique such as aeriel manuever boost management juggling and many amazing play that you can muster. You can choose from 1vs 1 2vs 2 3vs3 or 4vs4. Ranked match private lobby pub and local play is possible. And the best thing local play support splitscreen! Want to have fun in one monitor? No problem! Up to 4 player possible and 8 player can join through LAN.Customization lie solely on cosmetic and each car have no different in ability so they are balanced by the fact each player have to play with similar limit. The difference s only the hitbox of different car. So player skill play a major role here. With a lot of achievement trophy EXP based level up stat and leaderboard this game bring high replayability value and 'bragging right' among player and friends. You can exchange stat and be proud of your ""MAD SKILLZ"".just 3 days after release the competitive scene have an eye on the game.

Example for pro play can be seen here Link www.twitch.tv This game also released on PS4 and available for free for PS+ user this month. So get em! Currently cross platform support is being developed on the way. So expect more player to come when it is finished. The only problem this game has is server issue due to server overload. More than 10 000 player concurrently with limited server capacity due to dev budget make the server down a commonplace. Expect it to fixed later this year.All in all.

2015-07-12,0,0,5,False,Recommended,From what I've played this game is fantastic. There's a variety of different modes and it's a fun casual game to play when bored. However one aspect is infuriating if not game breaking. When a player leaves in the middle of a game there is an AI that plays in their stead. This would be fine if the AI acted like a normal player. The problem is players are very inaccurate and programmed inaccuracy can never be equal to the inaccuracies of human error. As a result the AI is either overpowered or terrible. I was playing a game and we scored in the first thirty seconds or so. A player on the enemy team left. The AI who replaced it proceeded to score five goals by the end of the game with it's teamates scoring zero goals and it blocking essentially every shot we took. I would most certainly recommend this game and I would most certainly recommend that if an AI is on the other team you should leave immediately.,Rocket League®

2015-07-12,0,0,18,False,Recommended,Coming from a somewhat simulation y background I didnt think this game would be very good. I thought it would one of those 0.1 hour games where you play it for 10 minutes and then forget about it in your steam library. I WAS WRONG. THIS GAME IS AMAZING. After doing some flight simulation which can be quite stressful or just coming back from work I can have a little fun and relax by playing some quick 5 minute carball games.Psyonix have nailed this game. They have succeeded where others have failed. They have managed to make a new style car game that is cross platform. There was nothing better than 1v1ing my friend who was on ps4 and winning to prove that PC MASTER RACE will always beat the console peasants. Pros fun cars quick (5 minute rounds perfect for small breaks at work xD) online (The servers on this game are amazing.

2015-07-12,0,0,123,False,Recommended,This game is literally worth every penny. I've never enjoyed a game so much with my friends since Smash Bros. The game is very simple and easy yet it takes a bit of skill to do a couple fancy tricks. The graphics are great not realistic but it fits the theme of the game perfectly. This game will make you laugh smile and especially freak out at all the goals you will make yet you had no idea how you did it. It'll be even more fun playing with your friends. You can set up a nice shot for your buddy to make or you can just touch the ball last to get the goal even though your friend did entirely the work. OR even better block his shot. However the only problem I do have is with the bots of the game. In online multiplayer if a player is missing in a team then a bot takes its place. And i have to say these bots are op as hell. They practically never miss and don't even need the rest of the team. Anyways it is an amazing game definitely worth every cent. Don't even wait for the sales.

2015-07-21,0,0,83,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is CS GO with its competitiveness/team driven game play without the stupid randomness and raging and with a more relaxed and laughable/enjoyable environment.I think when most people first seen this game they thought ""how can this basic game possibly be worth while and fun?"". But after just putting a couple hours into this game it is nothing but boring or lame it is refreshing! The game is fast paced and a blast. It takes a bit of time to get used to maneuvering and how to do everything and whatnot but that just makes it all the better. Like I said the game is refreshingly enjoyable A.K.A. not the same old crap. Props to Psyonix (Developer of Rocket League and Nosgoth and other games). They appear to be doing some great things. Rocket League and Nosgoth both are simple concepts but yet very fun games (Nosgoth just doesnt have enough playerbase unfortunately).

SOLD!Pros Solid and fun skill based gameplay. A very steady learning curve that will see you getting better the more you play. I have a fair few hours in this game and I am still learning. A large playerbase. Cross platform to both XBone and PS4 players (Although cross platform partying up isn't possible yet). Free content updates every few months with new features gamemodes arenas etc. Up to 4 player split screen for those who like local gaming with friends. Has a ranked matchmaking system and leaderboards for those who care about that sort of thing. Along with ranked rewards at the end of each season. Highly customisable cars. Free cars and ""Common""cosmetic items drop for you after every match until you unlock all of the base stuff. ""Uncommon"" and ""Rare"" items also have a chance of dropping too. Player trading for cosmetics too. (Only between players on the same platform). Private matches with editable mutators which are quite customisable and allow for some ridiculous matches. There is a single player tournament style mode against AI too.Cons Addicting.General notes Microtransactions in the form of the typical ""Crate and Key"" system containing cosmetics. DLC Cars are available to purchase too as another cosmetic option. Play this game with a controller for the best experience.",Rocket League®

2015-07-17,0,0,64,False,Recommended,This game is like crack cocaine with some caveats. One only play online. Playing the single player campaign while good for practice ends up being really boring and will over inflate how good you think you are. You aren't. Two server issues. I live in Asia and its a right nightmare having to deal with the ping when playing the US EU and Oceania servers. Especially in a game like this where it's extremely important to aim and line up your flight path with the ball (yes flight path. rarely do i find myself driving). Now that we're done with the bad what does this game do good? Its a simple game with simple easy to understand controls and straightforward gameplay mechanics. Normally this will make for a terrible boring game but in this case the game excels for one reason. Its incredibly difficult to master. You might watch Kronovi do some insane cross field aerial volley while going backwards and think ah that doesnt look to hard I can do that. And then you can't. And end up hitting an own goal instead. Goddamit Carl. Now I've wasted enough time explaining this game. TL DR if you're looking for a fun game with short rounds that you can just pick up and play and that has a burgeoning multiplayer scene this is for you.,Rocket League®

2016-07-15,0,0,208,False,Recommended,Bought this because it was on sale and I have friends that played it already. That said it is so much fun! There's a learning curve but it is by no means too steep. It is also great how innovative they were by allowing cross platform play (PCs playing with PS4s) although one slight improvement on that would be the ability to form parties with my friends that play on PS4. As is we have to make a private match to play together. That is my only complaint but I understand those kinds of things can be difficult to implement. UPDATE 1 I now have 54 hours logged. Haven't eaten or seen daylight for two whole day. Please send help. Also it's effing soccer/hockey with rocket powered cars PLUS the new power ups in rumble mode.

2016-02-18,0,0,443,False,Recommended,Edit 6/11/2016Game keeps crashing after 30 mins of gameplay... only game in my library that does this and it started after season two. Online killed this game. Especially rankedThis games community is absolutely awful. You own teammates will most likely be the main issue as they have been for me. If you hate preteens and kids who think they are God and threatening to kill you and let's not forget wannabe professionals who think yelling at other players in all caps even if that team is winning then you should stay away.This is no doubt a fun game. The community though has made me reconsider it though. Single player is almost nonexistent. I'm serious. The day you get this game is the day you're done with playing offline. You'll get online and then realize how thick the demise is in the community. If you find anyone decent you'll need to friend them and hope that they will always play with you... until you want to see how good you compare against others.... onto ranked mode... see what happened there?Since this game is 10% offline and 90% online I can't truly recommend this game because how bad it is playing with people (ranked or not).0 Game changed on ranked and even online. All the major A holes left or decided to grow up. Much more enjoyable. YAY! And this season hasn't crashed like before (Season 3),Rocket League®

2016-05-11,0,0,37,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game is incredibly fun. Only feature I've found myself wishing was in the game is the ability to spectate online matches but I guess there's Twitch and such for that. The AI feels a little ""weak"" to me at least the lower levels. Not that it should be harder but Rookie will score on their own goal regularly and Pro only seems to mostly hit the ball anywhere on the wall where the goal is... but I think most people know that online is the real draw anyway. The AI is good for learning basics at any rate.",Rocket League®

2016-04-24,0,0,82,False,Recommended,Easy to learn difficult to master. Do the tutorials to learn the basics of driving jumping and maneuvering the ball then refine your moves in free play. Apparently you can fly if you time for jumps and boosts correctly. Practice your jumping I can't stress this enough. Practice your boost management. Practice driving on the walls. Practice using the ball camera wisely. Then jump into a match. I found the matchmaking to be pretty decent. As a rookie or semi pro I wasnt ever matched with anyone higher than that. I tend to play late at night when all the vulgar kiddies have been tucked in and read their stories so not alot of toxicity. It's an online game as with all things online there will be trolls. Played this on the free weekend and had a blast. The price tag isn't too steep ($20)Lots of fun if you don't take it (or yourself) too seriously.,Rocket League®

2016-09-23,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Nice and fun casual game. Even as a person who doesn't like sports type games I found and still do find this game enjoyable. The devs also continue to add new content to it and with its low price it's a good buy. Tons of customizations and cars some of the cars are dlc that must be paid for but they give no advantage to the player. New game modes have been added such as hoops (basketball) and a hockey like mode. It's a good fun casual game that you don't have to invest a ton of time in but if you want to just play something for fun for an hour or two. Fun game and worth every penny in my opinion.,Rocket League®

2015-07-23,0,0,8,False,Recommended,Wacky chaotic kinetic fun. Essentially this game is soccer with RC like cars that can jump slide and boost. A fantastic choice for a LAN party game. One drawback I really wanted to try playing the 'season' mode with a friend but it appears to be only available for a single player vs bots. It would be nice if you could have multiple 'saves' so you can play a season with different friend(s) or by yourself.,Rocket League®
2016-04-24,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Just played for the free weekend. I like football (soccer) not terribly good at it IRL. Maybe because I don't run into people and blow them up in order to take control of the ball. But in Rocket League I can with a little rocket boost! Plus do crazy aerial stunts that I could only wish I had the skill to do IRL. This game makes me feel like I can rock at football! Haven't felt this good since I used to dominate the foosball table during our lunch break in high school! Since I don't have room for a foosball table in my apartment this will suffice.

2016-09-24,0,0,1044,False,Recommended,"The game feels unfinsihed and it should considering that the game was never meant to be (solely) about cars playing soccer. The ""mini game"" of soccer was just so popular among the development team that they abandoned the main game due to low interest. The ""physics"" work and are satisfying for what they are but there are no numbers accounting for the weight of an object. This is why things feel floaty and what allows for flight at the same rate as ground travel. Again not really an issue since the game works and the physics in place are satisfying. An engine accounting for real physics would likely not be much fun in this context. I recommend this game because it eventually gets fun when you learn to control your car and the ball with much more precision. The skill floor is incredibly unrewarding and if you're unfamiliar with the game you'll likely spend a lot of time just crashing into the ball hoping for the best. It's definitely more fun to play with friends whether that be competetive or not. So my recommendation is based on the fun you can have with friends and not so much anything else. Ranks are an unrewarding grind but that can be said of any game. Winning and seeing that green division up after four consecutive wins feels good but your next unlucky game causing a division down is disheartening. It's not that it's unfair losing is losing winning is winning and if you want to judge your skills accordingly you partner with someone you trust to be at an equal skill level and let come what may. The issue is the crapshoot of solo queue. Whether it be someone afk someone far above or below your skill bracket or someone assisting your/the enemy team. This isn't the fault of the developers or any systems in place it just exists and makes the game a less enjoyable experience.

2016-07-02,0,0,535,False,Recommended,So this game can be a LOT of fun when played with decent human beings. Unfortunately half the time you end up in games with people who continuously insult everyone including their own teammates (sometimes before the game even begins) spam simply stop playing without leaving outright sabotage their own team every possible opportunity or intentionally making everyone wait the full minute after the game before leaving (which is still better than them joining the next game right before the minute is up to just stand there and do nothing which also happens but not as often).I found that this negative behavior is especially prevalent on European servers. Sure there is an option to report them but from the looks of it this does not have any effect and if it does I don't even dare to think how the situation would be without it.Once you get matched with and against good people just stick with them otherwise you're guaranteed to leave the game annoyed. I suppose indirectly that's also the reason why the matchmaking has a hard time finding people of similar skill level a lot of the time.At the time of writing there also seem to be issues with the (SE) Asian servers since I have a friend over there that would rather play with a 300ms ping on a European or Middle Eastern server than joining one in their region where second long desyncs randomly start happening every few seconds.And then there's also the issue with family sharing smurf accounts trying to ruin it for newcomers. Seriously creating a new steam account just to score some easy wins for a change? Grow up.Overall a very nice product (virtually perfect actually) with some minor server issues but unfortunately an outstandingly bad community that totally ruins the game. Edit There's an option to completely disable chat now which makes the game a lot more enjoyable and the new rumble mode is pretty light hearted which is nice.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,1603,False,Recommended,This game is great in more ways then I can discribe. The core of the game is simple. It's soccer. It'd defies any borders or barriers. If two people know what soccer is and know how to play they can play together no matter what the circumstances. This simple premise makes the game easy to pick up and fun to play with anyone. It's so well polished that the game has a high enough skill cieling to keep people playing. There is always something more to learn more to perfect. It's easy to play hard to master and quick. Most games don't last more than 7 minutes so you can jump in and knock out a game and if you don't want to keep playing you can switch right inot something else. But you will want to keep playing. This game is simple addictive and incredibly fun.,Rocket League®

In game replay recorder (Just hit ""save replay"" after any match) Incredible visuals Controller support (The game suggests to use a controller but honestly the keyboard works perfectly. All preference)Game Cons Slight lag after letting go of the VoIP button (F) No punishment for players abandoning a match Reports of crashing/freezing while watching replays Has the chance of crashing/losing connection after a round if you're in a group and not the party leaderRelateable Games Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Power Battle CarsConclusionRocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game and i've already had so much fun with it.

It is truly my favorite game of all time I have racked up hundreds of hours on Xbox One and can now enjoy it on my new PC build and it still feels like it will never get old.It strikes the perfect medium between competitiveness and simple pleasure. You have the freedom to play stress free in social unranked matches or test your skills in competitive ranked.Everything from the visuals to the sound effects and music in this game are absolutely perfect and stunning.Psyonix has been an amazing dev team and truly cares about the community and what we want. They're constantly rolling out updates and new features (nothing that could possibly upset anyone or ""ruin"" the game in any way just more to enjoy).

2017-06-24,0,0,1202,False,Recommended,I cannot recommend this game enough. Yes I didn't play it much recently as I was busy with some Assassin's Creed and MGSV. But that's what's beautiful about it after you've played the game for some time you can just come back to it for a match or two. Won't talk too much of the constant work the devs put in adding new maps cars and even gamemodes every now and then to praise the overall entertaining gameplay which is as addicting as you've surely heard.Before you buy this game just note one thing singleplayer isn't all that fun. Yeah sure it's a bit of a challenge in the beginning but just like in Fifa the real deal and real fun is in multiplayer so you'll need an okay wifi connection.EDIT 3 months after this review was written. I play RL pretty regularly now. It gets really good when... well when you git gud and start scoring some awesome goal. Recommending it even more expressively than before.,Rocket League®
