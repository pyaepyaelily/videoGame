0,76563600,english,"SS4. I'll keep it seriously simple and short.

[h1]Heavily enjoyed:[/h1]
1) Soundtrack. 
Damjan Mravunac composed another brilliant album, this time merging idle parts with battle episodes. A solid focus is made on the chorus parts and drums.
An instant transfer to my playlist. I found myself often keeping one enemy alive just to enjoy the battle loop longer. =P

2) Humour. 
You wouldn't believe how much of it is in SS4! Seriously, played the first level and thought their jokes would remain solely for the first chapter. 
No! The team carried on mocking each other, Sam kept on exclaiming his classic quotes (there are more hilirious phrases during the loading screens).
And... OMG. The Granny with the bloody minigun! That's was seriously awesome!

3) Side-missions. 
To my surprise, they fit so naturally, so subtly into the linear gameplay, it would be a crime to miss one!

4) Shotgun. It was greatly done. The punchback, the sound, animation. I ran with it through half of the game, that much I loved it.

5) Gadgets. 
Unique and powerful accessories, however, few of these are too powerful e.g. Black Hole which sucks in the whole crowd, stays on for a long time and can clear the whole area w/o sweat.


[h1]Now, what seriously let me down.[/h1]

1) Not enough enemies! 
Half of the corridors, fields, cities are empty. Some chaos begins literally during last levels and don't last long.

2) There are episodes when you drive a giant mech. These are extremely short. :( 

3) Lack of content. 
Writing this after 2weeks since its release, there is only campaign mode, solo and cooperative. No survivals. No deathmatches. No CTF, Burdens, and other modes. 
Wish at least survivals will come back. 

4) Overall appearance is rough and ""meh"". 
I struggle to write this, but... to me SS3 BFE looks and plays a lot better. Doesn't mean SS4 looks poor. Let's say... number ""4"" assumes a significant jumps in quality, which is not the case.

[b]Summarising.[/b]
As a SS series fan, I greatly enjoyed the game. 
I can easily see myself replaying it for weapons and gadgets experiments, but I wouldn't recommend it to a new player, who never stabbed gnaars, ran away from ""AAAAA!"" or gathered kleers into one crowd for a cannon ball elimination.",1601075023,1602101483,True,4,0,0.578220844268798828,0,True,False,False,76561197993246947,482,15,898,898,868,1602103475,,

5,77180767,english,"I've been with this series since my brother got the first game with a new PC build, so I'm sad to say that this game really disappointed me. It's got everything that makes it look like a Serious Sam game - fun and impressive weapons, interesting monsters; but feels more like a Call of Duty clone with a Serious Sam paint job.

To me, Serious Sam has always been non-stop action with hordes of enemies to fight, but a lot of that is sacrificed to add more narrative. Your weapons get taken away from you for the sake of story, which only serves as a source of frustration. You are forced to fight along-side uninteresting NPCs that kill things for you, completely taking away from the power fantasy of being the lone hero the previous games had. Reading data entries on your various weapons and enemies feels more like a chore now instead of a nice break from the action, because you already have so many cutscenes to watch.

Credit where credit is due; the art direction is really well done. The music is a little cliche, but I prefer some heavy metal to go with my FPS games. Sam himself is still the same old Sam, with his one-liners and ""let's get it done"" mentality. So if you don't mind the changes, then give this game a go.

22,76694517,english,"tldr; Nothing like what SS should be. Combat is great but everything else seems rushed/unfinished/bland

Pros:
-Great combat and weapons
-Beautiful engine and the lighting is nice (when its not bugging out horribly)
-The monsters look great

Cons:
-Terrain is horribly simple along with the levels and cutscenes
-You can jump out of every level at almost every point and skip an entire section with little to no effort
-Glitchy as all hell and there are plenty of places where there are holes in walls, world drawing issues
-Storyline is completely unfitting/boring/bland

This game seems beyond rushed. It has almost nothing to do with the previous games. Mental (as a boss) is almost a complete afterthought. This franchise should have took the playful joking story that it did with its first two games and rode it out instead of trying to make this completely serious. (pardon the pun)
The levels are obnoxiously simple. Every couple walls you have the option of jumping over and out of the world. The secrets are hidden in places where you can achieve basically the same thing. It's almost like no one really tested this before releasing it. The combat is great and the monsters look it but there is simply too much dead open space that leads nowhere and it almost forces you to waste a lot of time looking for bland little secrets such as a small L.I.F.E. syringe.
As someone that used to play the first two games a lot and LOVED the franchise for its humor and its way of poking fun at stories FPS games have it's almost like they decided to take a complete opposite approach now. The game is full of reused simple walls with simple textures, boringly open landscapes that are again easily skippable and the running speed just seems insane in comparison.

26,77146650,english,"The same old Sam but with all seriousness, a bit more than I expected. 
The game is a fast-paced, weapon-flashing, and destroy-the-swarm type of first person shooter game that also delivers some great jokes and puns that make the game more fun to play. It is goofy, classic, and funny and it does not really try to fulfil or exceed the goals of the common First-person shooter games that are being released like Modern Warfare and Battlefield. It doesn't have very smart AI or incredibly structured and cutting-edge combat system like Crysis. In fact, the graphics are decent, the shooting is subpar and somewhat clunky, and the enemies might as well be vegetables. However, that is precisely why this franchise is loved by many, it is because it doesn't take itself too serious. Sam , the protagonist loves to shoot his guns, big or small, and obliterate hordes of weird creatures without wanting to crouch or take cover behind boxes as you do in Gears of War. Sam just doesn't care for any tactics or strategies. He picks and fires his entire arsenal of unique weapons while standing in front of a seemingly unending swarm of creatures. Each weapon is unique, and tailored to meet different conditions. During heavy skirmishes, Sam has to use explosive devices like the grenade launcher and RPG to clear space on the battlefield for other incoming enemies that must be picked out with more accurate, single-shot weapons such as the sniper rifle. The game further improves on the previous installments by introducing a brand new skill tree and the ability to dual-wield two-handed weapons, a dream come to true to many, especially those who liked the Wolfenstein games. Those who like Serious Sam and his witty one-liners will find a lot of playing value in this game, as there are many new things introduced in the game such as some new monsters, cool gadgets like grenades and a holographic device that explodes after luring enemies to it.

All we need to do is wait to fix all the problems.
Everything is gonna be ok.
When I started the game for the first time, i had a huge mental breakdown cringe. I said to the Gnaars once they were spawned on level 2 ""Gypsiiiiiiiessss!!!"" then i shot multiple times on Kenny.

ALRIGHT here's my honest opinion because i've been retarded for years

The Graphics are fine for me but it needs to be optimized and because this is the first open world of serious sam , dont expect to be 
very well optimized(this will take some time to fix this). And I also do belive that they will add more side missions,DLCs,gamemodes soon idk.(And iknow that i sound like a fanboy)

The Cutscenes (on COOP only) are kinda buggy sometimes.
If the game was from the beginning ""Early Access"" they would understand that is still in progress. 

One thing that I dont like is Rodriguez sounds like a Text to Speech on that  cutscene with Colosseum when Mr.Ston kills the giant enemy spider.

The Soundtracks sound very nice i dont get it why some people hate the soundtrack:/

The Facial Animations hope the will fix for those who complain about this not only on the cutscene but also in the gameplay.:/

The ""Skill system"" is fascinating and I'm glad that they finally brought back the Vehicles(motorcycle,ATV,Tractor,""Papamobile"").
 
The Chainsaw launcher is very useful when you're on trouble with ""Huge enemies"" like Demon,helicopter, ""cacodemon"" who spits acid and tracks on you.

Iknow that they did some hot fixes to be playable this game but i was trying to say that i want the same performance as ""Serious Fusion"" because i get like 100-200-300 fps.(maybe im exaggerating but hope you get it what i mean and what i want exactly).

Atleast the gunplay and the animation of guns are good and the Upgrades.

34,77139761,english,"TL;DR: So... Basically its like the third one but with more stuff. You liked BFE? You'll like this one, they kept all the old stuff and pretty much everything the added is optional.

There's now skill tree, third of which is rather boring stat buffs, but those are in their own branch on the side and doesn't really getting in a way of learning more interesting things, overall, good optional side thing to spice up your gameplay if you want to.
Vehicles are back. Some are just a mean of transportation, some are a bit more. Overall, good change of pace from just walking on your two.
Also, in some missions you will have companions, that are actually fighting. Third one always wigled away from having someone fighting alongside you so closest thing to a companion was automated minigun in the middle of a field. And now having an actula companion feells... A bit weird. But don't worry that they'll make the game too easy, they are helpfull, but not too much, it seems that they managed too keep balnce between companion doing nothing and companion doing everything quite well. They also speak a bit for somethion to listen to while walking to next shootout or checking every corner for loot. There's also quite a variety in them.
Another addition is sidequests, most of the time, nothing too fancy, fight through to there, then back, couple of lines of dialogue, maybe a cutscene, and, of course, a reward (which is shown on a marker to it so if only interested in prize you can decide if it worth it beforehand). Usually if not reward, then at least the cutscene will be interesting, so overall they are very well executed side ting to do.
What else... Oh, yeah, gadgets. To be honest, i only ever used a couple of them so i might not be in a position to give them a fair review.  The thing is, aside from one that is basically a portable healthpack everything else is very scarce so i were always doubting if this is a time to use it and ending up dealing without it. I tried one of them once and it turned out to be a screen cleaner that goes for about half a minute, making it feel like saying ""i give up, remove this pack and let me go to the next one"",  and the rest of the game went without me feeling like using it. There are other gadgets that seem to be less OP but there still were too few of them for me to feel free to play with so i ended up barely touching that side of game.
Rather minor thing which i, however, really liked is all those radiobroadcasts you were luistening on radios here and there, not that i'm realy competent in talking about those things but i think it were building quite a good atmosphere. Still doubtiong if my word really should be listened here, i'll also say that i think story and characters overall is quite good, manging to keep balance between stupid (in a good way) and serious.
And there's also a lot of change in scenery, as now you get to travel quite a bit across the globe allowing for much more variety oposing to third being restricted to Egypt.

As for negatives, i encountered quite a number of graphycal glitches, although, nothing that made game unplayable, and couple of times (3, if i remember correctly) some enemies AI just broke.",1602009327,1602009327,True,2,1,0.521513283252716064,1,True,False,False,76561198024159992,84,2,2251,2251,2251,1602000022,,

Anyhow

This game has the fastest gun play I've played in a while, hearing the hordes of enemies screaming right behind your head as you're running away to survive is very gut wrenching. This game is HARD, and i love it.

My only real complaints is is the disappointing utilization of vehicles, there are big empty roads that i would REALLY wish they would just give me a bike. There is a lack of features, such as split-screen and survival mode, in which previous games had.

This game is definitely not finished, but that doesn't mean they are not updating and listening to fans or reviewers.

Anyhow I strongly recommend this game. This game has the most enemies, the most ridiculous weapons and enemies, beautiful graphics and the best enemy designs (love the gnaars!) and some of the side-quests are ridiculous!",1601312377,1602000970,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198242342814,101,9,1574,1574,1460,1602016117,,

Sound appealing? Cause that's what the entirety of the Serious Sam series has been for decades, and this game continues the tradition and turbocharges it with even bigger guns, a wider variety of crazy aliens to shoot, and levels that are even more massive than before. (Yeah, I know. You'd think they'd reach the limit by now?) New additions include side-quests for gadgets that range from the game's own version of the Holo-Duke to crystalized Black Holes, the ability to dual-wield everything (Yes, everything), and weapon mods that provide interesting alternate firing modes to classic guns. By the time you are fully decked out, you'll have quite the number of tactical choices to consider in each battle, and will be tearing through the hordes with style and panache.

And if it doesn't sound appealing? Well... you will probably get annoyed by some of the game's shortcomings. The massive levels sometimes feel like more of a tourist trip with occasional shooting than a grand quest to save the planet. The game's attempt at writing will probably have you mash the skip cutscene button a lot, and the term ""Eurojank"" best sums up the physics you'll encounter.

So, in short, buy this only if you liked previous Serious Sam games.",1601996567,1601996567,True,3,0,0.543362736701965332,0,True,False,False,76561198050749385,164,40,1373,1373,1373,1601994848,,

40,76548761,english,"I regret pre-ordering it. i really do. I fear that even after 1-2 years of polishing it down, even if Croteam will do such a thing, core gameplay and level design problems wont go away. Disaster.

Ok, so after some thought and more hours inside game, i decided to expand my review, and boy, where do even start. . .

1) Level Design
My biggest disappointment. Why? Because TFE and TSE were legendary level-wise. Yes, sure, TFE took place in Egypt and only in Egypt, but you got this ""moments"" like night in Karnak, and bloody sunset over Valley of Kings. TSE was way better tho, different environments, traps that defy physics and logic, bouncing walls, pits of spikes, cylinder fight with beatiful gravitation trick. 

But what do you see in SS4? Well, copypasted buildings that lead from one boring corridor to another boring corridor, masked as ""city"". Tis not even about outdated, straight out from 2011-2012 visuals. No. Even textures are not where they should be. You look at this copypasted building, and you see missing parts, like door is not there, instead, flat, black, square shaped darkness. You press on, and then you get to Talos Principle rip off location.. Unlike TP tho, textures and walls and objects from puzzle game are just not working well enough for shooter decoration. But you know what happens next? After you reach the end of Talos-location, they spin you 180, and now you must go back, for another hour, but, oh look, now the area from 5-year-old-game is lit on fire with magma chunks in some parts. Wow. 

2) Gameplay
Yes, gunplay is good and fast. New usable items are fun enough, tho cycling through them mid-combat is a complete trash. Old weapons are looking great and sound design is also good but... the damage is not there. I cant explain it, but it feels like they nerfed standart versions of weapons. Perhaps to balance out akimbo skills? Which is fine, i guess, but then again, choosing hardest difficulty setting and then not one-shoting Kleer with good old shotgun in 95% of situations is just painful for a longstanding fan as myself. Mods for the guns are a worthy addition, but it feels like 90% of them are straight from Doom 2016. Like, cmon, hold right click to lock on targets with rocket launcher and then send multiple auto-aimed rockets? Grenade that splits to 5 smaller fragments? You need to come up with your own stuff, Croteam.

Optional quests and quests as a system... i just... i just do not want to talk about it. And QUEST MARKERS, in the game like SS? With goddamn tracker on ground, cmon. 

3) Sound and music
Godlike, actually. Ingame sounds are ok'ish, but music is handbanging as ever. All hail Damjan Mravunac.

4) Performance 
Bad. Just bad. I hope they'll fix it tho, in time. All the crashes and low fps framerate will go away. For now tis a major issue.

In the end, the game feels like it still needs 2 years of development. I have no idea why we are getting this release at this point in time. The game is undercooked, take it back into the oven, put an Early Access tag on it. You cant just take 50% of assets from Talos Principle, including walls, columns, buildings, clone it 50-70 times, mix around and call it a day.

Sam has a lot more personality and the story is way more cinematic and linear than i was expecting, sadly the story is pretty pointless, the only reason to watch the cutscenes is to hear the jokes, which are funny.

Serious Sam 4 is a heavily flawed, but worthwhile game. I'm going to go through its positives before I get to its negatives. 

Pros - 
-Gunplay still holds up real well. 
-Skill point system is a welcome addition.
-Enemies have more variation.
-Overall gameplay feels solid.
-Soundtrack is pretty decent, if a bit repetitive at times. 
-Graphics are decent, but not generally impressive for the poor performance that usually comes with it. 

Cons - 

-Heavily un-optimised at the time of review. I managed to get a somewhat workable performance with my 1080ti by turning off parallax, and setting SSAO to low in settings. Those two seem to have the largest impact for me. 
-Almost everything about the cut-scenes. The writing, animation, the ""death gaze"" stares from the characters. 
You can get away with one if you do one of the others well, but in this case, it's hard to enjoy them or take any of the characters ""seriously"". It does pick up a little in quality late game for some reason, but golly gosh are a lot these scenes difficult to watch. 
-The scenery has a lot of ""fade-in, fade-out"" geometry that's very noticeable, even on higher settings. I'd actually have preferred to disable all non-essential geometry altogether if I could have. 

So, my general rundown: 
The game is great where it matters. You don't go into an FPS for the story, you go into it for the gameplay, and with that, SS4 delivers. 
It may fall flat on its face with almost every other aspect, but at least it will likely be patched over time with updates. ",1601148678,1601926792,True,0,0,0.409313350915908813,0,True,False,False,76561198041953994,1109,17,1423,1423,1404,1602017961,,

I give it a thumbs up since Ive loved this game since First Encounter and it never fails to make me enjoy it.

However,
i feel like they sometimes try a bit to hard to make jokes...they don't need to improve on SS3, they only need to stay the same.
game is very graphic intensive and my 1070ti need to run it on medium to get anywhere.
there are a few bugs that need to be ironed out, some of which kinda affect combat ability where dual weapons get stuck and you only get to use one.
i also feel like this game makes me feel nothing for the side characters.... its a bit late to be introducing them now, since SS4 plays off before SS3 and SE1 and SE2 is after SS3.... it kinda makes you not care for those side characters which i feel is a real waste.

75,77054225,english,"+2 points for the Legion system, the unique strength of this game as a shooter

-1 point for barely using the Legion system, and instead just largely doing things the series has already done. This feels like Sam 3: The Second Encounter

+1 for being similar to Sam 3 though, it was easily my favorite of the series

+2 points for the basic gameplay and how it feels-- shooting, things being shot

+1 point for new enemies, visually distinct and well thought-out

-1 point for a few enemies being disproportionately dangerous, and so, despite the variety of threats,  80% of your deaths will be due to the same handful of enemies time and again. The Reptiloids in particular are a Scrappy-Doo-like presence here, just taking over the scene completely whenever they show up

+1 point for the faster double shotgun

+1 point for dual-wielding weapons

+1 point for making dual-wielding and other techniques optional

(-1 point for not bringing back the sledgehammer from Sam 3, if you liked the sledgehammer)

-1 point for so many secrets requiring pixel-perfect jumping on tiny ledges in a game engine specifically known for terrible platforming. It's not fun, so why is it in the game? 

+1 point for the special items, good variety and fun to use

-1 point for the tedious-at-this-point  trope of a level where you lose all your items, including your carefully stockpiled special items

+1 point for the auto-detect settings working properly

-1 point for the combination of a game with lightning-fast gameplay and a game engine with texture pop-in (see also: Doom 2016)

+1 point for the usual in depth graphics options you get from Croteam

-1 point for bugs, especially the random slow-loading you get when reloading a save

-2 points for the writing. I had such high hopes when I heard Croteam had brough back one of the two writers from The Talos Principle to work on this game, as I imagined that would mean we'd finally get Sam gameplay with some proper narrative and dialogue, but god help us all I guess the other Talos writer was the good one because this is just the usual idiotic non-narrative full of non-characters and non-dialogue, but in this case turned up to 12 because... I don't know. Maybe nobody working there has a sense of humor and hasn't read a book or seen a movie in the past 40 years, because that's sure how it feels. Too many characters, none of them well-defined or even introduced properly. Too many cutscenes, none of them good or interesting. Too much dialogue, none of it written in any way at a professional level. This game feels like it was written by a clever high-schooler who is excited at the closest he'll ever come to writing an action movie. The comeback to all this is ""who cares about the writing in a Serious Sam game?!"" But the comeback to that is ""Exactly! So why the hell is it in there?? Why the hell is there so much godawful narrative when nobody cares to begin with? Why did they spend so many resources on it when the game overall feels about 80% finished? Why is this game like a car with no roof but 15 glove compartments??"" Imagine if the original Doom had terrible cutscenes between every level-- it would take a lot of the lustre right out of it. Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing, especially if you have nothing to say and should also be busy working on level design

-1 point for the game feeling 80% finished, with gaps and blank spaces everywhere. So many times you expect a huge fight and... just nothing happens. So many Buildings You Can't Go In, in the worst video game tradition. So many empty streets. So many gaps and blank spaces 

+1 in advance because they're Croteam so you know they'll be patching the game for the next five years, but you wish they wouldn't have to

-1 point for this game not playing to its strengths. It's a Croatian developer making intense action games for the US and probably Russian markets, but it's filled with cutscenes in France with people doing bad accents and dialogue written by an absolute amateur instead of more or better levels. FFS, ditch the pretenses of the whole Game Makers Wishing They Were Making a Movie thing that everyone thought was tiresome 20 years ago and just be authentic. Be yourselves. The irony is that they are capable of making an original, spontaneous, and successful game with terrific writing (The Talos Principle), but how it's possible to have previously done that and then cobble together this idiotic mess (relatively speaking) is beyond me

-1 point, to that end, for the godawful budget ripoff of ""Born to be Wild,"" though the actual song would have been only marginally better. Why is it in there? Because they are at best action movie box-ticking, or at worst doing what they think people expect instead of being authentic. Does nobody at Croteam like any bands? Why didn't you use that music? That song epitomizes what's wrong with this game. That song IS this game: a worse version of something else for no good reason. Everyone likes at least one indieband who would license you their songs for a pittance, but not Croteam I guess

Final score: the math says 1 point, but I mean it's not *really,* it's better than that. But as a production it sucks. If you care about game writing, it sucks, and the writing is front and center and in your face, so one has to evaluate the things that stick out the most. If you just like action, it's there and it's a couple weekends of fun, probably on the level of 7/10. I don't regret buying it because I like the developer and am happy to support them, but this game needed another year in another oven. It's disappointing/10.  

I know they're indie, I know that Croatia has a terrible tax treaty with the US so they lose 30% of their US sales, but life in the arts is terrible for absolutely everyone right now so either everyone gets a free pass or no-one does. Frankly you can get good writers for less money *because* things are so desperate for artists right now, so what's the excuse for this game consisting solely of stock phrases and cliches daisy-chained together like everyone who's playing it is eight years old? And over the horizon lumbers the looming, one-eyed hulk of ""Wanting To Appeal To A Broader Market.""

Its only objectively good points are gunplay and OST in my opinion. Everything else looks out of place.

The game presents large maps that feel empty for the first half of the game, there arent enough enemies, the legion system was a marketing lie. The game tries to cater to old school hardcore FPS, yet it features reload and sprinting, two unwelcome additions that break the flow and feel unfitting given the naturally fast pace of its battles.

The game still has secrets for the completionists to find, but be aware that exploring too much and going too far might get you stuck out of bounds with no way of returning, this happened to me and my friends in some missions (in special, ""The four horseman of apocalypse""). 

My experience with the game revolved around collision glitches, ""out of memory"" crashes,  invisible textures, and a few nice battles here and there. Finished the game will uninstall, and thats it. Wait for more patches or get it very cheap.

Knowing which type of enemy you need to destroy first and using the right weapon is key to winning. Planning for encounters is key and that makes the game so much deeper and more fun. If you want a casual experience then this game can do that on the lower difficulties but I recommend playing on atleast hard if you have any experience with fps games. The game however does not take itself to serious and you will have a good laugh while playing it. Only issue I have with the game is the melee kills. The melee mechanic seems to be very rough and you should only use it when enemy charges right at you. If the melee mechanic would be on par with Doom's melee mechanics then the game would be close to perfect.
The change in setting is also a welcome one. Serious Sam 3 was mostly set in a desert which gets boring really fast. Serious Sam 4 have plenty of diffrent settings which is appreciated.

There are tons of large areas and tons of enemies in them to shoot. Ammo felt scarce at first but got way better as the game went on.

You don't have to do a perfect play through to find all the weapons, there are multiple weapons resets and finding new weapons you missed is common.

What drags it down a lot though is the performance and level design. Near launch there were a lot of technical issues and crashes. Half of the campaign is honestly kind of boring to run through, there are moments that are pretty fun but they are surrounded by dull and empty terrain. I'm honestly looking forward to a level editor at some point so that community made maps can fill in the void.

Making quick decisions on what weapon to use, how to approach the fight, where to move to avoid enemy attack and when to use gadgets is so much fun!

There is also some skills you can unlock. I was scared it's gonna ruin combat but it actually transforms it in an interesting way. You can upgrade your self so you can dual wield every weapon in game or take over and ride enemies!

------------------------------------------------

[ EDITED ]

Now that I've played quite a bit more in the game now, this is definite my money well spent. The game is absolutely CRAZY and in a good way as well.

Some perk in this game is actually insane, specifically dual wielding. If you play co-op with infinite ammo, there are lots of craziness to behold. Dual grenade is like one of the most hilarious and satisfying thing ever.

Perk like riding the bull just add up to more craziness especially with friends. 

The game gradually becomes much more like Serious Sam game in later stage, some level really reminds me of the 2nd encounter even.

[b]Just to be clear for this review.[/b] I played this game in its entirety on a completely shi*ty computer that does not meet this game's system requirements, I did some of my own tweaks and got the game running at 30fps. 

[u]So unfortunately the Visuals and Performance is going to be extremely invalid in this review.[/u]

[u][b]First off the Story,[/b][/u] If you know the Serious Sam games like I do, you know the story isn't that good in any of the games. It's self aware, it has some good and bad jokes and some hilariously bad cutscenes that were motion-captured. I would say that some of the characters that bring out one-liners and puns is downright awful but it's not distracting. Overall the story is just meh.

[u][b]The Gameplay is Fantastic,[/b][/u] it doesn't reach the peak of the Second Encounter but it's above the First Encounter in my opinion. There is some new weapons and some ""equipment"" ([i]thats what I call them[/i]) which are really useful to get yourself out of tight situations or if your just lazy. 

And just like I said in my Serious Sam Fusion review, the gameplay wraps around with [i]""Dancing with your Enemies""[/i]. [u]You need to know what weapons to use in certain encounters which means you'll be doing a lot of experimenting, knowing how the enemies behave, and their attack patterns and sound cues.[/u] [i]These are what makes Serious Sam's gameplay so fun[/i], [b]and if you're going in this game like a Blind Monk and not utilizing your weapons properly you're not going to have a good time.[/b]

TL;dr;
* The colour palette in certain parts are really questionable, making it kinda hard to see enemies at times. Something I never thought I'd say about SS.
* The lighting makes some parts of the game incredible frustrating to play, similarly to above.
* I don't mind new content/enemies but some things like long-distance snipers slow the pace down a little while I feel is a poor gameplay choice. This is a game where you pump up the music and just run around smashing bajillions of enemies. You shouldn't really need to stop and smell the roses to snipe people - too much.

 Pros +
+ The guns feel and sound better than ever and there's more guns to choose from then ever before
+ Gameplay is great with tons and tons of enemies on the screen at once
+ Soundtrack is good but sadly it's not as good as past games in the series
+ New additions like duel welding weapons feels nice and can be a real game changer at times
+ Gadgets such as the crystallized black hole and Time Warp are amazing and can let you just shred enemies
+ Enemies new and old are here and they are fun to fight and lots of them look well detailed

 Cons 
- I think the biggest issues for this game atm is performance and texture pop ins, My specs are above the recommended specs but i still had frame rate drops during bigger fights so i think it has more to do with optimization and i had a few crashes
- Have had enemies get stuck in places and had to go hunting to find the final one
- Human character models look decent but they are stiff and lack a lot of animation as well as the fact they all have weird looking eyes and hardly blink
- Melee executions in the game feel kinda lackluster with 90% of them just being Sam stabbing them with a Knife so no more ripping Gnar eyes then throwing it and such
- Some of the new skills you can learn feel useless while others feel like a must to have or you're gonna have a rough time
- The parts of the game that takes place indoors such like the Oil rig level look really bland and have real poor lighting

The guns are great, smooth (when it doesn't hitch like crazy, which is frequent even after updating) The voice acting is alright, but sometimes they will not stop talking during combat which is very frustrating to listen to. The cut scenes are silent compared to gameplay, which is very frustrating and for some reason effects volume is what controls the cut scene audio. Not voice volume. 

The technical issues destroy this game, and if they delayed it another month or two, would have likely not made me regret my purchase like I currently do. 3900x, 32GB 3600Mhz ram, 5700xt, playing in DX11. The game has awful stuttering, pop in loading issues in every area and during every single cutscene. It's so distracting that it ruins all immersion and feeling of badassery that Serious Sam should have. 

Currently with these rampant issues, the game is a 3/10. I would not purchase it, or suggest anyone to purchase in its current state. It is borderline unplayable with how severe some of these issues are. Texture loading in late, areas of the game which you can fall out of and get trapped forcing a reload of your save. The game will go minutes with smooth fps over 100, but then fall to 60 or less during intense combat with hitching occurring every minute or so. 

It is a disgrace that croteam launched it in its state, Devolver Digital seems like a good publisher, hopefully they didn't pressure them into releasing it unfinished. 

If you're curious about purchasing, wait 6 months and catch a sale. 

TLDR; Good gameplay, good enemies, funny one liners, decent story, horrible technical issues, game isn't worth purchasing yet.

60,76984832,english,"In some ways, this is the best Serious Sam game ever made. In others, it's flawed. How you'll feel about it depends on what your preferences and tolerances are. Its strengths are mostly in the gameplay and some aspects of the presentation, its weaknesses are in the technical side of things and, well, other aspects of the presentation.

Let's lay it out.

Graphically the game is uneven, it has really gorgeous vistas, good enough enemy models, some particularly amazing assets amongst the so-so ones, but also really bad areas (indoor rooms, or the entirety of the canal in the french town level). Overall I would say though that it's quite pleasing to the eye, even on medium settings. If you don't require your games to be as visually spotless as the best AAA game on the market, you should be fine. Though maybe watch the cutscenes with people talking while squinting your eyes. Trust me.

The soundtrack in my opinion starts off a bit generic and boring, but picks up about halfway through the game and never lets go again. And even the first half has some great moments in its music. It definitely enhances the intensity and drama of what's happening around you, and is generally just really nice to hear. Personally I've been listening to certain tracks on repeat for days now.

And let's get this out of the way. The performance ain't that great on some people's machines, but as I mentioned before, this game doesn't really lose much on the medium graphical settings, and besides, there's always a chance it will be gradually patched. Be aware: updating your drivers can help. It helped me a lot. Apart from the performance, there are some bugs and errors in the game. It can crash, or you can get trapped in some unintended place in a level. It's quite easy to parkour looking for a potential secret and end up in a place you can't escape from or simply just out of bounds. The latter is fun, though.

Now the most important thing, and what elevates this game to the best entry in the series for me: the gameplay. It starts out as slow as any other SS game does (and don't trust those people who claim that any SS game ever started with a bang right off the bat - each one's beginning levels are slow and unexciting, getting you used to the feel of things). But then it gets going, and boy does it get going. Please note: I am strictly speaking about the experience of playing on the Serious difficulty, a.k.a. the best way to play Sam games (which is of course subjective but I strongly believe it myself). You get amounts of enemies that we've never seen in the biggest fights of the previous games. You get exciting new enemy types that introduce new elements to the combat. You get combinations of enemies in fights instead of giant waves of a single type. You get amazing weapons that are stronger than ever before, which you can DUAL-WIELD if you go into that upgrade path (did I mention there's a small upgrade tree? Go into dual-wielding, you'll thank me). This game makes Sam stronger than ever before and then throws so much crazy combat at you that you're probably gonna be challenged like never before too. Some of the bigger and crazier fights are optional, but give you single-use gimmicky gadgets as rewards. The gadgets can let you cheese an annoying fight or escape a dire situation. Nothing compares to running away from a hundred or so kamikazis, throwing out the time slowdown, turning around and finally blasting them all apart. To sum up, the combat is crazier than ever, and I genuinely have no idea how Croteam would top this in a future Sam game. Maybe they'd have to actually make the Legion system work.

Anyway, this has become a bit long.

The TL;DR is: this game is the most Serious Sam that Serious Sam has ever been, which includes both the great stuff (combat!) and the not-so-great (the sort of jank that comes from not having an AAA budget or studio).",1601752586,1601752586,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198057507658,605,15,1936,1936,1918,1601823538,,

71,76976146,english,"This one is tough, because it isn't near perfection like previous entries (in my opinion). I have been a fan since Serious Sam came into the world in 2001 and have been a fan ever since. I have even played the spin-offs and enjoyed most of them. If I had to order them from best to worst, it would be in this order:
1. Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter
2. Serious Sam Classic: The Second Encounter
3. Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter
4. Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter
5. Serious Sam 2
6. Serious Sam: The Next Encounter
7. Serious Sam 3: B.F.E.
8. Serious Sam 4
9. Serious Sam's Bogus Detour
10. Serious Sam: Tormental
11. Serious Sam: The Random Encounter
12. Serious Sam DD XXL

(I excluded Fusion since it simply combines the games into one title. I excluded Revolution because that thing is something else. I haven't played Kamikaze Attack, but I don't think there is much to say there. I haven't played the VR games, but I do own them and they do look great.)

I will explain why I put Serious Sam 4 where I did starting with what I enjoyed. Serious Sam 4 can be summarized as some Sam and some new Sam. The level design overall has improved in areas and worsened in others. For example, the levels don't always feel like you are trapped in arenas that are convenient for the devs (I honestly was fine with this, but it seems more realistic if you aren't going from a boxy arena to a hallway to another boxy arena). The levels are a lot more open (in most of them, a few can feel like hallways at parts) and you have a lot of freedom to move around and kite enemies. Sadly, even though the levels are more open, there is a ton of space that is worthless, wasted. I don't expect every part of a level to have a purpose, but several levels are guilty of doing this. To help explain what I mean, in older Sam games, you might look for hidden nooks or something that is a little out of the way and you will be rewarded for your efforts with a secret (or be doomed by Biomech traps, lol). However, in Serious Sam 4, I often found myself looking everywhere for secrets (one of my favorite parts of the games among other things) and I quickly found that I would search endlessly around huge mostly empty maps and not getting anything most of the time. A Breakfast in France and One For The Road levels are the worst offenders of this. 

Anyway, enough about the level design and more of something else. The weapons are suburb in this entry and I am glad they have done more to make them feel good to use. There are a couple new ones (Weapon attachments, Flaming Rocket Propelled Chainsaw Launcher, Auto Shotgun) along with classic ones that are the same or have been tweaked. The weapon attachments are nice and add to the carnage such as the Grenade Launcher under barrel for the Shotgun. It is a nice early explosive weapon, at least until you get the Rocket Launcher. Speaking of Rocket Launcher, it gets an upgrade that allows you to load up to 5 rockets at will home onto targets, very good for certain enemies. The Laser Gun gets a damn death ray that annihilates everything in a line with the trade-off of using extra ammo. Besides that, gadgets make a debut as a weird crutch for when things get ""too serious"". They are fun to use, but they feel like a crutch and also make up almost all of the things you find in secrets. You get health stims that give health (even over 100), a revive button (yeah, I know it is called H.E.A.R.T. but that is what it is), a mini-nuke (that doesn't hurt you somehow), decoys, steroids(called Rage Serum, lol), a black hole, a drone, and a time slowing device.

Another new feature is the S.A.M.s or Sirian Artefacts of Might. A perk system that gives you some crazy new abilities like dual-wielding or take downs (executions, glory kills, whatever you want to call it) or riding on the backs on large monsters or reloading faster or many others. You don't earn them through getting so many kills or anything like that, just placed in the levels.

Furthermore, the important thing in an FPS, the game play. Serious Sam 4 doesn't do down time very much, I believe you are shooting more than you are doing anything else in this game (which is good). The movement feels good (EXCEPT when you are trying to do those damn parkour secrets which I didn't like in Serious Sam 3 either), you move fast, the guns have meat to the sounds and power, the music is fantastic (another Damjan Mravunac soundtrack worth getting), and the environments do somewhat fit with the music and real-world locations (you know, like in the future though). Also, how could I forget, the enemies, the real game play. A lot of new ones with a ton of classic ones (although missing some old ones like Aludran Highlanders, Aludran Demons, Marsh Hoppers [thank god], Electro Fish, and others) with some new twists or crazy designs. A few new ones that stick out are the Processed (so annoying), Zealots (also annoying because they are bullet proof from the front, but not the back), and Zubenhakrabian Spiders (try saying that 5 times fast). The last boss is also on this list for many reasons, but I won't spoil anything.

Something else I should mention is how well the game ran because this is a major topic that comes up when people see the reviews. Yes, it plays horribly and no I don't have the best PC, but when your hardware exceeds the recommended and it runs like dogshit and your friend has a PC that exceeds, but is slower than yours and runs better, there is a problem. Specifically the guns look amazing, the monsters look crazy, and the world looks good (up close, far away is not so good). On the flip side, animations can be a bit off, texture pop-in is so bad it isn't funny (it is the worst in cut scenes), and load times are a bit high, but I can understand if you have gigantic levels with no loading in the middle somewhere, and those faces (whatever you do, don't look at Quinn). I will say, my fps is pretty consistent (somewhere around 40) until there is a thousand monsters on screen, then it dives, but it never crashed.

So, what else is there to say? Serious Sam 4 is a very lengthy game (a good thing, but still shorter than Serious Sam 2), a fun one for the most part (especially with friends). Good game play overall with partially interesting environments and satisfying guns. Oh, yes, I didn't forget that I haven't mentioned the story because I don't want to talk about the story. The Serious Sam series does have a story, but it didn't always feel like it was the forefront of the game, it didn't feel completely story driven (a few excepts of course, but speaking specifically to First and Second Encounter). Serious Sam 4 feels more driven by the story (which is usually good if the story is good) and it isn't that good, it is probably my least favorite story of any entry (not including the spin-offs because Serious Sam DD XXL's story is non-existent and Random Encounter's is laughable). I won't provide a ton of spoilers so all of you can enjoy it or hate it without my influence. Simply, it is a prequel to Serious Sam 3 (I know, even farther back) and you get to know the crew more (Rodriguez, Jones, Hellfire, Kenny [new guy], Brand [another new one], and Quinn) from Serious Sam 3. Now, they are okay outside of the fact that most of their faces look horrific (I am looking at you Quinn), the banter is sometimes cringy (oh, the one-liners, they just hit you over the head repeatedly with one-liners), and the fact that they all can't shoot for shit when they follow you. Yes, you get companions, but don't expect them to be much help unless they are saying one liners (which I don't hate, Duke Nukem is good at it, you know, most of the time [*cough* Duke Nukem Forever *cough*]), but it is just done badly. 

Beyond that, there isn't much to say. I did enjoy the game overall with gripes, but it can't be perfect. I do recommend this game, but I would recommend you have a friend or two.

SS4 on the otherhand.... wow. first of all, it feels like the game was made by devs that did not want to make a serious sam game.
Its very uninspired and feels like an expansion to SS3 which came out almost, what?, a decade ago?.
It holds your hand instead of letting you explore, if you die one too many times the game will pop up a screen begging you on its knees to reduce the difficulty (i played on serious, so i saw this screen often), you cant click it away, you cant disable it, it will always be there nagging you, begging you. Something an SS game has never done before, not even SS3.
Not only that, but once this screen has popped up your next load of a save will take just as long as restarting the game completely.

Gun positives:
I do like the new double-barrel, i like that you can finally, once again dual wield 2 pistols (been a while)
I like that the tommy is back (but only if you preordered, so thats a minus)
I dont think theres much else postive to write here.

Gun negatives:
The tommy is preorder skin, alot of shaky cam when shooting which cant be turned off (unless i missed the option). grenade launcher on the pump shotgun. You have to reload guns, except for shotguns.

5/10 painfully average yet messy and broken.


review might change if croteam fixes the game, which imo, should have had early access a few years before release.

I mainly want to talk about my 2 big grievances with the game.

So the human companions, I anticipated this to be an annoying feature and up until my second playtrough I
didnt find this that much of an issue, but I had enough of them, they are annoying and obnoxios, the writing is absolute dogshit from the bottom of my heart and why NPC allies in a serious sam game, where the point is you are to solely take down hordes of monsters, most of the maps where theres more than 1 ally I just dont feel like have to dodge any meele enemies, they ruin the rhythim completely.

And second the Gadgets, now im kinda torn on this because some of them are good additions, healing on the spot, a decoy to misdirect enemies, even the rage serum are okay, but the ones that delete a whole screen of enemies, you have so many of them and there are so many encounters where the balance if absolute bullshit, because its designed to be beaten by a gadget, it feels so shitty to see a horde of monsters and press the win button on them, it is not good gameplay in the slightest.

I had alot of fun playing this game, especially at first, but in my second playtrough these 2 things made me so bitter that I cant recommend it all I hope is that a modder makes a ""true serious sam singleplayer"" mod, cause the gameplay is truly fun when it feels like a serious sam games (so like 20% of it) and I hate to see such a waste of opportunity.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :(
SS3 Started AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :( but then AAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)

Still waiting for SS4  to get to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA :)

Edit after another hour: The game is still sometimes unplayable, dropping to 20/30FPS form 80+. I am really struggling to like the game as it feels less than 3 </3

Edit at nearly 5hr gameplay: 
I have played every SS game on PC since SS1, and I hated 2 for the choices made by Croteam, including the vehicles. 
I liked SS3 even though it took a LONG time to get started (Basically, the levels in the city were meh), but I get they're needed to train new players on how to play the game. 
I tend to play conservatively saving ammo until I can't manage that wave anymore, and then switch to better weapons. 
I loved the silly tricks and traps of TFE and TSE especially before the HD remaster (with the old engine). I find there are some here, but they are missing. 
 I didn't care for the story then, and I really don't care for it now. I prefer the old/time travel environments as opposed to ""futuristic"" cities. 
There are a lot of EMPTY spaces here - I'm not talking about the VAST landscape with nothing on it (SS1 and the first level, going backwards, and that secret heart), but rooms or areas that appear to have no textures at all, as if they had been forgotten. There are some issues with being pushed out of bounds by a bull and being killed for going in the wrong direction (thanks game?). 
There is also a lot of reused material from The Talos Principle (textures, sounds, etc). I don't mind - it's your property after all - but it's quite obvious that stuff was simply reused instead of making something ""new"". 
Loading times are longer than SS3 even though levels appear smaller (at least whilst in Rome - haven't played further yet). 
I was very close to get a refund before the hotfix patch (FPS going from 100+ to 30 on spikes) but I've had the game preordered since May and I really want to support the devs. 
I really like the style of game, and I like the innovation/progression with the perks system. I'm not sure I'm too fond of the utilities as I find them slow and fiddly to use. I don't have a problem with the stupid humour and one liners - that's what SS has always done. I really don't care about the other characters or the animations. 

I think the main problem with SS4 for me is that between SS3 and 4 is that Doom 2016 and DE have been released in between, and they do the horde mode much better than the guys at Croteam. Yes, they have billions more in budget, but I'm afraid SS4 feels like a poor man's Doom Eternal, even though I appreciate that the gameplay is slightly different (especially the risk/reward of Doom, vs the careful weapon selection/enemy prioritizing of SS). 

So far I've played 4.7 hours and I've just met the Granny. 
I really want to like SS, but it will need to change significantly for me to be able to recommend it. For me, SS3 was a ""stick with it, it gets better after the city"".

Edit after finishing the game: I've now finished the game, and there have been a couple of patches that have improved performance. It does improve a bit but there are still a huge amount of empty spaces where there's nothing (I'm looking at you, France). The final boss is absolutefrustratingly pants on stupid and makes no sense. It is infuriating to fight and I don't even know how I managed to finish it after 20 tries. 
So yes, the game is fun in the end. It's more serious sam, a bit tedious, but it feels like there are more smaller arenas instead of big ones. I kinda enjoyed the last level as it was huge, varied, with different challenges (minus the final boss).

85,76955414,english,"Do not just read what everyone says in the reviews.  I will give you the full detail about this game of what you can expect from my experience.  Before I begin, take into mind that I finished the Single Player in serious mode and there are so many things that are bad.  I have played the Serious Sam long ago starting with First Encounter over a decade and a half ago.  There are many changes to this installment that doesn't match up to the previous titles. I will be comparing with previous titles throughout this review.  Let's begin.

Obvious things I should say is that of course as I am writing this review, the game has only been out for over a week so updates and changes will come.  With that being said, I won't mention anything that could have a potential change.  

Let's talk about the good things:
-Music-
Music is actually pretty good in this game, at least was an improvement from Serious Sam 3, but nevertheless, very good.  Sure some stages kept the same music which is fine but it changed it up every so often with peaceful music and attacking music.  Compared to Serious Sam 3 (besides the last level) which has so many drum beats over and over and over again, got extremely annoying to listen to.

-Gadgets-
Gadgets are fun to play with, very useful in tight situations depending on what spot you are stuck in.  They're about equivalent to the Power Ups (pups)  Serious Damage and Invulnerability in Second Encounter but instead of finding them in certain area, you always have them on you when ever you need them.  However, they are not a necessity in order to complete the game even in serious mode.

-Attachments-
Gun attachments are a nice addition into the game as it gives a bit of a special touch to the gun's main usage.  I found myself using the attachments pretty often and it helps tremendously in certain areas or against certain enemies.

Now onto the bad things:
-Way Points-
The first thing I noticed that seemed off was the way point.  In the old Serious Sam games, you were given the level to yourself, different places to explore and only 1 way to go.  The maps itself has its linear rundown but there were other places that were considered to be secrets or a way to find something that spawns more enemies to kill, or more ammo to pick up.  This whole way point in this game just makes it so that it tells players to go to point A, then keep going to point B, then C, and then to the end.  Sure it helps players put them on track, but it seems though you don't have the entire map to explore for your own freedom and that the game is telling you to just follow the line and get to the end.

-Side Objectives-
Remember what I said about way point and that it just points the player the linear path to the end or towards the main objective? Well side objective just happens to appear in a different track that lets the player decide if they want to tackle it or not.  Whatever happened to the old Serious Sam where you can just walk around freely and pick up secrets on your own leisure?  The side objective sometimes seems necessary because of the reward it gives.  Could be a weapon, gadget, skill point, when in old Serious Sam, you can literally walk around and grab the secrets if you wish.  It just makes the player go off track a little and do some side job for a little something that could be or could not be useful.

-Skill Tree or the S.A.M and the skills-
This little feature is everyone well-known skill tree that allows you to put skill points in certain skills so you can have support skills that normally you cannot do.  Past Serious Sam game placed you on a map with nothing to follow, no skills, no clues except your arsenal of guns and all you have is your movements.  

First point I dislike is the fact it has even more options to melee enemies.  Serious Sam is all about shooting enemies with your guns and occasionally, melee one that is too close helps.  When you have options to melee medium and big enemies just makes it seem like the game is now more focused on melee instead of classic Serious Sam shooting.  I agree, it does make it much easier to shoot a couple of big enemies, then go in for a melee kill, but for the most part you'll be swarmed with enemies like Serious Sam should, and never have that opportunity to melee.

Speaking of melee, the skill with the option to use objects to melee takes it even further.  Just regular melee was already bad enough and shouldn't be in a Serious Sam game and now they decide to be funny and use objects to swing at enemies to melee, are you serious?

Riding Khnum and Werebulls breaks the whole Serious Sam idea.  Why ride the enemies and use them to kill when you're playing Serious Sam and you're suppose to shoot enemies.  Besides, once you are done with the enemy, you still have to dismount them and kill them anyways.

Moving on to dual wielding.  I'm pretty sure this is just a fun feature because I did not have to use dual wield on any part of my play on serious mode.  It never felt I needed dual wielding to overcome certain areas.  This feature is probably from the other VR games on the previous installments and they decide to just place it there for fun.  Personally, I dislike it, no point in being there, not necessary but for fun, sure.  Classic Serious Sam can be done with whatever arsenal you were given in serious mode, the way it is meant to be played, so the dual wield is probably just for a fun feature, not really meant for serious usage.

Dropping items is probably one of the weirdest features in the game.  Remember the classic Serious Sam where ammo are all over the place and you seem to never run out?  That's how it should've been.  

Other skills such as reloading, shooting quick after reload, aiming down lets you move at normal speed, or reload while sprinting, etc...  It's a nice addition to the game but why are they a skill and not something built in to every player by default?  Why do we have to have a choice on that if sprinting, reloading, aiming sights are always going to be a thing while we play?

Overall, I feel the S.A.M is just total nonsense, none of that stuff should be there and the skill tree itself shouldn't be on a Serious Sam game.

-Level Design-
If you played any classic Serious Sam, you will know that the loading time is quick, level design is big enough to be rendered pretty fast.  Serious Sam 4... nope... My loading time for each level is about 2 minutes why?  Because the level design are extremely big with so much stuff to render and only about less than 50% of the entire map is used, but there's a workaround.  They purposely put side objectives and the main objectives over 500 meters away from each other every time and all you will see is the same trees, rocks and ground over for a long time.  Less shooting, more walking around to your next objective.

-Health, Armor, Ammo placements-
Remember the classic Serious Sam and all those placements of health, armor, and ammo?  Well in Serious Sam 4, you will have to run around the level searching literally every corner for a +10HP pill, and +10 Armor helmets every so often.  They are scattered around like the place had been ransacked.  Ammo drops are all over the place and you literally have to run around to pick them up.  Classic Serious Sam were organized, easy to find all the items.

That's all I have to say for the bad stuff.  I honestly don't recommend this game unless you want to give it a try or you are a Serious Sam fan.

This is in fact true.  Sadly, they've effectively counter-balanced this by removing almost all the ammunition from the game.  With careful management of resources, and balancing attacks between the double-barrelled shotgun (which kills things) and the single-barrelled one (which sort of does...), I was still constantly running out of shells and defaulting to the pistol.  I have an assault rifle, but no bullets have spawned for it since I got it.  The rocket launcher is okay, but anything bigger than man-sized takes at least two rockets to kill.

It looks phenomenal, but I'm stuck in an area with three or four green reptiloids, and dozens of smaller enemies, and I'm trying to kill them with a shotgun that fires once every two seconds.  Until it runs out of ammo and I'm trying to use the pistol to kill something the size of a building.

95,76946861,english,"I absolutely loved it! It's just the ""mindless"" shooter I needed after dumping over 200 hours into Doom Eternal (a lady needs a break from the equipment juggling, you know?). A lot of people were disappointed with how the legion system turned out, but tbh I don't think the game even needed it. After playing the other main entries in the series I honestly think this is the most intense and monster-packed Serious Sam game so far. Even with the dual wielding and room-clearing gadgets I still get overwhelmed in some parts, and I was playing on normal. The enemies in the 100,000 enemies in the legion system hoard DO actually shoot at you and you can kill each other, so they're not really ghosts like some people say. It's just that you have an army yourself to help take most of that fire off of you. I'm glad thats the case too since I was worried the game was gonna be a real pain with the legion system. the thought of fighting 100,000 enemies at once by myself sounds like a real slog and not fun at all, even with the mech. Sorry but I'd take 2 armies of soldiers blasting each other over 100,000 kleers and werebulls any day.

Speaking of dual wielding,  they handled having 2 different guns at once really well. You just pick what you want for each hand with the left and right mouse buttons from a single weapon wheel. It's a lot less clunky than in Wolfenstein 2 where you had two weapon wheels individually. The skill tree was pretty simple too. There's only a handful of upgrades and it's either for weapon handling or melee stuff. I opted for the weapon ones mostly since melee isn't really my style for hoard shooters like this, but there are some cool melee upgrades too if you want them. Weapon mods are kept simple too, no need to switch between two of them like in Doom Eternal, they each just get 1 useful alt-fire like the scatter bombs for the grenade launcher (my favorite).

The graphics are pretty good too, I don't get why a lot of people hate it so much. Yeah It's nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it's a lot better than Serious Sam 3 lol. And the sense of scale is really where the visuals shine the brightest imo. I'm aware that it does use some assets from The Talos Principle, but I really don't mind that they did that. It works for what they wanted to do with it and it's their assets anyway so they can do what they want with it. Lots of other games have asset flipped some too, like Portal uses some assets from Half-Life 2 but nobody complained about that. The animations are good too, except the human characters look a bit stiff since they're motion captured. They don't have good lip syncing either, but they literally animated the faces using an iPhone so I'm not surprised by that lol. The weapons and monsters are animated really well tho, which is good since they're the real stars of the show. 

The characters and dialogue is about as campy as you'd expect from a Serious Sam game. Some of the cutscenes remind me of Serious Sam 2 with how goofy it gets. I never took the series seriously so I don't mind this at all, it just adds to the fun for me. The story is definitely there too, but it's not that important. It's so unimportant in fact that you can just skip all the cutscenes and still know whats basically going on: you're saving the earth from an alien invasion by mowing them down like a lawnmower on legs.

My only issue with the game is performance (especially during the cutscenes which have a noticeably slow pop in whenever the camera angle abruptly changes). I haven't had too many performance issues personally, but since a lot of other people have it worse I really think it can be optimized better overall. 

In the end it's as much of a Serious Sam game as the others, but with a few bells and whistles tossed in for fun. I'd recommend checking it out sometime, tho I'd understand if you'd rather wait for some stuff to get patched first before buying. There's a couple updates out already and probably more to come, so I'm really glad they're working on it.

Oh and the music is beautiful too. Damjan Mravunac did an excellent job with it. It's nice to have some orchestral music thats actually good in a game for once lol.",1601697450,1601698492,True,4,1,0.566929101943969727,0,True,False,False,76561198153169491,193,11,1194,1194,817,1602055986,,

I definetely want to play it again to find out more secrets, many of them were actually a bit frustrating since they required more puzzle jumping (which I like in games) than exploration..

Serious Sam 3 was brutal, it was funny, it was serious and it made you feel good. Even more Sam 3 has been able to modernise the franchise by putting in the glory kills or giving you some new toys to play with.

Serious Sam 4 tries to do the same thing but literally every new thing they put in the game is not only no fun to use but also destroys the core gameplay. Seriously the vehicles feel so unnecesarry and lets not talk about the new gadgets which can kill every single enemy on the map with just one click. well played. Sam is about dodging enemies and about quick reactions and not about ""what is the funniest way to kill 100 enemies at once?"" 

Besides even the previously mentioned glory kills,.... they just do not feel good at all in Sam 4.
You guys remember how you ripped the eye out of the first Gnaar in Sam 3? Oh what an awesome feeling and it was this awesome feeling that set the tone for the rest of the game. Glory kills in Sam 4 however they feel underwhelming, the animations are not powerful, the sound is almost non existent and besides you are just stabbing your knife into almost every enemy, while you had different glroy kills in Sam 3... It just feels like a step back which is a really bad thing considering the last game is 9 years old.

[b]Maybe if you guys see Serious Sam as a dumb and silly playground you will have fun with this game.
For me the franchise is serious, its brutal paired with some witty jokes and blood.[/b]

On the bright side the characters and their dialogues are very good, it was fun to listen to their nonsense.
[b]But that's where the nonsense has to stop. Ridiculouse wordplay not ridiculous gameplay.[/b]

25,76920908,english,"[h1] SCROLL DOWN IF YOU JUST WANT A PROS/CONS LIST [/h1]

I would like to preface this saying I'm a huge Serious Sam fan, played the original TFE and TSE when they came out on my old windows ME. That being said, I will have a lot of bias for these games. With that out of the way:

[b] I don't know if I can recommend this game to people who aren't big Serious Sam fans. [/b]

Serious Sam's biggest draw for me is the huge hordes of monsters in the battles. Biggest hordes you can fight in an old school style FPS, to my memory. They ramp it up in this game and it works. That being said, Croteam mentioned that they have a Legion system where they can have ""thousands"" of enemies on screen. I saw only 2 occasions where that could be true, the prologue and the final fight. However, that ""legion"" was mostly ghost models that weren't killable? (Please tell me if I'm missing something there). 

I think Croteam excels in 3 areas: Weapon selection, the designs of the monsters, and the combat. All three of those areas are incredible in this game. The pump shotgun in this game might be my #1 favorite pump shotgun in all FPS games now, while Serious Sam 3 it was the worst pump shotgun in all FPS games (seriously, Serious Sam 3 gives you this mag fed pump shotgun that looks like a toy, and the design has a shell holder on the side even though its mag fed. Help me.)

What they don't excel at is the character models and animations. To go easy on it, it's janky. They make you want to skip the cutscenes entirely. The characters themselves, not just their models, aren't great in the writing department either. When you start the story and they give you an AI companion, I audibly said ""please don't do this"" but they still did. Don't know why they did this, but they did. The First Encounter and The Second Encounter you got Serious Sam and that's it (well you got Netricsa but that doesn't count). Sam, weapons, and one-liners against Mental's hordes and it was a beautiful assimilation. 

TL;DR I don't think I can recommend this to people who aren't already fans of Serious Sam, especially for $40, but I think fans of the series will look past the cons and really appreciate the gameplay that makes the series so lovable.

[h1] PROS: [/h1]

+The bestiary of monsters is great. There are a good amount of unique monsters with very little variant padding

+The combat is fantastic, I don't find myself holding S and left click as much as TFE and TSE (but its definitely still there)

+Serious Sam is still a great FPS protagonist

+The amount of monsters that show up in battles makes it satisfying

+In a series that is mostly a walking arsenal inflicting mass extinction to aliens in different set pieces, the story for this installment of Serious Sam really isn't bad

[h1] CONS: [/h1]

-The character models. Oh god. Please. Somebody help. I think Croteam consists of aliens that observe their human references through a telescope from a different planet.

-They implemented sections where you deal with AI partners and it's more of a slap in the face than anything

-I mentioned the story in the pros, but there is a con to it as well. The characters' involvement in the story kills the vibe a bit.

-Melee kills do not look good. Use your weapons. Don't bother with the melee skills

-The skill system doesn't need to be there. It's a fake RPG element that you can do without.

-There are tons of secrets to find but the maps are so big and empty you don't know where to look. It's bothersome.

-Maps are large but mostly padded out with... nothing",1601657411,1601657652,False,1,0,0.510503590106964111,0,True,False,False,76561198024987669,416,8,1863,1863,1863,1601503611,,
26,76920234,english,"Its Serious Sam, its exactly what you expect, silly humour, lotsa enemies and awesome weapons. I really enjoyed it and binged it till the end:
Pros: Awesome weapons
         Decent campaign - will take you about 15-20 hours if you run around and do all the secondary missions
         Although it doesnt seem so at the start, the waves become insane, in pure SS style - perfect
         Challenging on higher levels, you will need to use your weapons and gadgets properly.
         Lvl system makes it interesting and a little more RPG -like
         Awesome soundtrack
         Cheesy as it may be, I enjoyed the story :P
         Fast patching and response to community input
Cons: Graphics are disappointing, although environmental graphics are great, character models and 
           movement is badly done 
           Graphical artifacts and shaders are buggy as hell, mostly fixed in first patch, broken again in 2nd.
           Environmental sound like footsteps etc is dodgy.

Note: In spite of graphics and sound issues, game mechanics are 100%, I was able to aim and fire perfectly, and could determine location of charging enemies correctly

To summarise: In spite of initial criticism, I think devs did great job on this, it felt like a SS game, and I couldn't help myself binging it till I was done. Also, 100% achievements possible without replays and too much running around :D

Proudly stands between the other parts of the series. Same vibe, better graphic, sounds, animations. I've encountered zero performance issues, beside FPS drops varying from 140 to 40 - ( Ryzen 5 2600X, AMD 5700 XT ), but no crash or whatsoever. Feels good with Vulkan. Some people expected Witcher like story or I dunno... they clearly not played any SS before..., the story was made in the Serious Sam same style as before: stupid, and funny, thats all - nothing more to it.
I agree with some folks, that some places had no enemy, where there should be ( or at least surprise attacks more often ). Or some places had less enemy compared the actual size of the current battlefield. But don't tell me there was no hordes of enemies... you played it on Easy or what?... This game is ment for Serious difficulty only. Period.
With those new weapon looks, and their animations, bullet traces, sounds, and the Fakin' awesome music - when 150 headless kamikaze was charging at you, and then you blow up the whole field using your minigun, was... priceless, and nostalgic. 
It absolutely delivered what it should as an SS game. Don't expect something else, which is not this series.

35,76516122,english,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Serious Sam 4 in its current state. It is very poorly optimised. It only looks a bit better than Serious Sam 3 BFE and I'm pretty sure the engine hasn't been updated all that much. So I don't understand how it runs so poorly, considering Serious Sam 3 through Serious Sam Fusion runs pretty well. DX11 runs better than the other APIs on offer, which isn't normal. Normally DirectX 11 runs worse than DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Even if the frame rate is over 60, I get these hitches that can be very jarring. Usually, it happens when I'm moving through the level. It's as if chunks of the level are loading in. It doesn't matter if I have the game installed to an SSD or HDD, it happens regardless. Lowering the quality settings doesn't help either. Load times are also long, even on an SSD. There is noticeable texture pop-in, too. Oh, and IT CRASHED SIX TIMES IN THREE HOURS.

It's a terrible shame, because I rather enjoy the punchy weapons. The double barrel is brilliant. Headshots now do extra damage, which I rather enjoy. 

I can't imagine the state the game was in before it was delayed. People waited the better part of a decade for this. Unbelievable.

Update: It continues to hitch regardless of where the game is installed and what API I am using. The amount of crashing has become intolerable. I completely give up on the game until it is patched again, and I mean a BIG patch. What a shame. What little is good about the game is completely ruined by such poor optimisation and the worst stability I have ever experienced in my life.

Update #2: After updating Windows from 1909 to 2004, performance is even worse. It could run over 100 fps before with low settings, and over 60 fps at all times with medium settings (excluding hard hitches) and running at 120+ fps during cut scenes. Now, I noticed my CPU usage at 100% and the frame rate around 15 fps. I played for a bit, and it ironed itself out a bit, with roughly 70 fps or so but it was so stuttery it was basically unplayable. The worst optimised, most broken PC game I have ever experienced. And, no, it's not my CPU's fault. I have an i5-9600k, which is actually a very beefy six-core chip, and when overclocked can perform near identically to an i9-9900k at stock speeds in many games, because most games don't take full advantage of more than six threads. It goes toe to toe with the i7-8700k and often outperforms it by a small margin. Maybe I'll give it a shot on my X79 system with an i7-3930k.

Update #3: The game now runs a bit smoother and the lighting isn't completely broken and flickering. I played the game for at least one hour before it crashed. Except it didn't really crash, the notification popped up yet the game was running fine. I wanted to get rid of it, so I clicked ""exit"" and the game closed anyway. How weird. I must commend Croteam, they are on the right path to making the game playable.

You wanted Serious Sam, you got Serious Sam, now for twice the InSamnity!

There are SEVERAL references in this game that hint from TFE, TSE, and even BFE (I'm looking at you Grand Cathedral!) that are definitely worth checking out/listening to. 

While I agree with others that the game feels kind of clunky, the story and such make up for it. Only thing I didn't like about it was the difficulty scaling. Even on Normal, it took me a few dozen tries to get past. And uh, spoilers, but the Achriman fight was glitched out for me and I completed it without taking any damage because he apparently got stuck on the building. But I'm sure that'll be fixed in a future patch/hotfix. 

Overall, the game is great, the music is great, and story is great. Don't listen to most of the negative reviews as they are probably from people who enjoy DOOM more than Serious Sam and haven't really had a good experience or even played the game series at all.

The introduction of dual-wielding AND secondary firemodes for many weapons makes this game so much more fun than any of its predecessors.

Seriously, if there is one thing you take away from this review, i want it to be these two giant positives:

..........+++
..........+++
+++++++++++
+++++++++++ [b] DUAL WIELDING ANY TWO WEAPONS [/b]
..........+++
..........+++

..........+++
..........+++
+++++++++++
+++++++++++ [b] SECONDARY FIREMODES [/b]
..........+++
..........+++

Most weapons also look and sound better than in BFE.

The soundtrack is the best one, yet. Truly epic songs.

Enemy variety is big. There are a lot of new enemies, mixing up the gameplay. Some more annoying than others but none quite as bad as the witches from BFE.

The game also introduces [spoiler] gadgets (think items in Heretic or Duke-3D plus a few unique ones) that can turn around any seemingly unwinnable encounter. [/spoiler]

The environments / levels are very varied and colorful. And, of course, chock full of secrets. 
Remember the infamous 1-HP-Pickup-Turning-Into-Deathtrap-Secret? Well, they're back and wouldn't you believe it, they even improved THOSE.
The Levels also feature larger, more open areas to fight in, again. All of which are beautifully designed with lots of detail. Very fun to explore and fight in.

The only downsides i can think of are, that the game isn't very well optimised and that they amped up the cutscenes and characters from BFE up to 11. Granted, there was one scene that genuinely made me laugh ( [spoiler] when Kenny lost his shoe the second time [/spoiler] ) but for the most part the cutscenes try too hard and just end up being unfunny. The bad animation doesn't help their case either.
(Edit: Finished the game now. The characters grow on you.)

But, seriously, none of that will hinder your enjoyment of the game. Gameplay is king and it is amazing.

It is hands down the best Serious Sam game out there. I'm very much looking forward to what Croteam has in store for us next.


For once in a long time i do not regret a pre-order.

Brainless crazy action,huge amounts of enemies in every map,great variety in enemy types are all there to give many hours of real fun.The also big variety in weapons and crazy gadgets will try to make things easier for us.
The maps are really beautiful with tons of secrets to discover,like in most old-school games.
All these ,combined with an amazing soundtrack,can give the real SERIOUS SAM experience.

Not taking itself  TOO SERIOUSLY (pun intended) , Sam is there ,exactly as we know him ,with the stupid (but really good) jokes and the clever puns,always reminding the 90's and the style the games had back then.I think it will definitely satisfy the fans of the series.

From technical aspect,i want to notice that the game suffers from minor audio/video glitches and some bugs.It's not perfect but at least everything you might notice is minor and NOT game-breaking.

Serious Sam is back after 9 years and it seems like a strong return!

Looks great, plays really well and has been pretty solid for me so far, despite not even having played the 1.02/1.03 patched version. The Flaming Rocket-propelled Chainsaw Launcher might well be my new favourite gun in anything, ever! Definitely one to come back to when I've upgraded my GPU, I think.

At the time of writing, the lighting and shadows seem a bit broken in DirectX 12 - particularly in the French countryside. This manifests itself as pitch-black flickering shadows in a range of places, including, unfortunately, the view through the RAPTOR sniper scope. This problem went away in DirectX 11 and I don't think I saw it in Vulkan, either. I'm not sure when Nvidia changed that setting for me, though!

A more subjective complaint is that human characters seem to have weirdly staring eyes - most visible on Quinn in the early cutscenes (everybody else has shades obscuring their eyes). Shadow banding on Sam's arms and texture pop-in being particularly bad in cutscenes seem like technical things that'll go in time, but the eyes would need some art direction changes, I'm afraid.

+Positives+

+Graphics are cool
+Different enemies from previous games
+Some areas and chapters are well-designed
+Humor, jokes
+Guns, and game play is fun
+Music, was always good on SS games
+Finally some vehicles to drive
+Very nice S.A.M. abilities, those new features are very good, you can ride bull and Khnum, you can shoot with double weapons, melee on big enemies and some other nice abilities as well. This is the best part of this game
+It has perfectly enough game hours. Long but not like SE or SS2
+Gadgets, another part of this game and they are amazingly fun
+Side missions
+Support team

-Negatives-

-Optimization. (Never pre-order anything) Well they fixed most of it after a week release but it still has some problems, surely they can fix in some weeks.
-Even with customized ultra presets, the tree shadow distance is mess. 
-Copy-paste Talos Principle textures, ruins.. WTF
-Secrets. Most of them are stupidly placed, you can easily stuck on some of them, rewards are almost same, health gadgets mostly, not enough for trap secrets
-Story.. SS3 BFE was already prequel. Now they did prequel of the prequel -_- Places can be interesting yes but we want to see different designs and environments
-No multiplayer, no challenges. Only singleplayer with co-op
-Enemies are not enough for a SS game. They are so less in most areas, especially on HUGE france level, that game is not looks like their trailers. Enemies are so easy to kill and they are not enough. (played on Hard mode)
-Cutscene rendering problems, localization (language) bugs
-Legion system is just a basic trick and you will never see in whole game except 1 time

On final, i didnt like that game that much. Its even worse than SS3 BFE. And i really sad about SS2. That game was perfect with countless areas,planets, sky arts, secrets, jokes. But they ve forgetten SS2, probably they are not even care that game or that quality. My best guess they are having problem with their tech team, or coders or whatsoever. Something changed after Talos.

As for itself it can be playable on discount, and you can have fun with your friends too. But for a ''Serious Sam'' game (not about old-school memories) its just

91,76859707,english,"SS4 is a game that needs a lot of polishing.A whole lot, like a year extra in development.

It is not ready by any means, more like a good beta version.The levels are bland, reminiscent of half lie 2 rejected urban areas minus the combine technological additions, or any COD multiplayer levels that take place within cities.The area tilesets look bland, as if they are prefabricated and then stuck together to make an entire level.It's on the same quality with some games you see on Steam made by indie devs just slapping unity assets together.Also the secrets are annoying, they rarely spell out to the player ""hey, there is a secret here"" so that he pays attention.They are too subtle, which makes them so easy to ignore.A secret within a game must be able to discovered, so that the player enjoys doing that. Otherwise its just a waste of time.  

The guns are just adequate, not meaty or satisfying enough, they just work.Also there are instances that the developers show that they are tired to look for anything original or new, like the rocket chainsaw launcher.Why not create a homing pirate cannon then, or an exploding machine gun or any combination of guns existing within the game?It's just sooo lazy...  

Story wise, the story is almost non existent, but that's no shortcoming because this kind of games is all about blasting enemies here and now.

Technically wise, the game has unnaturally high requirements, while visually it looks like its predecessor 10 years ago.So why does it need them?A striking example is the hard disk required.SS3 needed 5 GB of hdd, this one needs a whopping 40 gigs.Let me stress again, it looks and plays THE SAME as 2010's SS3.Where does all this space is needed for ?!?!

[b] Seriously Good [/b]

The gunplay is just as good as ever, very smooth and fun to play, the weapons all feel good to shoot and there's even a couple new weapons to play with so that's pretty neat.

This time around they've added 'gadgets' which are consumable items you can pick up throughout the levels which help you out in some form such as healing or decoy or destroying all the enemies or sending a drone to kill enemies so that's pretty cool. 

They've also added perks which you can unlock by collecting weird purple orbs, the perks are pretty cool, you can unlock stuff like duel wielding all sorts of weapons and executions for different enemies. 

There's side objectives now which you can do to unlock new gadgets and stuff which is pretty cool.

The soundtrack is pretty damn cool. 

The graphics are pretty good, nice and vibrant, lots of color. 

The sound effects and stuff overall sound good, I play on speakers though so don't hold me to that. 

The enemies look really cool this time around, especially the Kleer. There's quite a few new enemies this time around as well as old ones so that's pretty good.


There's a whole bunch of vehicles you can drive around like a motor cycle and a combine harvester and even a mech, they're pretty damn cool moments and the driving feels better than in some big AAA games.

Luckily the game never crashed on me at all so that's something.

There's a whole bunch of cool little wacky secrets just as the franchise always had.

The final boss is pretty awesome.

[b] Seriously Bad [/b]

First of all the framerate is absolutely terrible, maxed out at 1080p on a GTX 1080 and i7 7700K most of the time I could barely sustain 80fps, even when lowering some settings and changing the renderer to vulkan it was still laggy, terrible performance throughout the whole game, it fluctuates anywhere between 40 to 144fps which makes the game a literal headache to play unfortunately. It also doesn't help that v-sync doesn't seem to work (on vulkan atleast) because I still got terrible screen tearing. There's even parts of the game where the cutscenes lag out and you miss some dialogue.

Another serious issue is the loading times, I have the game installed on an M.2 SSD and it still takes ATLEAST 30 seconds to load each level, ridiculous. 

I admire the developers trying to add more story and depth to the Serious Sam universe but the way they did it here really isn't what I think they should do. There's a bunch of boring looking characters with cringey dialogue and it doesn't help that the cutscenes really aren't that well animated. While its cool to hear more of Sam I'd rather just stick with him on his own.

There's a lot of parts where npcs are with you and they just keep repeating annoying dialogue and stealing your kills which makes the game a bit too easy, on top of the gadgets and perks they put in the game it just makes the game way easier than the previous titles in the series, maybe its to try and get a more mainstream audience but I really don't think this is a main stream type of franchise. 

One of the big things behind the game this time around was that there is a ""Legion System"" which boasts thousands of enemies on the battlefield at once but (at least on normal difficulty) there's less than 1000 enemies in every single level except the last one and the last level is the only level that has their so called ""battlefield teeming with thousands of enemies"" which while is quite impressive its a shame that they were only able to do it for a single level, makes it feel a bit of a scam, you can't even kill all of them they're just there for the spectacle. 


On the last mission my game bugged out and the objective marker didn't show up and I didn't notice so I spent an hour going through the level only to get softlocked at the end and the game doesn't autosave at the start of the level so I couldn't go back to a point where the game might not have been bugged and every level overwrites the previous level's autosaves so I had to start the mission over from the main menu instead so I lost my score for the entire game. This left a real sour taste in my mouth and honestly lowers my rating of the game overall. 

There's no leaderboards despite the main menu saying they are in the extras menu.

Texture pop-ins are quite frequent which is annoying.

There's only one crosshair and you can't change its color

There's a lot of times where you have to jump on objects or buildings to reach secrets but the game really doesn't make it easy to get onto stuff so that can be annoying at times.

The side objectives while cool at first sort of lose purpose half way through the game when you've unlocked everything so you're just doing the objectives for achievements instead of getting something new.

The executions in the game from what I've seen are a step down from SS3, you don't even pull the eyeballs out of the gnaar's this time you just stab them, in fact you just stab most enemies, at least on the executions you get from the start, you have to unlock executions on stronger enemies. 

They tried to add a lot of lore to the game like there's radios that you can listen to and then there's audio logs except there's only like 6 in the whole game and one of them I picked up and it didn't work for some reason and on top of that just the stuff in the logs and on the radio doesn't really say much most of the time so its a bit useless really.

It's a big shame that its yet another prequel, will Sam ever get to Mental? maybe in 20 years who knows. 


[b] Overall [/b]

They've made an effort to try and modernize Sam and make it more main stream and they've made some cool improvements here and there but unfortunately lack of polish just makes the game fall flat to me, the janky cutscenes and the terrible performance on top of there really not being as many enemies as they said really just kinda makes it feel a bit weird. The gameplay itself is great though like if you liked the previous games you'll enjoy this for the most part but this game definitely at the very least needed a few more months in the oven. Wait for some patches or a sale I'd say, in its current state I can't really recommend it, maybe once they've fixed it up a bit. 5.5/10",1601395154,1601546674,False,3,1,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561197993890344,912,266,881,881,881,1601390452,,

     Что мне понравилось:
      + Большие локации на которых есть место для манёвра
      + Озвучка: впечатление такое что актёр озвучивавший Сэма совсем не поменлся
      + Саундтрек хоть и несколько однообразен, но под ситуацию подходит и некоторые треки даже запомнится могут
      + Разнообразный арсенал оружия и гаджетов делает смысл. Дробовики подходят против толп слабых врагов или скелотов, гранато и ракетомёты против жирных врагов(можно поставить хэдшот ракетой), снайперская винтовка так же подходит против толстяков. Гаджеты будут не раз выручать вас в ситуациях где вы были окружены даже если только с одной стороны.
     + Разнообразие противников. Чем больше их видов в толпе бегущей на вас тем интенсивней и напряжённей будет бой
      Что мне не понравилось:
      -Мало навыков делающих смысл, некоторые просто делают игру проще до такой степени что вам будет уже неинтересно(например убийство больших противников с одного удара ножом)
      -Текстуры подгружаются в катс-сценах и модели порой их просто теряют
      - Мало интерактива на картах, особенно это видно во Франции где почти каждый дом это просто коробка без возможности туда войти
      - Уровень с Поп-мобилем
   Основные претензии к игре можно предъявить за техническую часть, которая проседает даже не на самых высоких настройках. Игру можно было бы поругать и за то что это фактически тот же Сэм 2000-х годов с малейшими изменениями, но как по мне это не минус так как если бы разработчики попытались сделать больше элементов как у своих конкурентов, то от Сэма осталось бы только название.

14,76759333,english,"I ended up enjoying Serious Sam 4 quite a bit, but can only cautiously recommend it right now:
[list]
[*]The gunplay is near identical to SS3 but makes significant improvements, especially in regards to visuals and sound. Less guns need to reload now, and the ones that do tend to use their own separate ammo source now. The gadgets (which are pretty much inventory power ups) and weapon attachments are very welcome additions to the series. You can also headshot for significantly higher damage now, which adds a lot to the strategy of the game. Having allies in the campaign is also a nice addition (when they're not saying stupid things repeatedly.) I have no problems regarding combat, it’s arguably the best the series has to offer. I would honestly like to see some of this backported into SS3.

[*]I think most of the levels are fine but are also sometimes hit or miss. Visually, most of the levels are significantly more colourful and varied than SS3. You get plenty of proper arenas and open fields to fight on, so that’s good. But for some reason dark interiors with no light sources like in SS3 return throughout the game, with no flashlight to be found in the entire game. For some reason. Why? Also some of the maps make no effort to wall you off from wasting your time discovering absolutely nothing on what seemed like alternate paths. It sometimes feels like people who designed the previous games worked on some sections, meanwhile a person who has only just started to learn level design suddenly took over for other sections. The second final level in particular is so worthless that I genuinely believe the game would have been better off if it didn’t even include it. I wasn't really a fan of the[spoiler]erupted volcano[/spoiler]level either. The “legion system” is also really cool to see but it ultimately doesn’t do anything meaningful to the game. Sorry.

[*]The story starts as silly but decent, then slowly makes it very clear that it only has full intention to get in the way as much as it possibly can by continuously referencing jokes that were barely funny the first time in the middle of combat and having half of the poorly animated cutscenes pretty much be a complete waste of your time. I appreciate the characters from SS3 not being cameos but the majority of the cast only having one joke being told in different words a hundred different times was a bad idea.[spoiler]Charlie was the best character and wasn’t used enough. Kenny was forced into being a loser the entire time which was disappointing. Carter has less than no value and is the fucking worst by far. Both villains who speak were awful. AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT ONE LINERS HOLY SHIT WHO AND WHAT AND WHY DID THIS GO ON FOR EIGHT HOURS STRAIGHT???[/spoiler] I replayed some of the starting levels with the voices volume turned to zero and turned the subtitles off. It's already a significantly more pleasant experience.

[*]The game pretty much launched in a beta state. Several parts of the game do not look finished, optimisation in general is questionable, none of the old crosshairs have returned, multiplayer is currently limited to 4 player coop with no other modes, there’s only 4 skins to choose from (starring Sam, Sam, Sam & Sam. Yes really,) and there’s no leaderboard this time for some reason. The game is significantly more competent than early reviews lead on (although they were playing a pre-release version), but it’s still not what you would expect from a $55 AUD game in its current state. (Edit: The devs have stated they are going to update the content in general.)

[*]Also Sam has skill tree upgrades now. For some reason. Which locks your ability to reload while sprinting and your ability to melee medium enemies, even though these were both standard mechanics in SS3. It’s not that big of a deal and you can earn those abilities back pretty easily, but I don’t think it was a necessary change. You can heal from melees now like in Doom 2016 or shoot with two guns at once like in Wolf TNO though, so that’s neat.

Overall a vast improvement over SS3: BFE. The enemies, weapons and music are the best in the series yet. Every weapon feels unique and is actual useful at higher difficulties. The environments are colourful as opposed to dull grey and sandy brown. The earliest levels start out strong and the chaos never stops. No more COD style beginner levels like SS3 had. 

For the first time since SS2 we have an actual effort put towards the story and lore. It's not a work of art by any means but it's a fun little romp. Nor does it distract from the arcadey gameplay. 

The new features including equipment and the S.A.M. skill tree abilities turned out much better than I thought they would. Who knew how much fun a grenade launcher on the pump-action shotgun would be? Well it is. As is dual wielding any weapon in the game. 

Now it's not all perfect. The human animations for the cutscenes are bad. The vehicle sections could be more fleshed out. Optimization could be better. Other than those few quibbles I do believe this might end up becoming my fav Sam game yet. I can't wait for mod support and the level editor to come. People are going to go wild with the rich sandbox this game provides.

4-ый Сэм получился вполне нормальной игрой. Без бюджетов ААА, чего хорваты и не скрывали. Это чистый трэш и угар, в котором можно вжать гашетку в пол, и уклоняться от кучи проджектайлов, и тушек, пока проводишь прицелом по экрану с безумной ухмылкой. Прежняя формула Сэма всё ещё работает и обросла новыми фичами. Будь то прокачка из-за которой можно будет стрелять по-македонски с любого оружия или возможность забраться, чёрт возьми, на того же быка да разваливать остальную орду тварей с двух разных орудий. Пушек достаточно и бахают они будь здоров. Альтернативные режимы огня порадовали, типа подствольника для дробовика (да, оно существует), или возможность зарядить сразу пять ракет по одной или множеству целей. Даже доп. миссии на уровнях дают какой-то приятный бонус. Типа портативной чёрной дыры или паверапа в виде временного замедления времени, или рейдж мода (а как вам портативная ядерная установка, стреляющая соответствующими боеголовками?). Ещё секретки с отслыками можно поискать, которые никуда из серии не делись. Что до сих пор доставляет.

Аудиовизуал и общая работоспособность на релизе конечно же вызывают очень смешанные чувства. С одной стороны у нас вполне хорошо смоделированные монстры и пушки, которые ещё и анимированы как надо. Серьёзно, в меню Нетриксы можно долго разглядывать как эти твари и пушки проработаны круто.  Кучу современных технологий завезли в игру, которые уже в любом-другом движке используются, но ты их можешь и не заметить. Источник освещения словно один на всю игру и это солнце. Хорошо что хотя бы цветовая гамма меняется от уровня к уровню. Тени как бы динамические, рендерятся они на каждом чёртовом деревце и кустике, но они всё равно очень простенькие. И как бы ты их разрешение не выкручивал, тени всё равно остаются какими-то сетчатыми, словно низкокачественными. Тесселяции на всё навернули, бамп и паралакс маппинг (т.е. техники, позволяющие сделать объекты визуально более детальными, объёмными), затенение приятное имеется в углах и монстры разваливаются на кучищу частиц, да и различных эффектов от монстров и оружия много. Деталей в игре действительно много, иногда даже слишком, но общая картинка всё равно смотрится неказисто. Особенно если просто пробегать игру, а не останавливаться и всматриваться в только что развалившегося монстра, стенку, лес или общий вид локации.

Ещё хорваты виртуальных людей так и не научились нормально анимировать. Внутриигровые катсцены и анимации передвижения персонажа от третьего лица всё такие же дешёвенькие, иногда даже кринжовые, т.е. вызывают стыд тот самый, испанский. Зато сами модельки NPC вполне нормально смоделированы и на всё-всё-всё в игре натянули прям супер-качественные текстуры. Которые подгружаются часто и бьют по глазам. Многим может не понравится более реалистичное направление в плане дизайна всего, но я бы не сказал, что это плохо. Левел дизайн всё ещё продуманный. Путешествовать придётся как по городским местностям различных стран, так и по крышам зданий, по различным руинам, лесам, по ""раскалённой"" местности после извержения вулкана и огромным полям. Т.е. визуально уровни тоже выглядят вполне разнообразно и приятно, нежели скучно. Учитывая как раз более реалистичный дизайн уровней. 

Монстров вываливают достаточно, чтобы игрок не заскучал. При этом было очень мало ситуаций, когда прям заваливали мясом и было очень тяжело прорваться, заставляя чесать репу и ощущать некоторый дисбаланс на уровне. Нет, как раз таки с балансом всё в порядке. В отличии от третьей части, игра разгоняется довольно быстро и больше представляет из себя американские горки. Где есть моменты спокойствия, достаточно стрельбы, езды, и необычных моментов, заканчивая всё дело очередным боссом и гигантским бахом. Кстати о боссах, визуально как по мне они получились не очень интересными, скорее окейными. Паттерны лёгкие, да и расстреливаются они иногда слишком быстро (играл только на норме, замечу).

Странная ситуация получилась и с саундтреком. Он довольно годный, но его преграждают звуки выстрелов, взрывы, общение по рации, бесконечные ""ААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААА"" от камикадзе, в общем всё что угодно. Лишь в паре-тройке мест хотелось прислушаться к сопровождающему действо OST'у. А как отдельно прослушал саундтрек... так оказывается там хор хреначит, боевые гитары и барабаны жгут, словно целый оркестр брынчит и гласит еееее рок тебе в ухо. А в игре... как то этого не замечаешь по большей части. Надеюсь это только моя личная проблема.

Местная история... ну... мотивация расстреливать всё и вся - тоже сойдёт. Она просто есть и она работает. Можно дополнительно послушать аудиологи, которые тут появились, почитать местные записочки о тяжкой судьбе тех, кто спасался или до сих пор спасается от тварей, послушать завывания местного мистера Зло о том, что людям бы надо сдаться, ибо так будет лучше для всех. А ещё можно тупо всё скипать и ничего страшного не случится. Глубоких персонажей тут нет, есть только великая цель, угар и содомия. Иногда сценаристы, правда, палку перегибают и стараются вставить гэг на гэге ради гэга. Просто чтобы они были и плевать - сработают они в конкретной ситуации или нет. Такое ощущение, что тут не только врагов, но и one liner'ов - больше всех среди всей серии. Но есть и вполне крутые сцены с гэгами, за что и спасибо.

Пройдя 4-ю часть серьёзного Семёна я так и не понял за что игру можно хаять кроме того, что технически она явно сырая. Речь о просадках FPS на любом железе, о визуальных багах. Некорректные анимации при добиваниях врагов, постоянные подгрузки текстур и геометрии. Один раз за всю игру дружественные NPC баговали, передвигались или неистово вибрировали на месте. Открывали рты и при этом не разговаривали.  Земля могла кусками просто выгружаться из игры и вновь появляться на месте. Герой проходит сквозь деревья и кусты. Флора в принципе разрушается на три веточки и живи ты с этим как хочешь. Доспехи рыцарей на одном из уровней стояли в T-позе с приклеенными к рукам мечами. Т.е. очень скорый релиз и слабый маркетинг – это единственные проблемы игры как по мне. Потому что многие журналисты, стримеры и обзорщики играли в превью билд, и естественно получили очень много отрицательных эмоций из-за того, что игра тупо недоделана -> обхаяв игру как следует. Фишка с системой Легион, наверное, самый известный пример, где разработчики всех ""обманули"" и предоставили ровно один бой с огромным числом противников. Хотя сам думал, что таких моментов будет хотя бы 2 или 3 на всю игру опять же разнообразия ради, но нет. Зато девелоперы честно заявляли, что это лишь визуальный трюк, а не полноценная битва с тысячами и сотней тысяч противников одновременно. Было видно желание сделать очень эпичный момент, но этого оказалось мало. 

Конечно разработчикам стоило вынудить издателей ещё на несколько месяцев отложить релиз, чтобы все в итоге получили более вылизанный продукт, но увы… Однако игру всё равно буду рекомендовать. Большинство тех. проблем можно искоренить, как и всегда делали разработчики (речь о прежних играх серии). Фундаментально продукт не сломан. Кор-геймплей Serious Sam всё ещё доставляет. Резвое передвижение героя с применением рекомендуемого оружия к разным типам противников всё ещё работает. Это Сэм каким мы его знаем. С обновлённой, осовремененной формулой геймплея, в которой лишь иногда стоит включать голову, чтобы не отправиться на последний сейв. Честно, мне не понятна нынешняя тенденция жаловаться на всё подряд. В частности на то, что в Сэме нет вертикального геймплея, глубокого лора и персонажей, что он не современный и всё в игре не работает. Народ ещё жаловался, что и в DooM Eternal заставляют двигаться, использовать разное оружие и способности. Так каким, всё же, должен быть современный шутер? Наверное [b] весёлым [/b] как минимум и четвёртый Сэм это даёт.

37,76827085,english,"The Serious Sam series is a series of horde shooters, playing something like an amped-up version of the original Doom games. I'm writing this review on the assumption that you at least know a little bit about what game getting into here – there are a billion enemies and projectiles on the screen at once, you hold a billion tonnes of ammunition on your body and you strafe backwards a lot. Detractors of the series will say that the series is repetitive and dumb, which was always blatantly never the case, but Serious Sam 4 feels like it does a lot to try and counter this reputation.

[b]Gameplay and level design[/b]
My favourite games are those which offer dozens of ways to tackle scenarios at once, and Serious Sam 4 delivers here. On top of there being more weapons than before, there is also alternate fire for most of the weapons, a series of gadgets that are all really fun to use, and a skill tree with abilities to unlock.

I really can't stress how approachable this game is – the first thing I did was go for the dual wield unlocks, which on top of the alternate fire modes, opens up the weapons enormously. You can switch between dual wielding on the fly [b](I strongly recommend binding it to the back key on your mouse)[/b], which deprives you of the alternate fire but effectively increases your firing speed.

Weapons like the single shotgun, which normally in a Sam game you ditch after the first five minutes, is suddenly far more useful if you can switch between using the long-range grenade launcher and dual wielding which gives you rapid fire on the go. All the weapons are fun to use, especially this one NEW ONE which is one of the best things I've seen in a game ever – you'll see what I mean.

The gadgets are all fun and varied, and each change the gameplay in distinct ways. The healthkits help if you can't be bothered to go hunting through the enormous levels for health. I will admit that some weapons and gadgets are somewhat OP, but as far as I'm concerned, this is in the excessive spirit of the Sam series.

It would be a shame to have all this powerful weaponry at your disposal and the firefights weren't large enough to match. Things can seems slow in the first few missions, but about an hour or so in and it absolutely feels like the enemy levels are on par with the first and second encounters. There are more enemies than any other Sam game (notably none of them are boring and annoying like in SS3) and Croteam has the placement, spawn timing and enemy combinations down to a fine art.

It's a really great feeling to be fighting a mix-up of enemies, to have a couple of new enemies trickle in, and then a few seconds more you're adjusting your strategy to compensate for how the situation has seemingly naturally evolved. I found myself doing something I mentally dubbed “Sam-grin”, where all the elements of the game were coalescing so perfectly that I find myself involuntarily grinning like a maniac.

The levels themselves, while looking great, can be sprawling affairs and sometimes there a bit too much walking around. While this is a series staple, it's compounded here as there are a lot of dead ends and things really are MASSIVE. Though there are a tonne of secrets to find, there's still a lot of useless space to get lost in. I'm suspecting this might contribute to the low FPS reported by some players.

The game has the decency to throw you a vehicle now and then. If you're getting Serious Sam 2 flashbacks, I wouldn't worry, because this time you use your own weapons to shoot instead of the boring weapons on the vehicle, which feels more natural in a Sam game. There's a few areas where I was seriously vibing with the driving in this game, but your mileage may vary in that area :)

The bosses are massive and are fun to kill. I wish there was more of them.

[b]Writing[/b]
Croteam's budget has clearly gone up from the level of a PS1 game to the level of a PS2 game, which has enabled them to create the most ambitious Sam game in terms of storytelling. If you're even remotely aware of the Sam series, you'll know this to be an utterly absurd statement. SS4 offers a more complex narrative this time around. Don't worry though because there is plenty of tongue-in-cheek cheese to go around!

From right off the bat several hundred characters with actual personalities are introduced, and it's genuinely fascinating to see Sam Stone, usually a very lonely protagonist spouting one-liners to himself, actually conversing with, reacting to and bantering with other human beings. These guys even join you in combat in some of the levels. They probably talk a little too much, but if one of your points of contention with previous Sam games was the sheer sense of uncanny isolation, then maybe this one will do it for you a little more.

There's also more worldbuilding this time around, with audio logs and letters to find, monologues to listen to in the field. Do you like this shit? It's here. It would have been good if you could play the audio logs while shooting enemies though.

For the most part, the writing is very funny, and I've been laughing very hard at this game at late hours pissing off my neighbours. There's a lot more of the satirical poking at video game and movie concepts introduced in SS3. Unfortunately the game seems melodramatic occaisopally, and while I appreciate the attempt, it just feels plain out of place to me.

[b]Polish and performance[/b]
Despite the clearly increased budget, there's some pretty clear evidence that the game has been rushed somewhat. I'm not sure if it's because of Devolver putting the squeeze on things, or desperate times forcing them to get the product out quick.

I should point out that the 'Legion system', which sounded buzzwordy from the off, is not heavily featured in the game whatsoever. The last couple of missions do feel quite rushed (you don't even get every gadget and weapon in the final mission), but it's still all fun. Despite seeing some bugs, nothing was game-breaking.

I did seem to get low FPS at times, especially when there is a lot of foliage about (and trust me, there is a LOT of foliage about in places). I also saw an loads of graphical hiccups as well, including assets popping into the scene, square on the ground disappearing... I could go on, but while none of things things affect gameplay, I do hope they get patched out. 

[b]Other shit[/b]
The music is fantastic and some of the best it's been at the series, shifting between beautiful, ambient and energetic, and it's all memorable. Too bad it tends to cut out due to bugs but whatever.

There's coop but I've not tried it yet. I'm really hoping PVP multiplayer and workshop support will be added because they contributed a lot of longevity to SS3.

There are some hilariously bad animations and player models in this game, in that distinctively Croteam way. I'd have no issue with this, if the animations for melee attacks weren't so lame.

Melee wasn't as satisfying in this game as SS3. SS3 had an incredible sledgehammer, but in this game we're stuck with the useless knife. To be fair, [spoiler]I did not go down the melee route in the skill tree, so maybe it would have been more fun if I did that.[/spoiler]

[b]Final thoughts[/b]
The game is fucking brilliant but unpolished. If you're not already a fan of old school shooters, or fast-paced action games with large sprawling systems, but I feel this game could surprised you if you don't mind the sound of graphical bugs and slightly inconsistent level design.

I feel like I can't rate it above the old Sam games as, to me, the last two end missions don't feel quite as bombastic as they could be (though the finale is incredible). But it's at least as good as them and arguably the high points are even higher.

I feel like there's a lot I haven't mentioned. It's genuinely hard to find a line between explaining why the game is good, and spoiling some of the shit that left my jaw dropping.",1601493761,1601493761,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197999896590,398,10,858,858,858,1601420778,,

40,76825838,english,"Fun shooting action, as you would expect from a serious Sam game. I do have to say though that it is easily the worst in the series for 2 reasons:
1. The maps are big, but don't have a lot of stuff in them. You can wander for hours through some of the maps only to find nothing. This makes the maps feel empty and disincentives the player from exploring. Where the player does find something the reward usually isn't the greatest, In the form of a minor gadget. Maybe there is a lot more to find and I just haven't found it, I just don't feel like wandering the desert for another hour.
2. NPC's fighting along with the player. This makes big battles seem small and easy. Not every map gives you NPC's the fight along with you but when it does it usually wound up making the game less challenging. It's boring to fight a giant horde, only for me to run around letting the NPC's take care of most of it. If there is more than one character it should be a friend who you're slaughtering countless of enemies with.

That said it's still a fun game, though not everything tried really works for this game. I'd still recommend it.  I do hope the developer improves on its design decisions in the future. The action is still there, It's fun using all the guns and killing things where you do get good battles. Give it a go.",1601491914,1601491914,True,2,0,0.509493708610534668,0,True,False,False,76561198012609890,453,33,1141,1141,704,1601937588,,
41,76821717,english,"A pretty good prequel to the OG Serious Sam games. I am definitely disappointed with how the game turned out, but While its not just as good as the rest of the series and has its fair share of problems, I still very much enjoyed it along with some of the new mechanics it brought along with it. With now 20 hours on the game and the campaign and secret/achievement hunting now all finished, I felt it was time to give Serious Sam 4 a quick review.

Gunplay is fun and rewarding, now with a lot more choices thanks to the upgrades you find along the way. The weapons themselves look and sound great and the large variety will never leave you bored. The executions return from SS3 in the form of the upgrade (S.A.M.) system with the added bonus of health but are far more simplified which I found quite disappointing. S.A.M. is a basic upgrade system that in a nutshell allows you to increase your firepowere or melee prowess alongside a few new interesting skills that can turn the tide of any battle.

Maps, although overly expansive and bland when you explore outside main mission boundaries, are still interesting enough to keep me involved in the game and handled the game's even more crazy horde system quite well.

The Legion system is partly a bit of a meme as Croteam had stated they would have had thousands upon thousands of enemies on screen at a time, only for this to truly only show up once in the entire game, where it is quite unimpressive but still a mildly fun gimmick. However, the enemy count in general has been greatly increased from previous Serious Sam games which I find very chaotic and fun and surprisingly handled very well with the weapon buffs and generous spacious maps, with only a few times i've been overwhelmed on the Hard difficulty setting, as not every section in the levels is balanced 100% yet.

Story was a bit of a letdown for me, I felt the characters were quite boring and cringe bar a few and in general I didn't really know what was going on and where in the timeline this must have been, as I was expecting this to tie up loose ends for Serious Sam 3 BFE but to my surprise i'm left none the wiser. Don't get me wrong the story has never been a strong point of the series but I personally felt something was missing.

Optimisation and Graphics. It must be said that although the graphics arn't very impressive, and the old art style that used to define the Serious Sam games is no longer here to compensate for this. This is especially noticeable when traversing the map as environmental textures can be exceedingly bland and even broken. 

However what truly is a problem is the optimisation. As of writing this review, the game runs like complete bollocks even when I turn the settings all the way down despite having gtx 1080, 16 gigs ddr4 and i7 6700k. I trust that Croteam can fix the issue soon enough, but you know, a stable release would've been awesome.


Music was pretty good, but definitely not as good as the other games.

In conclusion, while the game has a fair amount of shortcomings, I can overlook most of them when I consider the fact that what Croteam tried to pull off here was ambitious as a semi-indie company. When experiencing some rough around the edges aspects of the game I can appreciate that Croteam were trying to mix things up a bit in terms of the Legion system and the greatly expanded maps and weapons to accommodate it and I feel they did so successfully. It is also worth noting that due to Serious Sam's tongue in cheek nature, most people like myself are not expecting a bombshell of a game regarding the drawbacks I previously mentioned, but just a silly and intense shooter experience we've all come to love over 20 years. 

Last of all, I am a HUGE fan of the series as Serious Sam was the first FPS game i've ever played in my life and was a part of my childhood, so I just hope Croteam doesn't give up on the series and takes a more classic approach in their next game. If they produced something akin to the Second Encounter with just the right amount of a modern twist to it, they can't go too far wrong.",1601486448,1601491388,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198008102911,274,13,1241,1241,1143,1601496966,,

first lets start with pros:
-instense and exciting combat
-new features and unbelieveble creativity for the player to choose how to approach the enemy 
-large map envoirements and beautiful view(i believe the game has 8K texture)
-its just beautiful the way they made the game
-the story is really good, full of plot twists and actually shocked me sometimes
-skill trees make the game actually balanced and u can customize at anytime, but here is the thing, u wont get all the skill points on the first playthrough, but once u do a secound playthrough u get all the skill points, making the game replay valuable, now thats genius~
-PAPAMOBILE, SILLY BOI, and vehicles :D
-legion system is badass, like... SUPER BADASS!!!! (read my cons for something bad, but its still badasss :D)
-the jokes are really funny 

and now the cons, naughty naughty:
-legion system appears only once, it was the whole marketting, but it all appeared only once :(
-melee animations are extremely lazy, i expected a brutal approach but honestly, i got something even worse than BFE, i could have got a tale rip out or break neck, but i got fucking knife instead, EVEN FOR LARGER ENEMIES!!!!!
-riding is useless, except werebull and khnum, i cant do much when riding

While this is very subjective, I also don't like the style they went for in this game. It often feels more like a Call of Duty parody than a Duke Nukem parody.

This game is superb if not brilliant old  fashion style shooter game which does not deserve to be overlooked.

it may have some drawbacks like cheap cut scenes, graphips could still be better, loading times shorter,some huge empty areas smaller,but this is negligible and should not be a problem because in return you get once again  exceptional fun shooting  game

Provided, of course, that you know exactly what this game has to offer, the only possible dialogue with hordes of attacking aliens with fun weapons in hands, where the only goal is to shoot and kill all the stupid aliens which  attack you in a straightforward  line waves , revealing secrets again and laughing to  Sam's funny one-line comments  and, most importantly, you have that rare and unique feeling of survival with a heartbeat in your throat,when you are suddenly  all alone in front of threatening hordes of enemies.

For someone who doesn't know this franchise well, this is not COD,the only tactic here is to shoot and kill ,It is true that you are merely shooting  masses of dumb aliens, which will deter some immediately. But the attacks of the enemies  in this old-fashioned based game  are masterfully timed, game  isn't varied,but  tense and fun, and all together  connected into a coherent whole. 

Croteam has the right feeling again  and in the end you have it yourself. A feeling of pleasant fulfillment when the last villain falls..
SS4 is  a hymn to old fps ancestors, starting with Doom ,a resurrected tyrannosaurus    which deserves more roar, a newly revived game from some other past time,with an old game recipe that modern younger gamers will  not understand best

Serious Sam 3 didnt really hit the spot for me, and I´m glad to say I feel this is more like the Second Encounter (just make sure to switch graphics filter to Vivid). 
They made the old weapons feel fresh, giving them real weight and it feels satisfying blowing up enemies with the double barreled shotgun at close range. Or with the new dual wield system, a DOUBLE double barreled shotgun.
They also added some accesories which replaces the ""Serious Damage"" and ""Serious Speed"" making them usable when you yourself feel like you need it, a nice touch.
The difficulty setting scales well, and the battles are well paced where you sometimes face enemies requiring a litte more finesse, and sometimes you just got to blast the sh*t out of them. 
They have also added a skill point system, which I find kind of nice. It adds some depth and gameplay changes which makes you excited everytime you get to level up.
One thing I kind of miss though is the quirky secrets, one of the things that made Second Encounter so enjoyable (I loved the developer disco). Don´t get me wrong, there are secrets but mostly in form of ""hidden armor"" or ""extra ammo"". Often exploring for secrets only lead you to empty hallways where you´d think there should be some fun stuff, but due to time issues they just forgot to add them.

Longer campaign that picks up quickly, no more waiting until the last 4 missions for things to get interesting.
 
More weapons with the best gunplay the series has seen so far. Alternate fire modes and duel wielding are really nice touch.

Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying the banter and cutscenes. It's a schlocky action movie and it knows it, very self aware. 

Although the day one patch fixed a lot of issues there's still bugs to iron out, I encountered one or two but your mileage may vary.

Performance on my 6 year old system (GTX980ti, I7) allows me to run at 1080p, on high, at a locked 60FPS, so I'm more than happy with that!

Overall a solid 8.5/10 from me....Graphics are a tad retro in places, and the characters are just way too shiny :-)",1601449152,1601449152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198053016810,285,6,170,170,96,1601625870,,
73,76797879,english,"Short version: Pretty good. Rough around the edges, needs some polishing to optimize performance, maybe add a few more packs of enemies to one specific level, and fix a few of the bugs like the missing Devastator scope. Otherwise the game is an absolute blast to fight through with a nice variety of weapons, jokes, locations, and enemies. 7/10. (Might update later if Croteam updates the game.)

Long version: Well, we're back and this time it's not another trip through Egypt (Thank god). This time we go through a nice variety of locations: Greece, France, Italy, Russia, and so on. The actual levels are pretty nice all things considered. Sizeable arenas for larger fights, and secrets galore, the latter of which is a little disappointing at times with difficulty vs reward. But overall the rewards are often very powerful, making for a much more Serious experience.

Weapon variety is huge as always, including a newer Rocket-Chainsaw Launcher. Dual-wielding making a more formal introduction this time around sees that you have the excessive firepower to push through massive hordes, on top of the ability to ride on the backs of certain enemies through the introduction of unlockable skills. And the best part is there's no grind. Just like Doom before it, you find SS4's version of Argent Energy, and pick a skill to unlock as you move down the branches. It's very simple, adds a lot to the gameplay, and doesn't demand more of the player while doing so. Just that they look good doing it.

A few problems I ran into the game included the aforementioned Devastator scope simply missing, only being just a couple of floating lens caps. There was a bit of texture pop-in, quite a bit of terrain clipping, and brief holes in the ground at times. But overall the game ran smooth enough that I was able to finish it without much trouble on Normal difficulty.

Overall I'll give this game a Recommendation with caution. It's a flawed game right now, and needs work. And I will agree the price tag is a little high for the quality. But if you're looking for something to scratch that itch the way Doom Eternal didn't with it's lack of ammo, look no further, because there's the usual excess.

Pros:
+Feels like Serious Sam 3 with movement, even when you spam jump and feel like you're gliding.
+Gunplay is vastly improved as well as lighting, visuals, animations, balance, and makes you feel seriously bad ass.
+Secrets are just as hard to find, if not harder. Some are easy but majority are nuts.
+Level design is a tad different but not bad, and it still delivers those staple moments though when you're in a large area wreaking havoc.
+No enemies have hitscan. No cover, all man.. for real this time.
+New weapons and items are dope and put BFG to shame. Still love you BFG but black hole grenades are too seriously sick.
+New skill tree system with actual fun stuff to unlock, like dual wielding. Helps make secret finding even better as it can give more skill points.
+Troll secrets that screw you over are still in!
+Is overall just as fun as the past games, if not better. A truly good SS game that delivers fun combat.

Cons(Now before I get into cons, the devs are still wanting to improve this game and say there's major changes and improvements they will make, these cons may become irrelevant!):
-Ugly facial animations, just like SS3.
-Story isn't fantastic but not bad either. It honestly depends on the eye of the beholder with the story.
-Melee doesn't make you feel seriously bad ass anymore :(. Now it's just quick stab-in-the-eye animations, instead of ripping their eyes out, you instead quickly poke their eye. Very, very underwhelming melee animations that are so bad I'm almost certain they'll update them.
-Music, while really good, gets repeated a lot in pretty long missions.

[b]The good:[/b]
* More guns...and some of the older classics have new special attachments. 

* Gadgets to use to help out with the seriousness. 

* The friendly-AI actually can shoot somewhat.  Typically they are just a distraction for the masses of baddies to distract your fire, but you do not have to revive them so that's nice. 

* [b] Some [/b] of the humor is genuinely funny.  

* Seems more difficult than Serious Sam 3: BFE.

* The RPG-like upgrade feature is nice and has good upgrades for building your character.

* The setting and atmosphere of the game is good, but may have been better in previous entries.  There is a sense of bleak-ness when you listen to the resistance-radio and some of the characters in the game.  Other times this can clash a bit with the juvenile jokes from some of the other characters.  The ruins do not look bad, but they do seem bland compared to some of the other games.  I'm not even out of Italy on the game so hopefully this improves. 

[b]The bad:[/b]
* The facial animations during cutscenes...  or lacktherof.  There are hardly if any facial animations.  Yes the jaws go up and down and yes the characters blink, but that's about it.  I think I've seen puppets with more facial expressions.  Case in point: Quinn's eyes and face are haunting.  If there was a alternate universe where Steve Buscemi was able to procreate with other Steve Buscemi's and increase the Buscemi-ness of their eyes, you would have Quinn be a descendant of his during 2095 or whenever the game's timeline takes place. 

* Some of the humor falls flat. I don't mind it much when it does since they are at least trying and it still adds more to the game.  I did not expect thought provoking or knee-slapping humor like from some AAA RPG games.  That said some of the banter did crack me up a little. 

***[b]***The biggest gripe is that the engine seems to be a bit more clunky than in Serious Sam 3: BFE.  They increased the number of enemies by quite a bit so I guess there are some trade-offs, but hopefully future patches will help with this.  I should note that it is still playable for me.  I have not experienced any crashes or major glitches.

No joy in getting points, just a small sigh of relief that you're getting closer to how you should have been.

The rewards for doing some secondary objectives are so extreme and game changing it's practically like playing different difficulty levels when you get them. Do every single one you find, unless you want to keep the difficulty at maximum.

I had so much fun, great gameplay, great music, actual hordes of enemies, it is a masterpiece. I will play it with friends in co op and for me it is the first game ever for which I want a DLC, I just want more of this!

Ok so the thing that everyone wants to compare this to is Doom Eternal. There is some merit to it, but for me Serious Sam is much more fun, more varied fun weapons and you aren't allways out of ammo. The game allows you to choose how you handle the enemies. At least half your weapons will be viable ones for any given situation, be it a horde of cannon fodder, or a far away sniper. The gadgets are great and very usefull for getting through tough fights. 

There is fun yet fucked thing about secrets in this game. You want secrets, but maps are huge, but they give you gadgets that will save you in very tough fights, but the game punishes you for taking too long on the score screen, but it also encourages looking for them in the score screen, but to get the secrets you pretty much need to go out of bounds, but if you do it in seemingly right place you see the glitching textures of a place you shouldn't be in, The secret hunting is mad fucked, it is fun but there are so many places where you think you should go to get a secret, but insted landing out of bounds...

Now for complaints, my only one is that  the first part in Rome seem like it was made as a side project with every asset of the ruins taken from The Talos Principle, there is far too much ruins with too little variety. the game gets better with that after the crab, but damn, I got sick of seeing theese textures. There is that  specific lack of asset variety, most of the buildings are copy and pasted far far to many times, trees too. Speaking about locations in game -> [spoiler] I wish there was more of Russia, or that most of the game would took place there, if it were then low amount of buildings and other assets wouldn't be as noticable if mixed with comblocks. France was ok, not great not terrible and Rome was great from the bridge level. I wish there was a roof level, it seemd like a wasted opportunity. [/spoiler]

Let's get the technical details out of the way as soon as we can. Yes, Serious Sam 4 is not a bug-free game, and that's an understatement. There is quite a lot of problems on a technical standpoint, however, I will not specify the bugs I have encountered myself, as these could be the result of my specifications being well below the minimum requirements of the game. With that out of the window, let's move onto the juicy parts of the freshly released long-awaited croatian FPS.

[b] CHAPTER 01: DEATH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW. [/b]
Serious Sam 4 does not change the formula of the classic Sam gameplay too much, and that's exactly why the game excels at what it's supposed to be. Unlike some of the recent FPS's that's been trying to innovate, and in the process, strayed too far way, Serious Sam 4 does not repeat that mistake. It's the same action-packed, non-stop adrenaline-filed guns-a-blazing game as all those years ago. The usual arsenal of a self-respecting hero consists of well-known to every Serious player out there shotguns, assault rifle and minigun, lasers, rocket and grenade launchers, cannon, sniper rifles and there are a few fine new additions such as Autoshotgun and Chainsaw Launcher. The weapons look and feel amazingly powerful, with weighty animations and crisp shooting sounds - no matter what weapon you use - Serious Sam 4 makes each and every gun feel distinct and satisfying to use.

[b] CHAPTER 02: GATES OF MUSICAL HEAVEN. [/b]
Serious Sam is known for it's music composed by the one and only Damjan Mravunac and the man himself once again composed the entirety of Serious Sam 4. The unique rhythm and style of the soundtrack is immediately recognized, and I honestly think that this might be one of the best game soundtracks so far in recent years. Remixes of the legendary Grand Cathedral and Dunes will not leave any old-time veteran of Sam unsatisfied, and newcomers to the franchise will be pleasantly surprised with just what exactly Mravunac brings to the table.

[b] CHAPTER 03: WHEN IN THE SETTINGS... [/b]
In terms of visual art-style and palette, this is mostly a matter of taste. However, Serious Sam 4 looks sufficiently gorgeous even on the low settings, with the overall look of the game bringing quite a lot of color into the war-torn Rome, France and Russia. Some of the top-of-the-mountain views in later levels were beautiful enough to make me and my partner stop in our tracks and just admire the size of it all for a few minutes.

[b] CHAPTER 04: VIVE LA ONE-LINERS! [/b]
While the overall story of the game is nothing exactly jaw-dropping or thought-provoking, the game has it's fair share of dramatic moments, but it also has a lot of ""So-Bad-It's-Good"" cutscenes where the animation budget really shows, not too terrible, not good. The real jist of it all is in the dialogue between the characters of the game, and the texts in NETRICSA - where you can read up on your friends, foes, weapons and everything else required for the succesful completion of your planet-saving mission. Getting some real writers for the games was a good step in improving the overall quality of the plotline, with characters actually becoming more prominent, with me personally starting to get attached to each and every one of them, having their own quirks and personalities. Additional touches, such as quotes on the loading screen help solidify this.

[b] CHAPTER 05: THE PACKAGE OF NEW TOYS. [/b]
Here we come to the new things that Serious Sam 4 brings to the formula, and that is - Gadgets, Side-Quests and Skill-Points. Gadgets are well-hidden (and sometimes not quite so well) items that you can also acquire from doing side-quests, which take place off the map's main route, gadgets can seriously (no pun intended) help you out of a tough spot, or clear out a large group of enemies in your way of total mayhem, they include, but not limited to, Black Holes, Medical Syringes, Rage Serums and even Mini-Nukes!
Now, skill points are something entirely different. During the game's main story you will find 10 skill points that you can invest into various new skills that help you change the gameplay in interesting ways. Want to dual-wield Miniguns and lay waste to those boney Kleers? We got you, fam. Want to ride the Werebull like in that pre-release trailer? Hell yes you can. Couldn't sleep well knowing that Serious Sam 3 doesn't allow running and shooting at the same time? Your nightmares are over, you can get the skill for that exact purpose. And there's much more.

[b] CHAPTER 06: FROM CROTEAM WITH LOVE. [/b]
In the end, Serious Sam 4 doesn't reinvent the wheel nor does it tries to fix anything that's been working well. However, what it does is that it continues to excel at what it did the best: It's a fun, one-liner filled, tons-of-enemies-rushing-in-your-face bombastic circus of explosions, gore and flying bullets, and in the world of story-driven, ""thinking-man's"" games, this - is just what the doctor ordered. An incredible dose of old-school blazing glory, and may it never change, and remain the way it is, as it does not need to be changed, this - this is the one and only game of it's status.

After all... some games are Eternal. But Sam...?

15-ish maps, some are really really huge and open, others are confined to streets and corridors, only 1 map felt small.
Too bad they still haven't provided a map.
The graphics are very good, I experienced no crash or stutter.
The music is good and a bit like doom, the tempo goes up when the fighting starts.
Many weapons from the previous games, but some got upgrades, the laser weapon got really OP but you burn through ammo faster.
Every map has 1 or 2 side missions which gives you special rewards.
There is a really small RPG side to the game, you can find crates with round things that give you points to invest in mainly 2 branches : dual wielding weapons or melee-ing bigger and bigger enemies.
There is sort of special extra weapon system like a grenade that makes enemies fight each other or a healing kit, even a nuke which kills everything around you. Off-course the better the more rare. Healing kits are not rare, nukes very rare, I only found 2.
And what would a serious sam game be without secrets, there are many on each map, I always really looked around and often only found a few, so there is room for a second playthrough to find all secrets.

10,76774961,english,"I'm a die hard fan of the series. Completed TFE, TSE, SS2 and BFE several times each, each time was fun.
But i have mixed feelings about this one. It feels rushed.

Everything about SS4 has been said by many reviewers so i'll cut my review short :

Pros : 
- Gunplay is fun, as always.

- Cheesy one liners are still part of the experience, and i did laugh on numerous occasions.

- Perk system is pretty forgettable although the dual wielding mechanic is very cool.

- Music is ok, not the best work from Mravunac within the SS franchise, most of the time it just felt over the top and inadequate. A couple of nice tunes i guess although nothing truly iconic like in previous games.

- A handful of nice sceneries and some really nice decor from time to time.

- The color palette used in this game is a welcome change from BFE.

- They did some worldbuilding in the first half of the game which is cool, it was kinda absent in other games. (resistance radio, alien drones patrolling streets delivering the villain's message like Breen in HL2, some graffitis, etc). Much less of it in the second half though which is a shame.

- I DID get some ""WOW"" & ""HOLY s***"" moments here and there, like the big battle in the intro or whenever a huge wave of Kleers was coming my way !

- Some gadgets were fun and useful (holodecoy, Time Bomb)

Cons
- Non existent optimization. I have a nice rig but got some pretty crappy FPS at times in some of the levels. (during the Quarry sequence or whenever using the sniper scope which btw renders the weapon downright unusable).
- Gigantic empty maps. The French countryside map is pretty much just a big terrain with vegetation on top of it to mask how hollow it truly is whenever straying off the main path. Also this map looks as bad as it did in the first SS4 trailers which was one of my fears... also the LOD sucks, you can witness literal trees vanish or fade in as you approach/get away from them.

- Overall lazyness in the production. They re-used a lot of assets from other games (hello there Talos Principle textures and statue models ! Hello there exact same sound effects from BFE! ). Found a door in a France level (Carcassonne) that had italian text on it, the same one from prveious Rome levels kek. This is one of many examples but this is infuriating. I mean come on. I know Croteam is a small studio but if in 9 years between two installments you don't make new assets for a highly expected sequel, it's just downright laziness. I'm willing to hear out the 'they don't have enough manpower' argument but then maybe it's time for the studio to hire some people ? Like artists, designers etc... and testers which brings me to my next point :

- It feels overall that the game didn't receive of whole lot of testing. I was playing on serious (hardest difficulty) and a battle for me was impossible. The one in France where you have to shutdown an alien portal using five switches to receive i believe 3 black holes (which BTW are pretty much a bad replacement for the iconic serious bomb rip). The amount of Kamikazes in this battle overwhelmed most if not all of my firepower. I even tried using a Chronobomb thingy but that wasn't enough. And don't give me the GIT GUD treatment. I beat the rest of the game pretty easily so yeah.

- Audio. During some of the battles there is so MUCH going on, audio wise, that you just can't hear anything. You have your guns' sound competing with Mravunac's orchestral melodic metal competing with effin cringey NPC's voice lines (totally dispensable during battles imo) competing with the low end mud from countless projectiles and explosions. I have no idea if the devs are using an audio middleware like FMOD or Wwise but if not i would highly suggest using one for their next production. You can actually design a Mixing system with buss hierarchy/priority and whatnot which felt completely absent in this game. Sometimes overall volume of the game would lower itself by a couple of decibels just to readjust seconds later. Whenever a battle ends, gamestate changes from ""You're fighting !"" to ""You're not"" which normally would result in the music gradually fading out to go back to the Exploration version of the level's music. Well, said fade would sometimes NOT TRIGGER which means you go from 100 miles/hour to 0 in a fingersnap which completely breaks immersion.
And finally countless badly edited voice lines (clicks, voice cuts too early, Dick's microphone has a noticibly worse signal to noise ratio than the actors they recorded for the other characters), yadda yadda yadda.

- Scripted final boss fight.

- Bad animation. Aliens are ok, i'm talking mostly cinematics. Ok they did some MOCAP, which shows, it's a step up from previous games, but it still feels clunky. Facial animation is... uh. Characters are as expressive as planks of wood. It's a shame because models are so much better in this one !

- Cringey characters (not all of them that said). Special mention of that german scientist who was the most obnoxious of them all.

- Lighting is meh. Makes ennemies (Kleers mostly) harder to notice.

tl;dr
Clearly rushed and unfinished product which isn't worth its full release price rn, would wait for a sale.
You can have some fun with it if shooting guns at aliens is your thing.

Heck, even GGGman has put something constructive in the market by posting his negative review on YouTube.

But they also need support from the community, and that's why I believe positive reviews such as this one are needed even more.

Despite the technical difficulties (some were patched day 1, and the rest hopefully will get patched in the future) and noticeable places where the game could use some more dev time, I'd say that this game is better than BFE in almost every aspect:
1. Great enemy variety. All but one (monky) BFE enemies are in this game + a bunch of other enemies
2. Shooting feels better, there are more weapons. Some weapons have alternate fire modes which are pretty cool
3. Simplistic perk system only adds to the gameplay. Dual wielding is fun and powerful
4. Environments, while not being great and containing plenty of old Talos assets, are still better than the sandy grey of BFE's Egypt
5. Great music, perhaps the best in the series. The only downside is the lack of lyrics in the Hero remix
6. This game has the most plot and writing in the franchise, and I quite like it. It's campy and funny. There are a few good moments, and some characters can grow on you

Serious Sam has always been a game about cheesy puns, jokes, and guns, lots of guns.

Serious Sam 4 makes some corrections to 3, pulls a little of 2, but forgets a lot of 1 (1st and 2nd Encounter)

So batting as normal, lets see how Sam handles the cage.

1. Graphics (It's a hit, but a foul ball)
I ran the game on my 2060 on each graphic mode, and I find DirectX 11 works the best currently, yet the game is still fraught with Z-fighting textures, pop in conflicts, and LOD issues. Worse yet is when this happens within the cutscenes, which utilize the in game engine, it becomes rather jarring.
I expect more patches to help improve these problems, and they don't fully hamper the game itself.

In game itself, I didn't find issues with any graphical slow down, then again I didn't go out of my way to set the video settings at eye melting max, and honestly when this game is gorgeous it is gorgeous! Especially with the terrain, the landscape (best with the setting sun).

While the land, the use of skybox (odd that there isn't really any actual clouds, but that seems to help save a lot of memory), and the average looking water, the creatures are...muddy.

One of the most important aspects of all the Serious Sam games, is that creatures, bosses, and enemies were very identifiable. They popped out against the terrain making it easier to hunt them down, even among the deluge of enemies bearing down on you!
Serious Sam 4 has a problem with being muddy, the enemies all blend in with the background, that it did become difficult at times to figure out who the heck was shooting me, especially when enemy snipers are popped into towers and the like.
Honestly I feel that Croteam should go and retweak the textures, make the enemies pop out, this was an issue I had with Sam 3, and it continues to be an issue.

Sam 1 and Sam 2 had it just right, where enemy characters were colorful and vibrant. With a game that expects you to annihilate a swath of mooks, it helps that you can see them.

Gameplay (Swing and a foul ball again)
Serious Sam has a serious case of ammo deficiency.
I was able to beat the game, with only a few cases where ammo became really strained, but it did require me using the pistol in situations to clean up lower tier mooks while holding S to run backwards.
I feel at this point, a Perk should have been allowed to increase the ammo that Sam can carry.

You make Serious Sam reload.
The pistol (wish they were revolvers still) is the only exception, always has been. But the rifle, sniper rifle, auto shotty etc. These weapons don't need a reload function, you've already tossed out the overall realism of the game, so why keep the reload concept? Allow us to just spray and pray, the rifle should be just like the tommygun of Sam 1.
Again the pistol is the only exception as that was how it began in Sam 1 with the revolvers, that is fine.

There is a whole lot of nothing going on, even within levels that are contained via walls as opposed to the out doors.
I can't say this is truly a complaint, but a personal feeling. I feel either more mooks should have been added, or you should have closed off more of the level and focused more on the arena zones where Sam fights.
Often times I would go from locations with plenty of cover, but no enemy spawns at all, to locations with nothing to hide behind and all the bulls rushing me down.

Melee finishers
Why? The knife and the old Sam chainsaw were the only exception for needing to dice up the enemy. Melee finishers in Sam 4 are lazy, Sam 3 at least was entertaining in its visceral carnage, but Sam 4's sad poke in the head with a knife finisher is just a big L, LAZY. Remove it, even the supposed bonus of a health boost doesn't matter when the 3 seconds wasted stabbing a mook allows his friends to gather around you and mall you to death.
It commits a major sin, it STOPS Sam's mobility and spends about 3 seconds of wasted time.

Same has pretty much dumped the ability to run fast while strafing, most of you might not notice this, but it is happening. Even worse, there are areas of the game that for some reason, force same to go from a run to a slow jog, parts of the Oil Rig have this at its worst.

Serious Sam isn't Duke Nukem, he isn't Doom Guy. His Serious Sam, he don't punch enemies, he feeds them high caliber lead in buckets full, along side a wash of cannon balls and explosives. Where is my Serious Sam explosive bomb?

Finally the Open World and the Legion System. (Its a hit, not a home run, but Sam can probably make it to 2nd base)

Open World is damn impressive, it reminds me of the game EDF with its huge swathes of land, trees, and buildings. The fact that you can see and travel through the area as far as one can, is impressive, but the emptiness of the land, especially during a World War, is sad. A wasted opportunity to have hundreds of fire fights happening throughout the land.

Legion System
Its...gimmicky at best. Something that should have been shown off more often in the game, even as a background to show that fighting is happening. We see it at the start, and the end, and it is...ehh.
Legion is interesting in that it utilizes hundreds of low poly models on screen at once, but the AI seems similar to the Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator. They all charge one direction, they fire in one direction, rinse repeat. The only real threat are the actual spawned in enemies that all target Sam specifically.

Don't get me wrong, Legion looks cool, it feels great being surrounded by clashing armies, but it just isn't utilized enough.

Overall, the game is fun, its a lot of fun. Even with its minor quirks and need for improvement, it is a Serious Sam game.
I hope that Croteam is willing to utilize this engine for the next Serious Sam game, with minor tweaks and improvements, and more focus on polish, and not feature creep.
Don't get stuck in the loop of ""Ooh, that game did a thing, I want to do the thing too!"" as you did here.

Also yes, the friendly allies with their odd EYEBALLS O_O  is a case of the 3D Modeller and Texture artist. One the whites of the eye are vibrantly white, instead of dispersing light, so yeah it looks like everyone is freaking out. The 3D modeler could have done better to squint the eyes a tad, I mean to say, the Good Father in the game isn't bad.

(Bout me)
I do game development work as a Gov Contractor, and I admire the capabilities of teams like Croteam and others for what they can do, and what they probably have to deal with in development!

You score at least one home run for at least letting the game be fun. If you had forgotten that, I'd be very disappointed.
May your next game have better polish and shine!",1601393591,1601393591,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561197980634342,1036,11,964,964,964,1601391544,,

32,76496517,english,"This game certainly feels like Serious Sam. The core gameplay carries on the Serious Sam traditions and is certainly a lot of fun to play - some old enemies make a nice comeback and the new enemies are fun additions. The dance with the enemies is certainly on point here. Although the melee is less gloriously brutal than in SS3, the guns are the most fun to shoot out of any in the series - though the speed of the rockets definitely needs to be increased, they're currently far too slow. I do wish the assault rifle had a bottomless clip like in the classics, but that and the rockets are my only real complaints with the gameplay. The Rome levels, at least, have a mostly fun level design, if aesthetically it gets a bit repetitive.

The AI also sometimes gets stuck on objects or walls. I've seen other complaints about the pathfinding as well. I don't think it is as terrible as some have made it out to be, but it is noticeable.

The graphics are not incredible, certainly not pushing modern technology to its limits, but it nonetheless looks good. I'm not one who cares about graphics much anyway; as long as it's serviceable then it is good for me. The lip-sync in the cutscenes is flat out not good, and while some of the lines are really quite humorous, others fall pretty flat. I feel that cutscenes are not really a part of the Serious Sam tradition anyway, and I feel that they shouldn't have been included as much, particularly when they are not very high-quality.

The main issue with the game is optimisation. Loading times are aggravatingly slow, and the game is very poorly optimised. I know this isn't just a problem with my PC, as others have said it, and more graphically demanding games run more smoothly on my PC. Even on medium graphics settings, frame drops are frequent.

Overall, it is a fun experience and I recommend the gameplay, but at the moment I would recommend you wait for optimisation fixes, as this is a very irritating issue.",1600975856,1601387194,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047098690,337,51,665,665,665,1601339584,,

This is the greatest modern Sam game money can buy. Returning from the First and Second encounters, Croteam's dickish pill and armor traps and goofy easter eggs make a fun return and enemy groups are able to push you back a mile or two with the sheer numbers. The guns animations and models are pristine with great sound effects and the feedback from shooting enemies is addicting. The skillpoint system allows for plenty of experimenting with what they all do instead of locking you into your route which is a godsend and the gun upgrades are pretty cool.
I have three dislikes about this game, though.
1. Drakonians' are the most dangerous enemy in the worst way with aim patterns that are unpredictable and when you run into a hoard of them with the French Resistance, it is impossible to survive without using a black hole.
2. The cutscenes make me want to bash my skull in. I love the interactions between characters in them, but the animation is like watching mannequins, and why in the hell do characters who find each other phase in five feet away from Sam rather than be distant and call out? Or have Kenny climb out of the hummer window instead of standing there, completely unaffected by the vehicle crash? Something like this shouldn't bother me so much.

*Soundtrack 

Negatives: 
*This is the same backpedal shooter like any previous Serious Sam game, with exactly 2 changes in mechanics: Skill points and Weapon Upgrades and that's it!
*Optimisation is horrible, level design is nonexistent a lot of asses are being reused from The Talos Principle. 
*It has HUGE, but at the same time hollow and boring levels that you'll want to explore to find an occasional secret.
*It doesn't save progress when playing coop so you'll lose all weapon mods when you'll disconnect. 
*Animations are so bad, it's even worse than in Metro! 
*When I saw an intro scene on youtube before the game launched, it was so bad I was sure that this is some fake mod made for SS3, graphics quality is the same like in 2011.

Having played the entire franchise multiple times, including the indie series and console exclusive TNE and Advance, I believe those that crap on this game and 3 are only fans of the first game, not series sam as a whole. Granted I'm sure they will rush to say my opinion isn't valid since 2 is still my favorite in the series followed by first (sue me). 4 contains the same bits of modernizations that 3 had and a few more, but is still the large wave shooter that the rest of the series is and still has a great OST that beats most of the movie esc crap plaguing the industry for the last decade.

That said, there are some criticisms I agree with. For start it is very rough around the edges. While the hotfix did fix some of the most glaring issues, the game is still poorly optimized and has numerous graphical glitches and other weird bugs. Nothing game breaking, but it does detract from the overall experience. Having npcs follow you for some sections was a modernization I agree shouldn't have happened but thankfully they don't get in the way or have to be protected. The legion system was barely used but the Devs flat out said it was a trick and probably best that it wasn't actual thing. I highly doubt having to fight that many enemies at once would have been fun. And yet again, you barely get to use the cannon or laser. Some of the connecting sequences last too long (looking at you first france level). The story is pretty bad and takes itself too seriously (irony) and the supporting characters are Cringe, but I can forgive that as Sam's lines are still golden. Lastely, the sidequest system isn't really rewarding unless it offers a weapon upgrade or early access to said weapon.

Despite the many issues plaguing the obvious rush to finish, I enjoyed the game from start to finish for the 20 hours it experience all the content and the game brought a smile to my face many times, which is more than I can say about a lot of recent games, including the massively overrated doom eternal. this game lets me rip and tear how i want.

Regardless of actual gameplay, from a technical standpoint it's a pure disaster:
1. Loading times are ridiculously long, ranging from 30 second to 1 minute, and that's with the game being installed on fast SSD.
2. Constant stuttering every time new scene loads up.
3. VSync is broken in Vulkan.
4. Missing DLSS, despite being advertised as having it.
5. No AA improvements whatsoever: FXAA just blurs the image while leaving it aliased to hell, MSAA only covers geometry and eats 20% of GPU power, SSAA will literally burn your GPU into ash.
6. Objects pop-ins with each taken step. What's worse, forcing LOD to 0 obliterates GPU performance, so you cannot avoid it.
7. Random spikes in GPU usage. You can see 70% in one spot and then after turning around it suddenly spikes to 100% without anything happening on the screen.
8. The game is playable only in Vulkan. DX12 and DX11 have massive performance issues. I can understand DX11, but not DX12, which was clearly just shoehorned in because of Xbox. Xbox player are up for a treat once this game comes out on their consoles, mark my words on that.
9. The performance in French outdoors went down the toilet. While I could maintain somewhat stable 60 FPS outside fights in Rome, in French fields I was dipping to sub-40 FPS just by standing still.
10. Game crashes when switching to DX12, an API that is recommended by devs themselves.
11. Animations are atrocious and on pair with Painkiller and F.E.A.R. from 2004 and 2005, which is unacceptable in 2020.
12. Voice acting and dialogues are worse than in any other SS game, despite hiring TTP writers.
13. NPCs are so loud that they are nearly yelling at you. Even if they are several meters away, you can still hear them as if they are talking directly into your ear. It's year 2020 and we are blessed with a game with NPC voice lines that aren't coming from NPCs.
14. Lighting is truly disgusting, making everything look flat and interiors outright unwatchable. Which is quite shocking considering that The Talos Principle looked so much better.
15. Literal sky wallpapers instead of fully dynamic skyboxes with volumetric clouds. Except for burning Pompeii, which does beg the question why they didn't use them everywhere, or at least in majority of levels.
16. Cutscenes run worse no matter what, with massive frame drops and texture errors. But since they are badly done anyway, you can just skip them and ignore them completely.

56,76748243,english,"I started this game with medium expectations, it's Serious Sam after all, not to be taken too seriously. The first 5 hours were fun, even if the graphics are from 2015. 

The game totally falls off a cliff as soon as you beat the boss in the Roman Colosseum though. It turns into complete bland filler, with a boring straight line walk with a mech, and a boring boss fight with said mech. 

The next mission drops you out of a helicopter into the French countryside without all the weapons you had miraculously kept up your ass until this point. This is where the game became unplayable for me. I despise games that forcibly make you lose progression just to gain it back again. 

Not only that, the games performance plummets while trying to render the shitty looking grass in the wide open countryside. Playing at 1440p ultra on an rtx 2080, I had seen 90-100fps till this point. Now the game ran at 30-60, jumping all over the place even with all the pop-in and shit graphics. 

You then ride a motorbike for 3 minutes for no reason, then run across the open field again while a billion enemies chase you,which was fun when I had all the weapons I had amassed, like the rocket launcher and minigun, but is now just a chore. This mission was plain terrible and I just wanted to get it over with but then I get to drive a crop harvester across another open field. 

3 crappy vehicle sections in a row, poor graphics, poor performance, and the loss of all my weapons totally ruined the experience for me in the space of 30 minutes.

57,76491329,english,"First of all, it is one of the worst game launches I've ever seen.

Technical issues are omnipresent, game can bug out on you, textures stops loading, light effects start to cover up you screen, to the point of crash.
A lot of maps, mosly early Italy ones are obviously rushed as heck.

You acutaly can see a drawing tool shapes used to paint ground on the map in the editor.
Often you can notice textures mirroring on the wall, not covered by anything.

Some... wierd graphical bugs with terrain rising and lowering depending on how far are you looking at, water reflections with quality level of Gameboy. Some distant models and textures looking worse than one in 2000 RPG games.

Many maps are bland, unfilled, yet again, rushed. Early music hardly changes, not fitting bombastic mood of everything going on around you.

Trees and grass loads 10 meters ahead of you, you can walk on a grassy cliff just to notice 5 sec later you walked into small forest. You can feel the ""hand of console"" with deterring that shows everywhere, on trees, far shadows, reflections...

Most of the animations are... just...boy... let's not start about that knife swing...\


The worst part about animations in this game is, totally rushed, unloved by their creator, melee kill animation... every...single...one of them... They somehow look worse than 9year old ones, and looking at them really hurt, when you remind yourself of Doom Eternal.

Most enemies come from old Serious Sam games. Same goes for the weapons.

But, when you look past all of this. You notice, that this is Serious Sam game. After first encounter with Scrapjacks I had my hopes rekindled and I kept on playing. Around 3 hours in, on a one of side missions was the first time I've got stomped by hordes of enemies. It was the first time I had to bite the bullet and just bring my A game with fighting countless enemies attacking me all at once. After that I knew game is in there, under this thick sheet of bugs and rushed content.
And it is. Later in the game I had more fun than I had playing Serious Sam 3. And at points, it is harder and more satisfying (for me) than Doom Eternal, that I managed to beat on Nightmare first try, then Ultra Nightmare. Some fights are straight unfair for you, you are either forced to evade missiles and enemies chasing you, that you have never even had on your screen, since you are also forced to pick and choose targets sniping you from half of the map away with homing hellorbs or half hp-worth range shots
.
Some design choices are just plain weird, but they haven't stopped me from absolutely loving combat in this game. For sure fact that I manage my expectation when It comes titles like this helps me look past all these horrible things. I think this game need a big patch, that fixes all that was left out.

74,76535482,english,"Simply put this isn't the Serious Sam I remember.

You can box SS into whatever sort of basic elements you think define it, but for me the charm of the old SS games were:

1. The environments that sparked a heavy sense of wonder and mystery. The ones that made you feel like you were exploring an alien land, or a lost and forgotten civilization--yet still felt like works of art.

2. The way the game would toy with you, leaving you anxiously wondering what traps, pranks or terrifying yet creative situations were ahead of you. (You could tell the tricks in old SS games were genuinely having fun with the player and weren't just there to satisfy the presence of them.)

3. The subtle and cheesy humor that wasn't pushed to the point of cringe, or trying to be directly self-aware.

4. The presentation of new guns, arenas, and enemies in that special croteam way--the way that gave you a haunting anticipation of whats to come after you enter that wide-open courtyard ominously built like a battleground, or after you grab that new gun placed in the perfect spot for an ambush.

And 5. The game took itself seriously. It was cheesy, it was lacking in narrative substance, it had secrets and humor that broke the 4th wall, but it definitely wasn't wrapped around a running joke about one-liners seemingly making fun of itself throughout the entirety of the game. It was a personality that the game had that seems to have just perished into a bad joke.

76,76516066,english,"After briefly freaking out that this game might be bad, I was slapped in the face with a big dose of adrenaline and a swift kick to the serious balls! I've been a longtime fan of Serious Sam. I played the First and Second Encounter when I was just a wee lad, and it instilled in me a love of Egyptian architecture. That and Age of Empires 1 and 2 really got me liking culture, myth, and architecture of various civilizations including ancient ones. But now Serious Sam is back baby and in proper form! But this form is a bit... warped, if you will. For one thing, this game is poorly optimized to shit. I'm not sure if those system requirements are some kind of cruel joke, but reports have come in that the game doesn't really even fully utilize an 8 core processor like my Ryzen 7 3700X, and it has a tendency to overuse or under-utilize GPUs such as my RX 5700 8GB. There's absolutely no way that my GPU can't handle parallax textures, but increasing that video setting wrecks performance for some reason. Another example of it under-utilizing the video memory and power of a GPU. However, the technical problems with the game mostly end there, besides maybe one Arachnoid having a seizure in place and pretty bad pop-in, I've found that switching to Vulkan or DirectX12 fixes the performance problems! You might get some stuttery framerates, and mini freezes, but Croteam promises to fix these. I seem to be having a smooth experience with minimal or no crashes. Once again, luck is on my side, but I feel the pain of those dealing with problems. The game, in my opinion, looks pretty beautiful and better than Serious Sam 3, but doesn't warrant the kind of hardware melting effects it's having for some players.

Serious Sam 4, despite the technical problems, is quite frankly much better than Serious Sam 3. There's people who have the serious balls to claim that it's somehow worse than 3 ( despite me actually enjoying 3, regardless of its bad level design ). The gunplay is just... exquisite. The guns are so meaty, hit so hard, and feel so good to shoot. Just the sense of recoil and destruction, from the littlest shotgun to the biggest minigun, you can't go wrong with the combat in Serious Sam 4. Enemy variety is better than it's ever been, and EVERYONE IS HERE (TM), and every weapon is here to kill them with plus a ridiculous chainsaw rocket launcher. Every single ugly bastard we've fought across First and Second Encounter, and the third installment, are here. Each bringing in their own unique abilities that force you to change up how you do your dance of violence that consists of circle strafing, backpedaling, or just straight up rushing into the fray. Combat is an utter delight and an addictive rush that I want to keep coming back for more to experience! I've never seen this many enemies in a Serious Sam game, and it's a RUSH!

To aid you in battle, you can actually upgrade your weapons and abilities. It's a natural evolution and to be expected. I was surprised at how good the skills are, because some of them alter the gameplay or take advantage of features that Sam fans often dislike such as reloading but for the benefit of the player. Such as reloading a weapon increasing it's rate of fire for a few seconds. And these skills can be re-spec'ed at any time! Weapon upgrades are what you'd expect, some of them pretty wild, and some of them pretty inspired by Doom. Such as a grenade launcher on your pump action shotgun. But the wild ones include such upgrades as a multi homing rocket launcher upgrade that is just... *Chef's kiss.* This is a welcome addition to the game series. You also get cool gadgets such as a time control device that slows time, allowing you to bullet time your way to victory Max Payne style.

What about level design? Well, the biggest problem with Serious Sam 4 is that it puts its weakest level FIRST to ruin everyone's first impressions. Luckily, this level is very short and not indicative of the rest of the game... at all. I mean, even that level isn't THAT bad. The levels are more varied, more beautiful, and more fun than Serious Sam 3's levels. Sometimes, they feel even better than First and Second Encounter which is probably blasphemy for me to say. Plenty of the levels feature big open spaces and fairly open exploration, especially with the side missions. And rejoice, secret fans, because secret areas are plentiful. They do include standard secrets that grant you goodies to help you in combat, but then we have the GLORIOUS RETURN OF FUNNY AND CRAZY SECRETS! Caps for serious emphasis. I was barely expecting them, but I've found at least THREE funny and crazy secrets. I'm sure there's even more, as I barely found that many secrets because quite a few are well hidden. As for the level design that contains said secret areas, they have been pretty good so far. The pace is varied, some are meaty and some are short. There's plenty of corridors that lead into big open fields, and little mazes too. You can undertake side missions, and they aren't required to progress which might be a way for players to challenge themselves since side missions award cool upgrades and weapons. Different kinds of terrain, and differently shaped arenas, ensure that you'll be kept on your toes. The level design absolutely demolishes Serious Sam 3's with its overuse of dusty brown tombs and depressing slums.

Another divisive element is the story. Is it bad? Is the voiceacting bad? Hardly. Serious Sam was always about being as cheesy as humanly possible, but with A LOT of heart. Expecting this game to be The Last of Us 2 ( even if comparing games to movies is a fool's errand ), takes some serious balls. I quite frankly enjoyed seeing Sam in a different light, how he values his comrades-in-arms and cares for his friends. He just has a different, more distinctly Serious Sam way of showing friendship that involves fist bumping, one liners, poking fun at the new guy ( but it's tough love ), and cussing. The way Serious Sam 4 explores the lore of each alien further, including that of returning characters such as Quinn from Serious Sam 3 and Rodriguez to boot, is honestly a welcome addition too. The voiceacting isn't even that terrible either by the way, the stiff animations are the thing that ruins the drama and are the lowlight of the story cutscenes. But Serious Sam has ALWAYS looked like this with very awkward animations, and it's a matter of opinion if you think it really hurts this game. The story isn't bad, it's standard Serious Sam stuff, let it pass.

The music is great, I don't know what else to tell you. A mixture of epic orchestral tunes combined with good 'ol metal! It gets you pumped up for battle when you need it, although my favorite songs are in the ""Citadel Suite"". The music, in a way, has upgraded itself to match the modern Serious Sam game.

The graphics are really not THAT bad. As I've said, they don't warrant the technical issues. But the poor optimization really hurts this area of the game, and it's genuinely baffling. But I think they are gorgeous and have a certain aesthetic. The textures are pretty crisp and detailed, lighting and shadows aren't bad, with lots of colors to go around. Definitely more eyecandy than Serious Sam 3 with its brown and yet more brown. Visually, it's really not up to snuff compared to games that comparatively run BETTER while LOOKING better. But within its class of lower budget indie games, and its own franchise, Serious Sam 4 is the best looking game in the series to date.

What about game length? Oh my god... I can't even believe how long this game is! I'm amazed!

I think that just about covers Serious Sam 4 without spoiling anything, it's meaty and will entertain for HOURS. It's really not bad at all. Serious Sam 3 faced the same kind of hatred when it first came out, and this too will die down to make way for appreciation of this fun as hell game! I recommend this game!

80,76735658,english,"SS4 does gameplay extremely well. It's a Sam game, through and through; it might not be the best in the series but it's definitely a solid edition.

This game's narrative and story are seemingly quite controversial, however I enjoyed it immensely. It's silly, stupid, but the writers knew this and embraced it fully. The main cast of characters at the end of the day are fun to listen to due to their personalities.

This game does come with some issues, however; the Legion System crops up for only one location in the game, and it's really simplistic in its execution. It's mindless fun just slamming everything you have at everything Mental can shove at you, however throughout the rest of the campaign, you never see a truly ridiculous enemy count like we all hoped for. The enemy counts, I think, are more than in previous games, however they still could have gone much further.

93,76726680,english,"As long time fan who has beaten every mainline Serious Sam multiple times, and who was excited enough to pre-order this game: l am extremely disappointed.

l'd say Serious Sam 4 feels like an expansion for BFE, were it not for the fact that it somehow looks noticeably worse... despite being release 9 years later! Graphical it looks like an Unreal Engine asset flip; even worse, it has no art style. Go to any SS game before BFE, and you can remove all the enemies and HUD from the screen, and still instantly recognise it as a Serious Sam game. Do the same treatment to this one and it'll look like a generic early access survival game on steam, with its completely empty flat grasslands and copypasted generic streets, and... Talos Principle assets.

Remember when I said this could be a DLC for SS3? It's actually a DLC for Talos Principle (Talos is a masterpiece and SS4 is not, don't get me wrong). Half of the first chapter and the entire second chapter look EXACTLY like they were ripped from Talos; except in that game, they were actually fun. It was just boring narrow or small generic roman ruins after roman ruins; completely insipid, uninspired, and unmemorable. I'm in Game Design university myself and l'm no stranger to copy-pasting code or assets from project to project, but come on guys. Couldn't you create a single new tileset in 9 years?

Also, remember that whole Legion System with ""hundreds of thousands of enemies on screen""? That was a scam. It's only present on the first (and as l later researched) last levels. And it's not even that good. It's mostly hundreds of faceless foot soldiers, who are so far away and so small that shooting them has no feedback or sensation, with a couple major bio-mechs here and there, but l can assure there are levels in TFE or TSE with twice as mine bio-mechs are in this level.

The following is a point that probably only l in the entire world care about, but l'm mentioning purely because Serious Sam 2 is my favourite SS and Doom Eternal is my favourite FPS in a long time:

They tried to imitate Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal's weapon mod system, and l do mean imitate it, but not even that well. Only the shotgun, rocket launcher, and laser rifle have a mod, and guess what. The shotgun's mod is a grenade launcher (same as in Doom), and the rocket launcher's is a lock-on (again, same as in Doom). This annoys me because:
- If you're gonna copy a game, at least do it right. Every weapon in Doom has 2 mods, meanwhile in SS4 only 3/12 weapons have mods, and only one to choose.
- SECONDLY, because SS2 had a much more elegant solution to this, but Croteam would rather badly ripoff another game instead of reusing one of their own (GREAT) mechanics. In Serious Sam 2, you have a grenade button. Period. Any weapon, at any time, press right click and boom, you throw a grenade. Best part? It didn't even interrupt your shooting.


I could keep going on about stuff that greatly disappointed me, but I don't want to waste my time with this game anymore. I'm going to refund it now.

The things i loved about 4 were the environments are beautiful! Even on Medium settings. It does need a bit more optimization to it. I never experienced any crashes pre 1.01 but i did notice that some of the cutscenes would be really skippy from time to time and the load times in between levels are WAY too long. Even BFE had better load times but thats a minor complaint.

I love how open some of the levels are but at the same time there are parts of each level that seem too empty or not enough enemies spawn to keep you on your toes at least when i was playing on Normal, not sure what Serious looks like.

I wish there were a couple more newer guns but i love the new Rocket Propelled Chainsaw launcher. Its really fun to use. The upgrades to some of the weapons is also an interesting touch to spice up gameplay. Only one I rarely used was the Grenade Launcher's secondary fire. It just didn't seem that practical to me.

The intro of skill points and S.A.M feels weird and an odd placement in a serious sam game but it isn't anything that bugs me just seems a tad out of place. Talking about things that are out of place the story of the game in general seems somewhat out of place but luckily cutscenes are skippable.

The soundtrack is amazing! Remixes of Hero and the Theme from the Grand Cathedral level from TSE even the music that plays when your exploring and not fighting is really good. Only problem is they use the same songs for like 3-4 levels in a row and after a while that idle music gets old.

Overrall Serious Sam 4 is a solid game with some more minor optimizations and maybe a couple content patches it good be even better. My favorite is still Second Encounter but i think i can argue that 4 is better than 3 in several ways.

2) [b]Lack of multiplayer/PvP[/b] - Pretty much self explainatory. After you finish the storyline, there is nothing else you could do besides playing the campaign again alone or with friends. Also the lack of Survival mode is really disturbing in a Serious Sam game.

3) [b]Boring achievements[/b] - most of the achievements are earned by simply finishing the levels or completing side quests, there are almost no achievements adding something to the game, for example [i]Find all the Secrets[/i] or [i]Finish the campaign on the hardest difficulty[/i] and that's pretty disappointing considering the achievements the previous Serious Sam games had.

Like being able to dual wield cannons, ride Werebulls, a new headshot system that crits enemies, equipment like a Black Hole to Shift-Delete enemies or vehicles like a Mech and Combine Harvester(complete with a banjo tune!). Old enemies make a return with some changed behaviour and thank goodness you're not rushed with kleers until you have a decent arsenal.

There's also some overpowered bosses and a few broken spawn triggers while you can't unlock everything in the skill tree and a couple of other bugs but nothing game breaking. Things can be improved.

My hardware is:
3GHz 6 core CPU
16 Gb DDR3 RAM
And 2Gb VRAM NVidia video card, below minimum specs.
(Running on Win7 with DX11)

Game automatically decided to run without shadows and AA, but a quick kick in the settings remedied that.

After that I've played through the entirety of singleplayer campaign on medium with minimal issues and playable framerate.

It only crashed at me when exiting from the game, so I didn't had even nearly as many problems as some of the people there. Mostly just some small visual jank that didn't get in the way.

Will it work for you? Hell if I know. 

Now, about the game itself.

It's rough around the edges. No denying that. Especially in cutscenes. But that's... 

That's not important. Story is secondary. Graphics are secondary. Only one thing matters.

It is a Serious Sam. You grab a gun and turn several hundred enemies into bloody gibs. That's it.

It's a better Serious Sam than 3rd part, for me - it's not a visually boring brown mess. At least, after the first act.

Weapons are mostly the same, and in the same time some of them are different - weapon upgrades offer helpful and destructive options without littering weapon list. Gadgets are... There. I used them once or twice during the whole game, mostly because I like just shooting stuff.

Skill system is an interesting addition. Nothing compares to turning a horde of kleers into dust with two miniguns. Or insta-gibbing toughest bastards in the game with two charged cannon ball headshots at once.
(Tip: you can re-allocate skills at literally any moment. Just open Nettie, click and hold on a skill to remove it and get the point back.)

In visual design, it's a step forward from SS3, towards SS1. And that's a good thing. The grass is green, the sky is blue and the blood is red - properly balanced, as all things should be.
Can't say much about technical aspects of the graphics, as I don't care.

Story is... There. It's mostly for fun and to serve as an excuse for game to happen, to be honest, so it shouldn't be taken too seriously.
[spoiler] Here we meet Sam's team of misfits - ""Designated moron"" Rodrigez, ""Stoic black guy who dies first"" Jones, ""Sam, but a girl"" Hellfire, ""Conspiracy theorist who's right twice a day"" Carter, ""Team Mom"" Quinn and ""Asshole traitor"" General Brand, with a help of ""New guy who dies by the end"" Kenny and ""Holy man with a shotgun"" Father Mikhail - that goes on an explosive adventure to find the Holy Grail, an ancient egyptian artifact brought to Earth from Sirius, and then proceeds to destroy it to kill a big bad guy that came out of nowhere in the last five minutes.

Edit 1
Now That I've finished it and had some time to think, I would still say this game is fun, Janky and silly. some really strange decisions, like taking your weapons away going from some location to location, skills that should be essential locked behind trait points. And reloading. I think it would be better. a world where the assault rifle shoots forever, the auto shotgun shooting forever would make me reccomend it to more people, the shoot/reload while sprinting seems like the strangest one to hold behind skill points, The looter shooter honestly should just be in the default kit. Maybe I'm just a bit butthurt because I couldn't find all the S.A.M,s (trait point upgrades) but I'm going to go back and do this on Serious rather than hard/ tourist.

I have been a Serious Sam player ever since the first encounter released. Hell I was kid back then. Played through Serious Sam 1 part 1 and 2, Serious Sam 2 and finally Serious Sam 3. 

I know in these years old games turn to change over time, Doom, Shadow Worrier and hell even Duke Nukem (sadly we haven’t seen him since forever) and know it’s time for Sam. 

Started the game and got amazed by the amount of enemies that I had to fight a lot of enemies. Although wished Sam would say something like “Let’s get Serious”. Or at least something but it’s ok. Animations in this game are really improved unlike Serious Sam 3’s weird animations which is great well done Croteam. Big big problem is though is the FPS issue. I have needn’t getting constant frame drops whenever I blow up something or splatter enemies using the double barrel shotgun. Either way the game was fun, weapons great animations and really fun to use, enemies old and new are in the house. Story needs a bit of improvement but gameplay just saves it. To tell you this this is a great game. 9/10 gotta fix that frame rate issue don’t know if it’s mine or Croteams fault but I could try upgrading to a rtx 3080.

Overall the game was fun, taking me back to my first time playing Serious Sam. The sense of danger lurking around every corner is still there and the thrill in mowing down a horde is real making me want to keep going no matter how many times i died in the game. But the problems listed were very hard to ignore especially when the story is supposed to build tension between missions making it seem like they were half baked actors who knew they were on a movie set and could not pretend to be scared or angry. Plus, not listed above, there were instances where there was weapons and gadgets that were not possible to obtain, unless it was my own fault for not looking for a way to get them, even when they were glowing purple.

Still I'd recomend this game because though it has its fault its still enjoyable and worth its price.

It doesn't feel like a game made in 2020 and i personally feel for the time waited for the game, it didn't live up to expectations. Then again what more can you do with a Serious Sam game? Well, Crowteam showed us just that! I enjoyed some of the new features added such as the S.A.M.s system and the new Weapon attachments. I liked the idea of adding a story focused game with cut scenes, but this story isn't ""worthy of a movie"" like they said, and the cut scenes!! Golly! The eyes!!! The game in it's current state isn't ready in my view and some of the open maps feel boring and pointless. The music was excellent with some pretty neat call backs to some of the older games.

----------
Ah yes. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaaaaaaaaaahyourself/recommended/41070/]THIS is where the story begins.[/url] Lets break it down.

[h1]Story:[/h1]

Its another prequel. The story hints some ancient Serious Sam lore that only very inquisitive fans knew about beforehand: Sam ""Serious"" Stone was a starship captain who woke the Notorious Mental, causing a cascading avalanche of alien invaders to push humanity back to the brink of destruction.
You take part in a major campaign in Europe this time to acquire the literal Holy Grail. This is before the worst of Mental's invasion, as seen in Serious Sam 3, so things are a bit higher in spirits atleast. There are plenty of humans left, adding a bit of socializing and character building up front, instead of just texts from Netricsa or radio calls.
As far as Chronology, this is as far back as we can go currently. I do hope for a sequel next time, I'd love to see what happens to Sam after Serious Sam 2.

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

[u]Weapons[/u]
The weapons are the best they've ever been in Serious Sam. Returning favorites all around, every one of them look, feel, sound, and operate with great satisfaction, a +1 up from Serious Sam 3 even.

[u]Enemies[/u]
One of the great things about Serious Sam games is that from the very first game, many of them survive throughout the years, in one form or another. This means [b]veteran Serious Sam players already know how to handle the majority of enemies in this game[/b]. Like the weapons, the enemies look the best they've ever have.

[u]Innovations[/u]
To keep things fresh, Serious Sam 4 introduces S.A.Ms into the mix, which are basically perk-points to change or aid how you play, ranging from a melee-centric style to [b]""Dual Wielding with a Vengenace""[/b]. Further, Serious Sam 4 also brings Gadgets to the table, most of which I use as Panic Buttons, much like the Serious Bomb in previous games.

[u]Difficulty[/u]
As far as I can remember, no Serious Sam reached this level of difficulty. Maybe Serious Sam 3 did. Here its quite challenging, mostly for the good reason: Gratuitous amounts of enemies and just barely not enough ammo to handle it all. Fun!

[u]Bosses[/u]
Theres a few bosses in this game. Save for the last one, they're all really fun to fight. As for the last boss, I have my gripes. [b]All of my deaths came from the last boss[/b], but for all the wrong reasons in my opinion: [spoiler]All it really came down to was a difficulty spike via unexpected nukes from the boss, and not enough room or ammo to counter them. Speeding through it was a solution I found.[/spoiler]

[u]Level Design[/u]
This is kinda where Serious Sam 4 gets a little gray. I'd have to score it average marks on level design compared to previous Serious Sam games for the following reasons:

1. Exploring appears to not be rewarded. I travel to every nook and crannies and I find that theres usually [i]nothing[/i]. Given the size of these levels, you'd think there would be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Unfortunately its just nothing. Thats not to say its like that [i]all[/i] the time, I still find some nifty stuff and some secrets [spoiler]like good ol' Serious Sam point blank explosive traps[/spoiler] from time to time but by and large, theres nothing out there.

2. Speaking of secrets, [b]they're far more difficult to find than previous Serious Sam games.[/b] In previous games, I usually had a tell: A crack in the wall, or some hint from exploration (feedback from which is lacking, as stated above) to show me the way to secrets. Here, in tandem with lack of a rewarding exploration system, secrets are, from what I can guess, blended into the scenery. I usually ended a level with 1, maybe 2 secrets out of 12+ secrets in the level. You'd have to sacrifice quite a bit of time to find them all I spose.

3. Arena design. Unlike all other Serious Sam games, in this one you [b]have to watch where you're going.[/b] I found myself getting caught on corner verticies, stopped by a sandbag outcrop, or walking into a dead end I didnt know existed. Thankfully, this only resulted in my death once, but being stopped by a piece of the map can be devestating in a Serious Sam game, not to mention it can break the flow of the game because then I think, ""Crap, lemme turn around right quick and see what Im stuck on so I can get off of it.""

4. Only one level took advantage of something almost resembling an open world level. Though it was remarkably empty. While it was quite beautiful, exploring it, as I've said, yielded little.

5. Finally, some levels are unrefined. Exploration can actually hamper your gameplay in some instances. It only happened to me once, but I managed to find a way through a level that resulted in a soft-lock, and a level restart. Another instance, I was able to get out of bounds: map textures wouldn't load because [i]I got into an area I wasn't supposed to see[/i]. Not exactly game breaking, but a can set you back a few minutes if you're not careful.

[h1]Performance[/h1]

[u]Framerate[/u]
This is what you'll hear most people complain about. The game doesnt look any better or worse than Serious Sam 3 or Serious Sam HD. However, the optimization has taken a dive, as matching the settings from those games will result in a far larger framedrop here than it would in said games.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Also a bit lacking. As stated, it doesn't look any better or worse than Serious Sam 3 or Serious Sam HD, but I did notice quite a bit of popping-in textures, especially during cutscenes. Hopefully a patch later may fix all this.

[u]Sound Design[/u]
The sound in this game is the best its ever been for a Serious Sam game. Not only do the weapons have more oompf, but the ambient sounds, as well as the enemies all sound amazing. Damjan Mravunac also outdoes himself once again with his beautiful music for Rome and France, both ambient and combat. [spoiler]And his remix of the legendary Grand Cathedral track is an unexpected, but extremely welcome addition to his discography of epic final level music.[/spoiler]

[u]Legion System[/u]
Dont quote me on this, but I suspect this may be why the rest of the game is poorly optimized. This system is only utilized twice in the game as far as I can tell: At the beginning of the game, and at the end of it. Its lack of use makes you wonder if its worth it, but I believe [b]it is totally worth it[/b]. The amount of people and atmospheric [i]combat[/i] you see on the battlefield [b]would be enough to make a Warhammer 40k fan die for the Emperor a million times.[/b] It puts all other epic battlefields I've seen to shame... [i]and ironically, I didn't lose a single frame[/i]. Awesome!

[h1]Overall[/h1]

Overall, definitely a fun game. As experienced for the first time, I wouldn't say Best-in-the-Series, because as a Prequel, we know how it ends, but it's definitely a worthy addition. Definitely pick it up. I pre-ordered Deluxe and the soundtrack alone made it worth it for me.

36,76703576,english,"Hey! So I’m kinda of a fun from the first encounter, now I finished the SS4 and here’s my opinion.
First of all I want to say that everyone need to keep in mind that the croteam is around 40 people in company. And the price of game is directly responds that it won’t be any AAA. SS4 now in charge of new gameplay features as skill web upgrades, new weapons, gadgets, optional missions, transport, huge maps (never would say it’s open world tho). They implemented every new feature in the main core gameplay, basically going backwards, shooting aliens and in my opinion it works well. I liked the shooting most of all games of SS titles. The problem with SS3 BFE was that game that can be named as a Serious Sam started only at a half of campaign. In SS4 it starts much faster, first half of a game is made from big corridors, some hard challenging shooting time to time. Second half gives us everything the game can offer, huge amounts of enemies, bigger maps. Storyline was never SS main thing, but I don’t mind it at all after SS4.

-There’s still huge problems with animations and cutscenes. This always was the weak point but now as they want to push it on more important level in the game story-telling, they needed to improve it more. -Bad or either “random” optimization. What I mean by that is just a situation when big amount of players report issues with performance and other players with preferably same pc build reports that everything runs smooth. Kinda a mystery here, right? Speaking of me, I played on Egpu 1080 with core i9, 32gb, and it runs on everything set to high not except some issues while in city maps.

Completed the main story and I had lots of fun playing this. The story is fine I guess, the events in the story took place before BFG so it's a prequel of a prequel which is weird, but I don't really care for story in a SS games, I mean the core of SS games is mindless shooting hordes and hordes of aliens, that is the main thing. I was always on the edge while playing this, always running and shooting aliens, getting cornered by them, I truly enjoyed this game a hell lot.

Graphics were amazing, only the character textures were bad sometime voice and texture don't even sync but mehh who cares, overall it was really good nice lighting effect with massive environment, lots of vastly huge places to shoot aliens which was so satisfying & annoying both at the same time.

Now the best thing about this game was its music OHh MY GOD this thing has GOD LIKE soundtracks that I've never heard before just amazing, eargasm for ears. xD

DO NOT BUY, positive reviews are from people who do not want an old school shooter, this is  without a doubt the worst SS for any boomer shooter fan.

------------------------

A Serious Shame 4

Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of old school FPS, I've played through every Serious Sam, some up to 3 times. I just finished a playthrough of the full series the day before SS4 came out because I was very hyped. I saw the poor reviews and didn't want to believe it was bad until I had tried it. Now we can start:

- The game runs poorly
- The gunplay didn't feel satisfying, guns like the pistol/LMG aren't as accurate anymore, both shotguns lack the satisfying and deep sound you want from a shotgun (compared to previous SS for example) the regular shotgun lacks impact.
- We were lied to about the legion system (had to read reviews to find out).
- Crashes automatically when using DX12, Vulkan will make all cutscenes stutter.
- Lack of many options/clearly unfinished option menu.
- Very long load times even on SSD and i9 9900k
- With a 2080 Ti, poor performance, even on 1080p with low settings I cannot get constant 120 FPS... or even constant FPS at all.
- Lack of polish outside/during cutscenes
- Texture pop-ups
- Muddy/Blurry textures even on 1440p/4K
- Lots of annoying things like A.I companions, quick-items, a run feature that breaks the formula of previous entries in the serie which was always a serie of ""purist"" FPS you shoot and you dodge that's it, even aiming down the sigh with the pistol in SS3 felt weird and stupid.
- Going back on the A.I companions, they will kill your target sometimes (Which is already too many times) and even when they aren't around you you will hear them on your radio talk all the ****** time, they couldn't shut up, I don't know who thought this would be a good idea.

Pros:
-Sam's voice is still nice to hear.
-When the game didn't drop from 110 FPS down to 60 and I wasn't constantly being annoyed by NPC banter the gore system in itself was satisfying to see.

Very solid game all around and I'm thoroughly enjoying this pre-sequel (IDK the fucking timeline anymore XD).

Feels like the classics mixed with Part 3. 

You are still a crazy bunny in an arcade shooter so they didn't fuck that up either. 

Performance is smooth even on my old PC (Must be Digital Voodoo).

Love the new enemy types as well as the weapons and redesigns (Fuck those Vampire things though).

Graphics are pretty crisp and prob the best in the series (Unless you like cartoony aesthetic of 2).

Love the level designs and set pieces for Planet Badass along with the music. 

There are zounds of enemies in every level with the usual maze like levels and arena setups. 

The new skill tree is mehhhh but whatever every game nowadays has to be a Role-Playing Game now. 

At least this didn't change too much of it's style unlike other shooters trying to relive their old days and failing by adding stupid platforming or rhythm mechanics. (DOOM IMMORTAL).

Only ""bad"" things I found are lack of Extreme 16-32 player co-op, horde mode and the occasional shit enemy design like the aforementioned Vampires and also the excessive amounts of cutscenes.

47,76698811,english,"I was a bit worried about this after visiting the steam forums and seeing a lot of negativity but after finishing the game I can safely say that I really enjoyed it.  Probably my second favourite in the series. 

Never had any bugs or issues aside from a few graphical oddities. I was playing on medium settings to be safe since it does feel somewhat poorly optimised and I couldn't be bothered to tweak my settings to try and get it to look as good as it could without dropping frames. 

Sam feels like his old self. It's not afraid to take anything serious like Serious Sam 2 was nor is it trying too hard to be ""serious"" like Serious Sam 3. 

There's a good amount of variety to the levels and enemies. The enemy variety and guns are excellent. Dual wielding basically anything (once you unlock it) is really fun. They mix up combinations of enemies in interesting ways so that even though you'll have met most of the enemies by the halfway point, it doesn't feel repetitive. 

The skill tree is somewhat fun although sprinting while reloading and a few other skills feel like they should have been part of the base moveset, not locked behind an upgrade tree. 

Aside from a rather slow start the pacing is excellent. They show a welcome amount of restraint when it comes to the larger battles and they never felt tedious. 

The music is, as usual, excellent. 

The physics feel a bit off and Sam feels very light which makes platforming difficult. There's not really any required platforming aside from secret hunting but it is rather disappointing to see it done so poorly. 

The level design is also somewhat disappointing. A lot of the levels are massive and interesting but unlike previous games there's never any basic puzzles or item hunts or much of anything to them aside from ""follow the path to the objective."" There's also the terrible choice to have an invisible wall in the middle of the river in one stage; which is a massive middle finger to the player in a game that otherwise wants you to explore and find secrets. 

The side quests are a fun addition and a lot of the gadgets you get from them are fun to use. Sadly, most of the gadgets aside from the healing ones are only found in their initial mission or are hidden in secrets requiring awful platforming.

There's probably too many parts of the game where you are accompanied by AI companions but they never really bothered me. As far as I can tell from my single playthrough on normal, they cannot die, they cannot hurt you and they also do decent damage to enemies. Still, this isn't Republic Commando and I don't think fighting as a group compliments the gameplay here.

The end boss, as is usual for Serious Sam, is terrible. Somehow Croteam did not learn their lesson from Serious Sam 3 and once again introduced brand new gameplay mechanics in the final boss fight. Honestly, the best boss fights in Serious Sam 3 and 4 and just the regular enemies you fight earlier but promoted to boss status. You don't need gimmicks in boss fights. There's nothing wrong with ""shoot it until it dies."" Seriously. It's why I think the bosses in The Second Encounter are probably the best in the series although the gimmicky rooms in the first 3rd of that game are another matter entirely.

Overall, great game. It still feels like Croteam don't really know what they want to do with the series and maybe this was once again left over parts of other projects/tech demos but the final package is somehow a really enjoyable experience regardless.

* Everything that makes Serious Sam is there, the guns, the enemies, all classic content is in.
* We have a villain now!
* A proper story and new characters.
* Gunplay is varied, same as missions and content.
* Some levels are HUGE!
* We now have skills. Not incredibly varied, but are a nice addition, specially the dual guns!
* Shotting is very rewarding, all guns pack a punch, gore system and effects and all that is really good.
* Side missions!

However...

* Performance is awful. In coop crashes once or twice in about 3 hours. Makes you lose your progress.
* You can not save your progress if you quit a coop campaign. That sucks, because if you got gun attachments on a side mission, you will lose that.
* I understand is not a AAA game, but graphics/animation looks dated. Not really an issue, but I don't really understand why some levels are on the simple side, but runs awful. Something about using an old engine and not using new rendering tech?
* Some sections of the levels are empty. Some corridors here and there. Exploration is not properly rewarded, so if you wish to go down certain route, you might find a simple dead end.


An on a side note, people is picking up on the LEGION system. I mean, there are tons of enemies. That is not an issue at all. You won't find yourself short on things to shoot at. There won't be 100k enemies at all times, however, but is totally fine.

Before I write a review, I would like to say this, do NOT read the negative reviews. Yes, the game might have its bugs and flaws, but they are nowhere near as bad as people say they are, and they are easy to ignore or even forget they're there. Plus, people who take the story seriously need to be re-educated, because from the very start of the series its never been about the story! Heck, even the story is self-aware that the story is made for fun! Sorry for my rant, I just had to get that out of the way because I don't want to see a game people really like have a ruined reputation, just because some ""reviewers"" on YouTube or Steam missed the point of the story and nit pick bugs that are going to be fixed! There are other video games that have had much bigger and worse launch issues (Far Cry 5, most of Bethesda's old games, Blizzards games and many survival games), and whilst people call out these issues, they were more mature about it and just said to themselves ""I'm just gonna have to deal with it"" and still support these games with these on going issues!

[h1] Here's my review [/h1]
Serious Sam is the first PC game I've ever played, the franchise has always given me the most amount of fun, memorable moments, and has pretty much defined what arcade FPS's should be! After waiting almost 9 years for a new Serious Sam game, what do I think of the game

[h1] PROS: [/h1]
- The game-play is still a joy to play
- The story is self aware of itself and is very silly
- The humour as usual is fun to listen to, even if it's cheesy or corny 
- The art-style works very well
- New features (like gadgets, upgrade system and alternative fire for weapons) that work really well
- The graphics are not the best (especially for 2020) but is still good to look at
pushing the game engines limits!
- The weapons have a nice kick to them
- The weapon and enemy animations have massively improved and look great compared to the previous games
- Despite not being a huge fan of music, this game has some amazing music that sound like they came from big budget movies!
- The Sound design sounds amazing on the guns and enemy's
- You get to ride Warebulls and other enemies! 

[h1] Both Pros and Cons : [/h1]
- The cut-scenes aren't that good, but they are fun to watch to see if something goofy happens with the animation

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
- There are bugs (sounds cutting out during, able to go through a roof slightly, AI getting stuck sometimes, etc) they might be fixed soon and is rare and there are less than Serious Sam 3 or even the HD version's of the first two games, it is still not a good look for what it is right now.
- The Legion System was not what I was expecting at all, (it was deception for getting people to buy this game)
- Some explosions and other particle effects do look quite dated 
- Serious Difficulty is not that fun and needs some work
- Lacking some content (survival and death match)

My Score: 7.5/10 (8/10 because most bugs were fixed)

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]  
Whilst it's a great come back after almost 9 years and better than Serious Sam 3: BFE in some aspects, it's better to wait some time to buy it, because there is still content that hasn't been added and needs some polishing up, I'd recommend this game and think people will have fun.

It has all the things you love about SS, waves of enemies, guns and gore, lots of gore.  The gameplay is fantastic. There are also some cool secrets to find in the true spirit of SS. The weapons feel powerful and the guts spilled are satisfying to watch, like the particles which fly off when you shoot a Kamikaze. To be fair, if you're looking for a SS game, then this is all there.

[h1] What could have been better [/h1]
If you start looking at the negatives, then there are plenty. The character animations are [b]atrocious[/b]. The dialogues are laughably bad. The story is not interesting. I didn't find too many optimization issues but the ones I've found are very minor and shouldn't alter your decision to purchase this game. At the time of writing this review, I've played 4 hours of the game and I haven't seen any usage of their advertised Legion system, where you will have countless waves of enemies at once on your screen.

[h1] Final thoughts [/h1]
If Croteam had decided to go away with forced character interactions, then it'd be a far better game. Whenever a cutscene is triggered, I only wait for it to go away.

58,76694282,english,"So I finally finished the game, just played it on Normal to experience it for the the first time without headbutting a wall. I must say I loved every part of it, I never found myself bored or frustrated compared to SS3 which is pretty bland overall. Yes there are graphical issues, yes there is some stuttering and yeah a couple of bugs here and there but I still enjoyed the time I spent playing the game.

Gameplay itself is the same as any other SS game but with a few new things to spice up combat, you now have a skill tree which adds minor things like healing from a melee kill or faster reloading but there's also fun stuff like dual wielding ANY gun and reduced splash damage. The gadgets were pretty fun too although I never used the decoy I'm sure it would be handy in early stages of the game but once you get most of guns it seemed kinda useless. My favourite would be the drone, I only found a few but there were really helpful at taking down large groups of fodder while you focus the big guys.

Graphics wise it definitely looks better than SS3 but with the issues atm it doesn't seem like it, there's weird terrain pop-ins, textures pop-ins and an oddly short draw distance. Despite that aslong as you have a PC less than 10 years old you should be able to run the game fine.

Bugs - I only came across two myself, enemies getting stuck inside terrain which causes some fights to never end if you can't kill them (If you don't have explosives) and enemies pathing getting broke and they just get stuck behind something then drop aggro. Not major things but annoying anyway.

With some more polish and maybe a good-sized expansion pack, I think it could even be fantastic. The shooting is the best it's ever been in a Sam game, and it's one of the most fun shooters in years. The classic kiting and best-gun-for-the-job gameplay all set in the wide-open, exotic locales of past Sam games has been given an overhaul fit for 2020.

That's not to say it doesn't feel very much related to the previous game, Serious Sam 3: BFE, because it really, really does. If you can imagine that SS3 is akin to the first game, Serious Sam: The First Encounter, then to me Serious Sam 4 is the equivalent of The Second Encounter, combined with a bit of the wackiness of Serious Sam 2. There's more guns, more gear, you find the upgrades, you do the odd side quest, you unlock the odd skill. It's SS3.5, maybe, rather than a true 4. And that's only stated because graphically, despite releasing 9 years later, SS4 still looks a lot like its 2011 predecessor.

The story and cutscenes and dialogue have all been expanded from SS3, which didn't shy away from either of the three things. SS4 simply has more of everything. If you like the writing, it'll be a good thing. Some of it has had me pausing the game to laugh so I don't die. It's what you'd expect from Serious Sam comedy, and the characterization has been greatly improved.

There are performance issues, but not as bad as some experienced at launch.

Serious Sam 4 is another must-have entry in this iconic FPS franchise.",1601263324,1601263324,True,2,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False,76561197975388306,1049,44,1003,1003,590,1601694880,,

Pros:
+ Diverse set of enemies that will swarm, overwhelm, and challenge you - some are new, but the classics are still there
+ Wide array of different terrains and levels with some spacious areas reminiscent of the originals
+ I had a decent amount of fun and encountered a reasonable level of challenge completing this game
+ The additional mission objectives add challenging mini-games/bosses
+ HUGE amount of settings customisation (but your game will still run and look like ****)
+ Online co-op is nice

Cons:
- One of the worst optimised games I've ever come across
- Terribly dated graphics for a 2020 release
- The 'story' is too silly to really get into it and the cutscenes are horrific
- The weapon selection was OK for me, but some may prefer more variety and there isn't anything innovative
- The skill trees and gadgets don't help freshen the experience despite being 'new'
- Doesn't have the same vibe the first two encounters have that keep you on the edge of your seat. This could be due to the more open design of the levels - there is less intimacy/claustrophobia (and a lack of temple levels).
- Lacks replayability

69,76687320,english,"This game was great! I liked the addition of weapon attachments and the different support items. The skill tree was also a good addition but I wish there was a bit more to it. I was hoping for more large scale battles, but I have to say, that one massive battle near the end was very satisfying. I just wish there was more of it. I also really liked the side missions.

The dialogue was great, honestly no idea what some people are complaining about there. Nothing about it felt out of place, and quite honestly something I would expect from a modern Serious Sam game. My buddies and I had a blast playing this on co-op and there wasn't a cut scene that didn't have us laughing! There were a few that actually had me in tears.

Critiques would be performance is really not great in some spots. The level with the motorcycle had me drop down to 20FPS when there was nothing going on. I have to cut the team some slack as it's rare for such a small company to make their own engine. Most other parts of the game ran fine for me though, including the final battle. The levels were massive but there was quite a lot of running around trying to find out where to go. Which I'm okay with, I just wish there was a bit more to do in between. Having a few random enemies spawn would probably do the trick for me. I also got a little bored of having my arsenal wiped twice and spending an entire level gathering all my stuff back again.

I hope the performance issues are fixed because I'd love to go and play this again and really take my time with all the side missions. If performance issues weren't in the game, it would be 10/10, but I have to give it an 7.5/10 until then. This has potential to be my favourite Serious Sam game.

Some other minor problems I came across when playing which I'm sure the devs are aware of by now:
- After using an item, it always switches you back to the assault rifle instead of the last weapon you were holding. I found this quite frustrating.
- After getting off a vehicle, the game puts you into third person view. It should put me back to whatever view I had set before entering the vehicle.
- There were a few desyncs of enemy corpses happening in networked play (as a client). They would die, but instead of becoming a ragdoll or gibbing, they would just slide around on the ground.
- Doors in cut scenes desynced too (as a client), people would open them, but the static door was still there, so I was seen two doors, and people would just walk through them. To be honest this actually was pretty funny in a couple of scenes because it was basically Serious Sam talking to a door.
- Third person view performance felt worse than first person",1601252784,1601256254,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197998027609,184,3,545,545,545,1601251721,,
70,76688485,english,"A close friend and I - both long-term Serious™ fans - just finished the game, co-op styles. It took us about 12 hours total, not including some time spent menus and a valiant, but only partially successful attempt to run the game using Proton on Linux. We were both on Windows machines for the actual co-op sessions. 

Initial reviews and comments had me worried, but just about all of that melted away once I started playing for myself. The cutscenes and dialog all felt pretty close to home and moderately enjoyable, although the character animation was admittedly poor. 

Gameplay-wise, it's clear how much influence the game inherited from things introduced in Serious Sam VR: The Last Hope. These include:
-dual-wielding (and having different weapons in each hand)
-parachute drop ins
-a few enemy models

I'm hopeful this will receive the Payday 2 treatment and get VR support added, so headsetters can co-op alongside desktoppers for maximum fun. 

I can't speak much about the game's finale, other than personally it was highly satisfying and left me wanting more. 

I'm not yet ready for another playthrough, but I'll surely return once more friends end up getting it. That being said, playing with pubs was just as fun as it was in SS: TFE and TSE. Also, there felt like an amusingly high number of similarities with the Earth Defense Force games. So much so, that a pubbie joined in for singing one of the EDF songs. Most excellent.

People are complaining that the dialog and voice acting are cheesy as hell, but that's kind of the point. This is Serious Sam, not Shakespeare. It's silly, it's over the top, and that's what makes it amazing. The dialog is exactly what you should expect if you've played any of these games before.

As mentioned, SS4 does have a few issues I've noticed:
- Performance is terrible on the motorcycle level. My rig is not the most powerful, but I was able to maintain 60 FPS throughout most of the game, including the final battle. On the motorcycle level, I was averaging 30 frames per second, fluctuating between 12 and 45. It's a big level, but there are not an extreme number of enemies on screen all at the same time. Seems like there might be a memory leak there.
- After drinking RAGE juice, you always switch to your assault rifle instead of your previously-equipped weapon. Minor inconvenience.
- After exiting a vehicle or dismounting an enemy you were riding, the camera switches to third-person instead of reverting to your previous setting. Also a minor inconvenience.

74,76687553,english,"So I wanted to start this review off with a few things to mention while reading:

1. Pretty standard-thing most people say about games they have a passion for, but I’m a big Serious Sam fan.  
2. I’m in no way a big [b]game reviewer[/b] with experience with game design and industry background information.  
and lastly,
3. I waited to do this review after I completed the game at least once without doing it on Serious or Mental difficulty, without getting all the secrets (The game’s been out for 3 days, I don’t think everyone’s found all of them just yet but I could be wrong.  Because I sure as hell didn’t find most of them), because I wanted to help people whom are on the fence about bad reviews and pre-set expectations they set on Croteam.  

(Also one last note: I had to trim down my review to fit Steam's review limit, I had more to say, but there's a character limit I just hit.)

[h1]Brief Summary[/h1]
I’ve always had high hopes and expectations for this game ever since they first announced it.  [spoiler]Especially since we’re finally out of Egypt again[/spoiler].  Not sure what to expect, my expectations started to shift as time went on, and the game’s release date was pushed back.  All I wanted out of it now was a new story to tell and plenty of dynamic environments to explore.  Which is ironically what I thought about when I played and finished TFE before TSE was released.  And now that I’ve played through it all, I was very satisfied with the end result.   Personally I think a lot of the flak that this game got was from the astounding expectations that people set.  Not to say they aren’t justified of course.   

[h1]What I think they did right[/h1]
-[b]Scenery in the levels[/b].  There’s been many of times where I’ve stopped to take a beautiful picture.

-[b]Soundtrack[/b].  The music in this game went above and beyond what I thought they would do.  A perfect blend of atmosphere and your upbeat Serious Sam-like music that blends together phenomenally.

-[b]Gunplay[/b].  Pretty simple and standard:  the guns are fun to shoot, and the amount of enemies and the environment you’re set in are very fitting of a Serious Sam standard.  Battle Arenas and Mosh Pits fitting for a mowdown from any weapon of your choice.  With some of the perks/skills you can get, you can make any weapon viable, but there are still some weapons that just outright outshine others.  I’m also glad they split up ammo pools.  Tired of sharing Minigun ammo with Assault Rifles, and I knew it would've been awful for all the Shotguns to share ammo in this game.  

-[b]Characters[/b].  I know some people had gripes with the dialogue and banter between the characters, but I personally enjoy it.  The first few Serious Sam games were just Sam with his witty one-liners, who no one really talked to aside from Netricsia (If anyone even bothered to pull it out to read it).  Now you have a team (Whom you sometimes enter some of these Serious Sam-esque moshpit arenas with) and characters who have personalities (Some more than others).  And with certain events happening in the game, I’ve even felt a connection with those said characters.  Not to say it got personal or anything, but it wasn’t just your typical John Doe who’s a soldier and dies to an alien.  And they even explained why Sam does witty one-liners, everyone in his team and group does them.  Even the villains/bosses were memorable as well.

-[b]The Serious Sam Formula done greatly[/b].  I know the saying goes, “Don’t fix what isn’t broken”, but when it comes to making future renditions of games, I know devs try to not fix their formula, but experiment to see if they can make it better.  And if Serious Sam 3 was an experimental change from TFE and TSE, then I’d say they learned from most, if not all, of their  mistakes from SS3.

[h1]What I think they did bad/could have done better[/h1]
-[b] The guns.[/b]  They aren’t balanced amazingly.  Especially with the incorporation of [spoiler]attachment/upgrades[/spoiler] (For those who don’t want to be spoiled), that make their effective use just…good in most regards.  Like there’s little to no reason to swap weapons aside from running low on ammo, which can be both a good and bad thing.

-[b] The Gadgets.[/b]  Perhaps it’s just me, but these sometimes feel too much like a crutch than a new mechanic.  I understand with the likes of the Rage Serum being Serious Speed and Damage combined into one, but then you have the likes of L.I.F.E’s on-command heal that you can stockpile and just use whenever you’re hurt.  Or the Black Hole and Psychotropic Grenade just free-clearing hordes of enemies for free, making some of the events that happen in this game a complete cakewalk.  The only gadget I think is fine is H.E.A.R.T, which is just a second life.  Which I did like from the Serious Sam Xbox version.  Sometimes it’s tedious to die and go back to a checkpoint, when you have just an extra life or two to try again.  For the less-serious players of course.  This gadget wasn’t that abundant throughout the game, so it’s not like people had free extra lives all the time either.

-[b] The final boss fight[/b] Now this is going to be a big spoiler, so go ahead and skip this if you don’t want to be spoiled.  But the final boss fight was just so…underwhelming.  Like everything was leading up to this moment, just for a…C4-Grapple Hook mission, and it all ends in a Mech fight.  Like compare that to TFE’s first boss fight where you had to actually use your guns to fight, and try to get him low enough before activating the laser to kill him.  Or even TSE’s final boss with Mordekai where he spawns tons of enemies to send your way while attacking from a distance.  [b]THOSE[/b] felt like final bosses.  This one?  Not so much.

-[b] The graphics[/b].  I know a lot of people had graphical issues from this game’s launch, and I do agree that it’s a bit demanding at times.  There’s times where at Ultra settings I can get anywhere between 120-180FPS on a 2070 Super RTX, and then there’s a few times where my frames drop down to the 60s due to the sheer amount of…stuff that just needs to be loaded.  That, and the graphics and art style hasn’t changed that much from Serious Sam 3, which just makes it feel more like an extension to Serious Sam 3 than a sequel.

-[b]Still a bit buggy[/b].  But this is with any new game, which will probably be resolved in a little bit of time, but there’s some occasional bugs throughout this game.  The biggest one I can remember was that in the final boss fight, one of your missions was to collect C4.  If you have C4 full, you have to use one and pick up more to trigger the mission being completed.  And in my case, I was stuck in some weird dual-wield-bug where I couldn’t swap weapons, soft-locking it until I had to load a previous checkpoint to fix it.  But again, only happened once.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1] To wrap all of this up, because I believe I’ve said anything on my mind, I think this game was amazing.  I think people had too high of expectations, not saying they were wrong to have them, but because some of those expectations weren’t met, doesn’t mean the game’s bad.  Best bet is to give the game a shot and give your own opinion, if not just watch gameplay of it online before buying.  I pre-ordered having good faith in Croteam, and I felt satisfied with what I got.  The best way to sum it up is like this: Serious Sam 3 and Serious Sam 4 feel like a replica of TFE and TSE.  Serious Sam 3 is centered around Egypt and trying out new mechanics and styles of play.  Serious Sam 4 takes a step out of Egypt and takes what they learned from Serious Sam 3 and improved on it, with new beautiful environments to explore.  

I think the game’s worth the money and the time, I’ve very much enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it as I have with Croteam’s past works.  If you want to wait for a sale, by all means, but I think it’s worth giving a shot, especially if you’re a Serious Sam fan as well.",1601253242,1601253698,True,165,7,0.854075610637664795,0,True,False,False,76561198054823708,82,2,2550,2550,959,1602035147,,

Pros:
+ 15 maps with diffrent locations but not much
+ the last half of the game are good soundtracks and also the boss fights soundtracks
+ gameplay time feels diffrent from difficult but my was 15 hours with almost all side quests
+ the gunplay feels better than Sam 3
+ half of the maps are from ok to very good
+ the humor feels ok but the one liner would be better like in TFE, TSE, TNE, 2 and 3
+ the story yeah this game have one better than the other sam games but serious sam dont really need a story it feels a bit weird if there are to much story in it
+ the upgrade stuff can be good but it feels to weird in a Sam game
+ the verhicels feels pretty ok i gues like a Bike and Harvester but they are only in one level
+ the Papamobile is good and you can play it more than one time
+ the small boss fights are pretty good
+ some new enemies are good like the Vamps

Cons:
- the first half of the game have a pretty boring soundtrack its really a wonder why you have boring soundtracks in a sam game
- the final boss is really the worst thing in the sam franchise now i thought sam 3 had a weird one but this with its even more dumb gimmick stuff and unbalanced stuff 
- 2 maps feels empty for me and some places have fps drops
- the score system is not anymore to see in the HUD why and the ammo stuff at left under is also not more to see what happend with it
- some places in maps feels to easy or they are to much unbalanced
- the final map is to short for a Sam game yes TFE was also short but it was a game from 2001 and it was the first one but Sam TSE, 3 and even 2 did it better
- the missions where i have the NPCs this is pretty boring sometimes to fight alone are a lot better
- the melee attacks are horrible compared to Sam 3
- sometimes i had really to few ammo for bigger fights
- i feel some other the old school enemies are pretty weird here like the Kleer, Reptil and Harpie physics
- some of the new enemies are really anyoing like this Mask Hammer guy

82,76571032,english,"First, I'd like to start by saying, this is SERIOUS SAM. If you were expecting Call of Duty type graphics, or Doom level reinvention, then why are you even here pretending to know anything about the franchise? Anyone who has history with the Serious Sam games already know that the franchise will never aspire to be any of those other kinds of shooters. And why would anyone expect Call of Duty level graphics in a game where the main character runs around with an arsenal of over a dozen weapons ranging from hand guns to weapons of mass destruction seemingly all stored in his pocket? Serious Sam is and has always been about these simple concepts - Being in a shit storm of enemies, being armed to the teeth with weapons, constant movement, destroying and blowing shit up while occasionally popping corny one liners. 

Also don't really see why so many people are nit picking on cut scene graphics, as if anyone has ever really even cared about those at all in a SS game. I will say that it is a step above SS3 in graphics while being under something like the newest Doom games. In fact, if you have a capable system set up and can play at at least 60 fps, in 4k with all of the setting at it's there highest levels, there is a lot to  beyond in the graphical department as improvement over older SS games. That is how I am playing, and I am constantly noticing little small touches that really adds to the beauty of the overall graphic's experience, though as subtle as some may be. My set up is a 2060 super, i 7-9700f with 32 gbs of ram, and I have absolutely no issues with graphics, at all. So when I see reviews with people complaining about technical issues with the graphics, I have to be inclined to believe that to be an issue with their set ups, as opposed to the game itself. 

At the end of the day, this is nothing more than Serious Sam on steroids when you are in the midst of the action. And that is what I love about it. Not to mention that there are subtle upgrades to the game play as well, such as the addition of skills that you can acquire and build up through out the game with a skill point system. Nothing too confusing or elaborate, but it is definitely here and it can and does add to the experience. There is also the ability to click right right on the dumb pad to help you along if you find yourself lost and going in circles, with the welcomed addition of a temporary arrows trail to lead the direction to where you need to go. Dual wielding of both small and large weapons is also a nice touch via skill upgrades. Gadgets such deployable decoys and rage serum collectable items also add to the frantic action. I love that the franchise did not forget who they were and only added to make a formula that already worked even better. That's all I needed. Not the evolution that everyone else must have been expecting. If it were to have evolve too much, then I would fear that it may have not came back as the alternative game that I could love to play as a departure from all of the other shooters that it never tried to be. More comparable to Serious Sam 3 mostly, I'd say that they did well to improve upon that and run forward with it.

96,76508167,english,"Oh my, oh my. I'm afraid Croteam is serious about this game, and it's not a bad joke. I wrote this review after two hours in the game and hoped it would get better.

- Level design is very poor. Boring, repetitive. Especially the cities sequences are really meh.
- Graphics is not nearly as good as I expected. I mean, regarding GPU, it's a pretty demanding game, but all textures and models look cheap, not worth the required GPU.
- Many glitches, lags, stutters. Some were fixed in the first patch. But honestly. I played almost the whole game before the patch. This makes me mad. I want to support the studio, buy the game early for the full price, and play as it comes out. I'm not gonna do it next time. I'll just wait until the game is on sale and patched. 
- Some animations might look good in 2010. Not in 2020. What's with the eyes and weird movement. Reloading guns while driving is insanely disturbing.
- Performance optimization is terrible. Absolutely terrible.
- Story, characters, and cut scenes are just completely retarded. I know, I know, SS always was silly. And I loved it.
- Classical SS humor is gone and replaced with dialogs and punch lines for complete morons or mental asylum patients. SS was always a bit silly, but this is just too much. 
- Ripping of some completely unnecessary stuff from other games (Doom, Duke Nukem).
- Unexpected game mechanics like special items or upgrade tree are just wrong, boring and shouldn't be in SS game at all.
- Sadly, iconic guns like Canon or Laser Gun have come very late in the game. You're not gonna enjoy them much. For some reason, very soon after getting Laser Gun, you also get an upgrade for it which is so powerful you'll never use primary fire again. Some gun are fun (Chainsaw Rockets) but you'll get it only for a short time period in one mission. 
- Gunplay is OK, I guess. 
- Enemies are mostly cool and fun. A lot of new monsters.

The bad thing is, even if they manage to fix the game in terms of performance and glitches, the stupid cut scenes and characters will still be there. I'm going to finish the game and enjoy some shooting. But at this moment, I cannot recommend it. And it makes me a bit sad.

This could have been a great game if developers gave it some other name. But for some reason, Croteam is hanging tightly with Serious Sam franchise. One might ask if these guys are really so desperately uncreative they have to recycle the same material all over again. But let's just mention one almost revolutionary and superb game - Talos Principle. Creativity and talent for making great, smart, and well-written games is obviously not the issue. Who knows what the hell went wrong here. :(

I've seen an argument that SS4 was made only by 40 people. It's irrelevant. Developers obviously wasted tons of time on completely stupid things. Like retarded characters, different vehicles with bad physics, guns you get only in one or two missions, ridiculously large but completely empty maps (WTF the road to Carcassonne), and I'd like to mention good for nothing gadgets (some gadgets I didn't even use and I have no idea what they are doing), skill three, and of course super boring side missions. Oh, and mechs? Why? Just WHY? Just give me guns and let me destroy the hordes by myself. Not in the mech. Come on. 

The Legion system is a total lie. I'd say that there are generally less or the same amounts of enemies as in the previous installments—definitely nothing like ""hundreds of thousands of enemies"" as they promised in the trailers. 

The last level brought some resemblance to the old games: great nostalgic music, the awesome shooting of enormous hordes. Just what Serious Sam should be. 

I finished the game and got all achievements. I don't want to be a hypocrite. On some level, I enjoyed it. Croteam put a lot of work into it, that's undeniable. I just expected something a lot more different. It was a fun FPS. It just wasn't fun and good Serious Sam game until the final level.

[h1]Classic Serious Sam run and gun old school gameplay, not for zoomers.[/h1]

Ok the game is not perfect, there are some technical issues but it's still a great follow up to Serious Sam 3.
Don't listen to the plebs hating on this game, they probably didn't knew what they were getting into, or maybe they were expecting something very sophisticated with deep lore story, complex gameplay and lot of depth ?
Serious Sam concept is not that hard to understand, i don't know maybe there are indeed some unaware or misleaded people who probably expected a huge triple A DOOM Eternal 2 lol.

What you get here is simple, non stop action, the classic old school formula.
You get placed on huge maps and kills waves after waves of ennemies, probably a concept that's too basic for zoomers i guess ?
In the end there's no inbetween with Serious Sam, it's either you like or don't like it.

Serious Sam 4 is not a masterpiece, far from it, still it's a good game worth playing if you like fast paced fps.
Weapons are satisfying, there's lot of blood and cool gibs effects.
It's the perfect game for quick sessions, put your brain aside, engage psycho mode and kill everything in a massive chaos.
Overall it's fun to play and that's what really matter.
Sam is back and it's great, it could have been better that's for sure but it's far from being a bad game.
Thanks Croteam, i can't wait for the next updates and the community mods.

26,76670439,english,"I know its somewhat frowned upon to review a game before finishing it, but I really feel this game is getting to bad of a rep for what it is.

I'm about halfway through it (I think), but also I'm playing on serious so its taking a while. And my feelings on the game are in two parts:
1)The gameplay is satisfying and legitimately improved over SS3
2)This isn't a AAA game, its like a B tier game, so I didn't come in expecting perfection

Gameplay wise, I am having a... surprising amount of fun so far. The combat encounters are varied, the guns feel good and offer a meaty impact, it just all and all feels like an improvement over the disappointing Serious Sam 3.  The also worked hard to reduce the amount of hitscan in this game, which increases the quality immensely in my book, and makes it less frustrating to play.

The environments look gorgeous, and I'm gonna go against the grain here and say they like miles better than the last games. However, the character models and mocap are pretty awful. But it sounds like that was in house so I can't exactly expect quality.

But on the matter of quality, I feel like people going into this game expecting perfection were setting themselves up for failure. This isn't some bit game company, Croteam is basically just known for Serious Sam, and while its clear they worked very hard on this one, they could only go so far, and thats okay.

I think my most valid complaint with this game is its autosave function is... Probably the worst in the series. Like on 3 separate occasions it loaded me in front of a pack of enemies with like 6 health, because I triggered an autosave mid combat. And I'm gonna guess this is due to the game trying to make their combat encounters more natural (Turning a corner rather than moving to a new box-shaped arena), it can be very frustrating. And in one of these cases I softlocked myself and needed to load a previous save.

So, all and all the game isn't perfect, a few bugs made me have to load previous saves, the auto saves are kinda ass, and the cutscenes are kind of embarassing, but once you get past these issues, there is a surprisingly good, and very enjoyable game underneath.

I eagerly await any patches to clean up and improve the game so I can revisit it and have a blast all over again.

Less importantly but a nice addition is that the story is actually really fun, it's clear that having the Talos Principle's writer on board really helped them along as the self aware and intentionally absurd dialogue made me laugh in almost every cutscene which is extremely rare in games for me, sort of a case of it being so bad that it's good and even had a poignant moment or two.

Anyhow, here's my Honest Opinion of the game 2+ Hrs into it and I may update depending on how it goes the further into the game I get..



+PROS+
+++++++
+ Decent Story

+ Good Gameplay

+ Yay for Co-Op

+ Improved Gameplay (runs and moves a lot better mainly)

+ Runs really good on my PC and I have an older GPU (970 gtx)

+ Sound is pretty good 

+ Interesting Weapons

+ Interesting Skills to Learn

+ Side Missions is really cool, something extra to do

+ Mannnn 'O' Man did they hide those Secret Areas this time around. I have only found 1-2 so far but each level has about 7 it looks like and geez are these tough to find it seems but I like it! But i think this is a good thing because it gives a really good reason to play again.



-CONS-
------------
- Controls are a bit weird compared to the previous games

- Switching Between Weapons is a bit of a hassle, usually gets you killed especially in Co-Op since you can't pause the game or slow down time when switching

- Moronic Co-Op Players that just wanna run ahead of you in every mission so you have no idea wtf is going on or worse because of it they get you killed or you miss stuff like secrets and side missions. I found there are lives you can add to the game to dampen this problem.

- No Enemy Waves or anything for Multiplayer? What happened to that? I feel like this game is going to end fast and I just wanna keep playing it? Hopefully we see some good DLC?

- While the Story is decent it feels idk just feels a bit off, I mean it is decent, I do like it enough but it just doesn't really feel as much Sam enough compared to the previous games where I would constantly laugh at his random one-liners. It feels like this was done at the last minute and then just thrown in there. It's still enjoyable but very lackluster at the same time.

- I think the enemies are about the same as before, I don't see MORE per the claimed Legion System but maybe it will improve the further into it I go into the game? It really gave me the impression that I would go through each mission seeing more and more enemies coming which in theory should drag out how long it takes you to finish a mission/level for awhile.

- I have the game on Hard and I was expecting to literally Die a ALOT and yet somehow most the time I could survive which makes me question the game's difficulty. Additionally, this SHOULD get way harder with more players in Co-Op and yet it gets easier somehow, wth??? Now I just wanna put it on max difficulty so I'm a bit disappointed here and I don't really feel its challenging enough.

- There's a Lives System in there but its not the same as the original games. It's more like an after thought and you cant earn lives either. It does at least make the game tougher though but the problem here is nobody wants to join your co-op game because of it, too little and the level its too hard, and too much and that renders the lives system useless in the first place.

- Only One Mission and One Side Mission? WHY?? I think it would've been nicer if this would've at least had a Few Side Missions for each level. Feels like an afterthought at the very last minute. 



= VERDICT =
===========
= While the game has a lot of cons and stuff that left me a bit annoyed it's still pretty fun imo for the most part to the point that I do like playing it and I want to finish it eventually. I don't hate or dislike it but I can't exactly say that I absolutely love it either although I don't at all regret getting it since I've been a SS Fan since Day 1. There was definitely a lot of overhype here that gave it a bigger impression and that is not what you are going to get. It all really gave the impression of expecting something a little better and after playing I feel like we got something less especially after several delays so I would say in it's current state get it when it goes on sale if anything. It's worth it but I don't feel the game is worth the full asking price and I can only hope the story is long to make up for it. And if you're a legitimate SS Fan you'll like it in general for at least one good full playthrough and some decently fun co-op action but otherwise if you prefer commoncore modern shooters you'll be sorely let down.",1600991220,1601222470,True,4,0,0.500883817672729492,0,True,False,False,76561198022085812,532,102,427,427,323,1601940551,,

The best way to summaries this Sam game in one word it would be pathfinding. So far every SS game is different, breed on the same formula but executed a different way. The lore is completely nonsensical if you count SS2, and more if you add the indie titles too. And Croteam decided to end this and put Sam on the right track. And they did. 

If you can overcome the poor optimization (I could play with my 1050Ti so it's not THAT bad), you will find the definitive Serious Sam game here. SS4 knows everything that every Sam game knew before. It's your choosing how to play it. If you are oldschool 1st/2nd encounter fan it's the game for you, every classical damage output, weapon and enemy is here. If you are fan of the over the top mindless shooting from Sam 2 then this is the game for you, use one or more powerup from your pocket and do some dual wielding, it's a completely new dimension for the Sam universe. If you want a more Serious """"""modern tactical shooter"""""" style from BFE, then this is the game for you, stretch your reflexes and find those headshots and another weakspots in every enemy, few weapon have reloading too. Sam 4 have everything gameplaywise. It's by far the most immerse combat experience you can find from Croteam to this day, you just simply can't get enough shooting. And because you can vary your style replay ability is really high. The weapons are awesome, with some really nice upgrade to them too! That rocket launcher multiple shot, the laser beam, and the explosive grenade launcher...oh baby! It's funny because after beating the game, doing every achievement (they are really not impossible shit like walk in the desert for 2 hours just cause, but actually playing the game). 

The story is necessary, first it doesn't look like it, but the conclusion for the Sam universe it's really needed...If you accept their answer. {Warning, contains time travelling, surprise huh?] They more or less tell why Sam joking all the time, simply this is his and the whole humanity's way to keep fighting, they need to do cheesy one-liners to keep going because if they would take everything seriously as a normal people would do they would have lost all hope a long time ago. A bittersweet explanation but again, a necessary one. 

I don't want to bash BFE altho I really not like it, but Sam 4 really feels like it should have been BFE gameplaywise. And we get to the only point where I have a problem with the game. It's another prequel. A needed one, agreed, but another prequel. It's 2020 and the 2nd Encounter is...okay okay, Sam 2 is the one with the furthest of the timeline and there we don't accomplish anything by the end. When could we finally fight Mental for real? For not survival in defense, but in attack to kill him? In Sam 4 I felt this at various points (I will not spoiler relax {yes I could right now}) I don't want to play with the prequel. Oh no no no no...wrong. I don't want to play with the prequel's prequel. I want to take back the universe from Mental by step by step. Most of Mental's horde's species have a backstorie that not every single one of their kind is a soldier for Mental. I want to free them to fight with me! I want to resurrect poor Kleers (remember? Mental dropped Nukes on their planet, and they went extinct, only ther skeleton is what we see here). I want to destroy Mental's convertors and so on...when could I do it? In another 8 years MAYBE? If yes, and from on we go forward in time then okay. Because Sam 4 is amazing, the best shooter among all. It really gave me what Doom couldn't so I'm utterly thankful for Croteam. They did great this time, support this great team and buy their game, in another few patches that correct the optimization and fill in more monsters in some maps and it will be a masterpiece, trust me.

49,76664050,english,"I'm a huge fan of the series, so I was excited for this game for years, not just because it's another Serious Sam game, but because Serious Sam 3, despite its flaws, is by far my favorite in the series, so all they needed to do was to address those flaws to make a great game. The wait was long, and early trailers didn't make a good impression, the whole marketing campaign was a complete trainwreck. 

Thankfully the game itself is really enjoyable, if you know what to expect, if you don't, you might be surprised about a few things. One of which is the very low quality of character animations during cutscenes. You can clearly see the budget. On the other hand, the writing is better than ever for this franchise (which doesn't mean much), since they hired the writers for The Talos Principle. It can still be cringey at times, but I enjoyed watching most of the cutscenes (you can skip all of them if you want).

What is the most important in a Serious Sam game though is obviously the combat, which for me, is the best in the series. The weapons sound and feel really good, for the first time ever in the franchise if you ask me, and the enemies are better than ever. Gone are hitscan enemies, all of the annoying ones from BFE have been completely overhauled to provide a much more enjoyable experience. There are also many returning enemies from older titles, and some new ones (some of which are really annoying).

My favorite moments are double barrelling the big gnaars (their gibbing is awesome), headshotting khnuums with canons (yes, headshots are a thing now) and standing in an empty arena and hearing the millions of enemies marching towards you, but me saying ""millions"" here is just the usual rhetoric exxageration. The game was often advertised with having a legion system, which can spawn thousands of enemies at the same time to fight Sam, but this system is actually only used a single time in the entire game. I have to say though that that moment was cooler than anticipated, I thought it'll be just a gimmick.

 I am slightly disappointed with the soundtrack, because for me that was the biggest strength of Serious Sam 3. The soundtrack isn't bad, but feels a bit more generic, whereas in BFE the soundtrack had a clear identity. There are a lot of small things they did, changes and additions (like the skill tree!), about which I could talk for a long time, but at the end of the day, this game still provides the good old Serious Sam experience, which no other game provides, and it looks, sounds and feels better than ever.",1601221538,1601221538,True,2,0,0.528985500335693359,0,True,False,False,76561197973608826,555,178,901,901,654,1601636405,,

I myself haven't played any Serious Sam games before this, so it definitely isn't just for people who have history with the franchise. What i love about it is that the game isn't afraid to throw a ridiculous amounts of enemies at you, which isn't the focus in games like DOOM or really any other single player FPS. So it is a pretty different way to design encounters. Music is excellent too, so if you love DOOM for its music you won't be disappointed here either i think :D

The dialogue has been pretty entertaining so far. But don't buy the game expecting some fantastic story. Also don't expect the production quality to be on the level of the triple A giants.

Performance on my i7 7700k and RTX 2070S has been fine so far, with no stuttering or very low frame rates anywhere. But your experience could be different. I haven't encountered any bugs so far.

- The graphics may be OK/good, still has a lot of things done not right and has also many problems
- The level design is empty, boring and clearly not finished
- funny moments are rare, same for easter eggs (something Serious Sam stands for)
- Controls are somewhat spongy, movement of the characters stiff, sound quality medium

-> You can see and feel every second of the game that it isn't finished, like it needed 1 more year to get polished. Developers already started to roll out patches, to fix the bugs in the game. Which is good and hopefully will be continued!
But the bad design and missed opportunities can't be fixed with only some patches. 
Still if Serious Sam 4 will come to a state where you can play it without any other problems and everything it offers will be smooth, I may change this negativ review into a positiv one. Because as said, the core of the game is fun.

Change the normal shotgun spread to older Serious Sam. 

Double Barrel Shotgun needs more vertical spread but also be 20% better at range.
All maps before THE DIE IS CAST needs redoing all random walls. Especially the roman walls need to be changed to a more realistic layout and NO FREAKING FENCES ON 'EM!
UNUSED SPACE IN CORNERS NEED TO BE FILLED BY HIGHER FLOORS OR JUST A LEVEL BARRIER.

The ""Common Aludran Reptiloid"" need to be redone to be like in older games BUT only the speed of the magic homing balls. 

Kleers need to be jumping shorter distances when missing you. 

LESS Spawning without sounds.


[U]mild scam[/U]
[B]THE PREORDER BONUS IS TRASH THE THOMPSON SOUNDS AWUFL AND HAS WORSE AIMING DOWN SIGHTS
It Is No Mans Sky again. The LEGION SYSTEM is a joke and not true!
Large maps but only 25 enemies.[/B]


[U]Awful Spawns[/U]
The colosseum  shows that Croteam do not use the spawning enemies in waves but just throw shit at you and look if it sticks. In Serious Sam, main releases 1st 2nd, BFE and 2 the difficulty level Hard unlocks all main enemies and sets the damage to 1. No help but well thought out spawn patterns. SS4 seems to lack it. DOOM does it better. The whole getting rushed at can be evaded by using dashing and melee auto kills. Werebulls rush you like never before. Turn slower but somehow rush quicker. Kleer can do melee hitscan when near and when further away they jump much longer distances so when misses it takes longer to get them to you but in that time the next kleer is approaching. It really feels like Duke Nukem Forever or Halo 4. Lost it's identity. It is fun but no a huge-battle-Duke Nukem where weapons clearly showed more effective to certain enemies. The Auto-Shotgun is uselessly overpowered. The Grenade-Launcher has no reflecting of walls to hit enemies around corners. [B]The game feels like EA could have made a sequel to Half Life 2. The small things that made SS handmade is now just a wild-spawning-mess with new attack and speed values to all weapons and enemies that miss the mark by far.[/B]
[U]modernisation is building SS4 on fragile sticks MAINLY map design being empty to avoid attacks - first 3 maps[/U]
pre-release bugs. it is fixed at least in singleplayer mostly but yes the game is the worse of all non handheld ones imo. 
the werebulls are slower turning. the reloading is preventing running. the green big mages ""Common Aludran Reptiloid"" are faster and the homing magical balls are faster. the kleer skeletons are also much different. The shotguns are broken by being different. The map design is so bad they added fences on walls to prevent you from jumping out of bounds. The game looks [U]worse[/U] than Talos Principle and even HD looks more Serious Sam / same quality over all. Pop-in is bad. My PSU seems to be dying and can not handle a Ryzen 3700x and 1070ti on high GPU load because Control has it too where my game window (only that) freezes for 1 sec. The game is rushed and more Doom-y which is bad because dancing with the enemies seems to be broken. In the past, all Serious games except the awful ps2 / gamecube game have good circle-ing around all enemies which is lost in this one. I always say og SS First / Second encounter rock for being unique with the missing pathfinding and being harder. HD still awesome added pathfinding and streamlined some areas and the randomness of the 2nd Encounter traps got nerfed which is good. 3 needs replaying but is fine but areas are like ""oh no not this"" but kinda in a neutral way.

The game lost it's [U]identity partially[/U] by trying huge levels with bad roman dig sides which look like Chinese made Talos Principle and the [U]bad idea of sticking fences[/U] on old roman walls.
Doing more a doom 2016 thing but deleting the DANCE with ENEMIES where you know how to run around them so they miss their jumping attacks or shots.

Running is apparently a needed thing now. YOU need to run because spawns are now more random and miss spawn effects and sounds, though I do not know if that is a good thing if they add the sounds or just bad because headless kamikaze actually spawned in me and exploded which means CROTEAM NOW does the ""we know where players will stand when fight start"" which never worked because PC players run around the maps more [U](currently only notice in the first 3 maps).
SS4 don't even punish you for going back with additional enemies!! Every Serious Sam even 2 has this excluding Next Encounter.

To this date Serious Sam First Encounter is my [U]favourite[/U] including HD when I do want the polished levels and path-finding and easier traps when playing Second Encounter. The shotguns in both are better.

[B]Serious Sam 4 I guess is a good game but a really bad Serious Sam. Not sure if SS Next Encounter is worse when played in an emulator with mouse controls because the traps in that game are game breaking on ps2 and gamecube[/B]

[B]
Survival Mode needs to be added. The game has less content currently if my requirements are not too high after HD and 3. I played all games and every 3 months I play First and Second.
All in all the game can be good but needs [U]fixing[/U] ""trying to be popular"" problem and stay more true to the original and please add an option to unlock all unnecessary new perks after completing the game once if it isn't already in. I am still playing through the game.
It is FUN but not worth the money when SS 1st, SS 2nd, SS2 is childish but still more fun, SS3 still has good enemy placements. Only SS Next Encounter (the GBA game too) are worse.

I played my first Serious Sam game around 2006 and ever since then I've came back every year or so play them again, as generic the gameplay can seem at first glance, there's nothing quite like it, admittedly that feeling was missing for me at the start of Serious Sam 4, I was slightly worried when I got treated to objective markers and cutscenes, skillpoints and A.I. companions.

A few levels in though, my worries started to fade as the game picks up the pace and begins to scratch that Serious Sam itch I have very well, hundreds of enemies swarming your screen with a banging soundtrack and (in my opinion) great backdrops to it all, finished off with more ridiculous weapons than ever.

It stumbles here and there, a lot of the jokes and dialogue doesn't quite land, some boss fights feel a bit stale and you're tailed by A.I. who spout cheesy one-liners a bit more than I'd like, but there's great new additions too, alternate firing modes and dual wielding are incredibly fun to toy around with, all of which makes the times where the game is firing on full cylinders while giving you the freedom to play around that much more satisfying.

I'm a bit conflicted about this one. On one hand, if you liked SS3, you'll enjoy this one, generally speaking, it's more of the same + some new stuff. It's fun, guns are very good, most upgrades/alt-fires are stupidly powerful and fun to use. Sound design has its highs and lows, but the sound of shotgun shot and flesh hit is so, so good. Some enemies got rebalanced (witches have less bullshit and helicopters aren't hitscan, for instance), some were introduced and are ok. Kamikaze don't cause as much dust now, that's a plus. Many enemies got weakpoints, which is cool and allows for more effective ammo usage (you can kill scrapjacks/mancubi with a headshot from devastator for example; also Khnum can get massive damage from cannonball to the head). Maps are mostly beautiful (see below). Music SLAPS. All-around, a decent Serious Sam game. My expectations weren't high, and I got what I wanted, and even then some. I had fun while playing it. And still...

There are severe performance issues. It looks fine on ultras (autodetect), but fps is unstable on i7-7700K+RTX2080. I lowered all settings to HIghs and it slightly increased performance, I ended up playing on 45-120fps. And on highs it looks... tolerable. there's some props popping in and out of existance, trees LODs are very noticeable, but that's not the main problem. Sometimes ""arena"" is too dark and I can't tell the difference between headless soldiers, bombers and firecrackers. One boss arena was so dark I could barely see terrain (good thing the boss was flying and clearly visible on sky background).

Playing SS4 I remembered a certain quote several times. ""F***** RAW"" - Gordon Ramsey. Some terrain parts out of bounds are missing, although you can clearly see that if you jump. UI is not good: many guns have similar silhouettes which makes weapon wheel a pain to use. Ammo bars are not displayed on bottom right, there are gadgets instead. Gadgets selection mid-combat is horrible, and their activation should've been instant, one button press. There's no flashlight, not even automatically toggled one like in SS3. Sidemissions have a card with reward listed on them, massive spoiler, it shouldn't be this way (I avoided reading them after the first one). Some parts of maps are hard to navigate without objective marker and navigation guide (which before SS3 wasn't a problem). Only one option for customizable crosshair. 4 multiplayer skins, all of them are Sam. No multiplayer survival or deathmatch, player limit is 4.

Cons:
you feel like youre hitting enemies with a wet tissue. In previous games I always felt like an overwhelming force of power, not I just feel like a dogshit useless retard.
The game feels and plays like a shitty Unity asset flip, trying too hard to be Doom Eternal and not serious sam.
Game feels rushed and unfinished, poorly optimized and just generally feel robbed of my time and money.
I was looking forward to this since I have loved all previous games but this is just insulting to fans and the franchise itself.

- quite a few bugs. Eg. cut scenes where the npc is half in and half out of closed doors, duplicate npc in one room, terrain glitches., places you should have been able to jump to and places you shouldn't have been able to jump were buggy as heck
-buggy physics engine
-optimization is pretty poor
-did I mention 4 person only co-op
-if you crash or lose connections to server you lose all your special perks/gadgets
-the game should save your game in the same co-op without losing all your items
-poor secret rewards
- game doesn't show you each level if you actually found the many secrets, you had to find that information when you started a new game, then you would have to click the level in the game menu under levels to actually view how many secrets you found during the last session. 
-after each level (game map) no stats were shown, which was extremely disappointing 
-Doesn't work on DX11. DX11 is set by default and leads to game crash
-FPS is low even on high end computers 
-for a co-op game it seems to be built around a single player character
-No new Guns 
-seemed only the last part of the game had hordes of mobs, which in the beginning it left you feeling like where did all the hordes go?
-the rewards were nothing great
-the map is huge which leaves players feeling like a lot was missing from the game. Like they intended to add more but rushed it to market. 
-oh, and did I mention only 4 person co-op? instead of 16 like it use to be. 
- the skill points didn't seem to make you any stronger or better. Also why a skill point system anyways, didn't seem add to the game play ?

95,76647460,english,"[h1][u][b]Seriously insipid[/b][/u][/h1]
[i]For a game that took 8 years to make, I had much higher hopes, but as it turns out, serious sam 4 dropped as an addon to SS3 with some ever-so-slight improvements, noticeable deteriorations and unbidden additions[/i].

[h1]1. There is a story?[/h1] An actual storyline was added, with lots of narration and cut-scenes on almost every level, the first few levels nearly made me think I am playing some Call of Duty shooter. 
A rather questionable supplement to the core game: Serious Sam has never needed a story to be properly enjoyed, let alone a story that's so generic, sloppy and vapid. The characters are lopsided and void of any elaborate design. There's even an arachnoid defector, which gets introduced midgame, follows you around as an AI companion on one level and then never gets mentioned ever again.

 This is not to say, that experimenation is a bad thing, certainly is when it goes to the neglect of other, more important game elements, though. And the awful animations don't make it any better.

[h1]2. A mess of poor graphics and unbelievably awful optimisation.[/h1] Graphics and optimisation. Ugh, the ugly part. The graphics have barely changed at all since The Talos Principle and, in some regards, even SS3. Blurry textures, conked lighting, blocky shadows, broken LOD, short draw distance, low-quality backgrounds, corpses and decals disappearing instantly when out of sight, etc. There is almost no real destructibility and the explosions feel very weak. Reflections on water, jesus christ, THE REFLECTIONS. Some rare water puddles even have some water physics that make it look like melted plastic or mercury or whatever. What's wrong with sam's sunglasses absorbing all the light? They are blacker than black holes.

And at those seldom moments when the game actually delivers an adequate vista, the performance is an utter rubbish. In fact, the performance is rubbish at all times. CPU and GPU loads are a joke. The first half of the game runs like crap, with huge FPS drops out of thin air, and I mean it - you can have a stable 60 FPS and go down to 30 the next corner or the next step. Whenever a kamikaze explodes, the framerate inevitably and drastically bombs. Vulkan doesn't work, DirectX 12 crashes all the time. There is absolutely no excuse for this.

[h1]3. SS3 borrowings and changes [/h1] All the gameplay features from SS3, good and bad, reconstituted themselves in SS4, like sprinting, melee grabs, ADS and so on. A newer addition also took place - a headshot mechanic, that triples all damage and makes guns like devastator and barret outright broken. To compensate for that, 90% of all ranged attack enemies do are either tracking or leading, fashioning a very specific gameflow. What for? 

Melee grabs have been watered down, by the way. Remember tearing gnaar's eyes and beheaded's hearts out and scrapjacks' heads off and throwing them around? Yeah, forget it, now most melee kills consist of sticking a knife into everything, even the biggest enemies. 

Oh, and, on the off-chance you've ever felt a need for a barebones and ultimately gratuitous skill tree system in a serious sam game: you should rejoice now, for your pleas have not fallen on deaf ears!

[h1]4. Bodies disappear in an instant, blood evaporates or never even gets splattered.[/h1]
This item stems from the graphical development of the game, but yes. It's the end of 2020, and we still don't happen to get a decent aftermath in a shoot 'em up game. Corpses of fallen enemies vanish in a wink or even when you turn away for just a fraction of a second. There are no blood puddles and most enemies don't spatter blood at all, and, yup, blood also disappears as quickly as it pops up. 
Gore dematerializes in about 5 seconds regardless of whether or not you keep it in sight. 
Ragdolls of big enemies are static. How wonderful.

[h1]5. New enemies that look like they came directly from SS2[/h1] What happened to the enemy art design? The biomechs, mummies (exceptionally annoying mummies at that), nazi gorillas, tentacle zombie inmates, green cacodemons, bloaters? Moderation in all things, please; Should've left the tacky ones to SS2.

[h1]6. The level design. Or what remains of it.[/h1] The environment art has obviously been inspired by SS3 and The Talos Principle, with bland and dreary narrow urban labyrinths of SS3 taking turns with stereotypic medieval ruins of The Talos Principle, also backed up by rare, huge and scenic (but no less forgettable and empty) expanses, which can be traversed with 3 different transports: a motorbike, a harvester and a quadbike. 

The level design gets you fighting dozens of big enemies, spawned in a big circle around the arena, keeping you surrounded at all times. Also, remember that all ranged enemies lead their shots? Yeah. Enjoy dodging all of those AoE rockets and spread-shots coming at you from different angles. As a means to alleviate your struggles, SS4 offers consumable items - buffs or throwables or even free revives, that let you completely trivialise the fight, like tossing a black hole or shooting a nuke.

There are side quests in SS4, which are just more carnage with a consumable or a weapon upgrade in the end. It's no great shakes and should've just been a part of the main level, as it's nothing special and serves no special purpose.

A ridable mech was an advertised rather prominent feature of the game, yet misses the mark completely. I suppose the mech insets were made to break the player away from the routine, though they are themselves even more of a routine than the regular fights, thankfully these don't last for very long. You are given the mech thrice in the entire game, 2 of them ending with a curbstomping boss fight as you spam them with rockets in a matter of a minute while they're doing nothing. The last boss is dispatched with the use of a mech as well.

[h1]7. The ""Pull-my-leg-ion"" System[/h1] The so-called ""Legion System"" is a big flipping lie. You'll never get to meet more than a hundred enemies (as per usual in SS game) in a fight concurrently. The only time there are ""battlefields teeming with thousands of enemies"" is at the very end of the game, but all turns out to be nothing more than a delusionary semblance, as the whole scene is basically hollow low-poly models running into one another. Shame.

[h1]8. Pathetic bosses[/h1] Boss fights? Well, as far as I remember, there are 4 boss fights, 2 of which are ruined by a mech. What are the other two? One is a big green crab in a Colloseum and the other one is the main story antagonist, which is just a beefed up achriman witch. Both die very quickly and have only one or two attack patterns. 

[h1]9. Some of the positive whatsits[/h1] The only level I genuinely enjoyed was the last one, when the game throws everything at you, and even tries some of more interesting enemy combinations, accompanied by a Grand Cathedral track remix straight from SS:TSE. It's a classic bloodbath, although the level itself is an uninspiring brown dullness. 

One thing that can be surely identified as an improvement, would be weapon upgrades: underbarrel GL for the shotgun, beam module for the laser cannon, heat-seeking multirockets for the rocket launcher. Whilst sparse, they do mix up the jaded gameplay formula of the series.

The gunplay also got mildly enhanced, with some weapons like shotguns, laser cannon and grenade launcher getting a bit of an oomph - recoiling, smoking and jolting. That makes some older weapons quite satisfying to use.

[h1]Conclusion.[/h1]
[i]Overall, SS4 is a boring and sometimes irritating snoozefest that took 8 years to make. As a somewhat of a serious sam fan, I expected a lot more from a game that took 8 bleeding years to develop. Instead, I got a regressive, unpolished, unstable and lacking DLC to SS3 - unarguably the worst part of the series. Or so it was, because now it can confidently pass these laurels on to SS4! Isn't that great?[/i]",1601200006,1601203698,False,2,0,0.462763845920562744,0,True,False,False,76561198034217511,773,473,1544,1544,1159,1601781369,,

97,76649741,english,"Serious Sam is suppose to be about the guns, TONS of monsters that make you feel over whelmed, and fun secrets to find by exploring or doing something random, like shooting all the statues down.

The only thing this game seemed to properly achieve from those 3 were the guns. The guns were great...

SS4 prides itself on their new system, the ""Legion System"". This is suppose to allow up to 100,000 (yes, ONE-HUNDRED THOUSAND) enemies on screen, at once, with no issues. They nailed the ""no issues"" part. The game ran the same when there was ""100k"" enemies on the screen as when there was 20, atleast for the most part... The issue is they just didn't use this tech they made. They used it for ONE part of the whole game, and it was a very short part, it was cool for 10 seconds, but then you basically were forced to ignore it and focus on what they wanted you to focus on, so you didn't even get to enjoy it. You didn't get to feel that over whelming feel that really makes the SS games fun. Most of the horde fights would end up being you killed everything and you are literally waiting for more enemies to spawn... Thats not Serious Sam...

My favorite part of SS games are the secrets. Exploring a area or shooting things randomly and finding a cool puzzle or a cool encounter was always fun... This game decided to go a different route with the secrets. While there was a handful (Literally a handful) of cool encounter secrets, 90% of them were parkour jump puzzles (and when I say puzzles, I don't mean adventure type puzzles). Basically it was theres a glowing purple device up there (Which are items you can use once and these items stack up to 10, but they will do things to help you in your fight, like a drone that attacks enemies, or a health pack/stim pack shot, etc) and you have to jump on some walls to reach it. Yup, thats literally what their secrets were. A big message would pop up when you grabbed it that would say ""SECRET FOUND!"". Might as well be collecting feathers in Assassins Creed.

My other big issue was when I would try to explore and find secrets in hopes to find something other than a lame gadget, but instead, I was punished. So many times I'd end up outside of the map trying to find my way back in. Nothing to explore outside of the map either, just floating buildings, textures that disappear, and random water that had some weird push back mechanic (basically a invis wall essentially). 

To make it all worse, playing in Co-op, my friends would end up randomly crashing with all the optimization issues going on with the game (Which I wont really discuss much, theres enough posts about that), and when they would get back in the game, they wouldn't even have any gadgets that they spent all the time finding and collecting, because it doesnt actually save anything you do. Played all night and ready to call it a night when you finish this level? Got a ton of Gadgets that DO carry over to the next level? Well as soon as you log off and start up again the next day, you start COMPLETELY fresh. If you were max ammo when you logged off, you will now have what ever the level default was for starting ammo. Unlocked cool mods from the side quests for your gun? Now the weapon mods are gone! Gathered 10 of each gadget that you saved for a big fight? Thats gone too. Nothing really saves in this game. If you plan on doing part of a level each night and not fully finish the level, dont bother, theres no check point saving either. Its literally start fresh from the start of the level.

As for the rest... Lots of bugs, lots of optimization issues, graphics are meh for a game in 2020 (although if the game play is good then it really doesnt matter, but sadly the gameplay is just... ok).

I spent 20 hours doing the campaign (Most of this was looking for secrets that just really were not there this time). Theres only the campaign at the moment, no other game modes, but I believe eventually we will get some as the server list section has a drop down to search for specific game modes.

This game would be a good deal for $15-20 though... So if it goes on sale, grab it then, but doubt that will be anytime soon. Im sure they will fix the bugs and optimization issues though decently fast, so I wouldnt worry to much about that, but the core game play... I doubt that will really change sadly. There will be mod support within 1-2 months of launch.

The game lags to high hell at all times, I have a 2070 and 32gb of ram as well as an I7-8700 and on medium the game dropped to 20 fps in almost every arena, and frequently textures would still be loading even after the GLACIAL loading screens. Waiting upwards of 3 minutes for a loading screen only to find out that nothing actually loaded is just pitiful. Not to mention that changing the graphic settings crashes the game about 50% of the time.

Several times the in game waypoints were incorrect, one of which required going out of bounds over some rock textures, which the in game guide actually told me to do, to only be lead to a door that opens a good 5-10 minutes later in the game.

Also I expect enemy spam from SS, thats the whole game, and for the most part it was perfectly reasonable, but the final level takes it way beyond anything that is reasonable without save states. Placing dozens of elite machine gun enemies in very hard to hit places, and filling the arena with kamikaze so that you are being killed from outside your FOV at every angle in the only arena without refreshing health drops, and being forced to more or less stand in the open for 5 minutes REALLY ruined the game for me. 

Honestly not sure why I expected this game to be good when SS3 was so bad, but I once again let SS1 hype me up to spend $40 on not SS1 again. This series has been bad since second encounter, and I hope I can discourage anyone from buying this soulless attempt at recreating SS. Please Croteam, stop trying.

+ Best gameplay/gunplay of all SS games, fun gadgets and most weapons now have good alternative fire mode, some weapon's alts are just very good
+ Best gore of any game with huge amount of enemies

Cons:
- Bad level design
- Repetitive assets everywhere, I have almost none of levels left in my memory because there are 3-4 types of levels and they look same
- Killed loneless atmosphere of last human survivor
- Killed idea that the only person who could survive mental is unrealistic comic book cringy dude; now random soldier rookie and pilot grill can kill Khnums and survive ambushes with dozens of bulls
- New characters that are left to be alive only to serve as fan service in next game
- Another prequel, while SS3 is a good prequel and shows what was there before TFE and creates good time line, SS4 feels unnecessary and adds nothing to world story of SS

Conclusion:
While I didn't like what was happening in game itself, and levels looked boring, still took me 20 hours on hard difficulty and new weapon alt modes and gadgets combines with awesome gore makes for a very good game.

23,76640163,english,"As someone who's played Serious Sam since its launch on the Original Xbox when I was 6. I then got Serious Sam HD and Serious Sam 3 for the Xbox 360. I now am a PC gamer and I purchased every single Serious Sam title. I feel as if I am more than qualified to give a review based on a game I was waiting 7 years for.

First I want to get into expectations because it seems people who are posting these very negative reviews are expecting a company of 40 to be able to produce something of which a company like Dice EA with 640 can do. This game is 40$ so from the gates you can see this is a AA title, Croteam makes their own new engine for every game in order to raise the bar from the previous game. Hence why Serious Sam Fusion, Serious Sam HD, and Serious Sam Classics all have their own differences while still being mostly the same games. Lets start with some of the major points people have.

-Lack of new weapons
A very strange argument because if we take a look at Serious Sam 3 BFE its weapons roster is nearly identical to the games from 2001 with the C4, Devastator, Sledgehammer replacing the knife, and the Pistol replacing the Revolvers. Serious Sam 2 was also the same way with reskin replicas but also adding a few new items. The amount of weaponry, gadgets, and perks added makes this the largest arsenal in ANY Serious Sam game.

-Looping soundtrack. Alright this is a very strange argument because the other games did this too. Most levels in older games were actually LONGER than some of the Serious Sam 4 levels so you'd hear those songs more it just seams that they really wanted to bring the audio to the front so you notice it better.

-""Its an alpha"" This is far FAR from an alpha, if you wanted an alpha you should watch the original trailers for the games years ago. THAT was an alpha. Again this is a company of 40 or so employee's that are attempting to push the limits of old school shooters as a whole, they don't get the budget of a company like EA, Activision, ID who can just make an engine and build off it with over 500+ people

-""Bad level design"" The Level design for Serious Sam 4 is MUCH more of an improvement from the previous title. Serious Sam 3's level design was horrid in most levels in the later stages and very slow paced in the earlier stages of the game. Serious Sam 4 from the jump is much faster.

-""Cringe or bad cutscenes."" This shouldn't even be a criticism. Serious Sam Classics, Fusion, and HD had cutscenes where the enemies could hit you anyways. So be grateful you get something. But even then why are you trying to focus on the story of a game where the story almost doesn't even matter? Serious Sam was born during a time where games such as Quake, Doom, Unreal, etc etc... Wanted almost no story and just threw you into combat. The cutscenes are there mostly to give you a break from the action and let yourself relax. A common thing most players who don't play Serious Sam say is ""The game is mentally exhausting because of the hordes of enemies they throw"" The games are hard, they are unforgiving, they are relentless. The cutscenes do their job.

There are some things I would change. But this game in my eyes is without a doubt much better than the previous game, while distinguishing itself to be its own thing. Modders will have a good time with the engine and technology here, and some modders may stay with the previous games. Serious Sam 4, 3, Fusion, HD, Classics, Revolution, and VR. Are all their own games with their very own communities and that's what this one did well. It lays out a new foundation with a unique flow to combat and gives us new idea's and toys to play. For now there are no mods HOWEVER in the menu's there is a ""Workshop packages"" so once modders begin to get to work, we will see this game become alive and flushed with unique players who will bring lots of amazing overhauls and mods to the workshop. Give this game some time if you are wanting to get into the modding scene. Don't come into Serious Sam 4 like it is a game with a budget like DOOM. Come in it and remember that these guys poured their life into this and they want to do more with their series. Keep an open mind and you'll learn to love the game and its quirky nature.

This game is absolutely fantastic. It blends the classic Serious Sam formula alongside other games like Doom and Shadow Warrior. Serious Sam has always been about strategy. Controlling the waves. Knowing what weapon works best against each enemy. This game amplifies that and forces you to respond so much quicker than previous titles. Ontop of that it gives you the ability to upgrade certain aspects of your character (dual-wielding, faster reloads, more tolerance towards explosions, etc) which feels great. There's also a new item category called ""Gadgets"". There are a vast amount of different gadgets that will seriously help you within combat. These gadgets have saved me countless times.

[b]1) Performance.[/b] While for the most part it wasn't intolerable, there were some areas in specific that really dipped on framerates which can be really frustrating when trying to control the waves of enemies. They have since released a hotfix however the issue still continued to persist throughout the game.

[b]2) Random Glitches.[/b] One of the most noticeable issues was clearing the waves and having the music immediately cut off. Not fade away, but just literally being stopped. It really ruined the feeling of satisfaction you get when you look around and realize you finished the battle. Some other glitches I've noticed are certain enemies not responding whatsoever, audio logs playing automatically when collecting them, and sometimes the audio in cutscenes would be dead silent for a few moments. Nothing game breaking, just a bit odd at times.

[b]3) Snipers.[/b] I understand that certain enemies are meant to make things challenging (such as the Reptiloids or Beheaded Firecrackers/Bombers or Pyros), but the snipers have this incredible aim that is literally impossible to dodge unless if there's cover nearby. It's seriously annoying especially when they are so far away that you can't see them. Fortunately they aren't very common to run into but still. They are absolute trash.

The story isn't anything fancy but it's something fun to follow along with.

This is truly a great game in the Serious Sam franchise. Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter will always be my favorite Serious Sam, but I feel like Serious Sam 4 fits right under SS HD: TFE. This game brings a lot of new features to the table while also catering to the fans. This is the game I've been waiting 9 years for.

After almost 8 hours of gameplay I can say it certainly is fun.  Shooting feels incredible, some of the best yet; and most everything looks nice (barring some outliers).  I think there's an excessive amount of people blowing up minute negative aspects.  Optimization I do think has some issues on higher end systems.

This might not be the best optimized game, I had to lower the graphics a bit but it already seems much better than what some people are claiming. It might not have the best graphics but really though that's not why you should be playing Serious Sam. 

In my opinion it's a bit of a shame they went with the modern setting again BUT it is such a step up from the last game, they have color options so you can make it more vibrant and colorful.

I'm playing it in co-op and there have been bugs, a lot of wonk and other weird things and I have been laughing my ass off. So far this has probably been the most fun I've had in a Serious Sam game. The puns are so terrible they become great,
most of the jokes in the game are so dumb and I love it. I understand that's not for everyone but in that case I'm surprised if you liked any of the older games.

The gameplay is great, I heard some things that made me worried but pretty much all of that went away after playing. The weapons feel really good, the alt fires you can unlock from side missions are good. The perk system at first seem weird and not at all like something that fits Serious Sam but it's fine. There are some fun things and you can at any point switch your perks so you don't have to worry about being stuck with the chosen perks.

The leveldesign is good, there are fun secrets and I feel like there's a good mix between larger open areas and more narrow linear areas. I'm surprised how much I actually like the mission markers, when I first heard they added it I was unsure how to feel about it. Mission markers in a Serious Sam game?! Actually works better than you might think, after you have been searching around for secrets and ammo/health/armor it's nice to not have to run all over to find your way, you can even turn it off in the settings if you don't want it.

TL;DR
It's not perfect, there are a lot of things you can nitpick but in its whole it's really fun. 
It can be a little laggy at times. (Not to the point it's unplayable, atleast for me)
The gameplay is really fun, weapons feel good, the jokes are so bad they are good and I really recommend it.

+Great weapon- and gadgetvariety. Large selection of weapons and unlockable alternate firingmodes.
+Satisfying gunplay. Shooting enemies is tons of fun.
+Fun new enemies (except the ""Proceced""... f them) with great looking visual designs.
+Enemyvariety in waves is great. Rarely do you run into long waves containing a single enemytype.
+Leveldesign is decent
+The dumb humour is honestly supercharming. I want to call it ""so bad it's good"" but is being superdumb really the same as ""bad?""
+Perktrees felt like a big no-no at first, but all perks are creative and add to the core gameplay loop, and you can re-spec at will so you're not locked into anything. Perks help mix up the gunplay.
+Fun secrets. While not as good as TFE and TSE, there are still a lot of quirky secret encounters to find.
+Settingsmenu is just as good as any other Serious Sam game. I could change every aspect of the game's graphics down to every last detail, in order to find the optimal settings for my pc. 

+- Graphics are a bit hit and miss. Some areas are messy and the colourscheme is pretty monochrome (however after messing around with the colouroptions I found something that looked pretty decent).
+- Tons of people report performance issues, even though the latest patch seems to have solved most of them for me. CroTeam are probably working hard on ironing things like this out, but be wary if you have a lower end PC.

-Readability issues due to monochrome colourscehems on enemies and large amounts of vegetation/underbrush. There was a particular moment early on where I walked down a path and suddenly got bombarded by an ambush of grenadiers that I litterally could not see against the backdrop.
-""Side objectives"" with ""optional rewards"" should just be part of the level properly. There's no reason to skip these challenges and the rewards make the game so much more fun. Only thing this adds is an extra element of backtracking that, while not dull due to new waves and pickups on the returntrip, could've been avoided for a better flow.
-First 2-3 levels are pretty boring and overloaded with cutscenes.
-Cutscenes are pretty poorly directed.
-Locales are generic. While some levels have interesting theming, like the one set against the backdrop of an erupting volcano, most of the levels I've played so far involve you running through citystreets, castleruins and graveyards. I would love to see more imaginative and colourful environments in future Serious Sam games.

I don't usually leave reviews, cause i'm not great at writing my thoughts on things, so i'll just leave a pros and cons because i've been waiting 9 years for this game and I seriously believe croteam have delivered well and with more.

+ 3 different shotguns, thats one shotgun more than doom eternal.
+ SS4 is the most ambitious serious sam title in both tech and narrative. the legion system (fighting 100,000 enemies on screen) truly works and the narrative written by the talos principle writer has good humour and few heartfelt moments.
+ Weapon mods that provide additional ways to to use weapons. all the mods are creative and fun.
+ New optional objective / Side quest feature.
+ New gadget features that can drastically change the battlefield.
+ Musical score really accelerates the action sequences.
+ Lengthy game (10-ish hours, it really depends on what difficulty you play.)
+ Most accurate portrayal of shotguns I have seen in a video game.
+ The bosses come in a wide variety and are never un-fun to fight.
+ Most characters are loveable and are easy to feel attatched to.
+ Every single gun in the game stay consistently viable options throughout the whole campaign.
+ Croteam is planning on making as many patches needed until all bugs are gone.
+ Wholesome credits, I couldn't stop smiling. <3


- This game is filled to the brim with technical bugs (Rendering issues, Glitching textures, Audio mishaps, etc.) Nothing super detrimental or game breaking though.
- Really poor optimisation.
- Poor visual quality for a game in 2020. (Personally not a problem for me but alot of people seem to care about that.)
- Character animations both in melee finishers and cutscenes are incredibly janky and rigid.
- Gameplay is often really exhausting, being pitted against impossible numbers constantly.
- Some arenas offer an over abundance of ammo and health while some arenas have scarce resources.
- Legion system isn't experimented with enough in the campaign to really have an appreciation.
- Vehicles were something heavily teased with trailers and teases but they are pretty rare to find.

Overall: if you want full throttle nuts to butts action against teaming alien hordes with sarcasm and witty dialogue, then you should really consider this game. This game is just super fun superficial carnage.

61,76597896,english,"I first was introduced to serious sam 20 years ago with the Serious ""Sam Test - Public Test 1 (v0.06 build 95)"".  I fell in love almost immediately. Here was something that I enjoyed on a level, i had rarely seen in a fps game before.

The main ingredients for this were:

- a stylized, larger than life setting, that immediately sucks you in and makes you feel like you are on vacation in a dreamland version of reality.
- brightly lit open area levels (something never seen before in the genre) and some equally eye-pleasing dungeon areas.
- a non stop action approach to shooting large and larger amounts of enemies in varying combinations that keep you focused and let you zone-out while running around, choosing the right tool for the given situation.
- lots of secrets to discover
- great music that switches between relaxing epic idle-tunes and pumping action-music.
- silly monsters, silly weapons, silly one-liners but serious fun.
- lens flares

When First Encounter was finally released in 2001 I enjoyed it immensely. Reviewers (and most of my friends) on the other hand had a hard time liking it. The overall tenor was: stupid, silly, boring, repetitive etc... Enough people seemed to like it though...

Since then, croteam have essentially made the same game over and over again, with some variations on their initial recipe:

- SS SE: same formula + new weapons, more enemies, more worlds to explore, distorted gravity levels...
People criticized it for being more of the same, for not having a story, for having gimmicky distorted gravity levels...

- SS 2:  same formula + grenade button, ride-able vehicles, homing parrots, a ""story"", even more worlds to explore, friendly npcs...
It was criticized for being more of the same, having a story, being too silly, not feeling like a ""true serious sam game""...

- SS BFE: same formula + grittier setting, reloading, aim down sights, melee kills...
It was criticized for being too ""realistic"", having reloadable weapons, being more of the same, not feeling like a ""true serious sam game""...

And now we have Serious sam 4. The moment I fired up the game I knew I was at home:

- SS 4: same formula + Mediterranean setting, less weapon reloading, more enemies, better gun sounds, faster gun play, skill system...

I've seen the bad reviews. I get it that some people have technical issues; that sucks and should not happen to a game on release.
But apart from that, I can not comprehend all the talk about: ""not feeling right, clunky, not a true serious sam game, bad music, silly cut scenes, bad characters"" etc..

Apart from FE every title in the series had its problems and strengths. In my opinion the problems never outweighed the fun factor. I too don't like hit scanning zombie brokers, silly blue smurf creatures, cringe humor, depressing city levels, boring underground caverns etc. But in general, and from a pure gameplay experience all games in the series stayed true to their basic promise of over the top action in a silly game world. And all the games were essentially criticized for not being the first encounter.

So from my point of view, this is as good a serious sam game as its predecessors maybe even one of the best. There is so much to love here and so far I am very happy how this turned out.

The gunplay has never felt so tight, the weapon sounds are much better than ever before (especially the coach gun), and I think this might be the first time a shotgun in a shooter doesn't have the spread of an exploding can of beans. Personally I like the characters, the humor and even the story. The setting makes me feel like being on monster shooting vacation in Italy and not locked in a corona-infected and madness-riddled reality...and this is what a game should provide…. A good dose of escapism.

If I could wish for something to add to this game, I would want to have the grenade button from serious sam 2 and the old customizable crosshair back.

And it sure was! New Serious Engine is just mindblowing and the game itself is a much better Serious Sam game since BFE with a mixture of both First/Second Encounter. The amount of enemies on screen is insane and the gameplay is just as fun as it should be, however the launch was a bit rough but it will improve over time, if anything I'd suggest to submit all the bugs to this following e-mail address: support@croteam.com

This is my personal review of the game so far. Thank you Croteam for all the hard work, love and effort that was put into crafting such a masterpiece that is Serious Sam 4. 

Really looking forward to the upcoming patches that might help improve the game much much further. But the serious question is... Is it worth picking? Absolutely! I'll update this review once I finish the game, for now I can recommend it in it's state as it plays fairly well and i haven't ran into any bugs as of now, however there might be performance issues so i'd suggest to lower down the CPU/GPU settings to at least medium, for now the lowest setting preset is kind of buggy and doesn't work as intended but that will be fixed very soon!

Update: I have completed the game and all i have to say... It's just can't be described in words but to put it lightly, it was beyond awesome. 

The story was incredible and there wasn't a single moment the game felt dull due to it's awesomeness, it has surpassed my expectations and in my personal opinion if the hardware was as advanced as it is today back in 2010-2011, this could have been one of the most technologically advanced games ever but back on the topic, the writing in terms of dialogue, cutscenes and the overall setting is very well done, the character dialogue is very funny and amusing in most ways yet still tries to focus on the subject which is a good thing.

The soundtrack.... oh the soundtrack.... Damjan absolutely nailed it this time around, all the drums combined with various instruments is just so pleasing to the ears and makes all the battles in the game makes you feel that you are in there, fighting for your life and the life of your friends.

The Legion system which is a new thing in the series, it's absolutely insane, the amount of enemies on screen without any performance drops is just one of the things that i would consider as revolutionary and it works very well with the tone of the series and works pretty well on levels that are wide open such as the Rural France location.

The gameplay itself is very fun and in fact it is a much better experience and improves upon BFE in many ways, every weapon in the game feels unique and powerful against the horde of enemies on screen. Even the Pistol is way more useful now!!!

My final verdict for this game and pretty much how i feel about it:

It's a must have for a serious sam fan, and considering it's a prequel to all the Serious Sam games... Buy it and don't hesitate. It's a must have in your library. Everything about the game is just great and it feels like a proper Serious Sam game after all these years.

Thank you Croteam for this incredible game and for bringing Sam once more again. I am looking forward to your next project, and I am hoping for a Serious Sam Sequel this time around, if you guys knew how to make a badass prequel to the series, I am sure you folks will deliver one hell of a game in the future. <3",1601038409,1601157254,True,4,0,0.569096803665161133,0,True,False,False,76561198084015153,427,7,832,832,523,1602096797,,

Sure, the game is no Far Cry 5 or Assasins Creed: Origins, or even Doom for that matter. But it is pretty clear that this game doesn't try to be any of that. Serious Sam 4 plays and feels very much like a combination of the First and Second encounter mixed with Serious Sam 3:BFE.
There isn't a lot of innovation in terms of core game play, and it is up to you if you feel like this detracts from the experience. Personally, I think that the old school gameplay stays fresh enough to keep the game challenging and entertaining. The handful of new mechanics and perks introduced in this game so far really work out for me. As for the optimization issues: I was blessed enough to not encounter any so far.

After 9 years we finally have Serious Sam 4, but the question is - is it worth it?
Serious Sam 4 takes place before the third game, making it a pre-presequel (or a pre-sequel?)

The Good
-New weapons, and weapon system which allows dual wielding and weapon attachments
-Vehicles -  some for transport, some for fighting
-Side missions - a good way to get yourself some upgrades
-New enemies
-Different region maps, gonna give you that nostalgic feel from TSE and the 2nd game
-Perks
-Great soundtrack

The Neutral
-Map designs, some areas are way too empty or unfinished
-Legion system
-A decent story
-Some new sound effects
-Headshots, sometimes it feels like it makes the game a bit too easy, but that's just my opinion
-Few bosses become regular enemies, same thing from the 3rd game, which I personally wasn't a fan of
-Final boss

The Bad
-Shabby optimization, in some places you can experience serious frame drops and lag
-France levels
-No workshop yet
-AI can get buggy, where they simply run into a wall or spawn somewhere else

Final
Serious Sam 4 is a fantastic game and worth the wait. Despite its flaws, its very fun, challenging and stays true to its gameplay style, even with some of the new and modern day features. As for the bugs and other bad things, hopefully CroTeam improves them soon enough.

(Imho, people should write reviews after finishing whole game, because it gives more complete impressions)

Gameplay is just perfect -- i see a lot of classic mechanics that were reimagined and upgraded. Also, there are a lot of new things that were very unexpected for SS game -- like side missions, vehicles, a mech etc.
Upgrading systems for weapons and skills are nice -- they're minimalistic and really useful. Shooting akimbo miniguns with that Serious Rage drink is for absolute destruction. Or riding a werebull is another unexpected feature.
At the first glance, it seems like those new 'toys' make the gameplay unbalanced. However it's not very true: to the end of Italy levels the amount of enemies is becoming ridiculously huge. Another new feature is gadgets, I used them rarely -- only when i died more than twice in the same place -- I wanted to deal with such large numbers enemies with only my weapons :)

The music adds a whole new layer of epicness! 

The story is nice for SS, and even once Sam said something unexpected and powerful, not gonna lie :') .  Animations are a bit stiff BUT it's from a team of less than 50 people and the budget is completely uncomparable with other games like Doom.

Legion and terrain systems are impressive, but the usage of them in the game is limited, but it would be worse if it was overused.

94,76503991,english,"Новый Серьёзный Сэм. Дождались. Наконец-то!

В свете последних событий, игра получила довольно много незаслуженно негативных отзывов, как от обычных пользователей, так и от т.н. игрожура. Попробую разобрать самые частые придирки относительно этой игры. Не претендую на истину в последней инстанции, но как есть.

Небольшое введение. Насчёт спринта, перезарядки и прицеливания. Со времён сс3 комьюнити разделилось на две условные группы: классикофаги, которые считают, что это всё не нужно, и модернофаги, которым новые механики заходят нормально. И тех и других можно понять, но есть оговорки. 

Классические сэмы были более математическими что ли. На убийство разных врагов были разные пушки. Камикадзе — револьверы, клиры — двустволка, быки — 1 ракета + 1 выстрел из двустволки, большой механойд — 5 ракет и т.д. Игра требовала больше знаний от тебя как от игрока, точное знание спавнов, секретов (секреты крайне важны, без них смэрть, в частности на высокой сложности) и т.д. Опять же, если ты подпустил камикадзе слишком близко, единственный способ этого избежать — использовать револьверы или томмиган, и использовать быстро, не паникуя. 

Новые части, конечно, потеряли в математичности (во многом сохранив старые комбинации пушек), но приобрели в динамичности. Пример с камикадзе про спринт из видео — тому подтверждение. Не можешь убить — убегай. Прицеливание было и в классике, претензии по этому поводу нерелевантны. А вот перезарядка очень многим не понравилась ещё во времена в сс3. Не совсем тот опыт, который ожидаешь от сэма. Окей, запишем это в минус. НО. В новой части они отзывы комьюнити учли и добавили тучу новых механик, чтобы эту самую перезарядку использовать с пользой, или же ощущать её гораздо меньше. И это ОСОБЕННО смешно на фоне криков и ора о том, что кротим не слушает комьюнити.

Продолжаем про механики. Многие говорят, что игра не прогрессирует, а деградирует, мол де всё старо, всё не так. Замечательно, именно поэтому, полагаю, в сс4 добавили альтернативные режимы стрельбы (которые ещё больше разбавляют былую математичность, ибо теперь быки отлетают с 2 самонаводящихся ракет, а толпы мелочи хорошо принимают подарки из подствольного гранатомёта), добавили дуалвилд разных типов пушек (например, теперь клиры отлетают с залпа дуалвилд дробовиков), добавили возможность кататься на быке (и некоторых других врагах),  кататься на мотоцикле и комбайне, систему полезных гаджетов, прокачку персонажа... Из вышесказанного делаем однозначный вывод: игра деградирует и совсем не движется вперед. Ага, щас.

При этом, в новой части, пожалуй, лучшая стрельба за всю серию игр. Если на что-то кротим и тратили бабки, так это на разработку самых приятных и отзывчивых пушек в игровой индустрии. Двустволка, например, просто прекрасна (и игра даёт добро на просьбу ""дайте две""), все пушки ощущаются как ПУШКИ.

Сюжет не хватает звёзд с небес, но и не душнит бесконечными унылыми монологами, которые хочется промотать, как в думе. Тут хоть улыбнуться можно, да и Сэм раскрывается как персонаж.

Безусловно, игра не лишена минусов. Да, оптимизация графоуния плохая, что делает весьма красочную полумультяшную картинку мыльным мыльцем (в частности на низких настройках, на максах жалоб мало). Но стоит понимать, что кротим, это инди-студия, и для инди-студии на 40 человек они сделали отличную работу. В последние годы даже компании с многомилионными бюджетами выпускают игры с багами и плохой оптимизацией.

Кривая анимация движений и мимики также легко объясняются -- кротим, как инди, всё это делали чуть ли не в домашних условиях, используя для захвата движений свой, кастомный сет, а для мимики разработчики использовали технологию распознавания лиц с айфона. Да, обычного айфона. Вовсе не с помощью дорогущей техники для соответствующих нужд.

С системой легионов вышло не очень. Жаль. Надеюсь, эти наработки обязательно используют в будущем.

В конце уточню один момент, по поводу общей формулы геймплея. Часто можно услышать мнение, что в целом игры из серии серьёзных сэмов, это спинномозговвые шутанчики для дегенератов, то ли дело кал оф дути. И действительно, сэм всегда был про мясо и толпы врагов. Но сэм никогда не был про тупое мясо и отсутствие тактики. Прохождение на высоких уровнях сложности всегда требовало особой прозорливости, памяти, навыков, менеджмента боезапаса и т.д., в тупую игру не пройти ну никак. Я не претендую на экстраоридинарную интеллектуальность геймплея (как многие обзорщики любят сравнивать любую фигню, требующую минимальных интеллектуальных усилий с шахматами), но в случае сэма единственное тупое шутанно-дебильное и бездумное мясо -- это то, точнее тот, кто это мнение высказывает.

98,76615387,english,"So, I will recommend it, but at the same time I really want to vent out about this game.

It is the good old Sam we know and love. The one that a lot of us played since we were kids. Tons of Guns, Monsters, Abilities. Even the characters, which was never the point of any SS games, were cute.
Environments were bright, open and fun to run around.

However:
- The game demands far too much from your PC, even thou it's a casual rooty-rooty-point-n shooty.
- Some weapons are just useless. I mean look what they did to my boy, the double berrel. Its poopy, becuase their new engine prioritises large amount of monsters. 
- The animations of the characters are wooden and the dialogues are #cringe lol.
- The textures tend to not load at all.
- One time I used one of the abilities to bring myself back, and spawned without any weapons
- If you die a bunch of time, and ask the menu to load you again on the same spot as before, it for some reasone reloads the whole level. And loading times are a big oof.
- It gets a tad repeatative. I love shooting n all, but you could spicy it up with trap rooms or something like in the second encounter. (thats a minor thing)

Biggest problem thou, is the end boss battle. HOLY cow, did they dip you in some bull pudding.
""Lead the Attack"" is absolute garbage. Pretty but garbage.
And what comes after is worse... much worse.
Without spoilers, lets just say it introduces to a ton of new mechanics and instead of a boss battle, you will have to use that one weapon you never used the entire game. Its poopy.
 
However, this game is unique. Its something that most games lack nowadays - FUN.
Amids all these copy pasted roguelikes, artsy games and cashgrabs, this game feels genuine. It makes you feel like a kid. You know it gives you that rush like back in the days when you used to some back from school, throw your backpack down and couldn't wait to shoot some monsters.

Pro:
- The GFX is extreme good.
- The Story is by far better than in the previous titles,
- A really good atmosphere.
- Massive new weapons and improvements
- A crazy cool skill tree
- Hundreds to thousands spawned objects...this one is a coding masterpiece
- runs smooth for this huge environment
- tone of tuning options

Con:
- some texture flickering
- no DLCs announced yet (heck I don't wanna wait another 9 years)

If you want to play Herbert Stone 4, you need serious hardware with a serious cooling system. The newest GFX drivers help a lot too !!!

If you can't handle hordes of alien scum , switch to a dual gatling gun or a dual RPG or simply nuke em all.

For political correctness, snowflakes and hippies,  the developer give you the option to switch the red blood into flowers.
And if still can't handle it --> go play minecraft. :-D

It's super fun to play, considering you are a fan of big weapons, lots of shooting, and pure carnage. I'm a fan of the entire Serious Sam franchise myself, I've played almost all games until now, and Serious Sam 4 was already at the top of the list when I reached the middle of the campaign.

Serious Sam has always been about the authenticity in gameplay, silly moments and memorable one-liners. You might also notice some elements (mechanics and visuals) from other games, but that's fine because they blend in very well, and they definitely give a more modern feel to it, which is probably one of Croteam's main goals.

I'd also like to point out all the negative feedback towards the graphics and animation. Seriously, if you know what you're looking for in a Serious Sam game, you'd actually find all the little flaws funny and fun to point out. Sure the animations and lighting look a bit off, but once you start diving into the action you stop paying attention to it. Bear in mind that this game is a HUGE improvement of Serious Sam 3 and just 40 guys (which is a handful) put a lot of effort in making it. Look out for some of their videos showing the development process of not just SS4, but the franchise itself, I guarantee you'll be left inspired and motivated, and I'm not just speaking from a fan's viewpoint.

Let's SAMmarize, we asked for a Serious Sam game, and Croteam delivered. If you know what to look for in a Serious Sam game, you'll be left very satisfied.

PROS
- Fun as every other Serious Sam game
- Ambient is good
- There is this feeling of that makes them SERIOUS SAM games and this is no exception
- Music
- Yep
CONS
- Performance, you must have a somewhat decent pc to barely play this game
- Half of the animations are meh
- Several bugs
- Last 3-4 levels need a lot of polish
- There is some inconsistency in how the fights progress, some fights are too hard and some are too easy. This may be a testers error

I understand all the negative reviews about the performance because this game is heavy as fuck, probably will be patched in future, but as for today the framerate is incostant.
BUT I can't understand all the negative reviews about the gameplay, what did people expect to receive? A TLOU story with doom graphics and Serious Sam gameplay? 

I can agree that we could have waited a little bit more for resolving all of the cons, but I hope they will get fixed in future patches, for now, if you have a bad-medium pc I would skip the game as you wouldn't enjoy it that much.

I think the game isn't optimised enough, considering how many FPS you get with the overall look of the graphics (don't get me wrong, the graphics still look good) and FPS drops are a bit common especially when loading textures (maybe add pre-loading option?)

Also, sometimes it feels like Croteam tried to do too much with the game (sorry if that doesn't make sense) but I appreciate the effort.

Levels are mostly crafted with usual SS formula with corridors of death, arenas and other usual locations known to the SS fans, but again there is more added into it to make it fresh. Probably the most interesting twist is in France when player is basically in open world environment. Also the last level with legion system in use is so f*cking epic.

Interestingly the story is good and everything feels more in depth and more realistic. I really felt that there is this conflict between humanity and Mental, I even started to care about the Sam's friends



But there are some cons but I would say they are normal problems and I was expecting them:
- melee kills are kinda buggy and there is only 1 variant per monster
- walking animations in cutscenes are kinda wonky and funny (I know it is becasue the motion capture used for it)
- legion system is used only once but damn it is impressive

But so far I am really surprised and pleased with the latest Serious Sam

✔ Soundtrack is the best aspect of this game, I guess
✔ A great diversity of enemies. There are a lot of good designed, new enemies, as well as redesigned older ones.
✔ Beautiful environments. While I always loved Egypt theme in SS3, i must say meeting new places is very refreshing.
✔ Skill tree and gangets are great addition to the game.
✔ The World seems much more alive  this time. You meet different npcs in your adventure, thet help you fight your foes, and they're not useless like in other games.

❌ While enviornments, weapons and enemies look so good, the human models and animations could be better.
❌ Lack of melee finishers, There is only 1 finisher for many fodder enemies.

My main gripe is the level design. The first half of the game features ruins, ruins, and then more ruins. Tons of empty, lazily-textured dead ends and dull, uninspiring locations look as if they were randomly generated by an algorithm. The second half of the game gets worse and features ABSOLUTELY HUGE, vast, empty landscapes. You are constantly being tasked to go on foot across KILOMETERS at a time. I even had a legitimate non-stop five-minute motorcycle ride towards my next objective - in a Serious Sam game! The maps are so insanely large they easily rival battle royale games in comparison, yet there are no items, enemies, or anything else anywhere off the main path. Don't even try to find all the secrets because you won't explore some of these maps in a full day! And none of them are memorable either. It's a total mess.

While dual-wielding is fun, the overall weapon balance is broken. Why use the double-barrelled shotgun when you can dual-wield the regular shotgun? There's a new rocket launcher that uses its own ammo but functions exactly the same as the regular one; it does have a lock-on feature but the normal launcher gets it as an upgrade later on as well - it doesn't make any sense. The death ray upgrade for lasergun is a joke - imagine a continuous-fire, splash-damage, infinite-range railgun - it just instakills everything from kamikazes to red biomechs! It doesn't just make the sniper rifle obsolete, it makes dual cannons look weak in comparison. Oh, and there are now headshots, too, so the dual-wielding starting pistols can stop any number of Werebulls on their tracks. During melee attacks, enemies often disappear mid-animaton; but why would you even use the melee prompts when you can just dual-wield the knife and spam it? There is no strategy to using weapons anymore. Just use whatever gun you feel like.

Poor gameplay on awful, empty, soulless levels is further riddled with all sorts of technical issues, graphical glitches, bad item placement, poor AI, slow loading times, cringy one-liners, and a hollow storyline. It all starts out badly and somehow ends up being worse and worse as you go, culminating in a single really big battle which unfortunately serves as a background prop on a loop and has nothing to do with you, as you're too busy fighting the final boss that spawned off-screen out of nowhere with no introduction. I don't think I have ever experienced so much disappointed with a videogame to this date.

Croteam has demonstrated a staggering, fundamental lack of understanding of what the series' fans want and expect. Serious Sam 3 was fun even with the questionable design decisions but this steaming pile of garbage diverged so far from the formula you can hardly even recognize a Serious Sam game in it anymore. Or even any game for that matter, as it is essentially a barely functional sandbox full of empty landscapes and corners.

51,76601098,english,"[h1]Sam is back, and it's better than ever.[/h1]

I'm gonna preface this review with a disclaimer, I'm not a hardcore Sam player. This is entirely from a position of someone who enjoys these series in a more casual manner.

Ah, Serious Sam 4, probably the 2nd most controversial Sam release ever (nothing will beat Sam 2). ""Game-breaking bugs!"", ""CT scamming us!"", ""Awful graphics!"", ""Broken cutscenes!"", ""The story is shit!"". Those are only some of the complaints that I hear daily about this game. Shame that almost all of those are just a plain case of misinformation.

But before I get to that, I'll try to quickly summarize how the game went for me. (Mild spoilers ahead)
If you want to skip directly to me addressing the misinformation, skip to ""The Sam Dilemma""

[h1]The Story[/h1]

I have to admit, when I've heard that Jonas is brought on board for Sam 4, I was really skeptical of the end result. Jonas is after-all one of the writers for [b]The Talos Principle[/b], my favorite CT game to date. How would Sam, a game known for its one-liners, and cliche stories fare under someone who's most known for writing deep and psychological experiences?

Very well, actually.

The story in 4 is one of the aspects that sold the game for me the moment I've started playing it. It showed me one thing; Sam really, [b]really[/b] needed a proper story-writer. For the first time in a long time, I didn't feel bored after an hour or two of gameplay. It took what BFE attempted to do, and did it 10x better. The characters actually had charisma and personalities to them. They were likable, a player could actually establish proper emotional connections with them. The story was cohesive and incredibly fun, littered with references to both high- and pop-culture. The dialogues finally didn't come off as fake and forced.

Netricsa also got an update, making it even more useful. Long gone were paragraphs upon paragraphs of text that TFE/TSE brought in as a supplement for the story. In their place we got collectibles in the forms of letters and audio-dialogues that were saved to your Netricsa, allowing you to read and listen to them at any point in time. And it works, and it works much, much, much better than a boring 3 paragraph text about a single level.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

It's fresh, it's simple, it's fun.

Once again, CT took a look at BFE, and went ""Where did we go wrong?"". Sam 4's gameplay is based on the rules set by BFE, leaving sprinting and reloading of weapons intact. This one choice boils down to personal preference, really. Personally, I prefer it to the classics.

And this is where I'd probably stop if I were one of the reviewer folk. Instead taking it to the forums to bash the game for being ""lichlly BFE"". But-

Sam 4 introduced a lot of new core mechanics, most notably [b]gadgets[/b] and [b]skills[/b]. Just their addition added a whole new dimension to the gameplay. Gadgets are Sam 4's version of power-ups. You usually obtain them from secrets or side-quests. Unlike power-ups though, they don't take effect instantly. Instead, Sam stores them in his pocket, allowing the player to use them at any time. And they rock, seriously rock. We have black holes that suck enemies in, poisonous gases that make enemies fight with each other, [strike]g-fuel[/strike] rage serums that speed up the player, increasing their DPS, and many more.

Skills are probably the most controversial gameplay features added to Sam 4. People either love, or hate them. S.A.M.s (as they're called), allow you to modify the gameplay in many ways. They range from simple things like a quicker reload, to double-wielding weapons and even things like the ability to ride enemies. S.A.M.s are unlocked through a skill tree that branch out in two main ways: ""Weapons"" and ""Melee"". Scattered around the levels are chests with collectibles that add points to your skill tree, allowing you to invest points in either of those two branches. Weapons focuses more on stuff like dual-wielding or faster weapon speeds, meanwhile Melee allows you to unlock the ability to regain health via melee attacks and even take down larger enemies. And, gadgets aren't too gameplay intrusive, and even if you want, you can completely skip over them. 

There's also the [b]weapon attachments[/b], which add alternative firing modes. There isn't a lot of them though. [strike]The ones exist kick ass[/strike]

[h1]The Graphics[/h1]

Note: This section is entirely subjective.

The graphics in Sam 4 aren't bad. Surely, they aren't up to date with the AAA standards of 2020, but I didn't expect them from CT. We're talking about a studio which has 3x less employees than the folks who developed Fall Guys.
The weapon models look plain gorgeous, especially the new Laser Gun and the Assault Rifle. The levels look good, borrowing a lot of textures from their previous games like Talos or BFE. And that's not a bad thing, asset reusal is common across gamedev, since ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."".

From my own experience, I can say that lighting is one of the things Serious Engine was notably bad for. CT managed to overcome those problems, though. The levels are well lit, with some looking plain gorgeous for a SE game. The only part the game falls behind on are the interior areas, though.

[h1]The Sam Dilemma[/h1]

And here we are. Sam is sitting at around mixed reviews, with people complaining about shit that's not even present in the game.

Most of the negativity stems from a couple of youtubers. Instead of waiting for the proper release, they instead recorded on a buggy pre-release version. 
And yes, they were playing on [b]buggy[/b] pre-release branches. Something they addressed in a way no one really noticed. No one I've talked to experienced any of the issues they showed/talked about, me neither. The cutscenes work fine, graphical artifacts were patched pre-release.

Yet they constantly seem to complain about them, slandering CT for issues that don't appear in the release build. They go as far as calling people shills or mindless fans just for calling them out on their bullshit.
I'd assume they weren't acting out of malice, but complaining about a ""31GB Day 1 Patch"" (which is the game releasing publically), sounds a bit odd.

I know that the review category isn't really for complaints, but spreading misinformation and bringing people away from playing the game for themselves, while calling people names is petty. Very, very petty.

Another field the game gets a lot of flak for is the optimization and system requirements. And yes, they're pretty high compared to their previous releases, but given that their engine got heavily upgraded, I can't really argue with it. The performance is something that CT is continuously working on, with the latest patch (v1.01 at the time of writing) improving the game for many people.

Game instability happens frequently on release date, it's impossible to predict every scenario as a developer. Certain hardware configs can cause weird bugs with the engine, drivers can crash, resident software can collide. The most you can do is ask on the forums and help CT by sending in crash reports. They're working hard on fixing all of the bugs, trust me.

The graphics not looking like the latest AAA productions is pretty self explanatory. CT just doesn't have the budget of a AAA studio. Well, if they sacrificed the funding for other game elements and directed it towards graphics, I guess we'd have the next AAA game.
But then people would complain about other things :P.

And most importantly, if you want to truly read people's opinions on the game, skip the people who've posted a review with lessthan 2-3 hours of playtime. I've seen far too many people with less than an hour into the game complaining about the weapons, characters, story, gameplay, while not even having finished the first level.

First of all, it's great how fast Croteam acted with patching all issues which caused my game to crash or render it unplayable. Good i didn't refund it.

The actual gameplay is exactly what someone would expect from a Serious Sam game, hundreds of enemies running towards you trying to murder you as fast as possible, while you are throwing tons of ammo at them. Miniguns, Rocket launchers, Snipers, Shotguns and plenty more weapons. Also you can dual wield them. All of them. Even the knife.
The humor of the characters are on point and a lot of references.

66,76544734,english,"It's a pretty alright Serious Sam game for me, this is coming from someone who has played the Classic Serious Sam games, the HD remakes of them, the Next Encounter on PS2, Serious Sam 2, and Serious Sam 3: BFE.  Serious Sam is a childhood game of mine that I played a lot back in 2002 (even though wasn't smart enough to play fps at that time, so I watched my cousin play the classics), but it's what introduced me to first person shooters.  The Legion System works, but it's not a thousand enemies at once, more of maybe 100 - 300 enemies on screen (not counting the intro mission).  This game is like a mixture of The Next Encounter and The Second Encounter with the large maps.  The game has different firing modes for upgraded weapons, which kind of reminds me of the different ammo types The Next Encounter had.  This game now comes with skill points giving you abilities to dual wield weapons or being able to ride werebulls or khnums.  I really like the dual wielding aspect of the game, it feels good to shoot strong enemies in the face with dual double-barrel shotguns.

I am running this game with an intel i7 - 6700, 16gb ddr4 RAM, and a GTX 1070 on an HDD.  I manage to get consistent 60fps in most areas, but it drops to 57fps during battle.  It's a minor drop so it's not a problem (Sorry I forgot to mention, all my performance settings are set to high, but with customized settings in each to suit my liking).  The game does need A LOT of work on the optimizations, explosions make my game lag, there are some areas in the game that I lag in even though it doesn't look like an area that would normally lag, and the sniper scope zoom causes my game to drop to 28fps and after awhile it goes back up to 60fps.  Surprisingly having a lot of enemies on screen at once doesn't cause heavy lag for me at all.  I don't have problems with the long load times, but it could be shorter.

The gameplay is what would you expect from a Serious Sam game, violence, dodging, shooting, weapon combo kills, and the ridiculous amount of enemies.  I don't really care that much for the story since the Serious Sam series had very little story to begin with.  I would say this game is a lot better to me than Serious Sam 3: BFE.  The graphics look okay, but it needs some work, but for Serious Sam the graphics don't really matter as much to me since I mostly enjoy the combat.

So far what I think needs fixing for this game is he bad optimization that I encounter in some situations.  I am only mid-way into the game and I will update my review later if I encounter anything that bothers me.

Do I recommend it?  Yes. It's a fairly alright first person shooter game, but it does need some performance fixing so hold off on buying it until they update the game with better optimization.

68,76597203,english,"This review was written 8 hours in, and i'm still in the first part of the game.

Serious Sam 4 might have some jank and some serious optimization problems, but despite that, it's probably the best Serious Sam game to date where it matters.

And what matters in a Sam game? Hordes, guns, explosions. 
All the weapons are animated exceptionally well and feel incredibly good to shoot, this time there are some interesting sidegrades that shake things up for the bigger guns, and a completely optional but very useful skill tree that lets you dual wield basically everything when fully upgraded, despite the lack of powerups and the Serious Bombs, there's a bunch of gadgets that give you all kinds of buffs and special attacks, such as the Black Hole that vacuums all the enemies in its radius, the Rage Serum, which is a mix of a Haste, Berserk and Quad Damage powerups all together combined, Holo Sam straight out of Duke Nukem 3d and more!

This time, the game seems balanced more around the sheer amount of enemies and less about how tanky they are, with the exception of Khnums, enemies like Scrapjack can go down with two Double Barrel shots, compared to taking an eternity to kill in Serious Sam 3, and this applies for most of the returning cast and also new ones. With the exception of a Laser Sniper enemy and Arachnoids, there are no hitscanners in Sam 4, and the game doesn't overuse said few bullet shooting monsters.
The notoriously annoying Witch Bride from Sam 3 is back but has been reworked into a Poltergeist-kinda enemy that throws barrels and debris at you, instead of taking away your mobility, and it's now a perfectly fine addition to the cast.

The combat is so buttery smooth that feels like peak Serious Sam, and fighting tons of giant hordes of aliens doesn't get tiresome at all in this title for me, in comparison to the previous Sam games, because the gunplay is incredibly satisfying and the enemy balance is perfect this time.

As said at the start of my review, there's some jank, mostly some visual effects such as water and low res cubemaps, cutscenes not being the best thing ever, and some parts of the maps not being as pretty as others, but these are all minor problems that can be overlooked, cause the ""meat"" of the game, the core gameplay, is all there and it's what you'd expect from a new Serious Sam title.

Performance is seriously the only big complaint I have so far. My rig runs a Ryzen 3700x, RX 580, 16 gigs of 3600mhz ram, and the last Rog Strix model, the game is completely unplayable at ultra settings for me and otherwise runs decently at around 55-140 fps with CPU set to high, GPU speed to low and GPU memory to high. The game actually recommended me CPU to ultra, but that makes stuff like Discord voice calls stutter which makes me think there's something funky going on with how the CPU cores are used.
Particles are another big offender that can possibly cause fps drops and stutters, and there's lots of those between gibs, fire effects, weapon bullets etc. This has to be fixed, it's a serious problem that downright brings down the game and judging by the lukewarm reception it's already doing its damage, which is a shame because I'm loving this, looking aside the technical issues.

In it's current state I still recommend the game if you got a beefy rig, cause it's my new favorite Serious Sam title and there's a lot to love here, but if you're not sure about the performance, wait till the game's patched, Croteam's actively trying to fix most of the issues starting with the performance, and they're doing their best at the moment.",1601127400,1601127400,True,3,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False,76561198019137875,475,7,1158,1158,516,1602010615,,

77,76593985,english,"As of writing this review, I am only six chapters in to the game, but I felt like dropping my 2 cents on the game already. Maybe I'll update the review later.

Croteam has returned to Sam after 9 years in the limbo with The Talos Principle and various odd jobs helping out smaller studios with games like SCUM. Was it worth the wait? I'd say so, but I'll elaborate.

The most important part of any Sam is pretty obviously the gameplay. It's build on the ideas brought to Sam 3 (and by extension some from the Fusion port), so a lot of the same elements are still present. Sprinting is back, and still works as a super-backpedal in most cases. Aiming down the sights is back, but it's so completely useless that I'm not even sure if it works on all guns. The pistol and the assault rifle both have it, but why would you ever use it since the crosshair on the screen is more accurate...? The sniper also has it as a form of secondary fire obviously. Reloading is back, but only for certain weapons, like the sniper, the assault rifle and the pistol. It's still very much entirely pointless and usually just gets in the way.

As new additions, the game has added several upgrades in the form of secondary fire modes, presumably inspired by Doom 2016. The shotgun has a grenade launcher, the rocket launcher has a barrage mode and presumably other additions are to come later in the game. I don't mind these at all, I think they make for great additions to the guns much like they did in Doom. The fact that there's only one per weapon also makes them more manageable. Most of them make crowd control a lot easier, since you don't necessarily have to fumble through weapon slots to deal some damage to another enemy posing a threat as you're dealing with something else.

Sam can now also collect skill points and use them in a skill tree, as per the mandatory ""every game must be an RPG"" agreement. These are fairly forgettable, and skill points so far appear to be quite rare. Some of the upgrades are kinda neat, like dual wielding any weapon, but they are also fairly forgettable and don't mean much for the game. You won't miss anything by not getting upgrades.

Another addition are disposable gadgets, a la Duke Nukem 3D. Stuff like portable medkits, holoclones, timestop bombs and other weird stuff. I have not found as much use for these as it's pretty tough to get the right item to hand during a fight. You pull up the items and have to cycle through them with Z, which proves to be just a little bit too much of brain power that's not allocated to keeping track of the several hundred enemies.

Speaking of the enemies, this is probably the most diverse roster of bad guys in Serious Sam so far. Most of the old enemies are here, including the ones from classic Sams as well as 3. The amount of hitscen bullshit has greatly been reduced from SS3, most of the enemies are very fast and either prefer melee attacks or fire slow projectiles.

The new enemies are a bit of a hit-and-miss. The converted humans are pretty fun to fight, they're incredibly fast but still easy to dodge usually, so the gameplay mainly consists of either managing them into herds and disposing of them with explosives, or thinning the crowds out with a shotgun. The bloater knockoffs are kind of annoying, but are also easy to use for your own advantage by using them as a form of mobile bomb. The new vampire enemies are interesting, but a huge pain to fight in large numbers, kind of like the space monkeys in SS3. Pyromaniacs are basically impossible to keep track of usually.

Several of the older enemies have also received speed boosts. Gnaars now move incredibly fasts, as well as non-kamikaze beheaded soldiers, so it's not uncommon for you to be leading on huge groups of enemies right on your tail while slowly thinning out the horde. It's quite exhilarating in fact.

The levels are characteristically ginormous, but a little bit more focused than before. The UI has received an objective marker showing where you should head to, which is sometimes a godsend in the levels. Levels now also have similarly linear side objectives, which can range from collecting something alongside advancing to your main objective, or traveling through an entirely optional corridor and fighting hordes of entirely optional enemies. These side objectives reward the player with additional ammo, skill points, weapon upgrades or gadgets. There's also zero desert levels.

The levels are strung together by a paper-thin plot that encompasses the lives of several of Sam's weird military friends that end up dying in SS3. The cutscenes are mostly just dialog on an ambient track and they fade in and out after random gameplay events like they were ported directly over from GTA 3 on PS2. The writing is also absolutely awful. The characters are one-dimensional walking cliches that mainly act as one-liner dispensers. Characters such as the stoic black guy or the angry mexican guy or The Action Girl are all present, just like any bad action comedy title. These character tropes are something that got old about 10 years ago during the PS3 era and they are just as bad here. Occasionally they attempt to have the characters act out some heartfelt moments and it's just absolutely laughable, since the characters all have the emotional range of a wet blanket. I wish the game would've just let me act out the game alone with Sam's cheesy one-liners being peppered about occasionally like in the previous games. But as the story is more or less completely meaningless, it's not that difficult to totally ignore either.

In closing, I'd still say that it's a fun game (so far). It's made several improvements over SS3, addressing many of the gripes I had with that game. It's not the same as the classic Sams, but I personally wasn't expecting it to be that either. It's a fairly different beast, and fun it its own right. I think I'm going to enjoy it. In the end, it's up to you to decide whether or not it's worth your own time and money.

Additionally, there have been complaints about performance and technical issues. I myself am running the game on an ancient GTX 970, and it's running at a fairly steady 60fps on low-medium settings in 1080p. It's a fairly good-looking game, but it's still a bit underwhelming in its performance, the screen is very jaggy ad there's still occasions where the framerate absolutely dies due to particles.

There have also been a fair amount of reports with more serious technical issues. I haven't encountered any, but as with any new PC release it's usually a good idea to wait a few weeks so the most egregious of crashes have been ironed out. Croteam already managed to release a hotfix last night to patch out a few crashes and bugs, so I think by Christmas 2020 the game will already be running fairly steadily.

The game became much more diverse and balanced than part 3, the graphics seem to be the same and even a lot of assets reused that's why it doesn't feel like the next step at all, just an improved version.
The plot sucks (I played for 3 missions and still not sure what is the depicted time period) and the characters are lamer than in Borderlands (obviously borrowed the narrative style) but the one-liners from Sam are good.

I hate doing it, but I've gotta speak out against my fellow Aussie. GGGmanlives was dead wrong about this. As his video will likely be the main review people watch, I thought it was a little daft of him to review on a pre-release build when he likely knew that Croteam would patch the shit out of this in the coming days. 

I'm currently running this on a 980ti, with very little problems. Occasional texture pop in but that's it. Don't get me wrong, everyone's machine will cope differently but again, Croteam's going to patch the shit out of it. 

As for the rest of the ridiculous criticisms around this game ranging from story to tone, Serious Sam has always been a B-grade Endurance shooter. It's not of Doom tier, never has been. It's a Hold W/S and fire game. That's it. 1 and 2 are awesome games but they get tired and repetitive quickly. Adding in a cheesy story, dumb one liners, stupid characters are all part of the jank. If you can appreciate it, great. It's utter cheese. But if you can't, that's what the skip cut scene button is for. 

The shooting is awesome. The guns feel heavy, their responsive, and they send the monsters into mush. It succeeds as a shooter. Period. 

The main criticism that I think is very valid is simply around the level design. This is an endurance shooter, meaning the monsters need to keep coming, the ammo needs to keep stocked and you don't let your finger off the mouse until the end of the level. They haven't quite done that. There's wide open empty areas that are not used properly, and need some baddies and ammo filled in to ultimately make this flow and be what it can be. 

COVID has affected everything, even gaming. Don't be so f'ing reactive.

Before I start, if you think graphics are too washed up and not colorfull enough try to change color paltet from options to vivid.

People seem to constantly complain about how crap it is from a technical standpoint, unoptimized, cringe cinematics and voice acting. SS games were never about some super ""serious"" (no pun intended) powerfull muscular bald dude story like MustardChef. It was always about being over the top, stupid, complete chaos with 90's one liner dad jokes. (EVEN IN THE SHORT DESCRIPTION IT SAYS IT FFS)

Have you guys ever watch the developer diaries videos of CroTeam? They are 40 guys, made all cinematics by creating [b] their own [/b] motion capture tech, writing their [b] their own [/b] custom facial recognition app for iOs, on a fucking iPhone, to get facial animations easily. They used Vive to capture motion tracking instead of getting thousand of thousand dollar worth of equipment. 

This is an [i] Independent Studio [/i] with 40 people who don't have the budget that AAA studio has, whom can't even straighten up their di**ks with millions of dollars of budget yet still fail colossally AND don't get this much backlash as SS4 get. This is hypocrisy at it's best.

Saying that animations and cutscenes are bad is comletely, for me atleast, beeing disrespectfull to Croteam without knowing what its background is. For f*s sake, TFE, TSE, never had proper cutscenes with people in it besides Sam. In SS3:BFE there are what? like 3 or 4 cutscenes in the entire game.

Technical wise, my system is, 

[list]
    [*]Asus Z270-E Stryx Motherboard
    [*]Intel i7 6700k overcloaked to 4.4GHz (With Corsair H100i v2 to cool it)
    [*]MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X 8G
    [*]Corsair Vengence RGB Pro 4*8 GB Ram 3600 MHZ
    [*]Samsung SSD 860 QVO 1 Tb (Win 10 Pro)
    [*]Seagate Baracuda 2 TB (where game is loaded )
[/list]

And I never had any issues whatsoever with my settings beeing on 1440p with G-sync enabled on 165 Hz Using `recomended` DirectX12 on Ultra, with customised only to reduce anti aliasing to 2x and ambiant occuluton to medium, im having around 75 fps on 5 min benchmark. Game never crashed, never had any lighting problems, no pop in, no random off map deaths nothing...

Graphics, well kind of disapointed me too but it's not what they didn't show. It was almost like the first trailer. What botherd me at first glance is it uses most assets from The Talos Principle spesificly wall and ground textures. (Well on the other hand Valve did the same thing with HL and their spinoffs but nobody gived a f* because Hail GabeN) My only tolerance for this is maybe, just maybe SS and talos MAY have a connection, but I belive it is too far fetched.

Do you wanna complain about something then why don't you go and complain about:

How about these things?

How long GTA 5 Loads in over 1 minute,
or Skyrim who sometimes doesn't even load at all, 
or elevator simulator Mass Effect Games?
or Any Batman game where loading times are so long you forgot who Bruce Wayne was?

Do you wanna see texture pop-in? Go play Doom 2016 when it was released,
or Red Dead Redemtion 2 where half of your camps npcs randomly just vanished and never come back? even worse, Arthurs entire face and hands become irreversably invisible until R* released a patch 3 months later.

Do you wana see true CPU kebab? Why dont you look at Paradox's Stellaris? 
Why no one gives a duck about R6 Siege, Shadow of The Tomb Raider, Far Cry 5, RDR2, beeing single core and melting your cooler and comes here to `tell` that their cpu spikes where a game actively shows thousends of thousends of enemy same time? What the hell did you expect? Your CPU to idle?

It is realy sad that this community constantly whines about everything. To me most of these `negative` reviews are mostly just for users desparately to promote themselvs, trying to be controversial to be cool. They are not positively constructive things that developers may actualy care about.

Lastly, and this is completely irrelavent to game itself but;

In my over 25 years of gaming, I had very, very rarely encounterd games that are so underdeveloped they are unplayable. SS4 is not one of them. I played many many so called `broken` games at launch, and NEVER got any crashes, from my experiences most of the time these issiues occur on treating your pc as garbage, not doing any maintenance, not updateing drivers, not installing motherboard and cpu drivers that WON'T come with Windows (you have to download them from MB's Support page) and lastly worng hardware configration with uncompatible parts, (%99 of the time this is the issue, people won't check what RAM is your motherboard actually compatible with and when their computer or game crashes they blame directly developers and not their ignorence to check their hardware unity... Just becose you can shove a random DDR4 ram to your motherboard and boot your computer does not mean that your motherboard actually designed for it -.- )

TLDR: 

Game is good. Gameplay is even more polished and better from SS3. 
Classic Serious Sam experience and thats why I bought it.
Damjan Mravunac is beeing Damjan Mravunac with his exceptional music.
People are spoiled and expect AAA quality from a indie studio. (to me, which means they are so good at their job, they made people think this is a AAA game)

Remember the sheer clarity of TFE and TSE? Huge open spaces with clearly visible enemies in giant arenas. Yet despite being intentionally barren, the levels looked beautiful. That's the formula that makes this series work. Here the little I've seen is horrible city streets I can barely see the enemies on, and open arenas filled at random with pointless obstacles that suck the fun from everything. 

I've only played a bit but I've also watched several video reviews (the G-man lives one covers most bases nicely and fairly). 

Turns out the Legion system (thousands or even hundreds of thousands of enemies) is a gimmick found only in the opening and dying minutes of the game. In fact, I don't know if it can play out differently, but the opening battle for me lasted what felt like roughly 30 seconds.... Thousands of characters to be sure, none of them dynamic and all of them you can just clip through. It really does feel like a cheap trick. 

I love Croteam but this was a waste of the small teams talent. 

The jank is through the roof even by Sam standards. I have refunded and will repurchase one day to support them when it's a few dollars. 

However, no amount of patching out the jank will change the fact that this game is fundamentally not a good Sam game, and is therefore sadly unlikely to ever be much better than it is now. 

Let's home Croteam's main energy and resources are going into the Talos Principle sequel; that is one of my favourite games of all time, and the writing was stellar - compared to the writing here which cannot even be enjoyed as a bad joke.

yes its rough around the edges, yes it has performance issues, yes i wish we got back to the more creative zany levels of second encounter and SS2 already.

but holy hell is this one fun. the guns feel great, more meaty than ever before, the upgrades you can get for them are usefull and fun, the arsenal itself is also great fun with classics and a very enjoyable newcomer, the gear items you can find are powerfull and really make doing optional objectives and secret hunting worthwhile. the dual wielding.. oh the dual wielding... this makes the game, get these upgrades as soon as you can. when fully upgraded you can dual wield any two weapons in the game. double barrel in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other? sure why the hell not, two chainguns? you got it. but its not so opressivly good that you would never not dual wield due to dual wielding making you unable to use alt-fires and certain weapons losing accuracy.

the caracters and story are just that right kind of cheesy you expect from these games, that really dumb B movie slock that we all know and love. as dumb as it is fun and i genuinly enjoyed the chemistry between caracters even if it was dumb.

the game also suprisingly knows to mix things up every now and again, going from dense ruins to giant sunny hillsides to short but sweet vehicle sections. 

the secrets are back in full force ofcource, some simple and handy, others helarious and potentially dangerous

the music is ACE aswell, composer did a great job.

if we now somehow get a game with this game's gameplay, second encounters level design, and SS2's massive varied campain we got ourselves a real winner.

again though keep in mind that the game does have performance issues (atleast at launch) and lower end PC's will probably struggle.

Enemies look much better, a lot more detailed characters.
Explosion animations look great.
Surround sound is very immersive.

Cons:
Game has a few minor bugs; characters get stuck, some clipping, but it’s no game breaker.
Story line feels forced, but you still get to kill everything!
Long load times between chapters.
Difficulty levels needs to be refined, you can still die even in tourist mode, sometimes serious level is easier than normal.

Overall:
I love the balance between new elements while still staying true to the previous versions.

Get the family pack and enjoy with friends.

Mega fun with Serious pun xD

Definitely a keeper!

If you aren't expecting Serious Sam: The Third Encounter, this game is amazing... When it's good. There is plenty of fun to be had throughout, but It takes a while to be consistently good. From the start of the game to about halfway through you will go back and forth between really good encounters, to weird slogs where not a whole lot is happening and the levels aren't doing it any favors, to kind of annoying encounters where it feels like it's overly punishing. Highly recommended unless you have a strong hatred for anything that isn't classic sam type stuff, because while there's definitely a good chunk of it in here there's still a lot of SS3 DNA. Be it refined and improved SS3.

No matter whether you even care about the game or not, listen to that OST. It's amazing.

Now for the nitty gritty on what I feel the shortcoming are:

This game changes a lot from previous sam game. You can pretty much play every sam game more or less the same because the weapons, the enemies, the kinds of situations are all familar and consistent. 2 double barrel shots to down a werebull, 5 rockets for a red mechanoid and ideally do it as soon as possible, 2 rockets or 1 sniper for an arachnoid. Simple and pretty much always works. 

Serious sam 4? Nah, we don't follow those rules anymore. Gnar are actually insanley fast and an immediate dangerous threat. Headshots exist on some enemies, none were made tankier as a result of this thankfully. You can dual wield. Weapons in general fire a bit faster. The normal shotgun has inifinite 0 fall off range with a pure horizonal spread. The number of changes they  made, while seemingly minor, are huge for a game like serious sam.

Weapon and enemy tweaks weren't everything though. The new enemies provide a variety of different situations where different weapons shine in light of these changes as well as the fact they made enemies way more aggressive and in much higher numbers.

An example of how this changes the flow of the game in my experience:

The normal shotgun is now the most versatile weapon in the game. Most small troops die to 2 of the 10 pellets so with the infinite range where 1 pellet goes down straight, it's basically a more reliable pistol that can also handle crowds too. I straight up snipe the sniper class enemy with these things, it's hilarious. As a result, I don't use the double barrel at all really. This game has no room for a slow single target weapon anymore, even with the speed boost and dual wielding, you can get just as much done with the normal shotgun or it's underslung nade launcher you get early on. I find the best weapon against werebulls now is the auto shotgun since it can be dual wield to fire both at once and 1 shot headshot them, because they give you less time to prepare for them and they come in MUCH higher quantities to manage the mega fire rate on them lets you not fall to pieces. Then you have the gadgets which can complete turn the tide of battle if you use it but they are only found in secrets to heavily incentive searching.

I mentioned the DBS doesn't really see use from me anymore. Well it's not the only weapon. The rocket launcher has a 3 mission window where it sees use, then goes to the dumpster because it not only feels off but is outclassed in every regard.

Grenade launcher invalidates pretty much any other explosive but the shotguns. The sniper's ability to headshot much easier invalidates its use for single target for most things. The dual normal shotgun does almost as much damage at mid range and just uses shells! Then the decimator comes in and takes the sniper hostage too. More damage than either, good fire rate, high projectile speed, pierces but doesn't explode, ammo is pretty common. When dual wielding it those things can even out do the cannon for taking out single enemies. The only use I had for the RL until the final stage was killing harpies due the homing and the tommy gun having spread making it a gun with no strong role anymore. That's only because of it's alt fire, the only other time I used it was also just because the alt fire.

That was a bit of a ramble but that's one of the issues I have. Weapon identity has been blurred a bit in a series where each weapon generally had a very strong purpose. It's insane that a rocket launcher just be relegated to harpies of all things! But that's just me, I'm sure other people have their own tactics.

These issues are also due in part to there just being way more highly aggressive enemies. For a chunk of the game I kind of struggled to use multiple weapons like I used to and instead find a primary weapon that works well for the majority of the encounter than a backup for one other role. It was only the last couple stages where I REALLY started using a variety of guns.

To make the rest much more brief the final 2 issues I have are with the early-mid game encounters and lack of feed back, primarily audio based. Enemies swarm you from all around quite often and some of these enemies have very accurate tracking. Sometimes it feels like if you aren't moving almost purely horizontal to them, you'll get hit. This becomes annoying when you have to deal with them AND a big threat at the same time. I still don't know how to avoid the khnum's fireball attack and they give you PLENTY of practice. They track SO WELL.


I'll chock it down to the game being a fair bit different, but I felt like I could barely go many encounters without taking damage. Like how many homing enemies do we need? A guy hiding behind a shield that fires a volley of 20 homing bullets, a helicopter with homing missiles, reptiloids, sometimes the normal troopers, these flying brains.

The audio issue is such, enemies in previous games all had unique sounds that were loud and always audible from very very far away. In this game some enemies even share sounds, their audio can't be heard from anywhere near as far and the volume of the sound relative to their distance feels weird like something that hit you sounded further than it was. This is terrible because of kamikaze among other examples. I've had a kamikaze that was running into me sound as loud as one 30ft away. You used to be able to hear a reptiloid throw their homing ball from ANYWHERE. Now you only know when you see it/got hit.

Lastly on that point, enemies lacking good, distinct death sounds to help you confirm kills. Especially with the density of enemies and existence of headshots, confirming a kill is harder than ever because you may be unsure which enemy in the pile was the one that got headshot and died instantly or if they all did.

Yes, that's a lot to complain about and many are likely issues few people really care about. But at the end of the day everything I like just comes down to ""it's just some good serious sam"" so the issues that do crop up end up getting focused on more. The shooting is insanely satisfying, dual wielding feels great, and when the fights are good they REALLY nail it.",1600976015,1601105185,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198050659285,177,3,2062,2062,1279,1601597354,,

18,76517978,english,"Unedited original review below.
Following first update patch the stuttering and unusable Sniper Rifle issues appear largely resolved. Movement controls still don't feel great, certainly not good enough to be worth attempting some of the platforming for secrets - so far this ONLY matters for getting some secrets, NOT impacting normal play through. Mouse movement appears significantly better, no more motion sickness and is certainly now functional. As yet there have been no more instances of terrain warping or clipping.I stand by the comments on earlier level structure and objective guidance. Not strong points. Soon after the spoiler mentioned below the game does begin to feel more like a legitimate Serious Sam Encounter. I'll now recommend it, but only just. So far. I'm actually even more confident this will continue to improve.

Given the difference this patch made I can't help but think we'd all have been better off if the release had been delayed even just one more day.

--- Begin original unedited review ---

Currently can't recommend. DO believe this will be fixed, hopefully soon. Has plenty of potential.
Movement feels detached and imprecise, some secrets obviously require ""platforming"" on walls, rubble etc but currently movement feels like a stick of butter on a frying pan with a limited ability to jump. You can glide over cars etc but get stuck against walls the same height. 
Aiming also feels unconnected. Trying different combinations of mouse resolution, raw or smoothed/accelerated lets you choose between being able to aim or not getting motion sickness when navigating about. Other than finding Crysis 2 *in 3D* to be tiring after a long session I have NEVER experienced motion sickness from a video game until trying this with smoothing and acceleration enabled.
I've stopped playing for now at [spoiler] the volcano just erupting [/spoiler] which is (I assume) quite early in the game but up to this point at least the maps have been uninspired, repetitive and really just more of the weakest parts of SS3. That might be remedied later in the story, SS3 certainly started to feel more like a Serious Sam game later in the campaign.
Previous entries have had their moments where you have been forced to go into the options and figure out the key binding to use the Netrisca(sp?) thing, when you got stuck or lost on a map in your first playthrough - I've been enough of a fan to have spent the time reading all the info in this EVENTUALLY. The paths and objectives PLUS the optional objectives haven't seemed intuitive to me so far - I've already managed to miss optional objectives simply by not noticing them deviate from the main path until a gate has locked behind me. This probably wouldn't have happened if I spent more time reading - but this is Serious Sam yeah? So far at least it hasn't catered to the ""I have ten minutes and wouldn't mind spending 9 and a half minutes holding down the left mouse button"" which was such good value in previous encounters. 
There's also a bit too much ""jank"" to just be a laugh. Small edges of terrain geometry moving about and even melting up through things from time to time - that's OK. A bit weird but hasn't broken anything as yet. Noticeable choppy moments or stuttering either in cutscenes or every time the sniper rifle is zoomed in, that's less endearing. I haven't tried lower settings to see if this improves because I shouldn't need to, confirmed by the performance the rest of the time. Something isn't right. A title like this has NEVER encouraged spec flex even in 2001.
I'm sure some of this will be sorted, I'd definitely not say one should NOT buy this but at the moment I can't recommend spending the asking price unless you know what you're in for. If you're new to Serious Sam and expecting a proper AAA title you WILL LIKELY BE DISAPPOINTED. Far better value to be found in the 2017 Fusion Beta (I think, I own all the SS titles and don't actually recall how that is sold on Steam but either way it's a great way of playing the back catalogue). 
If you're an old school Sam fiend and have the spare cash - You've already boughted and supported, which is Seriously cool.

- Characters look rigid and stiff, animate poorly. I understand this is Croteam's own in house animation tool, but it just feels floaty and weightless, the facial animations are robotic and lack nuance.

31,76577746,english,"This game... is fun, as HELL. But it's not without its flaws.

The level design is something of a controversial topic at the moment, but I think it's fine. The reasoning being that, well, since the beginning, it was clear the levels were going to be flat, and it was clear that the flat levels were there for the bloody onslaught of enemies, which there are A LOT OF in this game. However, the scenery can get a bit tired, but I'm mostly fine with it when I get into areas of civilization, like towns, citadels and whatnot.

The story can sometimes come off as a bit intrusive, but it's easily avoided with skipped cutscenes. NPCs can be annoying to some but I was mostly fine with them, excluding Carter and occasionally Rodriguez.
The performance is still a bit shoddy, but I guarantee it'll get ironed out as time goes on. New terrain generation and other additions to the engine seem to be hindering specific levels in the game, with some of the levels running smooth as butter.

And finally to note, there is a pretty clear lack of polish in certain areas. There are areas in the beginning of the game where performance will dip dramatically, while other maps such as the volcano environment end up running perfectly. There are also times where little bits of the terrain are incorrectly positioned, or exposing areas that go out of bounds. Other graphical bugs exist but they're really just nitpicks, like dual pistols not shining any light (while single pistol does), T-Posing armours in France, and the occasional random visual bug with weapons like the multi-rocket attachment or enemies not ragdolling.

What I'm tryna get at, is that there are areas of the game which reaaaally need work... but why am I recommending it?
Because MAN, IS IT EVER FUN. It may not feel the exact same as classic Sam with all its innovations, sure, but the meaty weapon animations, great sound design, slapping music (at least most the time... I'm not the biggest fan in the world honestly, I still adore Damjan's Persia music the most), satisfying formulaic combat and MMMMMMMMM EVERYTHING JUST FEELS SO GOOOOD, and especially fresh after hearing so many reused sounds, and noticing visibly reused system assets like view-bobbing getting coated over and given a lovely coat of new paint, it all comes together as this bloody great product. Sam might be decking himself out in a newer, more modern look, but at its core, it's Sam cranked to 100x.

Thing is, the game relies quite a bit on the horde nature of the combat. Long stretches of vast flat environments and not so clever enemy placements, relying on quantity, are the focus. This sort of leaves Sam 4 in need of a specific kind of demographic to fully enjoy. If you like games like Dynasty Warriors with the shit tons of enemies, are a fan of Serious Sam's enemy count and combat formula and/or love some really friggin' good weapon combat, then dual-wield, mow down and fight back Mental's horde to victory in Sam 4! ... and maybe get a bit disappointed by the final boss, but Sam never really had good final bosses when it comes down to it. Won't spoil the final boss but I will say that the main game is far better, and also that the legion system only truly makes one appearance, so if you came for that, please note its absence before getting excited in France.

tl;dr - the game is really, really fun, and I especially recommend it for its much greater enemy count and amazing gunplay, but it lacks a polish which will likely be fixed as time goes on. Some level design may not appeal to most, but makes for the horde shooting's play field. Some areas are disappointing, and unfortunately can't be fixed, but the focus on everything else definitely makes up for those hiccups.

At least, this is all in my opinion.

Sam 4 brings a strongly considered blend of series essentials together in a package that satisfies in that special way only Sam games do. Excellent gunplay, challenging enemy design, heart pumping sounds, and devastating combinations of enemy skills that push your violent problem solving skills to their limits. It's Sam doing Sam how only Sam can. New systems like the skill tree and dual wielding are made unintrusive to the core experience, allowing you to change them at any time and never forcing you to sit and ponder some kind of build. You can even go entirely without them for a more classic Sam challenge.

Critics don't seem to ever understand what Sam is about. Cutting edge graphics, breathtaking animations, and groundbreaking technology? This is Serious Sam, not some AAA wannabe movie game!

39,76569667,english,"I mean I haven't played a ton yet but I've seen plenty and like, so far the game is fun iunno. I've already gotten that giddy feeling that I get from playing Serious Sam games. It looks like Serious Sam, it plays like Serious Sam, it sounds like Serious Sam, it feels like Serious Sam, it's Serious Sam. This game is so different from Serious Sam 3, actual comparisons are nearly non-existent aside from both games being Serious Sam at their core, and thus both playing like any game in the franchise (and for the record, I do also like Serious Sam 3, but so far I'm liking the direction this game is heading in more). The only technical issues I've encountered are mildly sub-par optimization, and a crash when tweaking graphical settings. Slightly annoying, but nothing close to major. Croteam is working on these things too. My rig is pretty decent, but certainly not a beast of a machine.

I don't get the complaints about the graphics, Croteam is an indie studio and they look solid even despite that. The artstyle is brighter and much more cartoony than Serious Sam 3 without going full Serious Sam 2, which is either the best thing or a bit of a disappointment depending on who you are, but it shouldn't impact your opinion on the game overall all that much anyways. I for one like the artstyle of this game and the HD remakes of the originals, they strike a brilliant middle ground. Cutscene animations are jank but again, indie. They're working with DIY motion capture. It's not good, but it's endearingly jank, and I've seen far, far worse. I love that there's a story and actual characters, they're not the most creative characters you'll ever see, but they don't need to be, and they're still a lot of fun. Sam himself is a joy to listen to as always. Exploration is abundant and fun but not mandatory as per usual, secrets are always a blast. Just choose a lower difficulty if you're not gonna bother finding the secrets, higher difficulties are meant to scale with finding them. Combat is just as Serious Sam as ever if not moreso than before. Dancing with massive waves of enemies is still as enjoyable as ever if that's the kind of gameplay you like. I'm liking the enemy variety and all the new types that I've seen, not to mention the nice changes to already established baddies.

It's hilarious to see people say that this game seems like DLC for Serious Sam 3 and not it's own thing, it was obvious even from the trailers how different this game is by comparison. It has so much that Serious Sam 3 never had, there's so many new enemies, there's new weapons and the weapon balance for all weapons is totally different, there's vehicles, gadgets, weapon mods, skill trees, everything has completely new models with no copy-paste from Serious Sam 3, it's as different of a game from previous entries as it possibly can be without losing it's identity as a Serious Sam game. Anyone who says this is anything like Serious Sam 3 saw the sprinting and reloading and immediately decided to ignore literally everything else.

You know what game was the exact same as a previous entry with only a few new things? The Second Encounter. I wanna make it very clear that I love The Second Encounter just as much as anybody else, but that game is everything Serious Sam 4 haters claim this game is. It's literally just The First Encounter with new environments, a couple new guns and a couple new enemies, everything else from enemy and weapon models to the gun and gameplay balance and enemy behaviors are identical, literally on the same version of the Serious Engine as The First Encounter. It was nothing more than a DLC for The First Encounter mechanically, literally meant to be the second half of the same game. And you know what? Every Serious Sam fan loves that game, it's one of the best in the franchise. So even if Serious Sam 4 was just a glorified DLC for Serious Sam 3, which it very much isn't, why would that matter? One of the most beloved games in the franchise for the majority of the fanbase is literally just that.

If you like the Serious Sam franchise then I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this game. Hell this game seems to add enough depth with the upgrades and such that people who don't like the other games in the series might find this one more interesting. I could always end up changing my mind later, but I really don't see that happening. Sam is Sam, they're all fun shooters for people who enjoy this kind of gameplay. Toxic vocal minority be toxic I guess. 

If you haven't played this game yet and are usually a fan of this franchise, I implore you to play the game yourself and not listen to some random steam reviews that gave up and/or refunded the game after barely playing it, or some youtubers with largely bad takes who played a bug-ridden review copy that Croteam for some reason decided to send out to them. I don't know why they did that, that was the one real major misstep they took here, but it doesn't represent the product as it is now, and Croteam is constantly working to polish and iron out any remaining bugs. 

Not every Serious Sam game is going to or should be exactly identical to The First Encounter. If you want more of that, go play some mods for it. This game is a great step forward for the franchise, and I look forward to it's future. Absolutely worth the pre-order imo.

QUICK BULLET-POINT SUMMARY (review below)

PROS:
-Constantly engaging gameplay and combat
-Tens of hours of content to explore and experience
-Largest amount of enemies yet seen in this franchise and possibly in an FPS as well.
-Amazing graphics depicting Roman society, French society and nature beautifully.
-New upgrades and ""gadgets"" (one-time use / temporary power-ups) allowing for strategy.
-Charming characters and personalities, feeling very human and quaint.
-New optional side-quests that unlock new gadgets and skills for Sam to use.
-Multiple vehicles you can ride: The ""Popemobile"" Building-Sized Mech, and Sam's Motorcycle, A COMBINE HARVESTER (yes it's exactly how you'd want to use it, banjos and all)
-A plethora of new enemies as well as old ones from Serious Sam 1, 3, and even S.S. VR: The Last Hope.
-Versatile graphics options for the perfect balance of performance/quality.

CONS:
-Standard Release Day bugs, should be patched out soon with time.
-Difficulty spikes and plummets in certain spots, decently few and far-between though.

-Skill tree may be subjectively underwhelming.
-Secrets are quite difficult to find in such large maps, but not impossible.

OVERALL SCORE: 9.2/10  [Fun, Engaging, Content-Packed, Charming, Thoughtful]


REVIEW:
I once was told of a saying: 📜""The imagination has the power to convince itself of ideas and concepts that eventually become expectations. Some of these expectations will be fulfilled, but most will not. The level of belief you give to these expectations is what sets apart the free from the enslaved.""📜

I've seen plenty of reviews bashing on this game for being, for lack of a better word, ""underwhelming."" ❗❗Serious Sam 4 is NOT a masterpiece.❗❗ Let's just clear that up right here and now. If you're expecting the best game in the world, then inevitably you're going to disappoint yourself. It's not perfect. It's just not. 

However, one thing I will say about this game and all of its pros and cons: the game is very ❤passionate❤ about itself. You can feel all of the work that was taken to make this game as fun as possible for the people who grew up with the Serious Sam games for all these years. The literal years and years they've poured into making every inch of this game feel intentional and satisfying.

It's not for those people who expect the game to be 100% novel in the way it plays, nor is it for the person who expects it to be better than any and all of the previous games. Basically, if you've played Serious Sam as a kid, yeah, all that's here. Some tweaks and minor differences, but essentially the same satisfying formula that made the Serious Sam franchise as popular as it is. ⭐⭐Expecting perfection and not getting it will INEVITABLY lead to disappointment and annoyance. ⭐⭐

The pros, at least in my view, UNDOUBTEDLY outweigh the cons. The gunplay is fun and satisfying, and you'll always be engaged with some brief moments of downtime to take in the scenery and have a chance to catch your breath. There are new upgrades that give Sam  new abilities (one of the most notable being able to ride a WEREBULL and KHURN into battle), and all the classic nostalgia of the weapons and lore is here also, wetting the whistle for anyone who wants that feeling of being a kid again in an adult's body. 😊😊

And don't misunderstand, there IS a lot new to this game, despite what some reviewers would want you to believe. There's a new Popemobile Mech the size of a four-story building, equipped with double machine guns and double rocket launchers, plus scatterbombs and dashing for good measure. A new motorcycle vehicle is also here, for those who like smaller yet quaint experiences versus the massive Mech. The story tries to make sense of the chaos that the previous games set forth, and it does so in a very creative yet faithful way, basically leaving the story as is and having it make sense as a result. But if you don't care about the ""lore"" or ""deeper narrative,"" don't worry, it's only for those looking to find it. 

Now there are cons (obviously) that this game can improve from. There are currently glitches and bugs as a result of ""release-day problem-solution debugging."" I personally found a glitch where the cutscenes don't have audio for some of them, but I'm certain it's a bug that was just from my play session, or that it's a bug they didn't see and will patch out. Beyond bugs, the maps can take a decent chunk of time to traverse, but there will always be new things to look at to keep one entertained. The progression of the S.A.M. skill tree is subjectively useful, so it's a wild card whether you'll like it. The difficulty can sometimes spike too quickly and flood you with enemies, or it can dip a bit and give you something you faced two levels ago. These are just a few of the things that the game can improve on.😕😕

But honestly, despite that, I just love this game. It's not perfect, and I wasn't expecting it to be going in. I'll be honest, I didn't really like Serious Sam 3, mostly because it felt like it was trying to be something that it was not. This game removes that and replaces it with what was there in the beginning: smart quips, one-liners, witty banter, action-packed gameplay, and a plethora of content to explore. And that's honestly all I wanted from this game. And it delivered. 😄😄

Maybe I'm just being too nice, but I didn't expect perfection going in. I expected it to be something kinda like what Serious Sam 3 was trying to do, but polish it and refine it, and that's what I feel I've been given. If you wanna go in expecting it to be absolutely mind-meltingly amazing, you'll be disappointed and start knitpicking everything you don't like about it. But I went in expecting something average and being given something above average, and I'm satisfied. And I'm sure if you gave the game an honest fighting chance, you'd see just how fun it is, too. 🥰🥰",1601024905,1601090447,True,1,0,0.508253097534179688,0,True,False,False,76561198225367192,257,9,2925,2925,1074,1602052642,,

Okay, so this game is being severely underrated. If you expected a small studio in Croatia to produce a perfect (and might I add, DRM free) FPS for $40 a copy, I don't know what to tell you. Of course it's got some issues, most of which are purely technical and will likely be worked on.

Yes, the graphics are nothing special. Because of course they aren't. This game has literally 100s, 1000s, and, towards the end, over 10,000 enemies on your screen, alive, all at once. Of course sacrifices had to made graphically for that to be playable. If you think graphical quality matters in a Serious Sam game, I don't know what to tell you.

Yes the load times are a little long, but nothing unbearable. It's about a minute between levels, but only a few seconds to reload a save when you die. Very tolerable. Not any worse than [i]Killing Floor 2[/i]'s long load times.

Yes, the framerate can be a bit dodgy. Rendering a ton of moving entities like that is difficult, even if they all have dumb AI. Sorry you don't get a consistent 90fps on your potato. It never delves into unplayable, the lowest mine goes is about 50 for a brief moment when my face is full of explosions.

A lot of people are comparing this to [i]DOOM Eternal[/i], I think that is a rather unfair comparison. id Software is a much larger studio than Croteam. The two are not in the same league, and never were. This isn't a bad thing, though. While [i]DOOM Eternal[/i] is definitely leaps ahead in its balance, gameplay, graphics, and well, everything, [i]Serious Sam 4[/i], prides itself on raw scale and insanity. The game aims to bigger, louder, crazier, and more downright ridiculous than anything else.

And boy does it succeed. what you will find is an absolutely insane FPS. Like previous Serious Sam titles, this one seeks to fill the area with massive hordes of simplistic enemies, ammo, and just let the player go wild. This is a game that literally does not care about being even remotely plausible, let alone believable. Sam ""Serious"" Stone can (with proper upgrades) duel wield literally every weapon he finds. Duel cannons? While sprinting? You bet. It's is a nice way to expand on the classic arsenal without breaking the Serious Sam formula.

And that formula is here as much as ever. Sure, you have a couple new tools and upgrades, but it never loses the feel of being Serious Sam. All your guns are there, you know exactly how many shots to kill an enemy, everything you know from TFE, TSE, and SS3, will all carry over just fine. Circle-strafing a horde of Kleer and blasting with the double barrel is just the same, except now you can have two at once to help tackle the mobs, which are larger than ever before.

On that note, I'll discuss briefly the ""legion system"" that was advertised. It definitely exists, although sadly is underused. I'm not sure if maybe they meant to include it more places and simply ran out of time, or if something within the system prohibits using it more frequently. When it is going though, it is incredibly impressive to see. The end fight in particular is arguably the most epic and impressive boss fight of all time.

The maps, are absolutely [b]massive[/b], by the way. And while the graphics might not be noteworthy, the design is beautiful indeed. And even in spite of the scope of the levels, it never feels like a bore to travel such great distances. The game is a little slow to get going, but the later battles make it worth the wait. It starts to really pick up momentum about halfway in.

I do have a few minor gripes, that are not technical in nature. Personally, I could do without the sprint key. It works I guess, but it feels out place, just like it did in [i]Serious Sam 3: BFE[/i]. I think the sprint speed should just be your default speed. Ironically I didn't mind it when I first played SS3, but the more I played it the less I liked the mechanic in a game like this, and I don't care for it in SS4 either.

Also a mechanics complaint, the 3rd person just kind of sucks in this one. Even with the FOV maxed out, the camera is still to low relative to Sam to be useful. That is a real pity, because I played every other Serious Sam game in mostly 3rd person. In previous titles, the 3rd person felt like watching Sam through a drone, it made dodging hundreds of things at once a little more manageable.

And, unrelated to gameplay, some of the dialogue is too cheesy, even for a Sam game. To call it ""B-movie"" is giving it too much credit. And to be fair it's not any cheesier than [b]anything[/b] that happened in [i]Serious Sam 2[/i]. I think SS3 got the balance of cheese just right, this one feels a little face-palmy at times. Generally though, it's enough to test your patience but usually it's tolerable. Except the radio guy, [b]he is cringe on ice[/b]. [spoiler] But then again, so are real radio hosts ;) so maybe that makes sense. [/spoiler] 

That said, I can put my gripes aside because this is a Serious Sam game. An epic and totally batshit shooter, complete with all its glory and all its flaws. This is a balls to the wall bullet-hosing therapy session. Pretty much exactly what I expected, and definitely worth the $40 launch price. It's better than SS3 overall. I mean hey, Sam  even has his red sneakers, knife, and finger-less gloves back, and his tommy gun if you own the skin.

In closing, while it's rough around the edges, it's still a blast of Sam's glorious and fun nonsense. Worth it.

Admittedly, they do borrow some tropes from the genre (""barfers"" anyone??) to keep it new, but like all good fictions the put a creative twist on it that makes it unique and enjoyable.

57,76509533,english,"Another great Serious Sam game. Does it have the graphics of a top AAA title, nope. Does it need them nope. Does it cost what they do nope. Is it super fun, yep!
If you liked the other Sam games this is more of it but better. The weapons and dual wielding is just plain fun.

Okay had to come back and add this as I had not read a single review so I need to add my experience. Game looks fine a little better than BFE but a lot more going on at once. SO LIKE EVERY OTHER SAM GAME. Keeps pushing the envelope of enemies on screen at once. I know some will hate the changes other will hate it didn't change enough.
I never stop being impressed by what this small studio brings to us at such a bargain price. If you hate the graphics now there is a good chance based on past experience it will get updated to a future engine like the others. They don't seem to ever abandon their games. 

Now as far as performance. It is playing just fine on a  GTX 1060 6gb for me with mostly medium settings and that is no worse than most other recent new games play on it. Plus it still looks better on medium setting than BFE did maxed.

Okay so I now have the game loaded on my best gaming rig in the family room on the 4k tv.
Now I really have to wonder if all the people complaining about bad graphics are just playing on low and have machines below specs because wow does this game scale. I though it looked good at 1080p medium. It is just incredible at 4k in DX12 and yes DLSS is working contrary to those saying it does not. I am rendering at 1440o DLSS in 4k ultra on CPU and GPU. The game looks wonderful. Also the claims of horrid load times are not true. I am on an older SSD not NVME but 3.5 SATA 3 and the game loads levels pretty much average to most other games. Certainly as fast as Control that I just finished playing and the levels in SS4 are larger with way more enemies.  I did try to render at true 4k but it was too slow for my 2070 super. A 2080ti or better may do it, not sure. Regardless 4k with DLSS looks great.",1600995035,1601087362,True,3,0,0.461087882518768311,0,True,False,False,76561198002077231,780,18,908,908,328,1601074706,,

73,76503256,english,"To be a blunt as possible, this game is a broken, unoptimized and unfinished mess that should have had more time in the oven.

I've been a Serious Sam fan ever since the original Xbox days and I've been very actively been keeping up with this game's development for the past 9 years since SS3 released in 2011. Needless to say, I've been very hyped for this game. 

Pros:
+ Good shooting mechanics and weapon animations (for the most part), when the mechanics work they work very well and feel like classic sam. I like the fact that the bullets aren't hitscan as well (for the most part) 
+ Good music, the music in SS games are almost always good and this game falls into that category as well. It's what you expect which is a good thing

Cons:
- Textures pop in like crazy, you can't walk 5 ft in this game without the world popping in and warping at it's own will in it's current state. It's incredibly disorienting and makes for a bad experience.

- Unimpressive graphics and animations, even when those textures do pop in it's nothing to be amazed at. Flat and lifeless textures over boring landscapes. The animations are absolutely jank for most enemies and especially on the facial side. When you shoot a single shot of the assault rifle the animation looks as if you're shooting multiple as an example. The eyes are the stuff of nightmares too. For a game in 2020 these kinds of things should not be happening even by the standards of this studio

- Unoptimized as all hell, the performance stats on this game are not good and I've seen this as a common problem among a lot of reviews so at least I'm not alone. I once had a cutscene that was running at 20 fps for half of it then jumped up to 60 for the last half. Constant dips are abundant in this game in and out of gameplay. Typically Croteam are very good at making sure their games can run on most hardware but this game is just not the case

I'm not going to go too far into other gameplay related parts of the game since I have only played for 2 hours, but in those 2 hours I have seen all I need to see to determine that this game was not ready for store shelves and it shows. I understand wanting to please the fans who have been waiting so long for this game to release after multiple delays but if you're going to release it at least give us a game that is worth the wait and truly playable from start to finish.",1600984862,1601079132,False,3,0,0.530516445636749268,0,True,False,False,76561197972562217,428,4,149,149,119,1601101518,,
74,76565578,english,"As a life-long Serious Sam fan, my only expectation for this this game was to be better than Serious Sam 3. That's all.

This blew me away!! It's a PERFECT hybrid of SS2 and SS3! I wasn't ever expecting stuff like skill upgrades, weapon attachments, dual wielding, WEREBULL RIDING, a full on actual story.. on top of an animated HUD, better weapon animations, weapon feedback is AMAZING and the best in the series. Screen shakes upon every shot (no recoil, purely visual), there's some weapon spread now, there's bullet tracers now.
Melee kills actually serve a purpose now too. The bigger the enemy you take down, the more health you're given back.
For the first time ever in the series.. there's headshots. I'm surprised how well they work too.

Croteam promised their levels would be gigantic this time around, and indeed, a couple of them have a ""open-world"" feel to them, you can literally go anywhere you want and the maps are GIGANTIC but the game area itself is rather small and contained. It's extremely immersive if you stay in the game area, and it's immersion breaking if you run in a straight line away from the area.

Only real downside, and my only disappointment was that I expected these levels to actually have a bit more going on with them, but they're pretty barebones except for the few scripted sequences where you're supposed to get to. Just my own nit-pick.

One thing that you should genuinely keep in mind is that, at the time of writing this review, the game isn't well optimized. I had to play the game on medium settings otherwise the game would start shitting itself. I assume that in the future this has been taken care of,

Game has not a great optimization now, but looking back on previous Croteam games I have no doubt it will be polished soon (first hotfix is already here 30 hrs after release). I personally haven't seen any bugs or errors. My laptop (i7-8550u, gtx 1050 max-q 4gb, 16gb ram) runs SS4 on middle-low settings in 1080p and game looks ok (except for some strange light behavior sometimes) at 60 fps during exploration and 40-50 during combat.
Gameplay is pure gold classic Sam with some new mechanics and balance updates (nice to see improved pump and double barrel shotguns). Weapons feel good and overall experience is very nice. It's still a fury dance between missiles and enemies (and their flying blood and corpses).
I couldn't even think that I will enjoy dialogues in SS but here I am. The game is full of one-liners, stupid b-movie jokes and stuff like that. And I love it! Remind me of some best Edgar Right works.

80,76555793,english,"The long awaited Serious Sam 4 is entirely fun and (mostly) quite funny, with the best and most satisfying gunplay in the series as well as the best monsters yet...

No Sam game will ever match TFE/TSE. But Croteam are an (and repeat after me) INDIE dev with a low budget. With past Sam installments, each new entry had quite a leap in graphical power and technology that mirrored the evolving tech of the times. In 2020, an indie game can NOT look AAA. Now, sure Croteam could have gone full stylized and given the graphics a timeless quality. I agree. But they wanted to do it this way. And the graphics, for me personally, barely matter if a game is fun. Now, allow me to address some of the lazy and uninformed claims people who haven't followed Sam 4's development and in many cases haven't even actually played the game have been making online.

-Firstly, there aren't ""lazy re-used Talos Principle assets"". Talos used SERIOUS SAM 4 assets! It's the other way around. Due to delays we only happened to see them first in Talos. I in no way fault an indie, 40 man Croatian dev team for finding ways to save money and cleverly re-purpose things. In the Zelda series, Majora's Mask re- used countless identical assets from Ocarina of Time and no one complained or cared. Also, play the original Donkey Kong Country again some time. Every other boss is a palette swap. Mortal Kombat is guilty as well. All still fun, celebrated games that get a pass on this.

-Secondly, the game is not a ""more realistic and serious direction betraying the series' funny roots"". Save for Serious Sam 2, the series has always had zany cartoonish aliens in very realistic environments. The tech back then just made them SEEM like more cartoony environments. This game is still highly comedic and not grimdark or gritty. 

-Thirdly, this game has added objectives and a skill tree to the mix, admittedly inspired by the recent success of Doom 2016 etc. I've seen this criticized. Doom 2016 literally and admittedly copped much of Serious Sam's approach to gameplay. Apparently, Doom can be inspired by Serious Sam but Serious Sam cannot be inspired by Doom. Modernize Sam too much and people want the old school style again. Go full old school and people complain (as reviews have about this very game) that it's outdated and stuck in the past. I've seen people say SS4 sucks because it's too much like SS3. Also seen others say it's too much like SS2. My conclusion is that every SS game is so different and everyone has their own favorite. But you can't have it all. Croteam tried with Sam 4, and mostly I'd say they were successful.

Objectively, this game is around a 7.5 in its current state due to lack of polish (which can EASILY improve over time with patches, not to mention the amazing SS mod scene). Subjectively, however, it's the perfect mix of TFE/TSE vibrant colored enemies/SS2 absurdity/SS3 graphics and realism and I'm having a blast so to this longtime Sam fan it's much more like a 9/10.

You be the judge. But whatever you do, do NOT take a FPS YouTube reviewer's snarky, fashionable, dismissal of a pre-launch early build they were given as gospel. Remember how everyone uses a different past SS entry as an example of how they think a Sam game SHOULD be. Croteam heard all of these complaints for nine years and, like it or not, this is the middle ground mix they came up with that they thought would please people.The fact of the matter is, however, given the reviews I've been seeing, that the Serious Sam series (as always) is still the low budget, weirdo, B-movie, campy, bloody, splatter-fest, self aware, postmodern, simultaneously behind the times and ahead of them, arcade-y, SHMUP bullet hell in FPS form, big, dumb, awesome series that is sadly doomed (pun intended) to continue being misunderstood as an underdog....

91,76550326,english,"So.. okay, let's be honest; I haven't finished game yet. while I'm writing this, my task is to find papamobile, so this review is not based on whole game..but I don't care. When I finally could install game (which was..problematic at the beginning.. remember that 72mb download? Yea, that's what I'm talking about) I was playing 5 hours straight, and I would play a little more, but I had to wake up early for my job. The gameplay was really addictive, the feeling of weapons is really cool. Fighting old and the new enemies is really fun, and demanding (I am playing on serious difficulty, which sometimes makes game frustrating, but satisfying). 

We have so many cool features, like progression system (we can find upgrade points and spend them on special skills like handling two heavy weapons at once, or riding the werebull), new cool items that helps in hardest fights (Wanna vacuum some biomechanoids into the void using portable black hole? Or lock'em in a time capsule? Or just nuke them? Here you go!), rides (okay, didn't tried yet, but harvesting enemies looks pretty awesome). The new levels looks sometimes like from previous decade, but I'm okay with that, it's just Serious Sam game, and it works for me. Unfortunately, my potato graphics card (GTX1050Ti) can't handle this game, so I can't say anything about graphics.. because my settings are very low. It's not  bother me, but to be honest, i can't see any excuse for that low performance, considering the graphics in this game.. It's good, but not good enough to slaughter my pc, come on...
The music. Oh man, this music. Damjan Mravunac did awesome work, and I can say he probably beaten Mick Gordon's Doom Eternal soundtrack. Those energic riffs, epic choirs, the drum set.. everything makes another battles more intense, especially when you figting another biomechanoids with two double-barell shotguns, jumping around to avoid their rockets and werebulls...it's just epic, nothing more to say.

Ok, so what do you guys hate in this game? Level design? It's not the best, but in oldest Sam's we got just another corridors and courtyards filled with another spawns of enemies. The story, charaters and dialogues? Come on, no one force you to watch cutscenes; It's really good that this time they put more effort in storyline, exept just another ""Here's your gun, go boom-boom"". It's doesn't make Sam 4 worse, interactions with other buddies in squad or random characters makes you a real part of resistance against Mental's horde... Unless the previous game, when this fight was jsut a background.. well, It IS STILL a background, but at least this background is alive. Sorta.. Dialogues may be cringy, but in Serious Sam's way. Admit it.

So..at this time I can give this game 8/10 (or even 8+ for an effort). The only thing that really hurts, it's the lack of multiplayer modes. Ok, I don't care about pvp modes (in Sam this doesn't any sense anyway), but where is survival mode? We got only cooperation. 
Let's see if my opinion will change during the time, and my appeal: give this game a chance! Don't hate it because you don't like the first two hours of campaign. I was feeling really strange during the first levels, but this game really growns in me.

The game is not done, not at all.
it took me 30 seconds into the game to find the first bug, and there is A LOT of bugs, Graphic glitches, Quest bugs.
The character's/NPC is so poor, the eyes and the hair is so bad i bet you can even find memes of the eyes online if you google it.
I found myself skipping most cut scenes because they are boring and cringe, and there is a a lot of them.

The devs should have waited 6 months or a year until release, more polished and proper game testing and this could have been the game of 2020 for me but, nope.

Enemies look great and gore is awesome, there's blood and guts flying everywhere. There are some fun new weapons and ability to dual wield guns which is great. Nothing beats ripping through horde of Werebulls with dual double barrel shotguns!
Active use gadgets are another great addition. They are very much like usable items from Duke Nukem 3D or Blood. Some of them allow you to slow time, enter fury mode, launch a nuke or create a black hole that obliterates everything around it. These are nice addition to Sam's arsenal and I found all of them useful.
Graphics are nice but not a big improvement over Serious Sam 3. Enemy models and weapons look great but NPCs and some environments look rather poor. Some areas feel unfinished which is especially noticeable once you start exploring for secrets. Many textures look blurry up close and there is quite a bit of texture and model pop in. I expected more from the visuals but they are not bad by any means. Just keep in mind this is not a AAA game.
Performance wise its a bit uneven. Sometimes it runs great despite all the action and monsters on screen, while on other times frame rate drops for no good reason. In general optimization is not great, but I admit my rig is not so great anymore.
There is much more story and cutscenes in Serious Sam 4. Cutscenes are not great due to low quality NPC models and stiff animations. Dialogue and voice acting are alright, I found them quite funny at times. Sam's voice actor is as great as ever and his one liners are spot on.
Overall Serious Sam 4 is a fun if janky old school FPS that needed a bit more time in the oven. For Serious Sam fans its a must have. For me its the best entry in the series since Serious Sam: Second Encounter. It fixed all the annoyances of Serious Sam 3. Combat is super fun and the encounters can be quite challenging. Gameplay requires you stay on your toes and keep moving, while juggling weapons and prioritizing targets.

5,76493961,english,"[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
It does not disapoint as a Serious Sam game and personally it's the best one so far (ignoring technical issues). For fans of the previous games I would describe it as a mixture of SS3 and the classics. It has enhanced SS3 mechanics with the playstyle of the classics. Graphically it isn't the best, but it looks good enough and it's fast paced action will distract you from that. 

[h1] Story [/h1]
This time Sam has a richer story and a one liner for each enemy and friend he encounters. It's odd seeing an actual story in a SS game, but it's always welcome and in this game you can choose to just ignore it. The easiest way to describe it is ""the story is grim, the characters are aware of what's happening, but they joke at every possible moment"" which is how a Serious Sam story should be.

[h1] Enemies [/h1]
The enemies have better attack styles, designs, placements, sounds, animations and are grouped in very well designed bunches. The new enemies to the series such as the belcher or vampire fit perfectly into the game. Another great new thing the enemies have is weak spots such as headshots. 

[h1] Weapons [/h1]
Weapons each have their own purpose just like in the classics and for better results you need to chose the right one for each scenario. The most noticeable differences between SS4 and SS3 are:

     - The pistol feels and sounds like a Desert Eagle
     - Both shotguns pack a punch
     - All weapon animations are amazing
     - Weapons have upgrades that are very useful, but not overpowered
     - Dual wielding is a great addition and is very balanced

Gameplay is bland. Enemies feel uninspired and offer nothing new besides annoyances. Sometimes it feels good, but most of the time it's weak. I only played the first few chapters and the hyped up ""Legion"" encounters only existed *once* and for an extremely short period of time (Less than a minute). It has it's good points. Soundtrack is on point, and some of the guns feel good. But there's nothing new, if anything it plays it too safe and tries to rely on nostalgia more than anything, and even then it falls flat. Don't even get me started on the ""Story"" they got going. Serious Sam was never about the story until 3, and I would've thought that Croteam would learn from their mistakes with that game. Unfortunately they didn't. I'd forgive a lot of it if the game played well, but it even fails to do that. I didn't experience crashes or massive bugs but I did notice the game hitched a lot on lower settings, and had some massive FPS issues and loading times (even on an SSD).

This is an excellent game. I don't understand why it's getting so many negative reviews, other than that some popular YT game reviewers trashed it. It sounds like that trashing is down to two factors: Croteam might have sent out buggy review copies, and some of those reviewers are complainer dickheads who've made a career out of whining even when there's no reason to.

Probably the most important thing for an FPS to have is good gunplay. And SS4 absolutely nails the gunplay. I don't think there can be any doubt that the guns feel way better in SS4 than in any other SS game. Similarly, hitting the enemies feels better than it ever has before—the shots have a great sense of impact and gibbing enemies is fantastic. That's a big accomplishment because SS3 is already very solid in this respect and a huge step up from FE and SE (SS3 is not nearly as good as FE or SE all things considered, but the feel of the shooting in SS3 is far better than in the originals).

Just about everything bad from SS3 has been removed or fixed. I wish they had gone all the way in giving us a retro shooter and had just dropped the sprint function, but now you can switch weapons while sprinting—not being able to do that in SS3 was a real bitch at times. Hitscanners are gone, another source of aggravation from SS3 that we don’t have to deal with here. This means that combat can take place fast and free out in the open, unlike in SS3 when playing peek-shoot-hide with hitscanners ate up a lot of play time. Also, you get good guns nice and early in the mold of a true old-school FPS (again, this wasn't the case in SS3). Maps are big and often colorful (set the color preset to “vivid”) and there are tons of enemies to shoot, leading to lots of frenetic action. Some people seem to think that SS4 involves ""escort missions."" They don't seem to understand that the NPCs you're ""escorting"" don't need to be protected. You can completely ignore them and fight as you would in any SS game—they're basically there for background chatter.

Maybe the biggest complaint has been the performance/optimization. In my case, I haven't had any problems. My system is pretty good but definitely not the best—2070S, Ryzen 3800xt, 32gb ram. Running on dx11, 1080p, ultra, it's very smooth and I haven't noticed any framerate drops or bugs (except one menu crash that I'll mention in a bit). People also complain that it looks ugly. I just don't agree—it doesn't offer AAA visuals, but it is, contrary to what many people are saying, far better looking than SS3, and overall aesthetically pleasing. Also I have not experienced overly long load times (I use an SSD, but everyone I’ve seen complain about load times also claims to have an SSD, so I’m not sure what this is about—maybe a bunch of trolls or people who have an especially poor sense of the passage of time?). I did experience one crash while changing a graphics setting (ground quality) in the main menu, but that was before the first hotfix dropped.

Summing up: This game is awesome and great fun—definitely a proper SS game, much more so than SS3, and it certainly doesn't deserve the shit it's been getting at all. (I'm glad to see the Steam review average has shifted to ""Mostly Positive,"" though, after the avalanche of sniveling launch-day bitching reviews had it at ""Mixed."") If you have a decent system, buy it and enjoy it (but even lower-end systems seemingly are fine if the game is run on low settings from what I'm reading)—don't be put off a great game by the YT reviews of clueless whiners like b*tchymanletlives.",1601058408,1601067663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968176480,338,1,543,543,99,1601674893,,

19,76507990,english,"As someone who plays through First and second encounter and SS3 quite regularly....(2-3 times a year at least). This is a severe disappointment. There are many good mechanics, but they never get used. Maps are bland, enviroments are bland and the legion system is 99% nonexistent. They promised the slow pacing from the beginning of SS3 would be gone, I'm 7 hours in and it's slower than SS3 ever was pretty much the entire way, and the few action set pieces are over so quickly and just puts you back to trundle around and wait for the next group of enemies. SS3 was plagued with stop'n go action, go into room/area, shoot enemies, trundle through area to the next one, shoot those enemies, trundle to the next area, shoot those enemies. No real flow to the combat. And in Serious Sam 4 it's more of the same but with more empty  areas/rooms. Go into room, kill enemies, go through the next 3 rooms, kill a few enemies, go through the next 3 rooms, kill things, rinse repeat.
Dual wielding is useless with most of the weapons, devastator, autoshotgun and coach gun make good use of it but it completely ruins the accuracy of the weapons and is pointless with the rest of them. 
It feels like they tried to simplify and balance this game for console players with little FPS experience. We started the first playthrough on Serious difficulty and it's still so ridiculously easy it feels weird.
On a 3900X with 32gb DDR4 and a 1080ti the performance is pretty drab as well. Somewhere between 50 and 110 fps and all over the place, still some random big stutters even with a high framerate.

I think the motorcycle section sums this game up perfectly. Sooo much potential and there's just almost nothing there. A few pockets of enemies here and there, but the rest is just empty wasted space.

The biggest problem we faced besides the really chonky performance is that you spend the entire game waiting for the Legion system to actually show itself and be used, but it just doesn't happen. In most cases the enemy numbers are severely muted.

Knowing what this game could do and what it promised <<Battlefields teeming with thousands of enemies>> makes it difficult to enjoy for me. The potential of what it could be.",1600992407,1601066794,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561197969103960,476,6,617,617,457,1601123429,,

Serious Sam 4 is excellent. I could not find any major flaw to point out, rather some things that I would just add to the game, but they're minor things. The story is very intriguing, animations are well made, some character models look a bit strange but it's mostly hilarious rather than eye boggling or even annoying. The gameplay is outstanding. It's a really big adrenaline rush even in smaller battles, not to mention the bigger ones or boss fights. You get to improvise a lot by having a plenty of weapons and gadgets which all serve the same purpose - to kick ass. It's so much fun to play in co-op too.

Welcome additions and worth the wait. For me the best Sam yet. The gameplay is perfect Sam gameplay, maps are beautiful and full of exploration and the guns are satisfying to use. New enemies are a welcome addition to the series. Sound design is good and music is simply amazing and I wish it fit the environments more.

Some inferior design choices compared to the previous titles of this series. Optimization is pretty bad too. The story in itself is pretty questionable and it breaks the fantasy of Sam being this lone hero and a time traveller with the whole humanity's fate on his shoulders.

The AI will straight up stop and stand still. On the hardest difficulty. 

I refunded and will consider repurchasing if the state of the game improves but I was pretty turned off by the gameplay/gunplay/voice acting/dialogue between characters/etc... Tries way too hard to steal a bunch of ideas from other games. There's a lot of Borderlands-esque title cards -- one for every single character that gets introduced. It gets very old very quickly. The combat just narrows down to holding backwards and shooting or running as fast as you can to the next checkpoint to trigger a cutscene and skip it all. The guns themselves don't feel all that powerful when you shoot them and are pretty underwhelming to use. The animations are all very static and broken as well.

It's unclear if it's trying to make fun of itself or not. The enemies feel like they're straight ripped from other games. I see the Mancubus from DOOM and the Bloater from The Last of Us standing out more than the original characters as they are slowly drip fed to you one by one. The level design is frustratingly simple and flat. I didn't find it difficult to find a bunch of secrets barely hidden off the beaten path (ie: looking around a corner from the main path the game wants you to take and finding a small cache of items to be presented with SECRET FOUND is just completely unrewarding) I wasn't able to get to much of the ""open world"" the game touted itself upon before the 2 hour limit but I did feel like they were larger levels for the most part. Just very empty. Much like the game. Empty and broken.

The game is very unfinished and lacks the optimization or polish for the price it's asking. I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I'd rather go replay Serious Sam 3.",1601033867,1601058017,False,10,1,0.56956183910369873,0,True,False,False,76561197967771895,1002,10,120,120,120,1601028217,,

73,76549682,english,"Serious Sam 4 is rough around the edges, mostly technically. Since it's using a GI lighting system, enemies tend to blend in with the environment because they're all being lit from the same source and there's little colour differentiation. The lighting makes indoor areas an eyesore, and the environment has a lot of pop-in and occasional texturing flickering.

It's also easy to sequence break the game using platforming, which is a pro or a con depending on the type of gamer you are. I've never had the game break, or my progress halted by a bug yet.

BUT - the game is really fun. This is definitely the best gunplay and enemy feedback the series has ever had, the gadgets are an interesting addition although they can make some tough fights easy. The levels are huge and have lots of secrets, and the enemy models are really good (There has been some redesigns but the actual model quality and texturing is undeniably good!). There's a lot of enemies on screen, they've added more fodder enemies to keep fighting more intense than they usually are. Destroying massive waves of enemies is satisfying and looks good.

I won't comment on the story because it basically exists just to move us between locations and force jokes, it's whatever.

If I had to rate the game numerically, it's like a 7.5/10 in it's current state, with all the points being knocked for technical polish issues. It definitely does not feel like a release ready version of the game, but it doesn't feel like an Early Access game either. At it's price point I suppose that's acceptable. Every point that it retains is in fun factor and enjoyment.

76,76548693,english,"There are a lot of controversy about this game. Will try my best to explain it in an unbiased way!

Four hours through the game. Overall, the game delivers what is expected from SS series. Provides solid and rewarding shooting experience and a lot of enemies to shoot at. There is nothing wrong with weapons, movement and (mostly) enemies.
The level design is sometimes questionable - levels in SS expected to be linear (beside secrets), but now we got some side-quests. They are usually short and fun, but diverts player from a straight path. The art style is noisy: in some levels enemies blends with a background trees and rocks.
There are some upgrades meta-game with the Sam itself and weapons, but it is not overwhelming. Unlike doom eternal, the upgrade system is very simple and does not changes things by much. You can play totally fine without bothering with upgrades at all. Speaking of doom, SS4 does NOT forces you to cycle through shooting-melee-chainsaw-some_parcour_cr@p. You are free to deal with enemies using any available toys, yet of course some weapons suits the concrete combat situation better than others - just like in previous SS games.

Pros:
- Valid SS game, all expected features are here.
- It's new and has some story (jokes included)
- Does not breaks the underlying formula of a series: there is no sh*tload of upgrades and abilities, there is no enemies which can be killed with only one specific way. The core of the game still good.

Cons:
- Questions about performance, crashes and bugs. Yet I managed to adjust settings and run in on my machine with no issues.
- Levels at early stages of the game may feel too empty and boring. Visual style is sometimes noisy.
- Animations in a cutscenes are clunky. Just if someone cares :)
- In general, the game fells mostly the same as SS3: this is good and bad at the same time. Some players expect innovations and development, but the game still mostly the same as previous one.

TL;DR
Bugs will be eventually fixed, beside that it is a solid SS game. There is nothing wrong with it in it's core. But it is advised to keep expectations down and just have some raw shooting fun.

There are also cool gadgets like a mini black hole or a mini nuke.

Also there is a skill tree for some reason? Although I don't mind it because it gives you cool abilities like riding a werebull!

Bland, boring, underwhelming. Just a few of the words I could use to describe this game having been in love with the previous iterations of the Serious Sam franchise. 

Cutscenes are awful, why did they even bother? It feels like they're trying too hard to be like Borderlands that it just comes off so unfunny. The jokes throughout the game and cutscenes feel so forced that they fall flat and are just pure cringe. 

Level design is bland af. It really is just boring to walk around the levels because they all feel so lazily designed. I had to double take on the first mission because the assets almost look like they were ripped from Dying Light but worse.

The first major boss encounter is just.. meh. [spoiler]Giant worm that is meant to destroy and come out of buildings while you use the minigun for the first time.[/spoiler] I sat there with the most disappointed look of, is that it? Boring.

I guess since there's the whole EDF thing going on, and I guess a lot of the features from SS3 made a comeback, but I do generally think everything is handled a lot better than SS3. Except the performance, I guess. Even so, it is a very enjoyable game from what i've played so far, but I feel like people's first experience with this game and/or series has been tainted, overall.

Cons: it's only Serious Sam gameplay.

They could've done more... Serious Sam is light hearted enough where anything experimental would be accepted if the core gameplay was there. Devs really let down on the possibilities of making this a fun group game with high scores and good coop competitive options. The end round score board feel completely meaningless knowing how quickly the game, being this shallow, will quickly be an afterthought of gaming.

After an almost complete (crashed on the final boss) playthrough in co-op, here's a short list of issues I personally have encountered:
[list]
[*] some kind of memory leak in Vulkan mode, which made the game stutter progressively more and more until it finally crashes; this made it necessary to restart the game every couple of maps and is probably the reason for the aforementioned final boss crash;
[*] constantly flashing shadowmaps in DX11 mode;
[*] players getting the ""Version mismatch"" error randomly when joining my co-op game, despite having the same version, until the server is restarted;
[*] some objects desyncing (e.g. the last gate and the blue power shield thing on the map before the oil rig were open for some clients but not others);
[*] game kicking everyone out of the server and sometimes outright crashing when changing graphics settings;
[*] progress does not save in co-op if you exit and restart, which is how it was in Sam 3, but this time there are optional objectives which give you rewards that aren't in the ""default equipment"" list for the next map, so you lose those;
[*] enemies targeting players from across the map and charging head first into the nearest wall to try and get to them (this happens pretty rarely, considering the amount of enemies);
[*] the crash reporter crashing after you click 'Exit'.

I don't love the aim down sight mechanics for lowering recoil on weapons, I don't love the visibility of the map. I found enemies challenging to see among the abundance of textures and it looks like health bars are put in place to help you see them. 

The game has a lot of customization and I really appreciate the motion sickness settings as well. But I found the graphic settings being hidden in the performance tab to not be great - also there isn't indication on what a lot of settings do and which have major impacts to performance so it's a trial and error on what settings will give you a hefty frame rate boost.

The game offers D3D11/12 and Vulkan API for rendering yet the performance doesn't seem to move in either one. I was expecting better frames on a high tier rig. Can't comment on things like level design and music simply because I just was not having fun. I could boot up Serious Sam The First Encounter Classic right now and have a blast.

On thing I really do like about this game is the embarrassment of options for everything from difficulty to camera mode (you can set it to third person btw.) It even has special settings for motion sickness which doesn't affect me but really does affect some older gamers I know.

One of the options I really like is the fact that you can adjust difficulty mid-game. I really like this since it means that you can try it on as high a difficulty as you like without having to fear that this will get you stuck later on. 

The story is fine so far and actually starts out better than I expected. The jokes don't always land but they don't grate even when they fail. In fact, they jokes that fall flat are kind of charming in a dad-joke sort of way. 

The controls are fine and like everything else in this game, can be tuned to become exactly what you want.

I Will be updating this as more as i play[/b]

Id say that this game is pretty good, even for its bugs and Optimization catastrophe.

The gameplay is retro and fun with a bit of ball curving here and there, which makes it challenging and engaging
the new escort system is actually not bad, since you don't need to baby sit them and they help you during battle which is a huge step up.

The huge EDF battles may have been a scam but you forget they have to pack Thousands of enemies against you, the player A huge Bad ass of pure flesh and bone.


Whats important is that they included classic with new mechanics, mostly fun ones at that.

76,76529992,english,"So, remember when in Doom 2016 they made Doomguy the ""I don't give a s#it about the story, I'm just here to obliterate demons"" character and how awesome that was? I sure do. And now, in 2020, we finally have the ""long-awaited"" Serious Sam 4 (without the ""Planet Badass"" part for some reason), when the devs decided that the story is so important and that is what every Serious Sam fan wants.

Yeah! Instead of making a good classic FPS lets shove in a dozen of useless characters, that everybody (who've played past games) knows all gonna eventually die! And give them cheesy, ear-bleeding, cringe-inducing voices and dialogue! AND make them follow you around! That is exactly what the series was missing! Don't forget the amazing facial animations! ""Yeah, judging by our previous games, we here at Croteam know that we can't animate faces and lip sync for s#it but we gonna do it anyways!""

Also, screw all that ""optimizing your game before release"" stuff! I don't have a high-end PC, but it's certainly powerful enough to run this game on high-to-ultra settings. So why is it runs like garbage even on minimal? Texture and model popping is horrible too, even when the game is installed on SSD. And it doesn't help that this game sometimes looks worse than Serious Sam 3, a 9 years old game. Damn, some animations look even worse than those from the classics (looking at you, combat knife).

The level design gets more and more boring with each release. The levels in Rome are just bunch of copy-pasted cardboard buildings, with some brick walls in between. The ""large open areas"" are just barren fields with boring vehicles.

The game is also quite buggy, with enemies getting stuck in architecture, enemies hovering above the ground, enemies having pathfinding issues, fuсked-up lighting and so on. Although the game never crashed on me, there's many players who did experience crashes, some even had problems launching the game.

I've been a series fan for like 15 years now and I'm just really sad to see this game turned out to like it did. It just feels unfinished and... overall dated. Many areas have no detail and feel empty, especially the indoor ones. The ""legion system"", the killer feature of this game, is just a lie -- if you just stop and look closely, ""a hundreds of thousand enemies"" are just the same assets, copy-pasted hundred times, and only some of them are enemies you can actually attack.

And yes, knowing Croteam, they eventually gonna fix all the bugs like they always do with their games. But I doubt they can ""fix"" the story, the annoying characters and the boring-аss level design. So for me -- the hope is lost.

I've never refunded a game on Steam before, and I think it's a good chance to try. Sucks it's a Serious Sam game.",1601033774,1601033774,False,6,0,0.546296298503875732,1,True,False,False,76561198035337085,304,7,80,80,80,1600976274,,

A fan of the series since I was a tiny kid.
I loved SS3 and this game was worth the wait.
The new story focus is great, definitely what the series needed. 
I love the characters, nothing is taken too seriously, but with a few touching moments. 
And the gameplay improvements are 10/10.
New movement is very fluid, faster weapon changes, more forgiving collision, tracer rounds etc.

And the new models are amazing.
Croteam art department are gods.
Leans slightly more towards the cartoon style of earlier games with the colour pallette but keeping the realism with the fidelity from SS3.

Soundtrack is amazing, can't wait to hear the epic themes in the final missions. 

All in all brilliant game.
Might melt your GPU until they get some performance patches out. My mates gtx1050 laptop can't even get 50fps with most settings on low.

81,76501552,english," Sorry if the formatting is weird, my review is to big lol.
This section will not be long as this plot is quite simplistic overall, but if i were to give an overall feeling, its alright. I really do not care honestly, the only thing I liked was I got to hear Serious Sam talk more. I will say one thing that bothered even me a bit, as well as others who cared about the story. This game has shown while they want the story to be a thing in Serious Sam, they basically got rid of the any story they built up in Serious Sam 3 or in other games. It effectively has redone the whole series plot, HOWEVER this does not mean the game itself like how it functions, or the guns in it are changed, in fact I am going to get to that now.

The gameplay as far as I am concerned, really feels like a mixture of the past games. I do feel Serious Sam 3 still here, with reloading, sprinting, and a couple of other things like the movement in general. But I do not mind, as the reloading feels less of a chore due to the larger amount of rounds you get per clip now. The Sprinting is not to much of an issue, negatives of it get negated later for reasons I will explain. Now for the guns, I personally loved the guns in this game. They felt heavy, they did damage, I just love the feel of them, and if you are worried about the amount of guns, I will say I believe almost every single gun from the last game has made a return, as well as new ones. The Laser gun, the cannon, the double barrel, the duel wielded pistols (in a way) are all here and are basically the same. New editions like the auto shotgun, the flaming chainsaw rocket launcher (legit a weapon) and others i don't think i can remember are here as well. I legit can not really state how many weapons their are, I know their are not a lot of new editions but considering that ALL the old guns are back really does say that Serious Sam's sandbox of weapons does not really need to be changed much and feels like a nearly perfected set. However I will mention their are new gimmick tools called ""gadgets"" you can use at any time. They are limited uses, only one use per gadget, but these are neat and offer a diverse amount of things you can do with them. An example being the rage serum, making you run faster, and deal more damage. Essentially, serious speed and damage at once.
So to make it brief, this game touches on smaller cramped areas, and giant and I mean GIANT areas. They were not kidding when they said they had massive areas, and I believe they made decent use of these. I will admit I felt like their may have not been enough levels with the aforementioned ""thousands"" of enemies, but I still think they used it quite well, and this is truly the most enemies I have seen in a Serious Sam entry. The levels detailing and actual environments are pretty solid, the colour palette was very green and red alot of the time. 

It has its country side areas, its urban areas, even flaming burning areas to. Overall, I think its a good mixture and helps the pacing of the game alot for what it wants to do. The side objectives are here, and are actually pretty fun things to do, they reward you with the gadgets I mentioned, and offer a nice distraction from the main course, and will usually help you in the main objective, I see no reason as to why you would not do these as they are very rewarding, usually either giving good weapons early, or gadgets. 

I will say this now, I think this is the most enemies I have ever seen from Serious Sam before. The sheer amount of different enemies is crazy, I have counted about over 30 in total, and still had them show up in the later levels. They do not feel redundant either, as they all play a role of some kind and will be used at some points. The creativity behind them is amazing to, I love the way they look and they brought back nearly all the enemies from the past games, and have a completely new different cast of them as well. I also have counted so far, 4 to 5 Unique boss fights, and about 3 sort of repurposed boss fights. (i.e Witch bride, khnum) That makes this game have probably the most boss fights out of any besides maybe Serious Sam 2, which I think is quite crazy.

I know a lot of people may not read my review, but all I am asking is that you give Croteam a break, and just understand this game is actually pretty good for the most part. I have not encountered any of the reported glitches, (not to mention a bunch of early reviewers got a scuffed press copy that wasn't updated in time) and I have not had really any performance issues. Keep in mind this is a 40$ game, and I am impressed with what I have seen so far, they also I believe promised a day-one patch, so just please take it easy on this game for now.",1600982608,1601032361,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198023139465,264,4,912,912,494,1601490387,,

The good:
-Smooth gunplay, secondary fire modes, dual wielding
-Audio
-NETRICSA's encyclopedia feels much closer, to the TFE and TSE
-Power-ups
-Enemy variety (including the missing sub-types of beheaded Sirians and Gnaars)
-(So far) stable framerate and performance on low-end PC (although my 1050Ti might try to assassinate me in the sleep)

The bad:
-Many people mention awfully outdated graphics. I'm in no position of talking about graphs, as I'm playing on medium settings, although there are some issues with shading. Some objects appear to be much brighter, or much more dim, than the surroundings
-Speaking of graphics, the game tends to crash when changing settings
-Voice acting of people other than Sam feel kinda cheap

Things I cannot say a thing about right now:
-Vehicles, story. I'm still early in the game
-DX12 mode. I'm playing on DX11, so that's not my issue

To say it in short, Serious Sam 4 is underwhelming, but not disappointing.

It's got loads of those hilarious secrets that are from past games that make it fun to look for them. The guns are great and even some have some new add ons to them to make them even more fun to play as. There's a new skill tree addition to the game that makes it more interesting and adds variety to the game. The graphics are great and while yes there are some tiny bugs and frame rate dips on occasion, it's not enough to make me say this is a crappy game.

Some people are experiencing a lot of technical issues, I haven't even bumped into one at all.

This game is x1000 times better then Serious Sam 3 and I think they did a way better job this time around. There are so many enemy types now and it's just a lot of old school fun as it should be.

All these whiners and complainers are clearly playing a completely different game then I am because I can't see how you could even remotely be disappointed with this game. It carries that greatness that serious sam first and second encounter did in a completely more modern way, and it succeeds in doing so. The serious sam ""faithful"" here saying they've played all the games 5+ times and saying this one is ""crap"" clearly didn't know what made the first two games so fun as it's been replicated in the same but different way in this game.

Serious Sam 4, despite what was shown in the trailers, is just Serious Sam 3:BFE 2: Electric Boogaloo. While I believe the game is fun and probably worth your money depending on if you liked SS3 or not, had reloading, the ADS on weapons other than the sniper, and sprinting been evicted, it would have been much better and less ""oh you shot 80 bullets? Reload, [b] [i] [u] N O W [/u] [/i] [/b]"". Also I'm leaving it a positive review as I generally like the game despite some issues.

[h2] Story [/h2]
Yes, its Serious Sam. No, you did not come for the story. Anyways, as soon as on the story trailer said the story is something worthy of a movie, I was skeptical at best. And ngl I was right. The story is a mess kinda. Father Grigori's descendant? What.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
Refer to my SS3 review for the general shooting, but theres more, and [b] the additions are good. [/b] Dual wielding goddamn (Steam swear filter bad) laserguns? Get enough purple balls which are used for skill points, then yes, you can. Theres also vehicles, such as and I'm not gonna spoiler it since it was in the trailers, a mech, that I believe was made by nonother than the Pope himself. Also gadgets things, which range from stuff like temporary buff to portable blackholes. Also Also, side quests. [strike] Open-World Serious Sam game when Croteam? [/strike]

[h2] Graphics [/h2]
When I said ""It's like Serious Sam 3"", that shows with the graphics. I had to lower it to the lowest for me to not lag every 3 seconds, and get this, I have a GTX 1060, the requirements list:
nVidia GeForce 780/970/1050 or AMD Radeon 7950/280/470 (3 GB VRAM)
and I have to make the game look potato to run decently. Did optimisation really come into the devs minds? But, if there's one thing I have to give them credit for, it's the fact that the Double Barrel Shotgun anims dont look like hideous anymore.

[h2] Multiplayer [/h2]
Haven't tried it but theres co-op, which allows up to 4 players to make Mentals forces cry.

weapon upgrades (attachments)

companions and NPCs are boring

If i compare this with other releases from the last weeks (like Avengers and others), where those games are full of bugs and the game constantly crashes, SS4 is, compared to those, close to bug free.

Buffering worlds and the missing hop on/off during a mission is not a bug or something new. 
This is since the very first Serious Sam multiplayer game, as its using different mechanics.

Yes, the game takes up a huge amount of resources, but thats what we expect,
if it would not be the case, how could we say there is an evolution between SS3 and 4?
You can get stable 83 FPS with 2x 1080ti, the game looks, for a Serious Sam, absolutely beautiful.

Dont compare a real FPS game with Battlefield,
and dont play it like Skyrim (as i saw on Twitch).

SS4 is technically the logical step forward from Serious Sam Fusion.

Sure, there are bugs and performance issues at launch but given Croteam’s track record with their passion and support for SS (Just look at what they did with SS Fusion) all these issues will no doubt be ironed out.

The voice lines are dull, the modelling of some characters are bad as hell (no eyes, or shapeshifting faces, etc). Not to mention Serious Sam 3, hell, even the HD version of the First and Second Encounters looking better in any ways.

Alright, you went past the meme, let me give you my personal thoughts.

I love this game.


This game seems like Serious Sam 3 if it took more inspiration from Serious Sam TSE and TFE. The maps are all really beautiful to look at, ranging from the streets of Italy to the fields of France. The enemies feel varied enough, and they come in huge numbers.

The guns also feel extremely satisfying to shoot. Whether it's blasting off a polyp's head with a pistol(which is my favorite by far in the series), to shooting Beheaded soldiers with the Shotgun. It all feels fantastic.

There's also some story now, which I've heard people criticize, but I've honestly lost my shit at some of these jokes. They're great.

There's also some fun little vehicle sections that are very short, though I wish those could be a bit longer.

Secrets also make a fun return, but I won't spoil what those do.


I've heard some people getting quite a few glitches, but other than some small framedrops, I can't relate to it.




Overall, right now I'd give the game a 7/10. The framedrops could be fixed, but other than that, I don't see much wrong with the game.

That's what I said as soon as I got in to the room with the double-barrel shotgun. Make no mistake, right now in its current state Serious Sam 4 has a lot of issues that would destroy AAA devs for all of time. I ran into several, but I also wanted to play it and see for myself what was really going on. [b] If you're reading this and just want to know if it at least plays like Serious Sam then this review is for you. [/b] Fair Warning: This is going to be a long review and I'm not one to write these so bare that in mind.

[u] The Kind of Serious Sam This Is [/u]
The gameplay is a major improvement over Serious Sam BFE. They took many of the ideas that worked in BFE and expanded upon them. There's now a skill tree, gadgets (stored powerups), and headshot bonuses. So how does that help? Because those are the parts of the game that work, and they serve to balance out the part of the game that will even scare veterans. The game is faster than previous iterations of Serious Sam. It feels more like KF2 set on HOE than it does Serious Sam throughout most of the game. I feel that their intention was to cause way more hectic moments rather than maintain the rhythm of previous games, and in that sense they succeeded. If you find that appealing, you'll enjoy this. If you were aching for a return to the classics, this isn't it. I only play on Serious or Mental so I can't help you otherwise. 

[u] The Mess [/u]
Here's where I get into the mess of its current state. This to me is dejavu of BFE, and in a way I was ready for that. What I'm trying to say is that the mixed reaction is actually the fault of both fans and Croteam. I don't believe Croteam set expectations properly by not releasing enough information. The promotional material was sparse. But in their defense, they're a small company with few resources, so little to at least say, ""Hey, we got the gameplay to work and we're trying to make this more of a modern BFE than a return to TFE/TSE. Sorry if that's not what you want."" Their job is not easy because everyone has their own idea of how Serious Sam should be. Purists have Serious Sam Classics Revolution. Fans are divided to this day over the HD remasters. BFE has mods and the workshop. I strongly believe this was made to push things closer to modern games without relinquishing its essence. It was gonna be rough. I don't believe their intention was to somehow own the modern FPS platform like some of the top negative reviews imply. This is less about ""lower your expectations accordingly,"" and more about, ""understand what they were going for and see if that appeals to you.""

[u] New Experiences [/u]
[b] Note: Overuse of ""okay"" [/b]
As soon as I launched the game the Croteam Crash Reporter popped up. But I was okay with that and continued. I moved the window to the other screen and went to check the video settings. I changed GPU Speed to Ultra and it crashed. I restarted and decided that its preset autodetect settings of Ultra, Normal, and Ultra were good enough and started. The cinematics improved by about 1.4x since BFE and I was okay with that. You immediately start killing with the deagle, which really improved since BFE. Landing headshots was addicting and the return of classic enemies was unexpectedly exciting since they're faster and seem more capable on their own. I got the decoy gadget and never expected to use it. Jumping ahead a bit but there were two sections I ended up using it and I do believe those areas were intentionally setup for that.

The double barrel shotgun is satisfying to use and it was by that point where I really realized how they rebalanced enemies in a way that deviates from the classics and BFE. The deagle isn't just a revolver reskin, you can wear bigger enemies down or 2/3-shot them. The double barrel had way more range and power than I was expecting. Using the deagle on the new zombie like enemies didn't get old. I found myself trying to land as many headshot kills on them and the new space aliens in swat gear. 

At some point I realized the game ""settled down"" a bit and the steam overlay began working again. The new characters talk a lot and I didn't find their dialogue annoying or trying hard to be funny. I was actually very surprised that despite there being a lot of new cutscenes and minor characters, they were just okay. I didn't mind their moments and the only thing that bothered me was I could've sworn one of the minor characters gave Sam an assault rifle but actually didn't. Maybe I hallucinated it like when Sam got his first skill point from a drug reference. 

With the 1st level done, I was still excited enough to see what would happen next. The change to a mostly outdoor landscape was very welcome and it showed with the scenic set pieces.

The 3rd gadget you get is an energy drink which is your speed & damage powerup in one. It is very obvious that it's there to help you deal with the arrival of Kleers that appear after you got done wiping out a horde of enemies with your shotguns. Soon after is an area showing off how the zombie guys are apparently attracted to sound? If they are cool, if it was a mistake, lol that's okay. Sadly soon after my game crashed. 

[u] Final Thoughts [/u]
I'm definitely going to finish the game and will try and update this review when I do. I wish I could do more tonight. For those interested, here's my score for the first level on my first try. I'm not good at finding secrets in any game even going back to Doom '93.

45,76520779,english,"It's Serious Sam 3: 2, and that's all I was expecting.
They took Serious Sam 3, made the art style just a tad more vibrant and colorful like the old style, and then completely revamped the combat to make an excellent FPS.

Serious Sam 4 is perhaps the best the series has ever felt in terms of combat. Every single weapon is punch, now projectile based, and sounds better than crumpled up paper, which used to be common for SS games. Regarding the NPCs, they are not with you constantly, just some missions. Otherwise, missions will play out exactly like a classic SS game. You are alone in old ruin place and get swarmed by enemies alone the whole level.

As for the story... it's... alright? It's not good, that's for sure, but it's more like a hammy B-move type thing where they are very clearly self-aware of how stupid it is. If you take it seriously and expect it to be good, then you're probably an idiot yourself.

Performance and bugs I will bundle together because I have not experience a single bug or performance hitch in the first 3 hours of the game. I'm on an RTX 2060 Super and Ryzen 5 3600X at 1440p w/ 16gb of ram, and it runs phenomenally at 60fps custom High-Ultra settings. Mileage may vary, as apparently people with better systems are experiencing hitching.

Do I recommend the game?
Absolutely. This is likely to be one of, if not my favorite SS game besides TFE.

vehicles are responsive and easy to pilot
damjan delivers yet again with another killer soundtrack

cons
major problem currently is the terrible optimization where even higher end pc's have trouble running the game smoothly
textures popping in and out
lazy melee finishers for most enemies
the clunkiest eurojank character animations of all time
AI is lackluster (was never a strong-point of the series but the amount of times the AI gets stuck by simply walking towards you is too much)

49,76520287,english,"Serious Sam 4 is very controversial with players, it seems. Having been a fan since 2016, I can see the beauty in this poorly optimized diamond in the rough.

I'm not gonna focus on the graphics or story here, just the gameplay. In my opinion though, they look great uh...when they're not slugging my computer down.

The first four levels of this game are the kicker. They give you too many enemies, very few supplies, and you only have the single and double shotgun for a lot of this. Also some tight corridors even outdoors make an appearance, making it very difficult to bob and weave your way through projectiles. So yes, I recommend it but I'm saying all this harsh stuff about it? If you take a look back at The First Encounter, the first four levels were also rather frustrating to newcomers as literally the third level had an annoying soundtrack and cramped indoor spaces. Same for the fourth level, some annoyances indoors. If you're willing to get past those first four meh levels, you are good to go. Well, almost. This leads me to my second and final point.

Serious Sam is an orchestra, tightly conducted by the players reflexes and woven with the left mouse button all into one beautiful formula. But enough fluff words, what my analogy means is that the tune here is slightly different than the tune you've BEEN playing all this time. and you're essentially using a different ""orchestra"" altogether, not the one that knows your tune inside and out just like you. What I'm asking here is that you open yourself up to learning these new chess pieces, and the changes that come with the old ones. Don't like the story? Skip the cutscenes! Don't like the skill tree? Don't pickup the Artifacts of Might! You'll still get the secondary weapon fires no matter. Please, if your computer can handle it, give this game another go before you give up. It's super fun once you learn how to dance to its tune.

TL;DR The first four levels are meh, but stick with it and be open to learning. It gets SUPER fun afterwards. In the words of Sam himself, ""Croteam rules"".",1601014827,1601014827,True,3,0,0.515892446041107178,0,True,False,False,76561198026295055,546,31,2069,2069,395,1601950241,,

If you pretend this is Ed Wood making a movie, it's kinda alright.  Like instead of AAA cutscenes, it's got that Wiseau guy trying to make ""art"" and gloriously coming up so short it's the cinematic equivalent of running a 100 meter dash with your shoes tied together, face-planting every meter and trying to run anyway.

I like the game play additions, gadgets and S.A.M.  A shame that they didn't add a crouch slide....  but that isn't really an issue.  Gun play is fantastic, the engine is better than ever.  (I've read some of the complaints, but I guess I am not picky)

I though it was really cool how they had that brief glimpse of Tunguska at the beginning, to show you what the engine is capable of, but then toned it down a bit.

I like the new setting, as well as the sound track.

I find it amusing, but why did they make Hellfire look like Ruby Rose?  LOL.  I guess there is a tiny bit of current year in their design team, between that and the newly modest harpies...  hah.  Hardly an issue.

Premise:
Aliens have invaded.. Well, technically they are STILL invading.  it's Serious Sam 4, after all...  Your job is to do what you do.  Which is kill them in a spectacular font of blood and gore.

It's no Wildlands or anything, but it's comfortably in the realm of yet another entertaining version of the Serious Sam genre.  It doesn't have amazing graphics, it doesn't have janky gameplay either.  The controls are tight, the demons are satisfying to blow up with any and all of your arsenal, and your followers are righteous, pieous, stupid and somewhat slow in the head at times.  Which makes for hilarious statements and situations.

Is it worth buying at $40?  To me it was, but I'm definitely a fan of the genre.  Tons and tons of things to shoot with weapons galore. 

Definitely a thumbs-up and definitely a must-have for any Serious Sam fans out there.

Technically, it is a mess.

But that opening scene with thousands of enemies on the screen? Yeah, [i]severely impressive[/i]. I did manage to get 60fps with my RTX2070 and i5 6600k there and I was only running DX11. In some places it dips down below 50fps but I'm running mostly high graphics, so I can always just lower it. I do hope Vulkan/DX12 rendering gets fixed soon so we can get some extra frames.

I must say there's a LOT of object pop-in though and it's very noticeable.

Btw. the game now looks a lot better than in the early trailers. Looks like the delay did help with getting the monster models to look right in the lighting. Animations, especially in cutscenes still leaves a lot to be desired though. It looks like they didn't even use mo-cap for the cutscenes. The voice acting is cheap (as usual) and the writing is corny (again, as usual for SS games). The ""glory kill"" melee animations on the enemies are somehow worse and less creative than in SS3 and very recycled (a lot of enemies just get the stab-in-neck animation). The way this game was hyped up, one would think they paid attention to these things, but no. I think people expected Serious Sam games to mature to AAA levels after all this time, but ultimately it's really just the old, usual, corny fun that SS:TFE and SS:TSE also were.

Now, onto the stuff that actually matters: gameplay. tl;dr it's good so far.

I'm 5 levels in on Serious difficulty and it feels a lot like the beginning of Serious Sam 3 mixed with the beginning of SS:The Second Encounter, where there was not that many enemies as you're running through the city, but occasionally there's optional objectives with big fights in big open areas with hundreds of enemies, just like how serioius sam was meant to be. Mind you, I love SS3 unlike most other people.

I really like the skill upgrades Sam can get, I just wish there was more. Stuff like riding a Werebull or a Khnum seems very enticing though, so no complaints here. The weapon upgrades are even better. Croteam, you finally managed to make me like the grenade launcher (the gun, not the underbarrel GL for the shotgun), even though I always hated it in previous SS games. The cluster mortar mod on it is just [i]delicious[/i]. I also love the little secret bouncing magic ball. It's cute! Headshots are also a thing now and often even demanded of the player, because just backpedaling does not seem to be enough anymore. Land those headshots and use the right weapons in the right situations. The roles for weapons are nowhere near as strictly defined as in e.g. Doom Eternal though. Hell, even SS3 has more defined gun roles than SS4.

As usual the secrets are extremely well hidden, I can barely find half of them on each level. The masochist secrets from the first two SS games are also back - you know, the ones where you pick up +1 HP and the game closes you into a 5m by 5m room with 5 big bio-mechanoids. SS3 didn't have these, which is exactly why I liked SS3 the most out of all SS games (plus it had that bracelet that was fun to use).

It's a lot of fun, I'm only in the beginning of the game but I already feel like I got my money's worth. They really just need to optimize it more.",1600994868,1600996426,True,1,0,0.510747015476226807,0,True,False,False,76561198019730955,132,141,465,465,359,1602102244,,

97,76505444,english,"okay so what im assuming is a day1 patch is already out. I have a couple of levels under my belt so i'll state my impressions.

First something positive.
Game feels really good to play. Weapons have that additional ""oomph"" to them that makes them even more fun. Especially noticable with a double barrel shotgun. So far the dialogue and story arent that bad. They arent ""so bad its funny"" like Serious sam 2, but they arent 80's action movie like BFE tried either. There is some good oneliners and some that clearly miss the mark. Sound design is good, music is great so far. New enemies are interesting, and the old ones got some fixes (Kleers dont seem to bug out and immediately attack again after getting stunned mid-dash. May need further testing). Gameplay is more ""modernized"" without losing the core feel of the series, which is the way to go. Things like the GPS, Weapon wheel, health bars arent intrusive and can be helpful. 

Now for the bad...

Optimization is horrendous. Im running a 10 year old CPU and a rather decent still GPU (1050ti), which usually allows me to play modern games on medium settings. Here somehow my CPU is set on highest setting while GPU at lowest. Game (especially in the 1st Pompei level my god) is really eye-straining to play. I literally have to focus to see pixels that might or might not be enemies. It wouldnt be an issue if the enemies didnt blend so much into the foliage, even a small outline would help. Instead i have to rely on sound and move my crosshair around hoping a healthbar shows up. This absolutely needs to be fixed as i imagine on higher difficulties its gonna be a literal nightmare when you cant even see things shooting at you from across the huge maps.
Speaking of maps, the level design. This is a mixed bag, on one hand you have some really cool and interesting design choices, on the other hand it feels like the maps went through a ton of reshuffling. In the first Rome levels there is a ton of objects sticking out from walls. Pretty much on every corner. However there is pretty much no parkour secrets as far as ive checked. And i tried to parkour from every single one. The other problem with maps relates to the Pompei one again. Too. Big. When the 3rd level has estimated time of 50 minutes, you've done something wrong. At the end of it i was happy to be done with the level. That shouldnt be the case. 

However my experience with the game is rather positive so far. Its fun, playable, gameplay still kicks ass. Seems the development hell never ends for Croteam, but considering the end product is still awesome to play despite all the issues is a testament to how great the core gameplay is. Cant exactly say much about the rest of the game, but i expect to have a lot of fun moving forward.

Plus people need to understand croteam isnt a big studio they cant aford to mutch they literaly have 40 people working thats nothing so considering that i think this game is good.

Now about the game i must say i am a serious sam fan played all of them and for me this game is really good they added more things to keep it intresting its fun same old cringe jokes that people complain about yet it was allways a part of the games. The gun play is good feels really good its skillful fast past and really fun its like the old games so you feel like at home. The new things that they added like perks i really like cause they give some progres that spices things up and they are well tohught perks new gadgets are nice and weapon atachments are cool some new enemys to. It is basicly the same old game but with a bit new stuf that in my opinon are really good.

Yes, it's a lot of the same things we've seen before, but considering how many new things HAVE been added, where many see laziness I see more of a ""greatest hits compilation"" of content from the early Sams to the new. The environments are gorgeous, Damjan is still a musical mastermind, and that classic Croteam sense of humor is still abundant in all the weird little secrets hidden among the maps. The dialogue is cringe-tastic, the attempts at a story are the most shlocky action movie crap... And it's perfect. It's everything I ever could have hoped for a Serious Sam game. It's eternally trapped in the 90's, and it is delicious.
It's not the most polished game by any means, but that's just classic Euro Jank, baby. It's got charm.

Its Serious Sam 3 with improvements (like easier to use C4 and less annoying Witch-brides) and ideas taken from Doom 2016/Eternal (like healing from melee kills and a shotgun with grenade launcher). Gameplay itself is very fun, the main issue is performance problems. Vulkan makes the game run better but apparently Vsync doesnt work on it, which explains why I got screen tearing despite checking Vsync on. If you can stomach playing with slightly lower settings to keep performance steady, the game is recommended for that Serious Sam itch. 
If your computer is slower one, you might want to skip this one, or at least wait for performance patches. When you're tweaking performance settings and the game warns you that your PC might not be able to handle your settings, take that warning seriously. I had a lot instance crashes when I didnt. 

If the typical eurojank launch doesnt frighten you, its a fun shooter all around. Play the game on Normal- to Serious difficulty, never play Serious Sam games on Tourist or Easy unless you want to get bored. The whole point and entertainment comes from surviving against unfair odds.

Texture pop in while walking around is noticeable on bigger areas of levels

First, from the first few chapters I have played I am relatively amazed. You can easily see that the devs really did try to bring something new to the franchise -> friendly NPCs, Cutscenes with over-the-top quotes and cheesy dialogues etc. I really do consider them a great addition to the already well-thought-out ""Serious Sam-Formula"". If you are having problems with playing a game that does not have top notch AAA level animations and graphics, then sorry, but we are talking about a game whose team is quite small compared to id Software. 

I am mentioning id, because most reviewers try to compare this game to Doom Eternal or Wolfenstein. The main problem I see there is that Sam has always tried to be its own game and not some copy. And from the point of money and time it is quite unfair as well. 

Next, I am feeling some people are making up problems about this game. They state that it is poorly optimized and I must disagree. I have an GTX 1060 6GB, which is as you might know not the newest nor the fastest GPU out there. However, on Vulkan I am running at constant 50-60 FPS on 2k resolution. If you call that bad optimalization.... well, nevermind. 

To sum up, this game gets bad reviews for not good reason whatsoever. By that I mean those talking about performance.

I suppose the NPCs took some getting used to but are they bad? Absolutely not. Not only that but Sam actually has a personality now! He's no longer just a guy that spits one liners (even though its a running joke as youd expect) and that's definitely a change for the better. 

The game is pretty much BFE levels of carnage until you pickup the minigun. After that, the new engine really shines. Literally hundreds upon hundreds of enemies charging at you as you run around and mowe them down. That's what serious sam is. That's what this game delivers.

... that I really love this game. The story is hilarious and endearingly self-parodic, the new enemy designs are fantastic, the level design is great and the expansion of the universe and backstory makes for a game that honestly hooked me much more than I had expected.

Most importantly, it's a HUGE improvement over Serious Sam 3 and brings back the road trip-like progression of Second Encounter and 2 to fantastically well modelled world cities like Rome, Vatican City and Paris. For the year 2104, these locations look very... well, 2015-2020ish, however.

Like many other players though, I'm also pretty disappointed by the technical jank.

To start with the unimportant things first, I'm a sucker for trashy cutscenes, that know they are trashy and have fun with it. The way the Game treats its story is exactly what I wanted. It's fun, has some semi-serious moments, a lot of one-liners, and a lot of references to the one-liners being in the game. It's trashy, it's fun, I love it.

Compared to SS3, in my opinion the gameplay feels a lot more polished. Now, this game can still look janky as hell, similiarly to SS3, but a lot of things about the Gameplay seem to be more thought through. A lot less hitscan, weapons being buffed in smart ways (for example the Double Shotgun being a lot more useful for hordes), and the new enemies fit nicely into everything. I really enjoyed SS3 after it's rough start, but SS4 just makes sense to me.

And thats the main part. As a life-long Serious Sam fan, this game just clicks. It feels good to play. The scenery of the levels keeps me just engaged enough, the story is fun to follow, and the gameplay gets me into the exact rhythm I want from a Serious Sam game.

Honestly, I don't understand what people are complaining about. By no means is this game a masterpiece, but it's pretty much what I expected when I bought the game. It's considerably more interesting than Serious Sam 3, boasting environments that are actually fun to go through (don't pretend you enjoyed a game that was 100% deserts) and enemy variation that I consider a lot more fun than previous entries. The new weapon and skill point systems don't feel entirely necessary but I don't think they hurt the game for being there; it's an extra bit of progression and I can respect that.

I will say my PC is relatively high-end so I haven't had many performance issues. Does it look or run perfect? No. However, i don't think it has to - it's fine for what it is. However, I can see people with budget PCs having a lot more issue getting this game to work. While the game could definitely use some polish, I think it's a playable and fun experience.

Some veterans/veteran youtubers or hardcore sam fans are just too used to old style gameplay so they will cry  about each change about gameplay. I bet if they made no changes to gameplay then those crybabies would complain about it being the same thing. Change or not they would most likely still complain about something. I personally think this change was a great thing. Those dialogues and cutscenes and story made the game feel more alive for me. I mean YES, it has problem with some animations in cutscenes and third person(yeah third person is catastrophy right mow) but those can be fixed later, its not something that breaks the gameplay. Honestly i love the ingame combat. Much better than previous games in my opinion. Some people are having problems with graphics optimalization, if youre gonna write a negative review then please dont be a douche a try to open graphics settings menu. I fixed it under 1 minute. But yeah some users have issues with optimalization. Im also sure developers can optimalize it in the future. Some veterans may not like the new gameplay changes but i think its more suitable for nowaday games and will attract more new people. It pisses me off how those veterans talk shit because their minds can NOT accept a change. I have played this with my veteran friends, they also thought it was a good change. We have had so much fun. There are also only 4 coop player models, i also think they will add more in the future. Remember that Croteam tries to listen to their fans.
The only thing im angry about in this game is the fact that when you get weapon upgrades/skill point or gadgets from side quests IT DOESNT SAVE IN COOP. We have lost our grenade shotgun attachment croteam please can you guys finally make coop save feature?

So yeah maybe it was rushed in the end with those cutscene and third person animations but there is nothing wrong with actual gameplay, its fine and awesome. They will 99% fix those animations and optimalization issues in the future. Maybe thats why they didnt want to release physical version for now.

Dual wielding is badass in SS4 i love every aspect of it.
Comparing Fusion 2017 engine to SS4's it just blows me away by how beautiful it is. I'm amazed by how Croteam managed to pull this off. Remember Fusion 2017 at this time of writing this can't even properly handle vegetation before it drops to 20fps when it's abused. Meanwhile Serious Sam 4 just puts thousands of various vegetation assets in one place and manages to run okay. 60FPS is enough for low settings. Using GTX 1060. My main concern is Optimization.

It's not your ordinary Classic Sam game where you're put in Egypt with big open space, no vegetation just sand or Jungle with barely 30 trees around the world. Those days are over.

I'm only an hour into it right now, and here are my thoughts:

Pros
- The new enemies are badass
- There's skills to obtain
- This feels as serious as any other SS game

Cons
- Invincible NPCs with guns kill stuff for you. Takes a little bit away from the immersion.
- You can melee endlessly, making large groups easy to take down just by mashing the E button.

People need to lighten up and stop having unrealistic expectations. The price is a little steep for it, but I can see the work that was put into it. I stand behind Croteam's new creation. Maybe they hyped it up a little too much or something but I don't think they deserve the backlash they've been getting from the SS community.

Also this runs just fine on Ultra for me.

[*][b]Does the game have some issues?[/b] Yes, there are plenty of issues - mostly performance related.
[*][b]Are these issues gamebraking?[/b] 99% of the time they aren't - there are workarounds for every issue, ranging from running the game with an additional parameter to simply dialing some settings down a bit until the engine gets optimized.
[*][b]Are devs ever going to fix these issues?[/b]I sure hope so; they're good devs.
[*][b]Does the game meet the expectations?[/b] Well, that depends on the expectations. It most definitely isn't an AAAA title that some expected. It's story, cutscenes, and voiceacting are cheesy as f<beep>, gameplay loop is very simple and repetative, and the game simply doesn't take itself (or anything else for that matter) seriously.

Sure, the optimization is pretty janky, for now, but it's been only a couple of hours since the release. Croteam always updates and supports their games for the long term, so I'm sure there will be patches rolling in no time.

As for the gameplay, even though I haven't beaten it yet, I can say that it rocks! Pure Serious Sam style awesomeness! The gunplay has been very improved. I'd even say it's the best in the series (believe me, I've played all of them). The weapons are very impactful: you can ""feel"" every shot and the enemies gib all over the place.

If you are concerned by not hitting the ULTRA/4K/144FPS mark, then sure, wait for patches.

The intensity of it got lowered a lot too It's not that intense at all which I liked from previous games especially in SS3, it tries to be funny and have some comedy in it but it's really not working out.

Theres a lot of voice acting and stuff but they shouldve spent the money and time on better level design, animation, optimization, and so on.

The variety of baddies is amazing. The addons and powerups are new and I guess a good addition to the gameplay? (some of them make your survival chances way easier so not sure if that's good or not, depends on what kind of a player you are).
Some of the secrets are well placed and require you to perform skilful set of jumps in order to obtain them.
Levels have a lot of side missions that reward you abundantly and make your life easier (plus you get to shoot some more baddies).
AI aren't too much involved as I feared.

89,76489697,english,"Granted, I'm only a few hours in at the time of writing this review, but I quit the game due to severe boredom, which is unthinkable in a Serious Sam title. I grew up with the original games and Sam is one of the last few childhood heroes that hadn't been dunked on by passage of time. Now I fear that only Great Cthulhu himself is left standing.

It's depressing to realize that even in 2020 the most fun you can experience with this series is through the magic of the very First Encounter. I've been gaming on potato hardware for 30 years, I have no intention to quit doing so any time soon, but this is the very first game in the series that is giving me performance issues, even though comparatively I'm running it on much better hardware than what I had available from the First through Before the First Encounter. The game looks extremely bad for how demanding it is and how it runs. The first title was revolutionary in how it represented water and the sensation of being submerged in it. The latter is likely completely gone now, and the former appears to be decades behind what they achieved almost 20 years ago, which in and of itself is mind-boggling.

Sam is the same no cover all man tough guy with one-liners so parched they should be declared a disaster area. However, he is significantly slower than in any other game, which again is just abominable. Controls feel off too. I can't remember the last time when I couldn't play an fps just fine with default mouse sensitivity and camera bobbing settings, and in this case I can't find the settings that feel right either. The music is another major letdown. After two decades of brilliant soundtracks, this one is a mixed bag of some cool tunes (and some remixed versions of classics) together with very bland and forgettable music.

Literally all they had to was reiterate on the formula of large open areas with frantic action and frenzied music, but I think the mark has been missed for whatever reason. I'm actually not looking forward into returning to the game at the moment, though I'd sure as hell go full blast in any of the previous titles. I don't typically write first impression reviews, but in this case I'd say it's definitely not worth the full price and that you should wait for some more patches and a sale.

91,76488637,english,"I didn't have high expectations for this game, but I also didn't have expectations this low. This feels exactly like the Bannerlord situation, perhaps even worse because that game is in early access and it's not as badly optimized.
Croteam is a small studio, and doesn't have as big a budget as other studios. That's why the gameplay in Serious Sam is exactly the same as in previous games, because the core gameplay doesn't need change, it's good.
It's the exact same as in the early 2000s, which is completely fine. However, I can't help but say that the older games are better, because trying to convert the good old into something new and modern, especially when you have a low budget, seldom works. In this case it doesn't. (in Doom it sure does, but you can't compare Croteam to id Software). 
The game feels incredibly bad to play, it is probably the worst optimized game that I've ever played, yet I feel like it looks and plays a lot worse than Serious Sam 3. The enviorment and textures are reused from their previous games, such as The Talos Principle.
The early serious Sam games were very good. For their time. Serious Sam 3 was also a pretty decent game, for 2011. But even in 2011 it didn't look nor feel very new or fresh. Now, Serious Sam 4 looks exactly like Serious Sam 3. Same graphics, engine, HUD, UI. It feels like a DLC for Serious Sam 3. Only worse.
The shooting looks terrible in cutscenes and in game. A lot of times particles from your gun and the enviorment blocks your view and you can't see or dodge incoming projectiles.
The graphics and animations are terrible, even for a 2011 game. People have their finger clipping trough the trigger IN CUTSCENES and their other hand also going trough the front grip and other stuff. The npcs walking around don't do anything and stand in the weirdest of places, also enemies don't seem to mind them as well.
The monsters... look like dog shit. Honestly, they've never looked so bad. Shooting at them feels horrible, unsatisfactory. Every few seconds a lot of stutters and frame drops, especially when getting shot at. Characters look worse than a 2009 game.
Everything about this game screams INCOMPLETE, or undoable. Random examples: There is a cutscene where a guy gives you a gun. After the cutscene some sort of bug happened and I didn't have it in my weapon slot. In the first cutscene of the game there are a lot of stutters, one even lasted 7 seconds because it had to load a big battle. Also during the game there are a lot of blurry textures that you have to wait for to load. And it's not like they are far away, they are right in front of you or even in cutscenes.
Croteam is a finished studio, they don't have the resources or budget for modern games, and they will be remembered as a great studio in the past that made awesome games, until they didn't.
I think Serious Sam is the first game that I've ever seen or played, when I was a little kid. And it was really good back then.

98,76488398,english,"I'll probably update the review after a few more hours of playtime, but with the little taste I got, I think I can at least give you an idea of how the first hour/level played out.

Graphics ARE dated, as a lot of other reviews say. They aren't the worse I've seen, but dated is the right word, it seams like a pretty looking game from 2 or 3 years ago, maybe even a beautiful game from 4 or 5... but I think we can all agree on the fact that graphics in the saga were only really great for their time in the first two games. After that, the rest of the games had good overall looking graphics but no finesse, no refinement. If you took a good look, you spotted flaws, blurry textures, ugly geometry. So I wasn't expecting my ass to fall off my hips when I looked at the graphics. They're good, but dated.

Performance was, again, a mixed bag. I keep reading people that have 2080 TIs and 10900Ks and still have the worst performance of all time. I got a Ryzen 5 2600X and a regular 2060 (ventus, MSI). When I booted the game it defaulted my CPU settings to ULTRA and my GPU settings to MEDIUM. Since I usually try to avoid spending a lot of time fine tuning the settings for max performance/quality (I mean, of course I end up doing that, but not in the first two hours... I wanna try the game and see if I wanna keep it), I set everything on ultra and thought to myself ""I'll try out the worst possible scenario, performance-wise, and take it from there"". And even though the game seemed somewhat choppy it ran above 80FPS the entire time (I got a 1920 x 1080 144hz monitor). So that didn't seem half bad. I couldn't run the game in DX12, though, for some strange reason. It just crashed on me when I tried to change the setting. 

Sound wasn't great on the cutscenes but it made do, it is a serious sam game, after all, so I don't think much time and polish went into the cutscenes. Sound ingame was better, but still not great. 

The gameplay was by far the most appealing thing to me. It felt like what I think a serious sam game feels. The action was fast and fun. At first it felt a bit off, but a few minutes in it came back to me. Movement's very floaty and arcady. You gotta like that or be able to cope with it, at least. gunplay seemed satisfying, but I haven't really tried all the guns out yet, except for... 

[little spoiler alert from literally the first few seconds of the game] -----> the first thing you do in the game is fight in a huge battle with all your weapons. I'm not a big fan of having been shown all of the guns from the start. Let me earn them, progress from one to the other while they're introduced in an organic way just before putting me in a situation that spells out their ideal use case. And... the army felt quite a bit fake, like the creatures only reacted when you got really close to them and attacked them. Before that, they all move in line and formation in a way that makes me feel rather lied to regarding the whole ""legion system"". I'm not expecting 50.000 AIs all working in a very complicated way at the same time. But I also wasn't expecting it to feel this hollow. I think if the animations of the army weren't so homogenous it wouldn't look so... bland. But as it was, I felt dissapointed about it. I REALLY hope there's another, better use of this technology along the campaign.
<Spoiler ending>

But overall I liked it enough to know I won't refund it. If that (or any of what I wrote), helps you decide if you'll get the game or keep it after having pre-purchased as an idiot (as I did), then mission acomplished.

dont let it end like this, 
dont kill Sam like this.

I played only a bit and i can see everything falling apart and its worse than SS3.
Just one hour of a game lacking of polish in technical and some gameplay aspects can really water it down to the point that its not enjoyable, and i enjoyed SS3.
Hate me for not playing more, but imma wait until at least some of the problems described by countless utubers now get fixed.

If NMS can come back after being the shittiest and empty promise of a  game on launch,
i really believe this serious scam can be a SERIOUS SCAME! game?  (idk how to rhyme).

16,76487139,english,"I just started playing this game, and it's awesome. It's a definitive next gen AA game. Yeah, it doesn't have the funding of Bethesda or the polish of ID Software, but it's got a lot of heart. This is an indie game from Croatia, made by people who came into game design self taught and they had to get their computers from a gray market. Serious Sam 4 feels like a massive improvement from the 3rd game, which laid down a ton of groundwork for DOOM 2016, and got no credit for it. This game does feel closer to the classic Sam game play, but with far more going on, like as soon as the game starts, you're using a minigun to fight off 10's of thousands of enemies at once.

If you aren't familiar with the franchise, Serious Sam takes the best parts of old school FPS games and ditches the boring parts, like being lost in a maze and searching for 3 key cards in each level. This is pure fast paced action with enemies spawnning in at frequent times, and if you get a new gun or lots of health and armor pick ups, expect a huge enemy spawn to show up right away. It's a big action fest from start to finish in each level. Like Sam 3, there is more of a story and cut scenes with a b-movie charm. It's still an indie game, but with a lot of ambition and trying to stay true to it's old school style, like there's never health regeneration, you find highlighted health packs and ammo, often times they can be hidden around. Each level has secret areas to find. Another improvement over 3, is this has better navigation, you won't get lost, but you still are encouraged to go off the beaten path for secrets and items.

I think the graphics are top notch, it preforms fantastic on my GeForce 1060, the load times are decent on a hard drive, I haven't had any serious bugs, so far the only glitch I've had was some lighting issues, like it gets too bright or flickers on a small area. But for a AA game, it feels polished, especially after talking the extra month to get the game ready for release. It's really a great alt to DOOM Eternal. I'd say you can compare it to modern indies like Dusk and Maximum Action, just on a much larger scale. This is what AA gaming is all about/",1600964627,1600964627,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198045457700,620,38,69,69,69,1600963832,,

I suppose this is serious since it's an option, but if it's a joke, it wasn't even funny. On with the game.

I tested the benchmarks couple times before running it and the quotes in the loading screens were almost cringe-worthy - going by the other reviews, I can imagine the rest of the commentators in-game. My performance in the benches was around 60 FPS at 3440x1440 with Ultra on both CPU and GPU presets on DX12 (3900X 4.4 / 2080 OC), but seemed to increase up to about 100 when I tried Vulkan with High GPU presetting, but I can see the game lagging for those with lower end systems.

The first level looked to be pretty much an abomination since it began with nothing other than what seemed to be an RTS emulator in Serious Sam form done with some 100s of human soldiers and Sam on one side, with just as much monsters on the other side. What's the point of this? Couldn't the devs have made a time trial challenge map or something for this level? Why not start with the typical Aztec or whatever ruins generated old school Sam maps?

21,76485423,english,"""Serious Sam 4 is going to kill Doom Eternal!!!""

Some nerds actually believed that, but the game is a laughing stock.

- Very unstable. I've crashed multiple times with a bunch of graphical artifacts, including freezing my PC twice and forcing a Disk check. Just for this alone the game scores a 0 out of 10.

- Game looks like ass. We were laughing our heads off at the bad texture pop-ins and crazy shadows. Sam looked like he came out of PS1 Era.

- To say that the animations look dated is not being truthful. Switch to 3rd person, and just look at Sam running animation, Knife swing and these poor man's ""finishing moves"" that were poorly copied from Doom.

- Gameplay is nothing special. You're put into this massive shoot out for 1 minute at first, which is impressive, and then go straight into the same old SS3/COD gameplay but now with annoying NPC to follow you.

- Day 1 38 gig patch. This is 2k20 vidya games in a nutshell. ""Small family owned game dev business!""

- They've put waypoints and HP bars. Icing on a cake is a screen where it offers you to lower the difficulty. I played on Hard and was against 3 Bulls with just 6 shotgun shells while laughing my head off. Imagine my reaction when I've seen that screen?... 

Thanks for the Soundtrack, but I have no interest in this buggy game. You want to play a shooter that's not half-assed? Play Doom Eternal. You'll love that chainsaw too after playing Sam 4.
