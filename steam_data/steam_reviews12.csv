2019-01-16,0,0,66,False,Recommended,I have mixed feelings about this game. While there is no problem in casual because the results don't really matter the ranked really has some issues.First of all it is very confusing.How i thought it worked was that when you win a game you go division up otherwise you go down a division.However i played games when i needed to win 2 times in order to get a division up but if i lost just once i go immediately division down. Idk if this is a bug or not but if it's not it should be properly explained. Secondly the skills matchmaking really has some major flaws. I played lots of ranked matches lately and there were 2 main situations 1) me and my teammate are actually very good and we destroy the other team with 6 02) my teammate can't get over 100 points (no goal no save no clearance etc.) and i am forced to try to carry him and fail against two guys who can cooperate and end up losing 0 5.This matchmaking algorithm must be updated ASAP since i have lots of clearly unbalanced matches.Also in ranked matches there should be the same algorithm as in casual adding an ai player instead of the player who left( whether he was a ****head or because server problems) so the ranked matches wouldn't be unfair. 2v1 is unfair 3v1 is overkill. Speaking of server problems if someone quits a ranked match and it's not 1v1 then the function to reenter the same match is more or less pointless simply because 2v1 is so unfair( recently it happened to me we were 1 0 the server made me disconnect then we recconect it was 5 2 for the other team and we end up losing the match AND going division down).If the person whose teammate left the ranked match if he wasn't given an ai to play with he should not in any circumstation go down a division because after all it was not his fault.Right now i am a bit heated because of this problems which i recently faced however because this game is so fun to play and it's an unique concept i give it a generous 8/10.,Rocket League®
2018-08-17,0,0,462,False,Not Recommended,Many thanks to Psyonix! I had an interrupted internet connection that forced me to minimize the game and re connect to the Internet. After doing this the message indicated that the match was over and the next attempt to enter the match received a 3 time ban in a row within 3 days for 24 hours due to accidental transfer of the cable from the Internet. Only regrets spending 412 hours in this game.Ps You have great servers in the game ... zero delays!,Rocket League®

2016-11-26,0,0,498,False,Not Recommended,Match making is a ing joke. You will most likely get connected to the 0 4 match with 25sec left or even tho it has so ing massive playerbase you will play with/against bots. Recently they are more focused on adding hilarious pass thing than on fixing the game.Many updates later (including the one enabling the absolute cross play between every single platform) it still remains exactly the same.,Rocket League®

2017-02-27,0,0,1772,False,Not Recommended,i dont recommend this game for several reasons even though its probably one of the most entertaining games i have played.1. terrible matchmaking. i'm C3 GC in ranked. if you are sick of ranked and want to play to move away from the toxicity in ranked then the casual mode has nothing to offer to you. most of the people who play this game tend to shut down their brain completely. they cut you off block your shots pass the opponents and when you call them out to relax and play a bit more thoughtful they get mad. 2. horrible community. no matter what you do turn off chat completely. you dont need it and it will help you keep your sanity in the long run. worst of all it turns new players off. some of the worse most disgusting scum of the surface of this planet play this game and the report system is a joke. racists and bigots simply bypass the report system by just putting a dot between the racial slurs. how do i know that? well i have several proof that even people with more than 40 reports in a few days won't get banned. 3. ofcourse if all of this isnt enough to turn you off how about some juicy server lag? i have a top of the line computer and an adequate connection that allows me to play most online game with 8 16ms ping but not in rocket league.you see the devs have completely shifted their focus on crates and try to minimize their cost as much as they possibly can. a year ago my ping in rocket league was 8 20ms and now i can be happy if i reach 44ms. 4. progression in this game is not rewarding at all. its completely tied to RNG and lootcrates. there are some individuals that i know who pay 200 bucks every single month to waste on this crate system.5. dead content galore. nobody touches the other modes because the most popular mods as of right now are 2v2 ( which the game wasnt designed for and pros play it because finding a 3v3 match takes too long ) and 3v3.,Rocket League®

2016-05-31,0,0,996,False,Not Recommended,"As someone who has spent wasted plenty of his precious lifetime on that awasome (looking) competitive game I really wish I could recommend you this game.Pros Really unique and well handled genre with smooth gameplay and graphics (At least) playable server quality with bearable ping &amp bugs most of the time It is soccer It has cars in it Cars carry fancy hats &amp paint jobs You can (temporarily) fly Allowance of up to 3 person parties even in ranked (except Standart Solo (3v3)) Quite steep but also significantly rewarding learning curve (of advanced techniques and strategies)Cons Physics engine struggling to catch up with the gameplay tempo (even if rarely it is a problem) Even the nicest guys/ladies you may ever know (obviously not me after daring to play ranked matches) can suddenly loose their and become a raging bull seeking justice for his completely not fairly taken away rank after just managing to become MVP 10 games straight and still managing to lose them all and demote where he ""supposedly"" belongs. Reason to that? The main reason to thumbs down this game even beyond the bottom circle of the freaking hell and even further than our observable universe? Yes you guessed it right The soul stealing motivation draining and suicide supportive community of this game full of literal crybabies trolls quiters and probably some of saltiest buffalo talking even after getting roasted multiple times served beside none of any common sense sportsmanship or respect. Not every single player personally but in fact the wast majority of their ""target audition"" honestly don't deserve to play at any single competitive or ranked branch even in any similar genre (football and racing included) after a legit qualification or mandatory tutorial that is actually demanding you to ing learn the ing basics and strategies of the gameplay (which is non existent).Conclusion This game is in fact brilliant and really deserves its 2016 Game Developers Choice Award but without anybody playing.I personally nominate the majority of its community for the 2016 Saltiest Aluminum Shitfull Trashcan AwardNotification for devs It would be wonderful if you were to consider the actual functionality of your penalty/report systems that are currently not doing any equitable damage to quiters/offensives/trolls. Penalty for just rage quiting without any essential or emergent reasons are not punished well and those are continiously damaging the ones actually passionate about ranking up. About the offensiveness of behaviour and language I actually think it should truly and directly effect ones rank and earned success by having confirmed reports of offensiveness leading to penalties such as instant demotion or temporary/permanent muting alongside with a tag indicating what one have done wrong/inappropriate. Both possibilities in my oppinion are enough to reduce a solid amount of saltiness.I only tried to play this game so hard because it is literally the only piece of its football/racing(sort of) combined genre.",Rocket League®

2019-01-31,0,0,2,False,Recommended,Just played for 2 hours and I cannnot recommend it enough!! I went into it thinking it'd be okay something to just pass the time but then I just played the tutorial...and played the next level...and then played a match...sucked...and immediately played another one. And another one. And 2 hours later I've bought a season pass because heck yes I'll spend 10 bucks to make my car cooler and I have to pry myself away because my fingers hurt.There's something absolutely wonderful about playing Rocket League. It's such a silly concept so goofy and yet so technical. But at the same time even trash like me can have loads of fun just racing around trying to even hit the ball. And the moment I got my first goal man that was satisfying. I just remembered I forgot to save a replay of it though.

Customisation is on point everything is well balanced great controller support passive aggressive quickchat and the Rocket Pass adds to the game in a good way. Only part that really needs improvement is the quickplay matchmaking I often get placed in games which are 5 0 on the losing team because someone got salty and left (I'd like to see the matchmaking act in a similar way to competitive). Which sort of leads me to my next point toxic players everywhere fortunately the devs let you know when someone you've reported has suffered punitive action so they are very responsive. Scammers are also about lost my Dissolver and a bunch of other stuff to one a while ago be careful when you're trading with other players is all I can say I was stupid enough to fall for it and learned a hard lesson don't be me. I also sort of miss the old system when opening a crate when it would look like a slot machine I can understand why they moved away from it given last year's controversy with gambling in gaming.

2018-04-10,0,0,119,False,Recommended,RocketLeauge is an amazing game with outstanding physics and beautiful design. It is a fun game to play and hang out with freinds. Rocket Leauge's amazing customization ranges from gamemodes to techniques to designs. The custom games provide a variety of different mutators that give the player his/her power of what they want. You can use the options to adjust the veiws graphics and controls you want to the perfect point. Last but not least the car customization it is my favorite part of the game simply because of the choices ( I sometimes can not choose because of the immense options.) which sold it for me the first time i saw it. But the one thing I dont like about the game is that you have to pay for the keys in order to unlock the crates. Itt gets me a bit upset when I receive a crate after playing a game just to find out i can only open it if i pay $1.49 just for a single key. But then once every three months or so there are these amzing events that i just love. you can get verything from crates to decryptors trails boosts decals wheels toppers and way more. All accesible to you if you play the game. You earn a random ammount of event currency after every game while said event is live it ranges from about 2 to 11. and most event items avalible for event currency are between 15 to 50 where you can buy these items to dec out your ride you can even earn crates and decryptors!

This is a good game and it's only going to be enjoyable if you have friends to play it with. God help you if you play by yourself. The people that play this are generally toxic very few people to be found here who aren't complately terrible.Don't play casual. It's filled with bots people just leaving their cars there some of these bots are programmed to jump every so often or drive around in circles to avoid being kicked off. I've seen a few bots in competitive as well but not nearly as much. And it's sad that competitive is the only way to play because that's where people are the most toxic. Don't type in chat don't show any shred of anger else someone who is either petty or just thin skinned (or both) reports you for harassment. Even just trying to give tips gets you reported by those types.Just don't play it. You're not welcome here you never will be. If you're not godly at it from the start you just get dumped on. No matter how hard you're trying. I only play because I have a couple friends to play this with and that makes my experience slightly less dismal. But for gods sake just consider playing something else if you're reading reviews trying to gauge whether it's worth it.PS just another game that decided to be riddled with microtransactions.

WELL LOOK NO FURTHER MY FRIEND as you can probably tell from the inordinate amount of play time I have on this game its safe to say this is one of the most infuriating games i have ever played simply que any of the online multiplayer options and prepare yourself for 5 minutes of pure agonising hell. Now you may be wondering what to expect from said option... heres a list A composition of the most disfunctional teammates that have never passed a ball in their life The same team of subordinates ramming into you whenever you get close to the ball Yet again those same teammates then complaining at you for not hitting the ball 5 minutes of talking directed at you from your same teammates again Terrible connection to most servers more lag then i care to admit rubberbanding losses due to horrible rubber banding rubbish items from crate drops getting matched against teir 1 champions when you just started the game a hate for everything and everyone around you a slow burning hate already inside you gets magnified 10 fold contemplation of getting some sort of tracker to track your teammates down to find out where the live finding your teammates IRL 25 years in prison for murder thats just some of the features im sure there are more things to list but in all honesty i have just given up all hope and reason for playing this game anymore.,Rocket League®

2019-01-30,0,0,36,False,Recommended,I've been playing Rocket League since late 2015 this was around when the game came out i was at my friends house and we were playing PS4 he mentioned that he had gotten a new game. Rocket League. I thought it was gonna be some crappy FPS game he opened it we were greeted by the theme mmmmmmmm that delicious theme song and we played for like 8 hours on end. like all pro gamers i was exeptinally good at the game. Anyway with Psyonix pumping out mew competitive seasons every 3 ish months theres always new content being added. not necessarily just on the comp updates Rocket league has the winter summer fall and spring updates. In conclusion great game would reccomend. not free though around 20.00 dollars not expensive. Unless youre poor of course.,Rocket League®

If you're someone who has friends that are really good and are always playing and you don't think you can be that serious or you aren't that serious then this review is for you.This game is still fun if you're super casual about. There's a high ceiling cap for skill but that's not a bad thing honestly. Have friends to play with? Get in there and mess around. Don't have friends? Well I can say that I still have some good fun just turning on some tunes and playing for a few hours all alone. Sometimes you'll pull off some crazy stunt and get a goal and that feeling of ""Maybe i'm not terrible"" really lifts you for about an hour.That being said Rocket League rules this gaming niche and for a good reason. I recommend giving it a try if you're curious and grabbing it especially if on sale. It's a good way to kill a few hours.tl drPut ball in goal 8/10 for casual play.",Rocket League®

2016-12-28,0,0,1012,False,Not Recommended,Casual snow day getting obliterated is the worst game 'update' I've ever experienced. Doubt I'd play the game again even if it's someday brought back. Zero faith in this developer.Ranked Solo drop in now usually senseless quick rematch to shuffle play with the same group of players / gone (leading to much longer wait times) having to disable chat just to avoid the heaps of toxic banter things that were not an issue in casual are enjoyment killing in ranked. Obliterating casual obliterated the reason I purchased the game. Just not as engaging as other games in my library now.I played casual at very random times day and night and never ever had any problems with matches filling.

2019-02-05,0,0,859,False,Recommended,Never reviewed a game on steam before this but I can't deny that they somehow made the best game ever. As far as replay ability and a literally infinite skill cap this game will be one I go back to forever. Also as terrible as you feel when you are playing online you really are only half as terrible at you feel. ) ')Also yes the community can be sarcastic and impatient with you sometimes but honestly people respond really well to positive people in this game. So just go for it and the rush of hitting your first aerial will come back over and over as you advance and actually begin to do things on purpose. 20 bucks. 11.99 as I am writing this. Cannot find a better multiplayer.10/10,Rocket League®

2019-01-03,0,0,206,False,Recommended,SO this is my second review ever and honestly I'm glad it's this game. Rocket league is the first game I ever got more than 100 hours on and I'm proud to join the great community and be a part of something more. Honestly I may have went a little crazy but once the amount of hours said 100 hours I bought nearly every dlc and bought the game for one of my friends. That's how much I love this game. I play it daily and never get bored. I'm willing to spend over a years worth of game time on this masterpiece (8760 hours in total). Thank you Psyonix for this game but for what I'm saying it might seem like there is nothing I hate about it. Well recently they made an update to where opening crates is a lot less exciting and it just kinda ruins the whole experience of opening a crate for me. Please fix it back because for it being slightly faster I don't get the adrenaline that I would get if I saw what I could've had. It's weird I know but I miss it. That's pretty much it. Thank you so much for this game and hopefully other people start playing this and become addicted like I did.,Rocket League®

Gameplay which is easy to learn but hard to master. Takes a while to learn but feels rewarding once you do.No micro transactions excluding keys for lootboxes (although loot boxes are really rare and aren't intrusive) and the ability to buy special skins like the Fast and furious packs Jurrasic park Jeep Wrangler and classic cars (from the prequel) for a good price. Can be played casually or competitevly can be fun both ways. Cons Some toxic players (expected in any game). Lag can be... frusturating. Great game. Better than any AAA game released be EA or activision.,Rocket League®

2019-02-06,0,0,22,False,Recommended,You wonder if you should buy this?Well if you are a male gamer then you will see The two statisticly most interesting things for men out there.Or in short CARS and SOCCER!I myself do not like soccer even that much I have never been to a game and I rarely view.Though this soccer based racing battle is THE single most addictive game I have in my library.And I own more than 200 Games. Well on steam anyway.A downer might be that the DLCs cost kinda lot of money for in my opinion a little too few extras. Which are all just cosmetic but for me that is the good point. No pay to win.I did buy Rocket League on sale so for me it is worth spending a little extra on a few (in my case two) DLCs to improve the Fun. (I drive the Batmans tank (The dark knight) and it s just awesome crushing your enemies)Furthermore you can pay to open chests that drop sometimes. Ten Keys (about nine bucks) will also bring you premium which gives you a drop every level not just irregularly.Well the controls as well as the gameplay are pretty easy to adapt though the jumping/flying is kinda tricky to handle at first. I am a quick learner so today in the middle of my first week after purchase I am getting the hang of it.So in conclusion I would prefer you this immersive Soccer Racing Game even if you are a CasualGamer like me.,Rocket League®

2019-02-08,0,0,78,False,Recommended,What i love about rocket league is its uniqueness. A game where you play football with cars sounds promising but the devs pull it off really well. The gameplay is fast and addicting and the game can last you hundreds of hours. The game obviously is best played with friends where you can have hours of fun messing about but playing solo can also be fun as you can do 1v1s which are extremely tense. The shere amount of gamemodes and maps to play on is outstanding and it will keep the game fresh every time you come back on.The different cars and customisations you can get are great for different playstyles. YOu could have a car with a huge hitbox or a small car that is more agile. The asthetics on the cars are super fun to unlock and equip to your car. Some of the rarer skins arent too hard to get as i have several of them and trading is a huge part of this game. Some of the cute hats or hats that refrence other games are a cool addition too. Finally the matchmaking is very quick and you can go on practice mode while searching. The custom games are also super quick and easy to make and there are little to no connection errors or glitches while playing.Overall this game has loads of content and its cheap so get your friends to buy it (doesnt matter what platform as it is cross platform) and mess about on custom games or play seriously on competative.,Rocket League®

2019-02-07,0,0,493,False,Recommended,"OH BOI Have I been putting reviewing RL off to the side for the longest time now and heres why. I have a sorta love hate relationship with this game. On one hand I am ALWAYS spending more money on DLC and I traded from nothing to a 43 (keys) as of rn with the trading community. I love this game it combines my two favourite things soccer and cars. (All the haters gonna say hockey well I got 2 rinks in my town of 700ish people I live in canada I breath hockey). It had been my dream since SARPBC for a Supercar to be in the game and I finally got one around 4 years down the road (Mclaren). That brings me to the other hand. This is why I hate that I keep coming back (call me a salty kid idc) is not a problem with the game it's because I played SARBC waaaaay back before this game was a thing. Like by a year or so and I wished I had a computer when RL was in alpha so I could get those alpha items. A few years (I couldn't even run RL cuz I was so dumb I didn't know you could change visuals and window size) I could play it. I started playing instead of being ahead of everyone behind in skill and I climbed in 1v1 from silver 2 Diamond 1 as of rn. I even have proof of me playing SARBC I have replays dating back to late 2015! Well I can't say it's at all a bad game I love it and if you like cars and sports and are going to put in the effort to NOT get stomped online and put up with the toxic gold's plat's etc. Pick it up it's great and you can get it on a sale. My one thing I still wish Psyonix would add is the ""Rocket Labs"" texture or environment to be an option for competitive stages JUST THE ENVIRONMENT/TEXTURE so my computer could handle it better and would be able to peek 30fps when playing with friends. Even said Rocket League you will always have a special place in my heart. CrazyWS",Rocket League®

This wonderful game that brings hours of fun and entertainment is completely ruined by people who are overly serious. They swear at you and act like you're a moron. It really messes with the overall feeling of rocket league and really pushes you to the point of raging... however I realised that it doesn't really matter and that I won't let salty people influence the way I see the game.

2019-02-10,0,0,481,False,Recommended,With almost 500 hours of gameplay put into this game I think it's time for a review.I bought this game years ago now and I am still playing it and am far from getting bored of it. Rocket League is one of those games you can play for a few months and then stop playing knowing you will come back to play it again in a few months time. Sure it's pretty much the same thing match after match but every match plays out and ends differently. The game is built on a lot of skill knowledge and skill of mechanics and co operation rather than luck. If you do have some friends to play with even on other platforms it's even more entertaining to play with them creating your own clubs and climbing your way up the ranks. The almost endless looks you can put on your cars (which doesn't affect your skill) really adds to the game because who doesn't want to look good and score in style right? There are however some negatives that do come with this game which really annoy me. Let's start with the community.Yes.. It's toxic. Very toxic.Unfortunately the player base of the game is built on kids and teenagers hot headed ones at that and sometimes Online Matches are not so pleasant because of this. Ranked Matches are even worse. Loot boxes or crates are also a present although they can be opened rarely for free with some Decryptors that can be earnt for free. Again these only hold customisable items for your car and do not directly affect gameplay. Overall I highly recommend this game especially if you have a small group of friends to play with. Quick matches and can be played by the casual gamer or the more dedicated serious gamer. A game I always come back to again and again.,Rocket League®

And with support of the Early access community using the F8 feature in game and giving constructive feedback. Ended up with an absolute masterpiece I consider the best game in it's genre.This company is honest about the state of the game at it's release it does not pay streamers to make it seem more playable than it was like Atlas did. This company is known to work hard work at a good pace and produce a finished product that is nothing short of amazing.If you play Below Zero at the time of writing this review you might fall through the world you will deffinitely experience bugs... This is not a ""Here is 3 hours of polished gameplay have fun with it while we make the rest""This is early access being used by a honest company being done the right way.Get in for an early access price and help give feedback to influence this games creation.

SO YOU NEED TO DO THIS.while in game press F8 and then press F3 (not at the same time) there are some graphical settings there. MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF CLOUDS. IT DOUBLED MY FPD AND MADE IT SMOOTHER. From there even I was able to turn up textures and other settings and i was still fine. CLOUDS NEEDS TO BE TURNED OFF,Subnautica: Below Zero
2019-01-30,14,553,2,True,Recommended,Honestly fantastic. The classic subnautica released to early access and has grown into a very complete and well made game. Take this game early access is releasing at imo an even better state than compared how the original did. I can see this game being taken very far and I am very curious to see how it will turn out. The artic setting is beautiful and even though the food fish and crafting items seem to be very similar it seems to breath in a completely new life to the game. Great stuff,Subnautica: Below Zero
2019-02-01,5,209,5,True,Recommended,"Subnautica is not a game for everyone to be sure. There are no guns. It does not hold your hand and tell you explicitly where to go or what you should be doing. You often wonder ""Am I doing the right thing?"" while you swim around exploring the beautiful world barely caring one way the other. What Unknown Worlds have done is create a living breathing world that you are sad to leave when it's over. When it concluded I felt richer for the experience but a little dimmer. I wished to go back in time and experience the game for the first time again. Then came Below Zero and my wish was granted! This is not just another biome or a small DLC. This is a sequel or at least it will be. Obviously it's in VERY early access and much of the game is still in development. Don't think of this as a bad thing think of it as keeping you from devouring this incredible experience all in one sitting. Help the devs make the game. Be a part of the community. In certain spots in the game you'll see a message from the devs asking for community suggestions and input. Very rarely will a video game give you fun and make you feel happiness like this. As for the quality of the game it's already promising. The color palate is slightly less vibrant. There's now more voice acting. But you get the same sense of wonder over the environment and the feeling that the story is much more than just ""don't die."" Definitely a steal at $20.",Subnautica: Below Zero

It was barebones and look what it became after all the testing of the community and developers!? All the negative reviews are written by people who don t understand the bigger picture. You get to assist in the development of the game. In its early access state I give the game a solid 10/10.,Subnautica: Below Zero

2019-01-31,0,0,7,True,Recommended,After playing for seven hours I can say that everything that the devs have been saying is accurate. There is about two hours of story content in the January version of the game and around five complete underwater biomes for you to find and explore. I found that I was still finding blueprints and new creatures even after four hours of gameplay. I never experienced a game breaking bug but you are undoubtebly going to come across a few small bugs considering this is the earliest version of this game. If you loved the first game I would highly recommend picking this game up because it's more of what made the first game so great. New biomes new creatures new technology and a whole new story that expands on the first game.,Subnautica: Below Zero
2019-01-30,6,132,3,True,Recommended,Right now it is an arctic less complete subnautica. Not everything is added yet actually there are only a couple of biomes. Nothing is really on the ice and most of the story isn't here yet. Has borrowed some things from subnautica like some fauna and if you are in creative mode you can build the original vehicles. It is everything you would expect from an early access game. When it is complete however it will most likely be the most terrifying experience anybody could have from a survival game. I'd say just get it now since it is cheaper than at launch play it for yourself mess around and test the game. (Just note that this game is VERY incomplete. Some items don't have textures or even models. The game right now doesn't actually have a lot of new things however there is weather ability to name and change the color of bases.),Subnautica: Below Zero
2019-01-31,4,49,3,True,Recommended,"NOTE If you're reading this and you haven't played the original ""main"" Subnautica game you will be far better off playing that first and then coming back to this later. Early Access Review date 30/1/2019 ***SPOILER FREE***If you played the original game this appears to be the best parts of that with a fresh lick of paint and some new story beats. The story elements currently in the release last about two hours and are VERY SPOILERY if you haven't played Subnautica yet. The characters introduced seem interesting and the player character has a nice dynamic with their counterpart on the orbiting space station. You could consider the first hour or so MAJOR SPOILERS for the first game so try not to watch any videos of Below Zero either until you've caught up.The new lifeforms and biomes are BEAUTIFUL although currently there appears to only be 3 biomes that appear at least to be finished.In short you're buying this to help the development team financially or to squash bugs glitches and suggest changes you will enjoy your time here. I would say however that there isn't a lot of content here that is complete so if you're looking to buy a finished game you will need to wait 9 18 months if development progresses well before you will most likely be able to play a ""complete"" story.",Subnautica: Below Zero

2018-05-21,61,1426,6,False,Recommended,Hi there I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.For the record I am not really fond of pvp like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason as you all know is for the green discount mark made by Fatty G (Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell) for another part of the reason is about the topic that I am going to address.First we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent s most famous products. (For you guys who don t you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view I d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ so that makes a billion letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So basically video game is its most heated debating part.There are still a lot of Chinese people however spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason from my humble understanding relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations At companies we compete for higher salaries At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up) As a result winners are few and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word most but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on) like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18 it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they ve seen the bad comments which means a monopoly is happening here right? Steam is like a shadow region in China so literally it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online you should know that it is a game that is for free to play but costs to win. You ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean it is still OK if you pay for skins right? But since it is a FPS competitive game I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online you pay for faster cars to beat other players And Naruto Online you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.And now Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry They are worried about whether they will be region locked They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections please feel free to discuss.,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege
2018-01-18,87,1022,113,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This is for the people who brought the starter edition... like me.If you brought the starter edition your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12 500 renown each. So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.For the attacking team Sledge If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget. Thermite One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage. His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a BIG ING HOLE on reinforced walls. Though to create that hole you have to make sure you stay alive the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...Thatcher Thatcher is your main man. One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls. With Thatcher all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.Ash She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox. Her gadget is breaching things from afar pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface. Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...Twitch Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list. Her ability isn't that special basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets. However her F2 a variant of the Famas shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.And now for the defending teamRook He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor. That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death. The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...Bandit Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact. Also his MP7 is known as a god tier gun being incredibly easy to use. Did I also mention he had to deal DRUGS?Jager Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main. To be honest though there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is. His gagdet may not be that useful at times having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking. Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs. Smoke He's simple but somewhat hard to use. See an enemy trying to get in? Block him out with gas. That's why he's called Smoke. He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in. WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?Mute He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls. He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields barbed wire and reinforced walls. He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon. Honorable MentionsHibana She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite. Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls. She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times. She's a DLC character so she will cost 25 000 renown. So do I recommend the game?Absolutely. Even if you buy the starter edition all it really means is that it will take more time and patience. Siege has a huge learning curve but once you get through it you will be hooked. I hope this review helped took me a while but I just wanted to share my thoughts.,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege

2017-06-18,40,1225,200,False,Recommended,Description Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters mixing it together into a tactical objective based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through. Pros + Over 30 operators to choose from based on real life counter terrorism units each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft even 1.5 years after the game s release.+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other simply running and gunning will only get you so far+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips everything will change weapon behavior.+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.+ A fair use of micro transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in game currency.+ You just can t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.+ Maps are free for everyone it doesn t matter if you bought the season pass or not everyone can play together.+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.+ Music is fitting the game s tone very well you just don t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all. Cons Lag compensation netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future) Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity. Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode. Unlocking operators with in game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter. Conclusion While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it s predecessors I think it s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4 Insurgency and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings be aware of your enemies abilities and a strong emphasis on teamwork.Enjoyed this review?

2016-12-14,24,720,2062,False,Recommended,"Man I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!I was in the Closed Alpha Beta 2 of the Technical Tests and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha 3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays) Updated January 3 2018 Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88 000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time clearing rooms and communicating with your Team. Defending a position flanking enemy attackers etc.People compare this game to CoD run and gun a lot which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun I hear their *thump thump thump* from so far away I can easily wallbang them (AKA Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area outside or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. CSGO players will compare it but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)Now that you have a ""general"" idea of what this game is about I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know). Toxic Players Generally speaking most of the playerbase is quite nice but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow that won't be as prominent to some and if they get on your nerves Mute button is there to use. However find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.Teamkilling A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.Cheating If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However since the addition of Battleye there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might ""think"" of a person is hacking people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender and if that person gets another account from the same computer Battleye can block them or watch them closely to ban again.Pay2Win I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls While he can make things easier he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.Teamkicked By Squads Another thing that's been popping up from time to time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to ""check"" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.Spawnkilling This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best ""peaking"" for killing people and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know but if your going into competitive this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. Running Outside To kill Another ""Game Knowledge"" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door be very very careful of people running out to kill you or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside if you have a decent headset on you'll hear that ""CRASH"" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize you'll get the hang of it! I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!Update on January 3rd Here we are 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz along with general improvements to ping and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015 2016. We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei Zofia and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios with the ability to help pinpoint enemies and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined but currently she's doing fine.Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the ""Ash 2.0"" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao /) Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's ""in that room"" but not ""where in that room"" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.Apparently Ubisoft is working on something called ""Operation Outbreak""....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer or heck improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems Tachanka.Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret but alas there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.That's it for the January 2018! I hope you have a better idea of the game its pros and cons and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!If you want me to answer some questions feel free to leave a comment.",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege
2018-11-20,30,539,614,False,Recommended,A.) I love this game I have a lot of fun playing this game. I recomond it.B.) My main point this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood slot machines the stripper neon sign and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion. If you are reading this and you wrote a negetive review purly because of this please take it down now that operation censorship has been cancelled.,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege
2016-06-03,34,631,259,False,Recommended,"EDIT The ""Starter Edition"" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear There is no difference between ""starter players"" and ""regular players"" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else play on all the same maps and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. To explain how your Starter game would begin I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are ""free"" and included in patches the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. Everything you do in the game earns you Renown which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12 000 renown to purchase an operator while regular players only need about 2 000. Ubisoft calls this ""grinding"" to reach 12 000 but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like ""grinding"" to reach anything the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said I know that in game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.If there's to be things to unlock I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9 10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition I earned enough Renown to purchase an ""on sale"" at 7 500 with a few thousand left over. The ""grinding"" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown and there's at least one operator ""on sale"" in rotation every week. Here's the thing though operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.I want to address the issue of the ""full price for only multiplayer"" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT 2k4 Quake 3 Arena etc.) especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a ""campaign"" the addition of a high budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single player content does in fact do. There are 10 ""situations"" each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills gadgets and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co op Terrorist Hunt as a ""lone wolf"" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future the game already has deadly bots for other single player content and the possibility is definitely there.Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The ""time to die"" is extremely fast with 1 3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.It might be a slow pace at times but it causes a white knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.The port (if it even is a port) is excellent offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low end to high end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub pixel aliasing and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4 offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.This is also the first time that I've had to ""deal with"" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game a minor annoyance at worst for me.So that was a of words and I might sound like I'm gushing but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.",Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six® Siege

Each planet offering full re playability which offers hours of fun on its own. every planet Unique and amazing on their own with massive and immersive cave systems all of which is spaced out in a believable way due to the size of each planet. Space exploration is Visually captive However framerate is a major issue when taking off landing and coming into orbit of planets. Crafting is broken in to small easy to understand parts that come together to make a functioning system for bulding bases that i personally love.

Not just in a fanboy type of sense this game even in EA manages to be FAIRLY solid even in it's current state. Sure it may get a bit boring and you might run out of things to do but even after a small break you will still be drawn back to this game. The game in my opinion is best played in short bursts if you don't play with friends. The devs seem to know what they're doing and they started adding more content at a steadier rate which helpsThis game is pretty fun but it still isn't perfect PROS Nice visuals Unique planets Fun exploration Fairly challenging Lots of content Fun to repeat Overly addictive Gives a feeling of excitement Alright soundtrack Nice artstyle Still having content progressively added (EA)CONS The art style is different to the style pre launch which I prefer to the current style Content is added in a pretty slow rate Severe frame drop during takeoff and landing with spacecraft Gets repetitive after a few hours Performance issues (my pc is a mouldy potato) (slowly improving anyway) Seems like not enough for $20 Not enough character customisation (apparently coming soon) Too many bugs (improving)EDIT 1 So as I mentioned that my pc is not very good and that the performance may be an issue but I managed to recently fix the problem by looking in the game files so the game runs without any problemsHere's a video I found with instructions https //www.youtube.com/watch?v Oe2MMQjMrmAEDIT 2 So after a recent update the devs added a graphical options menu that helped improve the performance so you don't need to go into the engine.Overall pretty fun game thats still getting better 8.5/10,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,54,True,Recommended,After playing a couple of hours this game is most certainly worth the $20. I enjoyed exploring the large cave systems that contained not only an abundent amount of reasources but also contained mysteries inside the caves. Base building is simple and reasource gathering is not that of a struggle compared to No Man's Sky. Music and visuals were very impressive. And what I liked about this game is the exploration itself as you can travel to many different worlds that contained many different resources and ecology. But there were some bugs and glitches on the way especially with the vehicles. And after playing alot of time on this game I reached the end of it as there was no new planets to discover nothing new to build and nothing else to research. But this is a Pre Alpha so I'll give it a pass. With that said there will be bug fixing and more content in the game like proper multiplayer/co op economy system lifeforms ecology hazards survival aspects (food/water) story element ect. If you enjoy base building or survival games like Subnatica or Planetbase do buy Astroneer. For the other people that wants to buy Astroneer but is not sure wether to buy it or not I would still recomend this game and wait for more content to be released and keep up to date with news articles and notes.Final score 9/10Final note It's way better than No Man's Sky. ),ASTRONEER

2017-12-29,35,134,20,True,Recommended,What a rollercoaster of a game.Starting the game I realise half way down the drop pod is controllable and manage to pilot down onto a brownish patch of dirt. There are no instructions nor any tutorial messages I am completely confused. In this regard it is reminiscent of my first play through of The Long Dark. I puzzle out the extractor tool and resources and somehow manage to create two Research Centers and some tethers. Feeling confident I decide to try and reach a mountain in the distant haze. The first storm hits and shortly thereafter the brief foray towards the mountain ends. While fleeing before the storm my Astroneer is struck down by a block to the back of the helmet.Respawn. Inserting what seems like dozens of gathered items into the Research Centers I learn to make a container and discover the wonder that is additive terraforming. The next twenty minutes is spent building a perfect wall around the meagre base it includes a horizontal lip at the top of the wall to prevent blocks rolling over. I turn my Astroneer's attention to base expansion and build a smelter and mineral extractor. Delving underground I discover that both copper and aluminium minerals can be found and smelted allowing the creation of small solar panels which untether research from the tyranny of organic powered generators.The second storm hits I retreat to my walled base to wait out the storm. A block from the sky caves in my Astroneer's face.Respawn. Spend a further thirty minutes building a roof over the now larger base with extended tunnel entrances to prevent the ingress of errant blocks. It is a master piece of engineering that has blocked out the sun preventing my solar panels from functioning. I take a moment to admire the sunlight mechanic and in a flurry of resin expand my base outside the cave to reach the glorious sun. I appreciate that a moon or planet orbits directly over my base as does the sun.Further expeditions are made underground and research items are found leading to further discoveries including the fact that standing too close to a 'plant' while digging it up leads to instant death. Respawn. A hundred tethers are expended and research items are laboriously leap frogged back to the ever churning Research Centers though the number of bytes obtained is distressingly slender. A crisis of faith occurs after hours of effort to grind bytes I start to feel the grind is not worthwhile. To change it up I decide to work towards an alternate to the endless conversion of hand mined soil to resources for research. Samples of resources are gathered and stored.I log off for the night.A trade post is researched and constructed. The merchant princes of the space station become rich off of the fruits of my Astroneer's labour as Aluminium is exchanged for samples of Malachite Titanium and Lithium to allow the now dual Mineral Extractors to churn out all possible resources. Medium Solar Panels and Small Wind Turbines now power the Research Centers. More soil is collected by hand and extracted into resources to fuel the ever present hunger for bytes leading to the eventual discovery of both the Medium Rover and 1 Seat. The final back breaking toil leads to the discovery of the Crane Drill Head and Medium Storage.A two Rover mining wagon greatly increases mining output storms are no longer a pressing threat following the construction of a fully enclosed vehicle bay and the ever present beacon that point to home.A chance discovery of two 6000 byte research items leads to a golden age of technology. Amongst the bounty of research are The Large Rover and Large Storage. A three Rover wagon train is constucted which will facilitate a new level of strip mining and over land foraging operation. The first wagon is equipped with a medium solar panel that charges the three Rover batteries during the day allowing for 24 x 7 movement a large storage for securing research items and a 1 Seat for wagon train control. Securely behind the lead wagon is the storage wagon carrying a pair of Large Storage with a mix of Medium Storage and Containers. Finally there is a Crane/Drill Head car with independent 1 Seat and Medium Storage allowing for both coupled and uncoupled mining. Hungry for bytes I direct the wagon train towards the horizon seeking to plunder downed space craft mineral deposits and plant borne research items. Disaster strikes. A storm materialises in the valley between the wagon train and base. I do what any sane wagon pilot would do I panic and flee randomly before the storm and plunge into a canyon. The storm passes and at this time I realise that Beacon research would have been a clever idea. I can no longer see the beacon for my base and am stuck in a deep canyon.I resolve to exit the canyon and re locate the base beacon I can survive indefinitely thanks to the ample batteries of my wagon train and the Medium Solar Panel and if I can avoid being killed by a storm I should eventually be able to locate my base. Exiting the canyon takes three days of digging and driving but eventually I exit into a mountainous region. I realise I am hopelessly lost and that I may as well plunder as many space craft as I can find while I search for my base. Five game days have passed and I am now adept at avoiding or flanking the storm but am no closer to finding my base. Though I am now rich with Titanium Lithium and have a full load of research items I decide to surrender to my fate and walk into the storm to respawn anew. While I await the storm I recall that what I decided was a moon orbits directly over my base. Reasoning that if I drive to and follow its orbit I should eventually locate the dome and vehicle hangar I drive with renewed purpose.I have travelled for a further two days and am now following the orbit of the moon but can go no further as my path is blocked by a deep canyon sided by two steep mountains. I will have to go back... Unless... I build a bridge. Building the bridge takes half a day it is barely wide enough for the wagon train but I hope that it is enough as I start to edge the first of the Rovers onto the bridge. Luck is with me and I make it across and renew my journey. Finally I see the beacon of my base and return triumphant with the spoils of my journey and load up the Research Centers to garner enough bytes to learn how to make Beacons...I initially thought there would not be enough content for me to enjoy solo however it's been eighteen hours already and I haven't even started researching space craft or any of the associated technology. It was a really fun experience getting lost and deciding to try to find my way back and I really appreciate that the developers went to the trouble to include non technology related mechanics that allowed me to find my way back to my base.The terraforming is magnificent. The only thing I would change is I would improve the flattening tool such that it brings all ground around it level to the ground in the centre of the selector. As it stands I find it relatively confusing/useless.The under ground experience while initially fun becomes a tedious game of run tether run tether. I experimented with driving a wagon train of two Small Rovers under ground with a bunch of small batteries and a generator but it was made arduous by power management holes to lower caverns and object clearing so I abandoned that effort. The above ground experience is much more enjoyable and I love the vehicle train mechanic.Once you understand it the inventory mechanic in this game is great. I really enjoy the Medium Storage mechanics on large base structures.I find the friction in this game a little off for my tastes Ground vehicles behave as if the tires are clad in teflon and are extremely light weight and walking down slops can be a little absurd at times. And now I'm at the end of the review word limit!,ASTRONEER
2018-08-12,0,0,56,True,Recommended,Okay look I like this game its fun and really entertaining I just wish that there was more enemys . The game for me is wayyy too peaceful . I just hoped as updates went on there would be like aliens and cool bases which I understand maybe not have been what the game was aiming for but still I wish there was more danger then just plants oxygen and falling off big hills . Other than that I love this games mechanics and how they developed the game throughout the years.,ASTRONEER

This game is very beautiful and the dev team has done a very good job maintaining a simple low poly artstyle but still making it aestetic. This game already plays very well as an EA title.

2016-12-26,16,79,5,True,Recommended,Bought it and played it from installing until I had to leave for a meeting but I was late.A simple game to play with few controls but a very balanced system that forces you to explore and pay attention to the surroundings. Right now the focus is purely on mining and exploration more than anything else. There is some research that can be done in the game but it's randomly generated by the computer.I hope that the developers make some more complex bases space ships and the such in the future but the base game is solid and fun.,ASTRONEER

2018-08-15,0,0,105,True,Recommended,This game is absolutely amazing and has some of the best potential I've seen in a long time. Keep up the updates listen to the consumers and this game will definitely go places. I personally really want to see more survival aspects such as hunger and thirst. How about more organic life? Perhaps not intelligent but animals would be good. More danger more weather. As much as it sucks to die in a game it brings excitement to be worried about the possibility. Definitely recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,37,True,Recommended,I usually tend to stay clear of the nightmare of early access gameplay but after watching the astroneer developers stream I couldn't help but front the dough and install the game. I was amazed to find how smoothy it played considering that its still underdevelopment. With all the massive failures in the space sim department playing astroneer was a breath of filtrated air in the vaccum of this years empty promises. The game's survive and resource gathering focal points are well executed and lack the repetitive feeling that many other games of its kind tend to bring about. The modular systems also allow for a great degree of creativity and customization while exploring the various terrans at the players disposal. I look forward to this games finished product and I will be enjoying it as it is refined. TLDR 2016 was a year for space sims but the team behind astroneer saved me from pessimism with Polygon moonrocks.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,58,499,22,True,Recommended,The thing I love the most about this game is how I stayed on the first planet for 6 hours and when I finally had a shuttle I didn't want to leave it felt like home for me... so I didn't leave I continued to live on the planet.Well until I died by driving a truck of everything I had into a hole I didn't realise was really deep. Then I respawned with nothing but my ugly base and a space shuttle. And so I flew to a new planet...Unlike No Man's Sky where you just go to a planet for a few minutes then skidaddle you will grow attached to the planets. The animations are beautifully made and the gameplay is simple yet fun. There isn't a lot to do in this game at the moment but it has a bright future ahead of it!Also I paid 15.99 for this game and in 20 hours I'm still having fun meanwhile I paid 39.99 For No Man's Sky and got bored after 5 hours or so...,ASTRONEER

2017-12-03,0,0,106,True,Recommended,UPDATE Game is coming along very nicely. monthly or so updates add/change content and the graphics and proformance are getting better with each update. co op is great fun and sucks away hours without you noticing!Lovely game! Good fun and can be very rewarding. Nice to see the game grow with plenty of room for more content and features. music is coming along nicely and ambiant noise is great. Would love to see some more uses for the wrecks that are laying about on planets.Solor panels are great once you hook them up via the small truck to the base.. but prehaps say the larger sections of ship could also play a roll? maybe as a large Battery?Same as for the trees? if you manage to find a research node? on them once you remove it prehaps they could re grow? allowing you to harvest them over time??Either way big fan of Astroneer ),ASTRONEER

2018-03-31,0,0,190,True,Not Recommended,"I have about 100 hours of game time and overall I really like Astroneer. At first there were issues but the game was intact enough to make progress. An update came that improved certain things but broke others in such a way that ruined the game for me. Once you progress to a certain point there are certain things that are broken to a degree that make it frustrating to play. These broken elemants impede an ""upward"" trajectory of building your space kingdom. One of those things are the vehicles. I've posted in the bugs section of the official forums (https //forum.systemera.net) so I won't go into detail here. The result for me is I have stoppled playing Astroneer because of the irritation the bugs cause. Much of the enjoyment of the game is the exploration but the bugs make it tedious. At this point I log on to see if the bugs have been fixed and the reason I check is because I really would like to play. If these things ever get fixed you would probably really enjoy Astroneer but until then I'd hold off on purchasing just my 2 cents for those thinking about spending their money. If the devs fix the game definitely give it a go but until then I would not recommend buying.",ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,20,577,35,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. Astroneer is a planet and space exploration game with a mixture of crafting and survival elements on procedurally generated planets. It was finally released in Steam's Eearly Access in 16th December and I have been anxiously waiting for this game for a long time. When I saw the first pictures and trailers it instantly gave me the sense of freedom and exploration on a grand scale that I have been craving. And of course I have been very excited these past days when we all can finally set out to seek our destiny in this curious universum.As I'm writing this review the game is still in very early development stage and weird bugs and nasty surprises are bound to happen. I was fully aware of this and knew the current annoyances would not keep me from having fun!GameplaySo it all starts with you selecting your hero and landing down to an unexplored planet. Game briefly gives you couple tips how to do things and after that you're on your own. When I got the game it wasn't even released yet and I enjoyed very much the fact that there were no guides around or too much hand holding within the game. You had to figure stuff out yourself and the system on the background is quite unique and requires at least some focusing for it to be mastered.Your tasks in the game vary between material collecting for crafting base building and expanding researching new types of tech and building more complex stuff. At first you jog around like a humble space peasant dropping down lifesaving tether lines that lead into resource sites and tunnels. Then you start driving around in small rovers then bigger trucks and you can even hook these into each other to make trailer combinations. Soon your tether worries are over and your vehicles own life support is enough to keep your lungs well oxygenized!All the vehicles and the various gizmos you can install into them require power of course and you can juice them up with solar panels wind turbines and extra batteries to keep going on. You can scoop up some energy nodes from ground too or use a bio fueled generator on your vehicle to give it a boost of energy.What I like especially in Astroneer is how your vehicles have certain type of equipment slots and the possibilities of you micro managing them. You can play around with them whenever you like tear your cargo and items down and change everythings' places on a whim. I had this scenario dozen times where my truck was full of supplies miles deep in the underground tunnels and heading back home. The vehicles store up only so much energy so eventually I ran out of juice. I tear down a fully loaded cargo module drop it on the ground while I grab a generator from my suit's shoulder slam it in the truck's side and give it some time to recharge batteries. Once I'm good to go I snap the cargo module back on and keep on truckin. Later on I of course fine tuned my truck with solar panels a wind turbine and a generator with enough biofuel to go with it.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 820419404The WorldThe graphic style animations and visual effects are all very appealing. I love the edgy simplified and clean style of the game and it all ties well together with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is there but it's not really stealing away your attention from the game itself and yet after hours and hours of listening to it you still don't get annoyed by it. I visited all the seven planets the game currently has and they all have their own biome and special weather effects and dangers. The terrain on a barren planet is dusty sandy and well Barren with little vegetation. Arctic planet has a chilly and very rough terrain where moving around in vehicle is pretty much impossible. And all this time when you adventure on various planets you can see the other planets in midst of starts when you look up into the night sky.It took me 24 hours in 3 different days to rummage through most of the current content and to figure out all the bells and whistles. I would have done it probably sooner too but I had to start a fresh game 3 times due to one savegame file not loading up anymore and on the second savegame my character was stuck inside a building. (Can't destroy buildings or anything you build at least for now) Again nasty early access symptoms but nothing major to worry about. System Era has been pushing out solid patches on daily bases and they DO listen to your troubles as long you report the bugs on a proper channel their own forums.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 820434992Crafting &amp BuildingCrafting in Astroneer in pretty simple and straight forward. You build various kinds of workstations and they all serve their own purpose. Smelter smelts ores Printer ""prints"" various modules and items on resource materials Vehicle Bay allows you to build Rovers Trucks Shuttles and even Spaceships that can punch through starting planets' orbit to expand your colony into other planets. Research station unlocks new technologies like new vehicles gear modules etc. Like vehicles these workstations require energy too and of course resources depending on what you're about to build. You can fine tune your bases energy needs with solar panels wind turbines and extra energy bank. Solar panels don't generate energy at night wind turbines won't spin if there's no wind. Yeah duh. But I like the attention to these details. And these are all detachable movable items so you can switch their places depending on your base needs and they fit in vehicles too.The starting planet's surface has more than plenty of basic materials available. The harder metals are underground and there's tunnel entrances almost everywhere to be found. The rarest materials can only be found via researching various strange items found in the world. They can be in a form of giant seeds roots crates glowy rocks etc. Once you get off the starting planet these rare materials can also be found on planet's surface areas and they require more advanced drilling mechanisms for you to collect them.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 821109136 At the moment once you have unlocked all the tech and built most things there's really no ""need"" to leave the starting planet. Not much will change in the game the planets all have the same materials so the only valid reason at the moment is to see the sights and explore new areas. I have no idea about the game's future plans but I do see it brightly lit. Astroneer is one of those 'good vibe games' where you can truly relax have fun by yourself or with friends and family. Game has no violence you don't shoot or smack or kill anything in it though the nature and elements on planets vary and they can kill you if you're not cautious enough. Luckily death is no permanent so just jog back to the unlucky previous You and you can save your precious items and continue your adventures. I am eagerly waiting for some minor bug fixes that gave grey hairs to my cute Astronaut and of course more content any and all kinds of! I want to keep playing Astroneer more.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-21,2,74,34,True,Recommended,Yet another early access sandbox space game? Yes. While these appear to be the next trend I have to say Astroneer is a very strong candidate in the category to become something amazing and excel. I'd rate it higher than I did Osiris New Dawn which I really enjoy as well. Upon starting your first game you are welcomed to a beautiful landscape of a foreign alien planet. Honestly beautiful doesn't even describe how the game looks and feels. The colors the weather the ambiance all come together perfectly and really immerses you in this game. It feels like a trip and you're suddenly peaking wanting to experience this vibrant and vast world. Just watching the stars and planets rise on the horizon will keep you entertained by just how well done it looks. So aside from the graphics what sets this game apart from the plethora of other early access space sandbox games? The actual sandbox. You are able to shape and mold the landscape to your will in almost any way you want. The terraform tool is something that puts Minecraft to shame it left me awestruck multiple times with how good it feels to dig just a simple hole. The cave generation is absolutely stunning. You will travel for miles in caves and thankfully with the tether system you will always have a line to get back home. You will lose hours without realizing it playing this. The survival is not a constant nag expect for oxygen which you will lose rather quick without the tether system. Honestly though the tether system is a great thing and takes the concept of putting torches down in Minecraft to mark your way back and just amplifies that by ten. Astroneer has a very unusual tranquil feeling to it at least for me even with the constant danger of sandstorms hurling huge rocks that instantly kill you and oxygen demands I never felt pressured. Playing this felt the same as Minecraft back in Indev before anyone knew about the game and talked about all the secrets. Just a beautiful serene experience and it's almost impossible to think the developers think this is a pre alpha. The developers might have lofty goals but they've already hit gold.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-19,0,0,23,True,Recommended,I LOVE the multiplayer aspect for this title. I REALLY hope they fix the stability with vehicles in multiplayer and address the ease issues getting to play with your friends because I was really bummed out when my friends and I couldn't play this together. There's so much potential here. I'm glad it's alpha and not beta testing phase. There is still a lot to work on but it's really fun.My opinion the gravity needs serious work with how it appears to be using a single thread to calculate which slows down processing and increases latency. Dev side of things I hope that they do make the game more stable and MP friendly and that they give that update the glory it deserves because that fundamental functionality is what's going to keep people and what's going to send them away.Can't show nothing but love for this title at the moment but that may change by the time it launches!

2018-07-18,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,IntroAstroneer is a survival game in space and the plot is... hmmm as of 0.9.0 not a single spot of plot. So as of now you're just launched (meaning you're put on a capsule and it was launched ) ) on a planet and you just need to survive. It's not my first survival game so I can definitely state that any game of this type has (or chooses) some sort of key feature along with it evolves. In Astroneer you may modify the terrain quite easily and for sure you'll do it a lot this is the key. I've built roads a park for my vehicles and bridges not a single structure just by modifiyng the soil. When you're satisfied of the location you may also place your base and enrich it with different machinery (not structures) they're used to gather/process resources and ease the exploration. A generic planet is filled with a lot of space wreckages which you may discover and loot. Finally it's possible to build a shuttle and fly to another planet and do the same.Pros+ Modifying the soil is very useful and entertaining + Oxygen paths are a really wonderful idea to better organize the exploration + Very rich environment Cons No NPC No lore it's just gather resources soil working gather advanced resources Game progressing kills instead of enhance what you've done this is worst in a survival in my opinion. Examples oxygen paths are wonderful but as soon as you'll build vehicles oxygen paths became useless Very rich environment but the game progressions restricts your will of explorating something machinery will give you resources and with no lore and no NPC why should you bother adventuring in a cave? The wreckages contains just resources which you may obtain from the machineries The evident advantage in exploring a new planet is different exploration discoveries type (i.e. bones instead of wreckages) Very basic not interactive fauna Not hierarchycal research system is just a click and select what you wantConclusionThe real pro of this game is the learning curve in a couple of hours you'll learn to do/manage everything. Unfortunately as of now the game has some contradictions (i.e. should I spend hours exploring for resources while in minutes I may gather them with machineries?) and the totally absence of lore renders it empty. Anyway it is an alpha so in my opinion the devs just tried to do a playable space world generator and from this point of view they succeded. It's also true that a survival doesn't need a strong plot but the total absence in my opinion is a con (i.e. why a planet should be literally filled with space wreckages? Bad pilots? ) ). The really bad thing is how the progression kills your previous efforts very very bad (and frustrating) for a survival.If you need to choose which game to buy maybe it's wise to put this one in wishlist and follow it for future developments and as of now you may buy Empyrion which is in a more advanced development stage and definitely more rewarding.Instead if you don't mind to spend hours in flattening terrain just for flatten it (or to simulate a road) or explore for the sake of exploring then you may buy Astroneer and even have fun with it.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-19,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Indeed this game is very early access. Whereas the game mechanics are already quite convincing and the whole scenery basic gameplay etc appears to be well developed there is a huge lack of content. I am not sure if the game is worth the money I spend on it (20 EUR) right now but if the developers keep on creating content this will turn into an awesome game experience. Since the devs seem to be super active and very transparent in their development process I would still recommend this game for space enthusiast survivalists and everyone in between. Nonetheless its worth mentioning that after 10 16 hrs or so you will have done everything thats possible in the game.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-19,0,0,20,True,Recommended,I'm giving this game a thumbs up it's interesting and the idea poses some unique challanges that can be rather fun. unfortunetly the challange drops off significantly when you discover the research for the fuel condenser and trading post. At that point the only challange is finding new research to add to the things you can make for any materials just condense 8 hydrazine and send away for it on the trading post it requires only energy to produce the fuel so you set up a few solar panels and you can produce as much as you need. the devs have some interesting challanges if they want the game to be fun for more than an hour or 2 per save.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-20,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,I really like the concept and art style for this game and I had some fun playing it with friends. However I just didn't have fun in the long run with this game. I find myself bored of the gameplay loop (go somewhere mine stuff come back and build) and generally wishing I was doing something else. Don't get me wrong it's still a fine game it just isn't for me.,ASTRONEER

2018-07-21,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Astroneer can be a very promising title! With interesting mechanics nice scenery and the option of multiplayer it definitely got me interesting. The first 10 15 hours of figuring out the gameplay and discovering your first planet are very fun. Unfortunately the fun and excitement ends there... Once you've researched everything and cruised through the surface of the globe everything becomes repetitive with a slight twinkle of variation. Flying to different planets does not change much about this. Given that I've enjoyed the hours I've put in so far I'll give Astroneer the thumbs up. It has potential to go far but in order to become a full fledged game it needs some big additions e.g. storyline sense of progression greater variation and I would even say NPCs. This game can surpass Subnautica yet at the same time turn out to be the next No Man's Sky. Please don't be the latter!,ASTRONEER

2018-07-20,0,0,45,True,Recommended,I like the game alot I like how you have to keep oxygen close or die. Building rovers with a crane to mine is cool but with the bigger car rekts that the player can't pick up the crane should be able to do that. Like a rope attachment for it to like tether to the rekt car and pick it up to a shredder. Also I think the Astroneer Community might have some great ideas to help the game.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-20,0,0,46,True,Recommended,As of now the game is fun and entertaining for awhile. It does need improvements but for an Early Access game with updates still happening and some big members that have joined the team it does really make a difference.The down side right now is that it's pretty much an explorable planet no animals or trees really but not all planets can have trees and animals so hopefully some might be added.You can fly to different planets that have some fast sun rotation that is really cool the multiplayer makes the game though playing solo wouldn't be too fun really unless you like molding the dirt into some awesome base. Which brings me to the point I kind of wish there was more abilities of actual buildings maybe a way you can set up a green house with growing would be cool.The game is improving and I'm sure it will be awesome before it fully releases so I do recommend the game.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-20,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Game with a lot of potentiel. Unfortunately the controls are really not intuitive so it does take awhile to get used to.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-20,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Pretty AlrightReally well thought out game very fun. The game is even better if you have friends to play it with. On the downside there are a few bugs like falling through the map and landing on the other side of the planet (yes it did happen and I survived off of sheer survival skills and oxygen veins through out the planet) loss of items while crafting and the batteries leaving texture mesh when moved. Once past these few bugs the game is well polished and is extremely fun! Highly recommended for PvE players.(P.S. The soundtrack is A W E S O M E!!!),ASTRONEER
2017-02-06,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Great game nice idea but needs a lot of work!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-13,0,0,29,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a terrifically fun game and I really hope the developer continues to produce quality updates for it. It has more content in it as a 'pre alpha' than a lot of early access and beta games that I've played in the past and it's ludicrously simple and fun.Yes there are some issues like crashing (primarily if you're playing multiplayer single player is very stable) and some wonky bugs like very rarely falling through the world when you get out of vehicles. And there's a finite amount of content in the game although there's enough IMO to justify its $20 price tag. There are also some basic features that you'll find in many games like a save management system that just aren't here.But the environments are gorgeous the play mechanics are intuitive and enjoyable (I especially like the fact that there's no UI it really helps with the immersion factor) and the graphics and animations are styilized but fun and beautiful. The fact that there are already multiple planets available (albeit with similar threats and resources available) is great for a game this early in its development.This honestly is what I think No Man's Sky intended to be on a smaller scale but with the potential to achieve what NMS probably won't. If you're into exploration/crafting/survival games I highly recommend picking it up to help out the developers to build this game into something amazing.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-21,0,0,40,True,Recommended,Cool game for only 20$. My friend suggested i get it so I did. The graphics are beautiful and the colors are very nice and I have always liked space. The only cons are that the game is laggy for most computers the loading screen at the start is very long and it gets old when you beat it kinda. Over all its pretty fun butnonly get it if you really want it.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-19,0,0,11,True,Recommended,I think I see more potential in this game than I've seen from anything since Minecraft in that general realm of genres. Honestly I haven't played much yet but I could see myself delving into this for hours on end with my friends. The other great thing about this game is that the developers are constantly updating you on what they're working on and it's nice to have the open dialogue like that.I would buy it now because the price is sure to rise as the game comes closer to compeletion.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-20,0,0,81,True,Recommended,Absolute great game there is no issues with it what i've experienced so far and there's plenty to do and Explore.explore caves and gather many minerals as in Malachite laterite or Ammonium smelt Ores into bards to create space shuttles to explroe a variety of different worlds that are special in their own way.so much more the game has to offer and its still in alpha.i've had no issues with the game except sometimes constant dust storms but on the other hand it is great and related to the type of stuff that would happen in a real life situation when it comes to space travel.Great game.,ASTRONEER

2018-07-21,0,0,5,True,Recommended,i downloaded about a year ago and only have 4 hours of play time because the game always crashed in the main menu. i would love to play this game but i am unable. i have all of the recomended specs and ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling. please help.,ASTRONEER
2018-04-02,0,0,70,True,Recommended,really good game needs some more diversity between profiles whenever you start the game it's always the same pattern it would be nice to see almost like a second path or way to play the game. Not this has anything to do with it but terraria has multiple damage classes some being magic damage melee damage and range damage and you can start over feeling like you can play a different class another thing I would like to see is more planets. and more exclusive machines that you can only get at those planets. because for my time playing I feel like I can stay on the starting planet without ever having to leave. Overall fantasic game to invest your money into,ASTRONEER

The game is still pretty far from being complete so there isn't much to do yet but what is there is preatty good.There are quite a handfull of bugs and errors like falling though the ground and random spasms in fps.I strongly recomend you wait for the game to be completed or to get more stabel before buying a strong 8.5/10.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-19,0,0,7,True,Recommended,The game is fun and a good game to play but the problem is that when you're playing with friends it starts off good then when you start to build more and add on more the hosts game looses FPS. So that everytime you add a new thing it will get to a point where the host has a max of 20 FPS and it is unplayable.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,5,True,Recommended,I'm only a few hours in so take my opinion with a grain of salt. For an EA game it's surpisingly stable and solid on a fundamental game engine level. I've had one CTD and I've lost a few materials to bugs. I've also glitched through the map plenty but that's a simple fix when the entire map is terraformable!I would say I've gotten as far as the mid game at this point and I know there are quite a few advanced features I have yet to get to. That said there is a lot of obvious room for expansion of crafting recipes resources tools buildings etc.After everything above I am highly pleased with Astroneer so far and I am already a die hard fan and rooting strong for the devs to keep expanding such an already well made game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-30,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Great game! Only complaint is that it's super early access right now and thus doesn't have much to do and has some weirdness/glichiness. I don't at all regret my purchase and look forward to seeing where this game goes from here!,ASTRONEER
2017-02-06,0,0,175,True,Recommended,This game is by far... well lets just say AMAZING. So relaxing and just peaceful. You get to just do what you want and its not to hard to progress in.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-08,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Great Game I love The Space Concept Although oxygen runs out way too quick in my opinion but still great game,ASTRONEER
2017-01-13,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Yo honestly the game is really fun you get to play with a few friends and adventure around. Easy to pick up how to play. Only downside in my opinion is friends have to host server so you can play. If they aren't on you can't play. Another one is how its max 4 players. I bought this game with 8 other people and we have to play seperate now because of the player limit. But my biggest complaint (understanding that its still in early access) Game is filled with bugs. Glitching through map dying randomly crashes vechiles just crash flip and freak the hell out. Please fix the game I'll be interested in a few months.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-13,0,0,2,True,Recommended,the game is great i have a pretty beefy computer so that may be one reason its runs so well for me i find the game can take hours away from me which i love and can create a adventure ive dreamed of in outerspace! thanks to the creaters epic game!,ASTRONEER

2017-02-08,0,0,77,True,Recommended,If you're into survival games and like to build stuff and to be creative this one could be for you. (Personally I've played a lot of Terraria Factorio and ARK recently.)Atmospheric and beautiful. Great sound design great graphics!You play with a sense of discovery.I do believe and hope the developers will keep up the good work (it is in pre alpha right now). More content is needed. I don't know what really. Quests? Starvation and food? Perhaps more base building stuff. More planets? A larger ship to travel to other planet systems?,ASTRONEER
2017-01-13,0,0,9,True,Recommended,this game is really good but if your on a latop don't play it on your latop because the fps will be low but other wise it is a realy good game and should be played more and has given me another game to play die repeat thx game makers,ASTRONEER
2017-01-13,0,0,38,True,Recommended,So great of a game theres a really awesome survival aspect to it. The graphic style is really great and the survival is really fun and intuitive. Even in early access this game is worth the buy. Cant wait to see what it turns into.,ASTRONEER

I rarely binge games and I spend most of an entire weekend rushing through every aspect looking for any nook and crany I might have missed another shiny nugget of fun and exciting!I hope the developers just keep doing what they started out doing. The roadmap exists and is shared. (I haven't the training to offer an opinion on it other than I appreciated being able to see one!)Looking forward to this baby!!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,81,True,Recommended,Awesome game. I've been playing the game for 30 hours now and I'm addicted. Sure the bugs with the vehicles and terrain are a bit annying but the game totally makes up for it. In fact it makes the game a little harder. Simple game mchanics and many vast worlds (one of which I got stranded at because I had no fuel to return #idiot) is really the reason why this game is so awesome!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,54,True,Recommended,This is an awesome open world game that I would definitely recommend playing. The mechanics are good the graphics are awesome and the only complaint I have is that... Wait! Never mind I don't have any!,ASTRONEER

2017-02-06,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Great game and it has a lot of potential. Although i think the game should create a more comprehendable main menu where you could decide whether to play it multiplayer or single player. Also i think the deveoplers of the game should add more guides and instruction during the earlier part of the game. But all in all the game is amazing. I hope it continues to develop and bring out its full potential.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-01,0,0,8,True,Recommended,So far after almost 5 hours of coop play the experience has been pretty awesome. There are a few bugs that have gotten us like a disappearing truck no idea what happened was driving along and bam I flew out of the truck and then it was nowhere to be found. There has been some fall through the planet bugs. And I've had a few issues where my terrain tool simply stopped collecting (however that seems to resolve itself if I collect organics). Matchmaking through Steam works pretty nicely but the in game mechanism for connecting is a little raw and uninformative. Once I get an invite when I click the invite the main menu interface launches again and I am presented with the same sort of launch screen as I had in single player. The only indication that it is now in multiplayer is the home beacon visible on the in menu planet. And the only way I've currently found to end the game is to actually launch to the planet and then hit Escape. There is no 'end game' option from the main menu. This IS early access there WILL be bugs.All that aside the gameplay is otherwise very stable and solid (EDIT unless you're playing co op). Performance is really good. The artwork is great IMO. It's all about the lighting and sound. Things that need detail have detail. The rest of it is filler and they make it work very well. The sandstorms are great. When the rocks fly at you even though they are simple cubes the sounds and lighting make me feel like they are large rocks hurtling my way. Not entirely sure how much content is here yet but it has kept us busy to this point and we can't wait to see how it progresses.UPDATE my friend and I have put in a good effort and amount of time playing coop mode. Lots of bugs primarily for the client player. At first most of the bugs are workable and simply a bit frustrating at times but nothing earthshatteringly horrible. However we have come to the point as we advanced and began exploring the planet and solar system in vehicles that the client play was just too buggy. Rather than make an emotional statement the game sucks we decided we'd seen enough for now and can wait for another round of bug fixes and updates. Such is the story of an early access game. Have all of the bugs we have exerienced already been reported? check time to wait for the devs. That's the way EA goes. You're not buying into a finished product it's very early access. If you want a finished game don't buy it yet. If you want to help support the devs and be able to provide valuable suggestions and criticisms? Definitely recommended.Awesome fun great experience (althought a bit frustrating as a coop client)!,ASTRONEER

2017-01-30,0,0,56,True,Recommended,This game has great potential. It is very early access you can tell. (Flying rovers anyone?) But if done right I could see it surpassing Minecraft in terms of playability and exploration. Right now it is only good for about 6 hours or so as you build your base up and max out your resources not including the hours required to chase around your broken vehicles lol.. but those said 6 hours are fun and the planet surfaces and textures are simple but gorgeous and fit the feel of the game well.All in all I'd say buy now while it's cheap and watch it grow up. I have a feeling it will be a fully featured space crafting/building/exploring game in the future that will take many of my hours...,ASTRONEER
2017-01-30,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Wow! Pleasantly surprised. I can already tell this game will have more depth than No Man's Sky. After they improve the graphics I don't think there will even be a reason to play No Man's Sky anymore.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-08,0,0,69,True,Recommended,In Early Access and it's already 10x better than NMS this game only has room to improve. The DEVS seem to be very involved with the community and roll out with updates pretty regularly. Of course there are going to be a few bugs here and there but it really is not a deal breaker. I am excited to see more content as they develop into quite the hidden gem most people haven't heard of. The game does throw you onto a planet without any information into what to do but that's what makes it fun your first time around. You'll find ways to improve base layouts planet exploration and creative building creations. The fact that this game has a MP is 100x more advanced than NMS plus it's much cheaper. The MP can get a little quirky for the host but it should be resolved in the next update according to the DEVS most recent streams. There are performance issues that also will be addressed in the upcoming update.I highly recommend the game if you do want to wait for a sale that's up to you but it's worth the price tag and the hours you probably felt just flew by.,ASTRONEER

2018-07-25,0,0,47,True,Recommended,This game is super submersive. I find myself losing track of time when I'm playing. It does get quite lonely so I prefer playing with someone else so goals and tasks are less tedious and leaves more time to explore and mess around. The game has gone through a lot of change and the devs seem to really care about the player experience. The online co op has taken leaps and bounds and seems to be much more stable.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-27,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,I love survival games however this game had me loosing intrest very quickly. There is not a great deal of content avaliable to players and a lack of story really puts me off playing this. Not worth the money in my opinion.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,137,True,Recommended,I played the game only 15h but I have to say that it is simply great for pre alpha status. Clearly 20 for early access may be a lot but for the developer is also done much to get it in beta and later in 1.0. So there is something to do with other early access game developers. If you like games with space and want to experience this feeling as it is (single player) on a planet the game is best served with this game. Atmosphere is the musical background or the wide plains the view is offered to the one as soon as a huge mountain has climbed. Just awesome. I do not regret this purchase. The bug's which I have found so far and hanged me on the wall do not disturb as I already said it is PRE ALPHA and thus not yet finished the next patch can not expect moreP.S. BUY PEOPLE !!!P.P.S If you find typing errors keep them!Ich habe das Spiel zwar erst 15h gespielt aber ich muss sagen dass es für Pre Alpha Status einfach genial ist. Klar 20 für Early Access mag viel sein aber dafür wird aber seitens der Entwickler auch viel getan um es in Beta und später in 1.0 zu bekommen. Also es tut sich was in gegensatz zu so mach anderen Early Access Spielentwicklern. Wer Spiele mag die mit Weltraum zutun haben und mal dieses Gefühl erleben möchte wie es ist allein (Single Player) auf einen Planet zusein der ist mit diesem Spiel bestens bedient. Atmosphäre sei es durch die Musikalische untermalung oder der weiten Ebenen der Ausblick dem einen geboten wird sobald man einen gewaltigen Berg erklommen hat. Einfach genial. Ich bereue diesen Kauf nicht. Die Bug s die ich bis jetzt gefunden und mir an die Wand gehängt habe stören nicht da ich wie bereits sagte es ist PRE ALPHA und damit noch lange nicht fertig kann den nächsten Patch schon garnicht mehr erwartenP.S.

The game is polished very well for an early access game but as they expand their game it will get better and better with more exlporation and so on. This game is amazing with your friends and its extremely fun to play.Best of luck to the developers.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Ignore the bad reviews I've played 4 hours straight with no issues bugs or anything. Not to say there is any bugs because this is in Pre Alpha. If you're into Sandbox Open World and Space Adevnturing this game is for you. This is what No Man's Sky should have been even though it's not No Man's Sky.There's so much to do even if it's repetive. There's so many plans you can discover by researching various of resources too and you can even go to other planets. Can't wait for the full release in time ),ASTRONEER

2017-01-05,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,"I had a lot of fun faffing about with this. But presently at least that is all it has to offer.I'd not call this a game i'd call this a play scape. We can play games of imagination in it but it is not itself a game to play really. You go to other planets because they are there. You work the crafting system because it is there.But presently it's like early days of minecraft as a play scape place to faff about but lacking the personal creative building aspects of minecraft.There is only ""exploration."" But without a need to as i said you go out to see what is there just because you choose to not because there is any need/game drive to. It s just for personal sightseeing. However there is not much of anything to find out there yet beyond terrain palette swaps mostly. As a play scape it s kind a cool. For $20 and 28 hours of enjoyment I m not going to complain about &lt $1/hr entertainment costs. Ran smooth though kind a low FPS for its visual fidelity and didn t crash for extended play sessions. But do be warned it s not likely going to feel like a game as it has little to no driving systems or goals to achieve. Comes off bit more as a tech demo than a game if you see what I mean. And until significant content updates come along I can t say I m likely to log any more hours in it.As i can't say what kind of game it wants to be and as more of a tech demo than game i can't really recommend it.But will get back to this as things progress.",ASTRONEER

The cave systems are wonderous and i hope this game gets out of pre alpha mode because it definitely has the potential to do so. I am also hoping for more things to be added in this game such as more resources to collect like he malachite and aluminum and i really am hoping for the accessability of not just more planets but being able to visit other galaxies with better spaceships. Seriously how cool would that be? I want this game to expand and become more sophisticated in the future i really am looking forward to having more things to do and things to collect.Please let this game grow and become more ecxiting.

2017-01-05,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Good Times for a Short Time This game took over my life for a day but for one day only There just isn't much to do yet. I spent my time running around a planet doing the following gathering one of 10 crafting materials finding researchable blocks or orbs of materials underneath plants in the caves using the crafting materials to build the best equipment for gathering building a self sustaining base with batteries solar panles and wind turbines Then I built the best ship in the game and travelled to another planet. and repeated the list. But once I had researched all that there was to craft from the first planet all I found myself doing on the new planet was trying to a better layout for the base. There was no drive to continue playing anymore. I had everything.It took me roughly 8 hours and some change to get all that there was to offer at this stage of development. I recommend this game if you want to waste a good day just exploring and researching and playing with the cool tools you can make to gather and explore better. I didn't ask any friends to play with me because I wanted to be sure that it was fun before I forced them to buy it and by the time I was ready to go ask them to snag a copy. I burnt out. My hopes is that in a future update there is more to do. The exploring and gathering is actually the most fun I've had in any such game that builds its experience around it. It's paced perfectly. But there just currently isn't enough to bring you back after you already research it all.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,23,True,Recommended,This game has been an amazing experience so far. It is definitely worth your money. The game has such beautiful colours and if there was anything I would want improved or different I would want it to be less laggy and for there to be animals and life forms you can domesticate to be your pet or to eat. And maybe even make it so you can have your own little bunker to actually live inside of. But other than that I would say 10/10 game. Astonishing.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,20,True,Recommended,EDIT RIght after typing my review a patch downloaded and I just tested it my Core2Quad issues have been resolved and it's playing with very good frames on that system with the 1050ti! GREAT job Devs. Just played this for 6+ hours straight. After trying to launch to play on my living room setup (and failing) I moved onto my desktop which is a much more powerful system. Living room Core2Quad Q9550 8gb DDR3 1050ti crashed right after launch (sometimes before). Tried all the fixes nothing worked. Hopefully they iron it out. EDIT They did and it's awesome but the controller/camera needs a bit of tweaking. Overall very happy!)Desktop i5 4670 24gb DDR3 R9 290 crashed only on the first launch. Never again after that in six hours of playing.Overall this is a very fun game even solo. I slowly figured out how to play as I went along eventually building a rover then skipping the truck and shuttle for a Spaceship. Launched and landed on several planets all very different looking but like NMS samey. There are no enemies to fight just a few plants that spew poison clouds (but can still kill you). There's grass to be mowed and collected for use in generators and there are many options to provide power and oxygen. You'll struggle at first but it's a fun struggle. I've had a lot of fun for 6 hours and the game is worth 20 dollars for sure. That said I played NMS for 60+ hours and I honestly really like that game for what it is and similarly enjoyed GRAV for many hours. This game feels like a cross between No Man's Sky GRAV and Scrap Mechanics and in some ways is better than all. NMS has more polish and feels like a more living universe maybe. And GRAV's combat is a bit more fun. But the environmental effects and hazards make this game a lot of fun. There will be tense moments. It definitely feels like an early access indie game. But in a good way.It seems the devs patched some things right off the bat (none of which helped my situation at first) and hopefully we'll see that continue in the coming days and months. (EDIT There was a patch waiting as I wrote this review that resolved my issues amazing job Devs.)I'm giving it a thumbs up but steer clear if you're running an AMD CPU for now. I hear there are some problems with those currently. However my AMD GPU had no issues running very nicely with my i5.Even though the game is simple looking graphically it seems to be proceedually generated (the two starting planets I tested were quite different) so the look of the game from trailers fool you into thinking the system demands won't be high. I expect there's a lot going on beneath the surface. No pun intended. I experienced a lot of frame loss especially on new planets and when my base got pretty large. I feel that on a game this simple looking (no/barely textures) it shoudln't be hard to run at max but again there's a lot going on and weather effects etc probably hamper that. Unreal Engine is notoriously a glutton for resources besides. (Re ARK.) Hopefully we'll see some better optimization soon. (Typically I was getting 40 80 FPS at 1440p though and the slow down wasn't enough to frustrate me much as it only happened rarely. It's very colorful the music is a great match for the feel and look of the game and the audio fx are suitably cool silly and spacey as well. I quite like it so far going to try to talk my gf into playing with me tomorrow now that the Core2Quad issues have been fixed.Good job devs. I'd love to see some creatures to fight and some silly/fun weapons perhaps a monitary system or something to save for in the long run. I found that the drill for the truck really doesn't do a hell of a lot compared to your own multitool and it fell off my truck a lot. At any rate I love it so far and can't wait to play multiplayer. I will certainy be putting many more hours into this little gem!,ASTRONEER

2017-01-15,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Received this game as a gift from a friend of mine who told me that I would love this game. Turns out that I not only love this game but am also addicted with it. The gameplay is amazingly well made and after a bit of getting used to how to control the camera very fun and addictive.It could use a bit more background story in my opinion but the mechanics of the game are really fun(ny)!I would totally recommend this game to anyone who loves space and open world collect and survive games.Happy Astroneering everyone!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I think the game is okay and here is why 1 it is really beautiful and an amazing concept. It is a way way way better no man's sky. Now it is in pre alpha and with that in mind i am not trashing the game for occasional freezes and lower frame rate because the game is still in pre alpha. If you dont mind playing a game that is a WIP the definently try the game. I know as of writing this review i only have 5.4hrs but that is because i kinda got annoyed of the crashes but as updates still come out i still love to play the game. I have played for 5 hours and have only merely scratched the surface of the things you can do with this pre alpha game. I can't say that about a lot of games and that is why i recommend the game. Sooner or later they will fix the freezing/crashing/frame drop and i only eagerly await the update that does so.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,21,True,Recommended,I'm pretty hesitant about pruchasing EA games nowadays but I can say that I'm glad I splurged and got this game. The art style is great and I'm really excited about where this game is going. Solo is relaxing and fun to play it's not a grind and I've never felt like it was a chore or boring to get something or go somewhere. Multiplayer is also really fun even when your buddy is taking the rover you built into space because you're lagging like crazy. For $20 I'd heartily recommend this game get it!,ASTRONEER

Overall this game has a lot of potential and Im excited about the future of this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,40,True,Recommended,Proper good fun indie game where ya run around collecting resources and building up your base aswell as rovers shuttles and trucks.

2017-01-15,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Despite how great this game might become I really can't recommend it in it's current state. The camera is absolutely terrible with crazy amount of motion blur that makes cave exploration pretty impossible especially considering that you can't see while in caves. The lag is kind of unbearable at times especially in IN caves. Have I expressed how much caves suck in this game? Because good god do they suck,ASTRONEER
2017-11-22,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Would i recommend getting this game? Maybe.The game is great to start of with you spawn in get all your resources and start to build your base but after a few hours of playing you start to run out of things to do. After i went to other planets i found my self stuck with what to do because i had everything you could get. I would recommend getting this game even though updates are very slow.,ASTRONEER

A few examples of some bugs i came across are things going through the floor (RARE) player going through the floor (not so rare lol) everything about the ""drill head"" and this one time when i built a smelter right on top of my big pile of things they all despawned and i was immidiately sad JUST TO NAME A FEW.PROS (even though its in pre alpha) everything feels clean cut and nice.quality single player experiencecoop works exactly how youd want it to no bscrafting system works goodrewarding and addictingthe whole conceptCONScontent (obviously... not even a con really)bugs are to be expectedlag spikes when entering planets and sitting in anything at all trucks shuttles whateverthat drill head attachment honestly all in all i think this game is just an amazing idea that has been put into the works that just needs that extra push to go from a good game to a great game. i hope the devs dont let this die because ive seen such good ideas for good video games fall into the wrong hands with garbage developers. to be honest i dont know who these devs are i probably shouldve checked before i made this but take good care of this idea. if youre reading this astroneer will go as far as you want it to goi really really enjoyed this game so far and i hope that the developers use all their success wisely since this game has become increasingly popular in steam this game can be the new big thing forsure....genuinely excited to see where this game goes",ASTRONEER

2016-12-28,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,Yes it is early access. I too have been burned in the past. I only have 10.5 hours and I payed $20 but not all is lost I think that everybody should jump on board now and wait just a while to see what comes about. This game has excellent mechanics although a little slow at times I feel it lacks a sense of depth and objective. I think they should extend the gameplay value by adding automated mining and interplanetary/solar system trading. I feel like we need the ability to create a massive goal perhaps missions. Overall I give it 6/10 for right now needs some patching to make it run smoother and some more content.Update! It has been like 4 months since I bought this game and there have been no major updates!

This game is so fun to play and explore however in it's prealpha state ther are lots of bugs. for instance the vehicles are wonky when i get in one it pushes me to the bottom of the car not the seat. Also my friend and i lost a truck because it fell through the map. the characters fall through the map constantly as well. also whenever i leave a multiplayer game i have to restart the game to join back with my friend. when you are in the main loading screen ther is no way to exit to desktop that i know of as of now. i must enter a world then exit. i made a truck from my outpost and went mining i ran out of oxygen and died i spawned back at my MAIN base and the vehicles were over there so i was stranded. Please add some way to set a home location and spawn there. also i would love to see actual buildings and perhaps naming beacons and settlements? that would be really cool! I love this game with all my heart and it has huge potential Brotherhoodsentinel,ASTRONEER

2017-01-17,0,0,9,True,Recommended,This game is really beautiful. I mean absolutely fantastic graphics. But thats not what makes a game great.So You start off on your first planet after arriving. The game might seem confusing but its easy to learn once you understand. You gather some resources and build up your base Exploring as much land as you possibly can. Keeping in mind that this game is Pre Alpha It has absolutely unimaginable potential. This has so much content for a game thats not even in Alpha yet. I like the concept of this game and i think its going to become fantastic. And as many people have said Its what No Mans Sky wanted to be.,ASTRONEER
2018-01-03,0,0,35,True,Recommended,This is a great game with great graphics but I have a couple issues. First it never closes when I exit the game and it says that it's still running causing me to not be able to launch it. Second every time I play I get more lag. This is propobly because I explore more every time but it is still annoying to have a low framerate. I like how you can explore the whole world and advance as you go. I would give astroneer a 4.5/5 star rating and I would highly suggest it.,ASTRONEER
2018-01-03,0,0,55,True,Recommended,This is one of the most fun i have had in a while for a game. This game being in alpha stages still provides an amazing game I love how the game doesn't have too many deaths trying to learn and it isn't rare to die either. Also when you die you arenot forced to start over or spend an hour trying to find your body because of death beacons. Honestly this game easily matches the price in my opinion and has PLENTY of room to expand. The other planets allow one save to have dozens of bases even on larger planets you could have atleast 4. I would 100% recommend this to friends.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Love this game! I had no intentions of buying this game until i saw some screenshots of it and I fell in love with the art stye. Now that I was played this game for a good 8 9 hours I can really say that this game has ALOT of potentail and I hope they keep updating the game,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Hot on the heels of the hot mess that was No Man's Sky Astroneer aims to be in part what NMS claimed it would be. The difference between these two games is that Astroneer states what it plans to be as a game and then promptly meets those goals.A rather delightful little game Astroneer invokes the serene and peaceful atmosphere of Minecraft through excellent musical pieces while boasting its own adorable isometric art style that is capable of a quite surprising beauty. Only close to five hours in I've spent most of these hours on one singular save file and played both solo and with a friend. Both experiences were enjoyable and the game in its current state is a very promising sign for the future its heading in.It should be noted in my experience anyway that the game isn't particularly challenging by any means. Arguably the most challenging thing about Astroneer so far is inventory management because the backpack has very few slots to begin with and if you equip a battery and an oxygen tank the way I did for extra exploring freedom in small doses you have even less space to play with. The game also doesn't appear to offer a great deal of diversity presently or perhaps I was just generated a terrible planet with one singular dust storm that likes to blow by every now and then sometimes throwing a rock in my face in the process. Environmental hazards trip you up once and then never do so again unless you simply fail to notice them. Being able to shape terrain at your whim is an incredibly fun mechanic but it does lend itself to leaving you a lot of power over the environment and thus nullifying any threats of the environment as you learn how to avoid them. (Which normally involves just digging the whatever it is up and stealing its Research nodule.) Astroneer is a fun game. It's full of a good potential and carries an endearing charm even in its current state and I was able to happily spend two to three hours in one session alone with my partner just seeing what we could build where we could go and what we could break. (Tethers are your best friend if you want to move heavy and large objects. Trust.) I would hesitate against recommending it for its current price tag because it is a little repetitive and as much fun as I have with it I don't feel like the game has enough features to boast about for it to warrant being so expensive. That and it's also early access and regardless of how much I like a title I would always hesitate to recommend purchasing an early access game these days.But is Astroneer a bad game? No. No not at all. It's a lovely little game full of promise and charm and once it has just a bit more content to help bulk out the experience it will come with my full recommendations completely.,ASTRONEER

2017-06-11,0,0,5,True,Recommended,"Great game with loads of potential. Alot of reviews claim Devs aren't giving updates enough which might be a thumbs down for you. IMO the EA price now is better then $39 $59 later. As they stated it is Early Access. You will have strange bugs from time to itme. In it's current form there's plenty of enjoyment to be had. The ""vibe"" the music and cartony graphics create is very peaceful and tranquil. Perfect for relaxing and letting your imagination run wild terraforming the land exporing caves finding crashed ships and expnading you base.On a side note I haven't tried any of the multi player.

2017-01-21,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Astroneer is what you should expect from a modern sandbox exploration game. It's as much a survival game as survival mode Minecraft which is to say not really that much about survival at all and more about the experience of exploring the environment and building up your base. As of writing this review the game is still in early access a fact which is reflected in the longevity of the experience. If you're looking for something to play for a very long time with the expectation of having a lot of new tech to build then maybe hold off on buying until later in the development cycle as the sense of progression does kind of flatline after you build every structure and vehicle to your liking.Despite the genuine fun I've had going on expeditions for extra resources there isn't much to do in the current lategame with the collected surplus. I feel as if I've discovered most of what the game has to offer but it definitely leaves me wanting more which can only be a good thing for an unfinished game.I should note that I have not had any experience with multiplayer.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-12,0,0,57,True,Recommended,I love love love this game!! If you are thinking about buying this game you totally should! If you like space open worlds and cute little astronauts you will fall in love with Astroneer! This game is still an early access game but so far there is so much to offer.

2017-01-17,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Great game gives a solid 15 hours of gameplay before you get bored of it but with friends that'd take longer.Only complaint is that you have to manually edit game files to change graphical settings but i'm sure they'll add that in the future.Well worth the $25 for 15 hours of fun with pals.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-17,0,0,6,True,Recommended,For a game in pre alpha stage this is actually pretty incredible. First few hours of gameplay and I'm realizing that this is far more addictive than it should be. Has graphics that remind me of Spore a good system that utilizes resources fun little vehicles and a few ways to die. So far I'm impressed though I wish some of the debris you get the researchables from could either be farmed or destroyed somehow.

2017-06-12,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Astroneer 9/10Note This game is in a pre alpha state and may change blah blah blah.Astroneer is an intresting game which includes blueprints multiplayer vehichles exploration of a randomly generated open word solar system mining which can lead to rinse and repeat weather an intresting power and oxygen system with tethers and base building.The game consists of four characters to start off as including 2 skinny white space suits looking slightly diffrent a larger whit space suit and a larger orange space suit. Upon choosing your character you will launchoff what seems to be a space station onto an empty planet with only remanents of satelites and dead astroneers who came here before you. After being shown the controls quickly you will most like come across compound or resin (resin is used for base expansion while compound is used for crafting most of the in game objects.) after coming across these ores you will probably expand your base and begin improving. After so much time you will most likely have a research station which can get materials and blueprints when given unkown objects. There are many thing to research such as a winch oxygen tank drill shuttle seats rover battery generators filter dynamite etc. You can either make these objects at a printer or a vehichle bay which you have made. To make objects such as these you must collect copper alluminum which have been given diffrfrent names in their raw and materials like that to smelt. you can encounter storms which hurl rocks around and are one of the four current ways to die (the other three are falling poison gas and spikes.) You can create walls go inside a cavern or enter a vehichle/ habitat to survive but these storms do not last long. You can also obtain energy for yourself and modules you have made by catching wind or the sun by using the appropriate machine. The current goal in this game is to survive and expand. In caverns you might come across plants which spit poison gas spike you or just sit there luckely the plants are easy to identify from each other giving you a warning. thanks for reading my current review and sorry for putting things out the second they pop in my head.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Looks very promising. There are a few bugs which is to be expected in an alpha game like this but none so big it ruins the game or anything like that. The game doesnt hold your hand so it does require some pateints at first (Its not super complicated which is also good). Great sound track and the art style is also very nice. Its only gonna get better from this point.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,22,True,Recommended,TL DR It needs more. It's fun but buy it on sale or wait for it to be finished. There isn't a whole lot to do at the moment.That said...I'm totally digging this game so far. I love the survival dynamics as well as the building system. Controls took a little getting used to and there aren't any instructions really but its totally worth digging into! I can't wait to see what they continue to build into the game!,ASTRONEER

2017-01-04,0,0,22,True,Recommended,Right now this game has a lot of issues/bugs to be fixed. And as such not everybody would be willing to buy the game. The game idea is awesome and from what ive heard and what is being speculated this game should have an awesome future.But again the current game state is not all rainbow and stars it has massive frame drop issues that need fixing. Im sure that the devs are working on it and im patient enough. Would i recommend this game sure. Note that the game doesnt have much to unlock and explore as of now (can finish pretty much everything within a couple of hours even found a zebra ball).So if you have the patience to wait for the issues to be fixed sure buy it. If not just wait for beta. Great game though.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,5,True,Recommended,This game feels very unique and overall just a pleasure to play. LET ME STRESS I WILL NOT COMPARE THIS TO NO MAN'S SKY THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT GAMES. (Though on a general level I enjoyed Astroneer much more).Pros Dynamic unique enviorments. Runs and feels very smooth. I encountered NO bugs on a pre alpha. Beautiful soundtrack that REALLY captures the feel of adventuring in space. Tons of planets to explore. Very nice Devs if you guys see this then good job ) A day/night cycle that gives the game life. Overall very fun and entertaining.Cons In its current state there is not very much content actually here. (But the content that is present is amazing). The building system sucks it usually builds to a place very headache inducing and you can only build little platforms. (YOU CAN'T BUILD BASES) WTF. Although to be fair you can shelter inside of your landed ship or dig a cave and put stuff in it. To explore until you get a rover you have to string up teathers which gets SO boring. Not much to actually craft and build. Only a tiny amount of rescources to collect and use. Micromanage powering systems up constantly. Rover control is trash. For the current lack of content the $20 price tag is a bit steep.Neutral Factors There is no hand holding you have to figure everything out for yourself. There is a menu that shows controls but nothing about how the game works. Some people prefer this and some hate it but it's important you know you'll be self taught. You will spend a lot of time micromanaging your series of platforms.Notes To add or fill to a terrain hold alt. This will save you so many headaches.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Even though it is just in pre alpha I really enjoyed this game so far. It definately has a Minecraft feel to it too. The only major problem I have so far is the lag. The more I do the more it lags. I disconnected my tethers and fixed the lag for a bit but then it started up again even worse after I built a second truck. Currently just quit the game the game out of frustration.

Being that i feel I have done all the game has to offer i await new content and hope the developers continue to flesh out this great concept for a game.

While not without bugs and limitations you should expect from an early access project this game is absorbing and rewarding. You can easily find out about the bugs from reviews and forums and it will help have a better early game experience when setting up your bases. I read as many reviews I could of this before I bought. That said I've played full release games that are less polished than what is already in this game. I'm looking forward to seeing where this universe goes.,ASTRONEER

I don't regret buying it and look foward to seeing where they go with it. In all seriousness there's currently as much to do on the planets as there is in NMS and this game's in an alpha state.

2016-12-18,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Lots of content for pre alpha was quite surprised actually. really fun game I downloaded the game a day ago at 10pm and have already racked up 5 hours of game play.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Had no idea what I was doing so posted on the discusions for some coop. Got like 20 friend requests. 10/10 would make friends again.No but really the only real problems I had was crashing but heres a tip. Right click the game in your library go to properties start up comands then input ( nosound) without parenthesis and that will fix most of them. Havent crashed since.Other than that I wish there was a way to destroy the little platforms that you spawn all of the machines on cause if you mess them up they can glitch like I had a car spawner spawn cars into a fuel condenser and I had to start over new save because it was so cluttered. And the vehicles colide into everything. One time so bad it sent it into the stratosphere and we built a tower to get it unstuck from space. Was lots of fun though.If you have $20 bucks and want something to do over this christmas break and wana make new friends to play with this game is for you. Still in development (duh) so not much contentwise but you can have fun with your imagination and bros.Shout out to the guy who left a negative review because it wouldnt run on his windows 7 you helped me make the choice on should I to buy it or not based on the fact you couldnt run it on super outdated software. Go figure...,ASTRONEER

2017-09-30,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a game of exploration and base bulding. You can travel to different planets and find really cool things they have hidden within them. You can build lunar rovers to drive around and you can build shuttles to travel to the other planets. You can do complete terraforming of those planets meaning you can remove add or flatten the ground. My experiences with it have been much fun and enjoyment. Being an Early Access game of course it has bugs glitches and other issues sometimes but it's still being developed. I'm not upset over the problems because like i said they're still working on it. The look of the game while playing is beautiful and to not have a full fledged gaming computer it plays great for me. I highly recommend it to people that like games similar to Astroneer. To me it is well worth the money and time invested playing it. I've always wanted to play a game like this and thank you to System Era for creating it!,ASTRONEER
2017-06-02,0,0,18,True,Recommended,This game has so much potential. It's such fun just to explore and look for new things. The developers are hard at work making a quality game. Early Access isn't for everyone but put this on follow and check back when it gets closer to release. Certainly worth the $20.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,67,True,Recommended,"This game brings a lot of things I can categorize better than No Man's Sky this has variety although Bugs is forgiven since it is a PRE ALPHA and it is seen that if this game follows the path in which it will go very farAnother additional thing is that you yourself say ""ah I have nothing to do"" and then you start to find better things on the map that give you much more to do and if you think you already bored and you discovered ""everything"" pos Look up there are more planets.I love this type of space games and this one has enchanted me I will support it with all that I can. &lt 3",ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"This game is a beauty. Pre alpha currently but rocking hard. Couldn't say that about the abomination ""No Man's Sky"".",ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,4,True,Recommended,I've been playing for just one hour and I can say this game has great potential! It's very well developed for a pre alpha stage. It's fun and it has concrete survivability goals. Yes you need oxygen then energy then raw materials etc etc. It's pretty logical and pleasant.The only issue i came along with was the failure to join a friend's game for the online co op. But i hope it will be fixed soon.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Im not realy a fan of this type of sandbox games but Astroneer so far has proven to be a ton of fun. Once i get more hours put in ill update.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,22,True,Recommended,For an Early Access release the game has a lot for you to do which is nice having played many games from Early Access on Steam. Framerate does seem to be an issue after playing for a while but from what I've seen it has to do with placing tons of Tethers down in the game (They keep you connected to your base so you have constant O2 supply). Simple fix is just use them early on to find cave systems and spelunk a bit till you can build yourself a vehicle. I haven't gotten far enough yet to travel to other planets but my 4 hours on the starting one have been amazing. The random sandstorms that hit are tense if you happen to be a bit far from base making you scramble either for a nearby cave system or digging a hole and jumping in. Overall for the initial release this game was nicely polished which surprised me. Controls for a game are probably the weirdest aspect of the game vehicles especially but it's not at all hard to adapt. I should say I haven't tried it with controller just yet. If you have 20 dollars to burn and want a more peaceful look at a survival game Astroneer is mighty fine right out of the gate.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,18,True,Recommended,What a fun game to play this game have many thing to do and explore if u like are explorer then me recommended this game to u guy let enjoy it,ASTRONEER
2017-09-21,0,0,50,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Firstly I did recieve this game as a gift from a friend of mine. Take that as you will. If you don't wish to read the whole thing here is the short version. Like exploring? Mining? Minor Crafting? Well buy it. Personally I recommend it if you like those 3 things especially if it involves space exploration.In the games current state I would say ask yourself if it's worth it. As you can see the game is in it's Pre Alpha stage meaning bugs here and there and lack of content. I also recommend if you do get it to have some friends to play it with cause while playing it alone can be a relaxing experience playing it with friends is one of the better experiences I have had with it. While lately the new content in updates has been minor if any at all but as someone who went through a year of game design and programming it is not an easy task to make a game. The work the team is getting done is making the game a more enjoyable experience. My cousin and I got this game a few months ago deciding it would be worth supporting (We are both huge fans of space exploration) so when we got it we instantly fell in love with the art style. The songs that play are quite enjoyable as well and really add the the immersion of the game. Now to wrap up my rambling here are some features currently present in the gameFeatures Exploration Crafting(Simple crafting but still) Mining Online Co op(Up to 3 other people) Terrain adjustment(can also be included with mining)Now while that may seem like a list of things you would do in Minecraft this game I feel provides a more relaxed atmospheric experience also a major component of my enjoyment came from the ability to explore different planets.So again it is all on you do you want to support a Pre Alpha space exploration game If yes buy it if no don't if you still aren't sure watch the videos or look up some online. Get an idea of what goes on in the game before making the decision to support it and again it is much more enjoyable with friends.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-03,0,0,45,True,Recommended,What a wonderful little gem! It has a beautiful art style playful audio and a child like sense of wonderous exploration on a planet you gradually come to call home. I spent the first 5 hours or so playing with a friend and I'd HIGHLY recommend you do the same if possible. There's just something lovely about cooperative exploration and building.It IS still early in its development cycle so you'll likely cap out at some point having seen all the in game content so far. Do yourself a favour and pace your gameplay. This is a great proof of concept but it's shallow at the moment.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-03,0,0,167,True,Recommended,honestly it's a little Early Access gem and i'm glad it's consantly evolving,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,33,True,Recommended,This game is both adorable entertaining and pretty fun! Other nice thing is no violence so i can play it with my hippy friends without much conjoling,ASTRONEER

2017-06-03,0,0,35,True,Recommended,I really do like this game. That being said it is early access and can be buggy at times. The developer is very good about updates and hot fixes and the game has never been unplayable.I enjoy exploring the planets and going into deep caves and pulling out items to research or resources.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-03,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Great game,ASTRONEER
2017-06-03,0,0,66,True,Recommended,Still a lot of bugs but it is very well for a pre alpha,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I broke a rule I've had for a while now by buying this game making it the first Early Access game I've tried. So far I haven't been disappointed!I get the feeling that there may not be a ton to hold my interest over the very long term just yet. But hey as already stated Early Access!The sandbox and mechanics are fun and I'm looking forward to sinking some more time into ASTRONEER,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Very nice looking game with fun mechanics I am having lot's of fun playing it with a friend.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,32,True,Recommended,game looks awesome the concept is great early alpha so expect a few glithes.only real problem for me is the coop. If i start a world that my friends can join they cannot save the game or continue on it if i log out it shuts it down.If this is early alpha then i cant wait for the updates.,ASTRONEER
2017-07-28,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Ok it took from December 2016 to March 2018 to have a decent patch.But now thats it here the game has a new edge to it which is fun..Its a group game imo with more peeps it creates a fun atmosphere.With very little to actually kill you except plants in caves friends break up the grind.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,7,True,Recommended,There's still a bit of lag issues. I have specs well above recommended and every few minutes it will freeze. Beyong that it's still very addictive and fun I enjoyed playing it. I do wish there was a little more to do above ground but the caving is full of things to do. I also haven't gotten off the starting planet yet so I'm looking forward to seeing if other worlds have different things to offer.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Pleasantly surprised...For a pre alpha this is amazing. I was honestly expecting something completely different. No not a larch.This will be an excuse not to say too much more in this review. I will update this at a later date. However I can say that the visuals are superb audio is great and gameplay is solid.Cannot wait to see what they add in the future.*raises pint* Nice work System Era!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Unfortunately there's no escape from comparing this game to No Man's Sky so I'll just go ahead and say that yes I've enjoyed Astroneer a lot more than No Man's Sky from what little I've played of both games. The fact that this game ran fairly smooth despite being in pre alpha on my computer is a big plus.A few issues that I have with the game in its current state as of 19th Dec 2016 This is acknowledged by the devs but rover handling is fairly awkward and tends to spazz out occasionally. A single rover is easy enough to flip back if you mess up however if you ever decide to hook multiple rovers together like Mark Watney did in The Martian then you better make sure you drive as carefully as Mark Watney in The Martian otherwise you might find yourself dismounting every 30 seconds to flip your trailer back. Building is awkward to place and snapping is a bit erratic. I also don't think there are any ways to demolish a building once it's built in the current version so some level of pre planning is required. Some of the automatic snapping can also get annoying. For example I like to attach solar panel to the front slot on my rover however if I drive my rover's front end close to the vehicle bay the game automatically detaches the solar panel to make room for recharge cable. A minor inconvenience but a still annoying. Some of the early game materials are a bit luck based to go longer distances you want a rover which requires a vehicle bay which requires 2 aluminum easiest way to get aluminum in very early game is from spaceship wreckage however wrecks tend to be a bit spread out so if the two wrecks closest to you don't contain the 2 aluminum you need then you'll just have to build a long tether chain to get to the far away wrecks.That's about all the bigger issues I have with this game in its current stage as far as I'm aware the devs are fairly engaged with the fan base so it's quite likely that these issues will go away in future builds. For the moment I have to say I've had fun with this game. If I'm being absolutely honest here its current content alone cannot justify its current price tag however from what I've seen of the devs this game likely will reach a satisfactory level of completion in a reasonable time frame and I am cautiously optimistic about its future.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,80,True,Recommended,Even though the game crashes for me like every 15min this game is Awesome! I haven't come that far in to it but so far with everything you can explore... its really amazing. You should give it a try but wait untill it gets more stable.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,50,True,Recommended,I'm writing my first steam review in 7 years of using steam because of this game. I got Astroneer 3 days ago and already have 25+ hours logged. The game feels a lot like the alpha stages of minecraft. There is huge potential here and the game already has tons of fun content. The terrain deformation and manipulation is amazing and is hardly ever buggy. The Oxygen and Power mechanics work cleanly as well.Yes the game is in pre alpha. There are a lot of bugs. Multiplayer is unplayable on other planets. Your save file could be corrupted in multiplayer and become unplayable (maybe temporarly). Vehicles sometimes hilariously flip 8 times and launch into the sky never to come back. Despite all that it's the only thing I wanna do. In addition the devs are making frequent contact with the community and updating us on whats to come. Just today there was a live stream from a dev making a new discoverable crashed spacecraft. This game already has near the content of No Man's Sky and it's in pre alpha.This game is completely worth your money right now. Considering there will almost definately be a price hike get this game now before it's $40. In 6 months this game will be the new minecraft if the devs stay on top of their which I'm convinced they will after scouring the web for all their content and posts.*LIGHT SPOILERS FOLLOWING*In terms of content there are numerous structures modules and vehicles to research and build. As people have stated it wont take you long to see all the buildable things in the game. However there are also different planets each with different types of resources in different rarities. On Tundra the ice planet for example there is lots of rocket fuel just sitting on the surface to be mined. Theres a radiated planet an arid planet an exotic planet and a barren planet (the moon). Each has different plants trees terrain weather patterns and other unique details. For instance on the radiated planet since it's so close to the sun has faster day night cycles but its very windy. Easier to use wind power instead of solar. Theres also a pole with constant sunlight. These are just examples of the deeper world behind the content. Its very easy to become immersed and watch hours fly by. Yeah there's a lack of content but for pre alpha the worlds are abosuletly incredable. I cant stop playing this game. Seriously if you like minecraft or thought NMS would be cool buy this game you will not regret it. Okay back to building my subterranian warehouse..,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,20,True,Recommended,ITS REALLY REALLY FUN Cons it gets laggy after awhile for some reason,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,23,True,Recommended,This game has massive promise. Short playtime currently but the content that is already in is great. There are some bugs but I haven't crashed yet and I get 60fps. Really satisfying art style / visuals. I like that you can see electricity flowing through tethers or cables you see all your items instead of them just going into an invisible inventory. This game just does a lot of things right that make it a really satisfying game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,8,True,Recommended,This game is one of the funnest experiences i have had in a while bravo to the develpors. This is the first game of theirs that i have played (to my knowledge) and i was completely blown away by how amazing it it. I only have one proplem which is frame rate drops but that is a given in early access games. To anyone who likes exploration a catchy soundtrack and nice art and design in games I highly recommend this.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,86,True,Recommended,Have only run into a few minor issues but its still Early Access so that's kinda to be expected. Developers seem to be quite busy patching and fixing bugs. Otherwise its a fun and super chilled game,ASTRONEER

2017-01-02,0,0,462,True,Recommended,This game is very good. It's a good alternative to no man's sky if you have a weak pc or laptop. My inspiron 14 5000 can run it at very low fps (5 to 20 is my guess). The game itself is amazing and has a lot of potential. It could use some more optimization which I'm sure we'll see later on. Overall great game. Can be played on weaker pcs if you don't mind the lag.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-19,0,0,26,True,Recommended,"This game is brilliant and just what I have been waiting for. Why?Preamble Well for the longest time now I (and my gameward comrades) have been waiting for something quick and fun to play rather than Rocket League now don't get me wrong I frickin love Rocket League but its been quite a while now of endlessly smashing the ball about and arguing about whos going to stay in the goal so to have something to pour some time into which isnt over in 5 minutes comes as a welcome relief I think in the Astoneer we may have found a lump of gold! Why Firstly it is very visually stimulating the graphics are balanced just right between cutesy and practical and this lends to the fun Gameplay. Its not quite ""visually stunning"" but goes a good way towards being fully convincing and is sufficiently pretty to keep you fully engaged from standing on a plato and viewing the vast valley below and gazing up at the stars and other to be explored planets above to wandering deep into the depths of the ""earth"" within the vast cave systems the visuals are pretty dam good and do a great job of conveying the experience of what its like to be alone on a atmoshereless planet although any of those in doubt about the visuals should bear in mind that the strengths of this game lie within the intoxicating good gameplay.The Gameplay is great (did i mention it was fun?) just the right balance between quizzical and testing that lends to extended periods into the early hours for ""just got to do this first then i will definately definately go to bed"". The bulk of which will be exploring which there is an exuberant amount of in order to progress and which is fun and interesting.The games progression rate is very well balanced in my view from the early days of locating compounds next to your base in ""Eureka"" style moments from which you then learn to craft new buildings and facilities. This progress inevitably encourages the desire for ""more stuff"" and generally gravitates towards the production of far reaching air/power lines around the ""local"" area in order to facilitate more efficient collecting of a sufficient amount of materials to fabricate indeed more machines is very rewarding and the sandbox nature allows you to progress at your chosen rate and doesn't force anything onto the player. Inevitably you will end up collecting enough resources to produce that mobile lander you wanted from the start and it will seem great but then you realise it needs more storage you need a trailer!! (out you go again!) Then additional vehicle tools to help harvest the resources (I will go to bed in a minute.....) you will be absorbed with the conquest of land and apparent never ending requirement for more resources the great thing is these are fun to collect and look for and is the essence of the game. Playing single player is great and you can achieve all the things you need on your own however if you have a couple of buddies and if you can get a team of you working together then this quickly ramps up the progression speed and the enjoyment factor another couple of notches (understatement detected!).My own experience of the game went a bit like this.Friend sent a link to the game saying ""Buy This"" I buy it and download then meet him on the planet all within 15 minutes or so. I ask ...Q ""What do I have to do?""A ""Search for Composite so we can make a doobry""Long story short about 6 hours later we step out of the orbital lander craft on the other side of the planet this would have been great however we failed to bring sufficient amount of fuel for the return journey this was a massive oversight on our part but our goal had been to get into space pretty much since we started out 6 hours previous. In between the link being sent and ending up on the other side of the planet we had a whole heap of fun collecting exploring innovating crafting and dying and would 100% click the link again.Super excited to see what the Alpha Beta and final game bring to the best ""Pre Alpha"" game I have ever played...",ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,7,True,Recommended,This game has amazing potential and would be absolutely amazing but a major issue that should be fixed is all the fps issues that you get when you are in game. As soon as this issue is fixed which I'm sure it will as the game is still in Pre Alpha it will be amazing and my favourite game. But from what I've been able to see it has been amazing with lots of places to explore and things to createJust be careful when buying this game at this stage as it has plenty of glitches yet some are quite hilarious others are just annoying e.g the fps issue,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Basically everything No Man's Sky was missing except well made and crafted. I haven't had any FPS issues or any game crashes I think some people are having those issues though. A patch was released recently to fix that though.First 5 minutes of the game You pick your astronaut model there's 5 choices I think.Your astronaut and his/her pod fly down to a planet and land in usually a good starting area.That pod becomes your 'home' you can save your game by entering it as well as escape dangerous weather.You then gather a few resources to expand your base it takes 1 minute to gather what you need.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This is honestly the best game i have played in years. I bought and downloaded it and suddenly my internet went out at about 11 pm. I totally forgot about the game for about an hour trying to figure out the problem. After i found out i would get the internet back at around 5 am because my isp was fixing something i decided to boot up the game. I thought i would check it out for ten minutes before going to bed. 10 minutes turned into hours and suddenly it was 7 am. I had totally forgot to go to sleep and my internat was now back yay. I wanted to finish up and go to bed bud suddenly it was 8 pm. I had to force myself to shut down my pc and quit the game. TL DR Best game i have played in years would recomend it to everyone.Only issue is massive fps drops when placing a lot of tethers. One of the devs said he was working on it so if you are reading this review a couple days after launch it probably isn't an issue.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-06,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Probably one of the best Early Accress games I've ever played. At the moment the game is in Pre Alpha and I am blown away by how smooth the gameplay is. Also the multiplayer is flawless. I haven't run into a single issue with this game. The graphics are simple yet the abstract shapes and vibrant contrasting colors have a huge impact. The game's OST is beautiful and fits the mood of the game well.If you are looking for a fast paced epic surival crafting game this probably isn't the game for you. However if you enjoy exploring researching constructing and space adventure games you'll love ASTRONEER. I would recommend this game to any casual gamer AND hardcore gamer looking for a solid space exploration game. Can't wait to see where the devs take it. To infinity and beyond!!,ASTRONEER
2017-06-03,0,0,59,True,Recommended,one of the most addicting games i have ever played,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,120,True,Recommended,I played someone elses version of this before I bought it so I have an additional 30 hours.This game is an example of how amazing No Man's Sky could have been if they had focused on maybe a few dozen or even a few hundred planets and making them all unique and interesting. Everything is so polished for a pre alpha and it just sprung up with little to no hype so the expectations were nonexistent. The fact that you can stick anything into any slot whether it's a production module or your backpack or your rover it all just works. the scenery and atmosphere are gorgeous and make for some really awesome moments. I love how the planets are actually spherical and you can see the curvature of them when you climb high mountains. Multiplayer is the finishing touch and although I haven't played with anyone else yet I have seen enough videos online to know that it's gonna be great when they add more features and possibly pvp.TLDR This game is worth every penny,ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,17,True,Recommended,As the developers mentioned this game is in Pre Alpha...They need to build a wall.That aside this game is worth it for its fun core gameplay.Buy it it will be Great one day Trust Me,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,6,True,Recommended,This is truely a fantastic game. It shows potential for the future and the devs seem committed in updating it. That said it has no tutorial or in game wiki of any kind (also due to how new this game is at the time that I'm writing this review there's no internet wiki either). The game gives you plenty of things to explore and do but doesn't really tell you how to do them. I'm convinced that there is a total of 3 sentences in this entire game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,4,True,Recommended,This game is an absolute must buy for anyone that likes to build bases resource manage and explore lovable and colorful worlds! Even for just coming out on early acess this game has a ton of content and is playable for hours even through the single player. Although playing this game with friends makes the experience so much more awesome.The only downgrades that i can give this game is that there are some bugs that are on the edge of being gamebreaking. Like for one you can't have two people driving trucks at the same time the game engine can't handle that at the moment. And sometimes your charachter can get stuck in buildings and you have to relogg and collect your gear.But for an early access game that came out yesterday from the moment im writing this review its a definete must buy for all who loves base building resource managing exploration sims!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,37,True,Recommended,Well done... need more content... But worth a Buy.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,0,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Fun game and I am still learning about this game and dev can you make the next update about graphic because it lagging for me to load the terrain,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,39,True,Recommended,I love this game! the amazing colors and the art style is great not to mention the gameplay and the way it has you progress. sure there's a learning curve but once you get you understanding how to play then you will fall In love with it as well.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,11,True,Recommended,theres needs to be more options to allow for a more smooth running experience and it needs to actually save my options but overall its an amazing game and is what no mans sky shouldve been.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,33,True,Recommended,I may have played it for a solid day so far but i still havent found everything. Its surprisingly big for the stage of development that its in and the dev crew really know what theyre doing. I first bought it when the game was buggy as hell and now i can happily play it for hours.I dont know if people should buy it at the moment because of its early access but its definitely a game everyone should have a look at when its complete.Well worth the money imo.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-09,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Like no mans sky but more fleshed out and with multiplayer. But it's still empty exploration with no real enemy or challenge. I gave up after 1 hour and realized it wasnt for me. Refunded,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,"Summary ASTRONEER is a beautiful game that shows immense promise. Unfortunately that is all it has to offer at this time.In depth The presentation of this game is wonderful. Its visuals are colorful and stylistic. The sound design especially the music is simply sublime. These elements combine to create a world that evokes curiosity along with a child like sense of awe.The User Interface (UI) is among the most intuitive I have ever seen in a game. Everything follows the principal of ""what you see is what you get"". Items are stored as themselves attached to containers and the player character's backpack in a manner similar to a peg board. The character's oxygen meter is depicted as a clearly visible blue bar on their backpack. Energy is shown as a glowing yellow fluid like material that drains upon use. There are almost no numbers shown in the game or any kind of abstraction at all for that matter. This contributes to the atmosphere by keeping things purely visual and not distracting the player with the details behind the game's mechanics.Gameplay is where this title falls short. There simply is not enough content at this point to justify its price. You wander about the planet you start on and gather resources. You use resources to build the dozen or so structures available as well as four vehicles. Later you gain the option of traveling to nearby worlds which while aesthetically distinct only present a slight change to gameplay. You can morph terrain as much as you please explore and build the structures described earlier. That is all. Unlike many similar sandbox titles (e.g. Space Engineers) building is clearly not a focus of the game so I do not see much outlet for creative expression. Similarly once the novelty of a world has run out there is little point to exploring every nook and cranny of it.In short the game looks great and plays well but there just isn't enough to hold your interest for very long. I cannot recommend buying this game at this point because of that. Perhaps in the future when (and if) the game matures my opinion will change but as it stands I would recommend you hold off purchasing it for now.",ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,21,True,Recommended,GG System Era multiplayer is a bit iffy though. If I get in a truck with someone I fall to the core of the planet or the truck enters the 5th dimension and kills me otherwise it's good,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Honestly I don't know where to start with this game. Astroneer is THE BEST early access game I have ever played and it has so much potential! If you previously owned No Mans Sky (If so I'm sorry for you) then your in for a real treat. Astroneer is super chill 4 person multiplayer and you have the freedom to do whatever you want. If you have $20.00 Pick up the game now!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Very enjoyable... part survival part base builidng part exploration/research. Excellent considering pre alpha.... seen released games with less promise and features than what Astroneer has delivered right off the start. Congrats to the devs.There is enough in game help to get you started but you have to explore and work at it not handed to you on a plate. Prepare to try some things and die! You'll be the better for it ),ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Pre Alpha Realease Review In it's current state this is simple but God the potential of this game is insane. The game is gorgeous no story to speak of save the small excerpt that it's a gold rush set in the 25th century. But honestly that is all it needs. There is no reason to dig deeper it's actually solid I am sure it may be expounded upon further down the line but until then I think this is sufficient. I like this excerpt from the developersOriginally posted by SES Reshape terrain as though it were made of Play Doh. It didn't occur to me but they abouslutely pulled that feeling off it feels like you're a sculptor. This game is art it is your art it is the developer's art I say let's enjoy this journey with the developers together. I know I will try to regularly assisst them in making this a great game and I hope they get all the support they need I don't want to see this project die (knock on wood). And a last parting note I want to say as I looked around the game I saw passion written all over it as an aspiring game designer this is what I want to have one day in my games boundless passion for the world that is created. Phenomenal job SES you are on my radar for good. I will update my reviews on this as it is developed I hope they make magic happen.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This game is really fun 9/10 but theres one main problem for me this game NEEDS a MAP or an arrow pointing to your base. I was out exploring for research things and I fell in the largest cave I think exists in the game I was in a truck and had 3 new researches so I wasn't leaving it took me an 1 hour and a 1/2 to find them. So im in a cave tring to dig a tunnel to get my truck out and I had to search 15 mins to find a place near the surface(based on the color of the ground) I then end up digging out at the top of a mountain which is my fault and not supposde to happen but then I can't see my base icon. So im on a mountain and I have no orientation of where I am it then took me 2 hours to find my base and i wasn't gonna kill myself. I had some rare resources and multiple new researches. So during those 2 hours it was very laggy (I rendered a MASSIVE amount of terrain) and barely keeping up with my power needs for the truck and I run into 5 sandstorms where I can't do anything because I can't see.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,50,True,Recommended,I really enjoy this game. It's similar to minecraft but with less stuff to do. I know that there's more in the cards though!Overall I would recommend this game if you enjoy games like minecraft.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Really amazing game it's in prealpha but looks promising,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,50,True,Recommended,At the moment this game is in pre alpha but it's still insanely fun. At 20 bucks it's definitely a steal. Yes there are some quirks/bugs/glitches but this game is only going to get better. The controller support is great and multiplayer adds a lot of fun and depth. I will definitely be playing this game a lot and hope to see it grow.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-06,0,0,10,True,Recommended,This is hella fun for what they've given us already. Can't wait to see more in later builds!,ASTRONEER

2017-01-07,0,0,90,True,Recommended,RECCOMENDED!!!I know this game is in pre alpha but it is still one of the best games i have ever played !!!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,7,True,Recommended,I very much like the game. It has a unique atmosphere with a pretty feasible dynamic so it's not very hard to start from the beginning. I hope eventually when this game is finished that there is tons and tons of content because I've already pretty much run out of things to do. Overall a good 8/10 in my opinion.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Pretty fun looking forward to more features. Tho I managed to break he game. I built like around 500+ Tethers in my save. And well The game went from 60fps solid over a short while to 18fps. With a i5 6600K at 4.0ghz and a GTX 970. MY recommendation is to not make more than 500+ Tethers. But a few houndred less yeah.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Game is great. Became a bit addicting actually! Needs some improvements in some areas many people have had the same issues with stuff but it is the early release. Much like Warthunder when it released. Visuals are great soundtrack it awesome. Hopefully they add to the soundtrack though. does become repetitive.For $20 its a great game to get into or kill time with.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,A well crafted alpha. Clearly a passion project for the developers with a unique art style and loads of potential. Looking forward to what System Era has in store for the future. Can't speak for overall optimization but I'm averaging 50fps on 3440x1440 with a GTX 1080 during sandstorms.UPDATE SEP2017 Little new content in months no reason to come back to playing this. Unfortunately I can no longer recommend Astroneer as there is too little content to justify purchasing it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"Good game lacks content. The art style is nice base building is simplistic but also nice animations are fairly polished vehicles are working fairly well.There are few types of planets and each is slightly different.I was able to unlock every planet and research within couple of hours. When I buy games I always expect the price to be proportional to playtime right now there's about 6 7 hours of playtime before you reach the ""endgame"".There should be minimun of 20 hours of content for a 20 euro game.Buy if you want to support this game as it's in ""pre alpha"".If it truly is in a ""pre alpha"" then this game shows a lot of promise.",ASTRONEER

2017-01-07,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Hi. I love this game. But my laptop lack of requirements for this game. Im using vai VPCEG38FG E series and it has a very low spec i5 processor and vga. I wonder if you guys can add the lower spec mode for people like me?,ASTRONEER
2017-02-08,0,0,221,True,Recommended,Meh was fun for 2 hours,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Astroneer more like the No Mans Sky that everyone wanted. This game is pretty good for the price but i think there is a little more content that is missing. content like more planets vehicles storage crafting items and the most wanted base building materials. The game is pretty fast paced once you know how to build things and exc. The multiplayer when joining into a friends match sometimes seems to make your character glitch out through the map which makes you die because of suffocation. This wont be a problem for very long because the developer's are pushing out updates frequently.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Pretty cool game. Got a lot of potential. It will be awesome once they bring more content to it.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-20,0,0,37,True,Recommended,I only have 4 hours on this game but it's amazing. I almost have two complete bases on opposite ends of a planet and I plan on moving to a different planet soon. I highly recommend this game because it is a great time killer and lots of fun.,ASTRONEER
2017-09-27,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Soo Astroneer... Hell of a fun little game. It s easy to learn runs smooth ons u tweak up the fps in the ini file. My fps was limited to 60 fps im now running 144 fps in 1440p. I started 2 days ago and havent been able to put the game down it is very fun. Hopefuly the dev will begin to add more things to the game cuz this game has huge potential. Would i recommend this game to anyone ? hell yes. The price is fair also. 8/10 is my rateing.,ASTRONEER
2017-08-20,0,0,16,True,Recommended,This is a very interesting game just learning the mechanics and just exploring. Still looking for a content update but it's been clear that the dev team has been focusing on optimization lately due to the fact that the game has had many graphics settings updates. Since I first began this game a few months ago this game has been running smoothy since the many optimization updates. I truly believe that this will develop into a very exciting and fun game once the team gets out of the optimization phase and begins to focus on adding more content such as PvE base building and such.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Astroneers is fun and cute.There's a handful of bugs right now in pre alpha but there's nothing that would prevent you from enjoying this fantastic game. For example my truck train went crazy flipping around and then magically went into the sky and stayed there.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Needs a lot of work. Has potential. Noticed a lot of glitches from just 2 hours of playing the game. Multiplayer works great but could use improvement. Some glitches I found were falling through the world or getting stuck inside of structures and ending up either having to start from last save or completly restart. Give the game time and it will be gud.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,8,True,Recommended,love this game!!!!!!!!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,64,True,Recommended,I love this game. Absolutly love it but i do have an issuewith some weird stuttering. Now I have a Intel 6700k and radeon r9 fury and it studders at my base (which is a decent size). So if the makes are reading this pls optimize better. Or if this is a issue that I can fix message me.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-07,0,0,0,True,Recommended,This is an amazing game and surely can become even greater with time but i do have one gripe that is my own fault which is the framerate...my computer isnt made for games with amazing graphics such as these so a little more graphic changing would be favorable but otherwise this is one of the better games ive ever played,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,15,True,Recommended,This game is awsome! One of the best sand boxes I have seen in quite some time. I think it would apeal to all due to its simplicity. The fact that you dont have an objective means that the player can take their time or go digging for caves from the start. Some may say it is like minecraft but in SPACE! Would recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-04,0,0,36,True,Not Recommended,So when the game released it showed epic amounts of initiative. Like this is the first game using this idea (that I know of). It has been a couple of months decided to try again and check on progress. The game crashes in a multiplayer session every 5 minutes.. When the game just released this was not the issue performance was a more pressing matter. At the moment it in unplayable. Yes I know its EA but progress with regards to stability was not made.. So with a heavy heart I give my negative review. Will however ammend when the situation changes. This is a review of the current state of the game.,ASTRONEER

2017-06-04,0,0,6,True,Recommended,"Purchasing this product was a hard decision over many months of it sitting in my wishlist. My first impressions of the game falls into the ""hmmm what the is this?"" catergory but was instantly lured in by the""oh im about to die of suffocation!"" element.The game starts with no instructions needed and provides well placed hints. After the first few deaths one should realize the back pack is very important.The game is in alpha and you'll be able to tell. Grapics well not too shaby even after underclocking my CPU and GPU the game played great no stuttering or screen tears. i7 4770k 2 of 4 cores at 2.5ghzGTX 1080 SC underclocked by 25% both memory and clock speedGameplay is difficult even with the game the hints.

2016-12-20,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Very nice LEGO like exploration game.

2016-12-20,0,0,19,True,Recommended,LOVE IT,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Let me start off by saying this game is extremely fun with freinds.With that being said playing alone is still enjoyable. For an early access game (which I'm always iffy about early access) It's everything I was hoping for. The soundtrack is beautiful by itself but when combined with the visuals it becomes so much better. One of my favorite things are the sunrises in the game. If you catch them at the right time you'll witness something spectacular. Wanna build a giant land bridge to that mountain way over there? Go for it. You want to build a garage/hanger out of dirt for your vehicles? It can be done. There's a lot you can do.Unlike some other games once I've done everything I can in one save starting a new world still feels fresh and not repetative. And if you have friends playing along and keeping you entertained during the game it gets so much better.It's really easy to get use to the controls and start adventuring.Now onto the bad.The camera inside of tight caves can get bothersome at times but it's nothing too serious. And the only time I've encounter major bugs is when I was playing in my friend's world. Though that could be a connection issue and not the game itself. So be aware when plays with friends. The driving controls for the rovers can get quite annoying as well.SET DOWN BEACONS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. There's nothing more frustrating in this game than setting out in your fancy new rover with a second small rover attached with a crane and drill head AND GETTING LOST. I spent two and a half hours trying to find my home base. I eventually found it but the moral of the story is set up beacons and tethers to avoid that headache. Hopefully in the future we'll get some type of portable map system or something relatable.There are times this game can repetative such as finding every element and nothing left to do with them. Though I'm sure with being early access more resources and elements will come out in future updates.All in all With the updates they've been pushing the visuals and soundtrack and all the bugs I've seen I firmly believe this game is worth the price. And I'd highly recommend it to firends.For me this game comes in at a solid 9 out of 10.,ASTRONEER
2017-08-24,0,0,44,True,Recommended,This game is fun but there's not a whole lot to do in it yet.I've also been encountering some bugs so i suggest waiting a few more updates before buying it.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-03,0,0,6,True,Recommended,The game is great ive played about 3 hours worth and im still finding and learning new stuff! Just make sure you dont build upward where you are standing or youll fall through the map,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,24,True,Recommended,This game is what no man's sky should have been. It's Super Cute and awesome at the same time. You can do tons of stuff and it's only early alpha. AND it also supports a lot of languages so early in developpement. I recommend 100% purchase rate. (This sentence was not correct but I don't care)BUY IT NOW,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,215,True,Recommended,This is a fun and addicting game that you will not stop playing. I figured this out because after 3 days of having the game I have played over 40 hours of it. I promise you won't regret the purchase.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,20,True,Recommended,no mans sky but actually no mans sky,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Fun game with tons of potential.With time adding more raw materials and things to build this game will go from great to awesome.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Cant blame anything for early access. With all honesty its got alot to do and not that buggy compared to all these other early access garbages that get released. Look at H1Z1 King of the kill and all the money people have donated to it. Great game but all they do is sink more over priced items into it instead of focusing on the issues. This game is constantly updating and worrying about the game and doing well. Enjoying it.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Very fun. Much good. Wow,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,2,True,Recommended,put it on switch,ASTRONEER
2017-08-27,0,0,29,True,Recommended,8/8 gr8 game. Really buggy but when it is actually released this game will be insane.,ASTRONEER
2017-08-27,0,0,46,True,Recommended,Yes there isn't very much content and I will fully agree with everyone who may say that. However this game has so much potential I'm very exited with how the game is going to turn out and what objectives will be added. I have been playing for right around four days and have 35 hours as of this moment. Still love this game even though the games RNG hates me the most out of every game I've played (though every games RNG hates me so not to much more different in that sence compared to couple other games). Please keep adding more features slowly but surely and keeping all of this comunity informed on your progress consistantly.(P.S. It would be incredible if you guys can make it so that those crashed ships can be repaired and use able ( like the gaint crashed satilite dish) that would be a great start for objectives and content).,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,76,True,Recommended,A really fun game in the early stages of development. Because it is an early access game somethings don't appear to have a purpose. I look forward to seeing how this game grows and develops.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,37,True,Recommended,So far Astroneer is a great little sandbox game with crafting and terraforming elements. Early days yet but I'm really enjoying it. Read some reviews saying this is what No Mans Sky shouldve been. Not sure aboout that but this is pre alpha. Not sure what features they'll introduce down the track.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Very glitchy but has extreme potential. I have fallen in love with the simplicity of this beautiful game. One of the best games I have ever played by far.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Several bugs need to be fixed geometry problems occur however it's still really an entertaining and beautiful game for just being in alpha. I would definitely recommend this game if you are into art style and freeworlds though you may need to have a decent pc in order to run the game. 8/10 can't wait for the official release.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,6,True,Recommended,This game is so cute and so good. 11/10 Would recommend!!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Really fun exploration/base building game. Focused on managing oxygen and inventory beautiful worlds. 8/10 in it's current form works on my Intel/NVIDIA build well. Would recommend.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,19,True,Recommended,It's a great game but you run out of things to do pretty quickly. I would recommend waiting for a few more updates before getting it.BUYER BEWARE if your planning to get it and possibly refund it Also the latest update has introduced an issue that makes it so Astroneer keeps running on your system even after you close the game. I had to kill the process 4 times in task manager before it went away. I only noticed it because discord said I was playing astroneer for 6 hours longer then I was.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,49,True,Recommended,its awesome no crashing and its really fun!!!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-16,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Good game my son loves it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Great game. Provides hours of fun and exploration. You can literally do anything you want exploration wise. My brother and I have created a very deep and very extensive tunnel system on our planet connecting multiple caverns. Definitely recommend this game.Pre Alpha so of course it's a bit buggy occasionally. But it's worth every penny.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Product received for free. 7/10 amazing but laggy and bugs but just released so yea....,ASTRONEER

2016-12-29,0,0,22,True,Recommended,Very relaxing enjoyable and somewhat minimalistic surival esque game.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,56,True,Recommended,you know it gets old after a while but i cant stop thinking about this damn game,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,17,True,Recommended,After watching a few YouTube videos on Astroneer I decided to buy it on release day. We all know what early access means or we should know before purchasing. Bugs and 'weird' gameplay are to be expected which the devs iron out. Been playing for 1 hour so far and I can honestly say that this game is awesome! I haven't come across any bugs other than I got stuck inside a printer table for a few seconds lol. Frame rate runs at a solid 62 fps and at 60fps with VSYNC on (hasn't dipped under 60fps as yet).So in a nutshell a super polished early access game that shows great promise!My Specs i7 6700k16 gig 2133 RamMSI GTX 970 4G Gaming graphics card.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Fantastic game so far. Needs more content right now but as a starting point I love it!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,15,True,Recommended,One of the coolest games i have ever seen ESPECIALLY for early access. The game with evey start has a diffrent world littarly waiting for you. The bring something new to the table every time you play it brings something new to the table makeing long and extetensive playthrough better as you travel between planets or even explore your first. Withcrash sites in unexpected places which bring useful tools to the table. A great game even one that beats minecraft by a mile especially since its not out yet.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game is reaLLY FUN!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,17,True,Recommended,This is still a work in progress but its amazing what they have so far. I bought this game along with all the Nekopara games and In 3 days ive already played Astroneer for 10.2 hours. The gameplay is great the animaations are great The rocket manovering is a little poor but the system era team said that will be fixed some time in the future. As an early accass game I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes building exploration or someone who just wants to spend some time in a neet way. Great game.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-25,0,0,16,True,Recommended,bought the game put 13 hours in day one... do i really need to say more? No but i will. Are there bugs? yeah. Does it need more content? yeah.Does the music sound like Human music? very much so lolNeeds to be optimized? of course its early access.The inventory system is exellent.The crafting animations are an excellent touch.The vehicles are a lot of fun.My only 2 real complaints is the lack of danger through combat or from a survival aspect. i will give it that im still not far on the first planet but some combat would be fun and mix it up a little more. 1.Maybe a more cartoon/mario style combat where we use our guns to lob objects at things. Something that fits the more nintendo like style youve adopted. That way we are not just minning to craft bigger things to mine deeper... we could build bigger things to fight bigger things or even just to defent our base from bigger things. Just dont do Mobs. a monster as rare as wreckege would probably even be a bit much...2.As for the survival part i think the plant matter could be used for food as well. at least tier 1 food paste. then work up to some type of greenhouse or potted plants. The oxygen SHOULD be water. then we could use the extractor to get O2. instead of it just lying aorund like ore... idk wtf tyou guys were thinking on that one lol. missed opportunity there. The power on the ground and from the dangerous (if you can really call them that...) plants should be something radioactive or exotic and be a more rare resouce. Possibly hazardous to handle and take special equipment.All in all i can tell im gonna love this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Great game! BUT i want to be able to change the graphic settings!!!otherwise its great!!ps the game crashes often,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,14,True,Recommended,First Minutes into the game.Planet? Nice! Oh! Space grass! And then... space storm!This game reaches into my heart somehow and makes me want to explore it.The animations are wonderful the base building is interesting and getting some cars/shuttles to play with is just down right fun. I'd recommend this anyday.BTW the music it is amazing.Also have never really reviewed anything so this thing is worth a review!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-21,0,0,49,True,Recommended,Very fun hours and hours of it. I played 2 hours straight non stop. It never ends the amounts of things you have to do and everything it s not easy but I like a challenge. So much too explore and so much to do keep up the good work and hope you add more in the future &lt 3,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,11,True,Recommended,I've played this game for very little time as to the games I normally play however this game is simply amazing. Beautiful game and the time I first got lost in caves was terrifying but amazing. I wish there was more on this game posted around but it's a very new game and information isn't all over the place.Jump in and go explore and die and do it again and again. One word of advice go into caves or your capsule when a sand storm comes.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Great foundation for what could be an amazing game just lacking content and stability but what is expected for early acsess.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,0,True,Recommended,Astroneer has a great potential but it's not ready to play right now. I am not going to defile the fun that I am gonna take from Astroneer. I will buy it again when it's ready.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-26,0,0,16,True,Recommended,great game loads of fun with a interesting comical style. not too complicated with simple shapes and colors. reccomended for 15 20$ good fun with friends for a few hours,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,88,True,Recommended,It's good.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,0,True,Recommended,Not as beautiful as ABZU....but the one potential that the Developers add in to this wonderful (Pre Alpha) game is the atmosphere.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-16,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Astroneer is an open world space sandbox game that lets you build bases mine materials fly to other planet which I found really fun to play with friends. Some aspects of of the game is really buggy where you go flying in the air it's a bit laggy as well I can't really complain because if still in early alpha though I reckon this game still has a lot of potenial. I enjoy walking around in the breathtaking scenery and listening to nice space music!!!!! Highly recommend it for an early access game,ASTRONEER
2017-10-16,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Good game. Needs more content. And to be a bit less laggy on multilayer aswell as single player.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-16,0,0,29,True,Recommended,great game! developers are working very hard to improve it. regular updates and new content from time to time.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,172,True,Recommended,It only takes a fewminutes of gameplay to confirm that this is going to be an absolutely awesome game! Even though it is still in early access the developers have done a fantastic job and I cannot wait to see how the game progresses. I would have to say that this is just about the happiest I have been with one of my Steam purchases in a while. To the developers Keep up the great work! And to the potential buyers Don't waste another minute you won't regret purchasing this game!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,35,True,Recommended,I like it too much.This game give everyone to imagination and creative.Enjoy with friend XD.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Honestly when I bought this game I thought to myself like omg this game looks so fun but in my mind i felt like it was going to be one of those games that looks fun and shows all this cool stuff but you cant really do all that but when i played this game it was amazing. Yes the game has some bugs like falling through the world and not being able to see some stuff sometimes but dont let that get to you. the game developers will fix those bugs so dont hate the game cause it has bugs or dont get it cause your friends say there is too many bugs and the best part in my opinion is the multiplayer feature. me and my friend were playing this and having so much fun even when we die to debra(ignore spelling if its wrong) and fall through the world. This game has it own thing for everyone. So pls tell ur friends to buy and play with you and dont think the game is not worth $20. The game itself it really good and yes i agree $20 is quite alot but when u get into the game you wont even seem to care about how much money you payed for the game. Now that my comment is ending i want to say i give this game 9/10 cause you cant save your character on your friends world in multiplayer and trust what i say. I know ive said alot of pros and cons but the cons are going to fixed no time and the pros just show im not lying and the game is really worth your buck and the time you spend on it. Ive already spend 10hrs in the past 3 4 days. Cya and ty for reading my commend all the way ik its a long one but i really enjoy this game one more tiny thing(ik i said i was done) if you think this game is ez just wait till you get deeper into the game and they will add mobs soon but there are plenty of things that kill you already.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Great game but at current state needs more content and some major bug fixes to be completely worth money.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,168,True,Recommended,It is my favorite game. But I would wait until it comes out of alpha. and if it never does which is possible then get it on a sale.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"So far this game has been great. I havent had any crash or framerate issues yet and it runs very smoothly. I have seen a few minor bugs that are slightly annoying but no gamebreaking (some are prettty hilarious though). The art style for the game is very simplistic yet still very interesting and at times even beautiful. I love the unique style of ""GUI"" that is used as I haven't seen it executed so well in any game I've played before. I know that all the people at System Era are working hard on this game and can't wait to see what the future holds for it!",ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Not too much playtime in yet but from what i've experienced so far its a lot of fun. The game is very atmospheric and relaxed. Not a game you'll want to challenge yourself or stay on your toes. Its simplicity makes it a nice chill co op game also. There are some crashes and bugs but nothing that has killed my interest. If this is what pre alpha looks like then i'm sure the final product will be gorgeous.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Really funnnnnn DDDDD,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Amazingly fun game for an early access! So much fun and easy to understand with very little instruction.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-16,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Great game!I just wish i could attach rovers to shuttles so i can move around in different planets!,ASTRONEER
2017-10-16,0,0,19,True,Recommended,For being early access it's one of the few that has amazing developers. The game is also well made and wonderful sandbox experience. In the games current state there is not a lot of activities available for you to do so if you are wanting that out of astroneer I would highly suggest waiting for a later version of the game that is going to give you endless hours of fun. If you're looking for a game that is going to give you maybe 10 20 hours of space exploration gameplay then this is for you.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-17,0,0,30,True,Recommended,I have been playing this game for a while now and am still suitably interested. The game itself runs pretty smoothly with few major bugs pretty good for a pre alpha. Only issue is the sandbox begins to feel lonely as you are the only sentient being on all of your available planets. I hope the developers add creatures to have to face off against. You will find that you figure out most of the content quick which can leave it feeling rather redundant. It's like minecraft in space without monsters (yet hopefully).,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Game is fun but buggy. I've played for about 4 hours and I've seen just about everything so far (which I completely expected in early access). A couple of mechanics in the game annoy me such as fall damage especially on planets with lower gravity the camera can get pretty nasty when you're holding an object as well. Other than that it's a pretty good time. Looking forward to more content in the future.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Shows a lot of promise even in its early state. Awesome devs awesome game.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-26,0,0,45,True,Recommended,This is one of the best games I have played. Before some of the updates it wasn't my favorite but ever since the base building update I have loved it. This is a great game if you love games like minecraft but you don't like challenges. It is a game where you have to grind a lot but that is something I love about it.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-24,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Incredible game! Very pleasing visually great soundtrack interesting but not too complex gameplay. It's cool how there is literally no instructions or tutorials but you can still progress. For advanced info there is a great wiki on gamepedia. Totally recommend!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,26,True,Recommended,I might not have a lot of playtime as of writing this but im really enjoying the game so far. It looks beatiful and exploring is a lot of fun. My GTX 660 runs the game fine a couple of stutters every now and then but i have yet to experience severe framedrops or visual glitches etc...There are hardly any video options yet You can adjust the draw distance of the foliage resolution fullscreen yes/no and vsync. The rendering of objects still needs work since thin ground on cliffs for example isnt loaded when further away while the plants on top of it are making it look like theyre stuck in mid air.But then again its early access for a reason. The gameplay is pretty solid already though. Its up to you wether you want to spend 20$ on this yet. Id recommend you buy it and at least give it a shot since it really deserves it.I also heard of a free demo in the windows store or something so uhh... If there is one go get that first. P,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,32,True,Recommended,I'm not usually a fan of crafting/survival games. But this game is charming fun to play and instantly addicting. For a pre alpha game it is pretty stable and no major bugs cropped up during my play.Gameplay is intuitive and you choose your own difficulty/experience by how you play. The world is fun to explore and present reasonable challenges. The only thing I'm not sure is the depth of gameplay but I haven't explored the research path yet.On the technical side the game runs very smoothly on a GTX 1070 1440p. I had issues with resolution until I changed the Astro.exe to disable DPI scaling and manually changed the resolution in %USERPROFILE% AppData Local Astro Saved Config WindowsNoEditor GameUserSettings.ini.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,65,True,Recommended,Fun game recommended. I've encountered a bug when ever my oxygen is recharging it goes into a sort of feedback loop of sound. Like when you have a microphone and speaker too close. So far that's the only negative I've found.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,14,True,Recommended,I'm only getting started but already I'm really liking this game even if it's in alpha and a little rough around the edges. I had a tense experience as I fell down a hole in my journey to find some resin. It was both exciting and scary as I was trying to find my way out of the ground. I found a jackpot of resources and research items but had to pass on a lot of them so I could keep mining oxygen and power. Then I fell down yet another level and figured I was gonna die alone in some cave but I kept moving and was finally able to get back to ground level only to realize my capsule was no where in sight. Luckily I had mined enough oxygen to have enough time to be able to run around some mountains where I was thankfully able to find my capsule. Now It's time for a cigarette break to calm my nerves.So yeah I'd recommend it,ASTRONEER
2017-10-17,0,0,22,True,Recommended,Its very nice gameDuring about 2hours i did play at last nightAnd now i wanna play this game but im company...And finnish at my work i will play this game go to my home early Lol,ASTRONEER

2016-12-16,0,0,12,True,Recommended,I am playing on a Windows 7 laptop and while it is laggy it isnt unplayable and I think the lag will improve as the game progresses.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-20,0,0,14,True,Recommended,This game is so unique. Played it for 8 hours straight my first play through and only got off because it was 6 in the morning! Everything is pretty solid and balanced. The only complaint I have is driving the rovers is terrible because their like a tank. Other than that the devs roadmap looks solid and honestly makes me hype the final product. Best space game I have ever played. Way better than No Mans Sky even though thats not saying much!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,18,True,Recommended,This game is just brilliant. If you like survival/crafting games this is probably one of the best ones I've played. Everything about this game is thought out and elegant and I cant wait to see where it goes.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,51,True,Recommended,this game is plain awesome. it has some edges and next to no tutorial or explanations but that is to be expected from a pre alpha game. i dumped hours into it and pretty much tried everything and still got some base concepts i want to try.really looking forward to the next steps with this ) love it to bits so far,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"Even though it is early access there are some improvements the developers can work on and I have a few. One is that my game continually has a massive lag spike but it seems like the game crashed and I cant close it unless I use task manager. Two Sometimes your character can just somehow glitch through the ground and you can possibly die because I died once from that. And lastly can you improve the recharge on the station thing because I got a fuel condenser and powered it up once and got my fuel and then when I went to recharge it it didn't want to recharge I even tried getting new stacks of power. But anyway I love the game and it is so fun like I've been waiting for a game like this and its finally here. I tottaly recommend this game even though there are some bugs and glitches that can be fixed. The ""negative"" message up the top is for the developers. )",ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,24,True,Recommended,game has tonnes of potential but that's pretty much what im trading on actual chance to get to play is rare due to constant crashes and other bugs had fun while i was in though decent game but just has been released so bug and crash central!*** only played multi ***,ASTRONEER
2017-01-25,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Was playing with a friend.We decided to explore more of the planet when we got a big rover.Been driving around for 10 minutes. Got lots of ressources.We forgot to place 'bread crumbs'...Only found our base by pure luck...after 30 minutes... okay it would have taken 30 minutes it took an hour cause we got stuck in a big canyon...,ASTRONEER
2017-11-22,0,0,93,True,Recommended,Oddly satisfying game for just zoning out to while watching a movie in tandem. There can be some intense moments but for the most part if you enjoy exploration games with a hint of survival and a bunch of building you may enjoy Astroneer.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,36,True,Recommended,while the game itself has some little issues here and there.it's a great game with a good potential(i'm not good at explaining so it might be a bit weird)you start off as one of four astronauts launched onto a planet when you land your first priorities are collecting resources to build up your base and not wandering to far off your base or you will suffocate. dont worry your base has infinite off that stuff.when you get your base a bit up and running it's time to search deeper. the underground is filled with usefull resources like aluminium and copper. it's alsof filled with poison/spike plant that want to kill you.once you got that stuff it's time to research a lot of research.and before you know you are on your way to build multiple bases on multiple planetspros base building exporation deformable terrain (need a bridge? make one) random structures like crashed spaceships with loot or a huge solar panel to use active/listening developerscons fps issues for some people (w.i.p.)even if you don't like early acces it's worth to atleast buy and test the game if it looks interesting.and if you don't like it then you can always refund it,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,56,True,Recommended,Great Game. Sadly though my PC is barely strong enough to handle the game. I was surprised to see that there were no low quality options. I really wish you could add more graphics customization to be a little more friendly to the weaklings. Thanks for the great game keep up the good work.,ASTRONEER

While there might not be a lot to do yet the things that are in the game are enjoyable and will provide you with hours of fun. This game is still Pre Alpha so there some bugs but none of them are game ruining. As of writing this revies there are 6 planets to explore and each provied something a little bit different than the last. The future for this game looks promising and i cant wait to see what they have instore for future updates.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-22,0,0,16,True,Recommended,No there isn't an objectiveNo there isn't really any reason to progress other than for the heck of itNo this is not the game where you shoot the bad guyThis is a very simple and charming comfort game.Maybe you had a rough day and just want to relax a little nothing too hectic just a little bit of sitting back and listening to soothing music while collecting moonrocks.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-27,0,0,92,True,Recommended,Amazingly beautiful and full of potential. This is one early access journey I am happy to take.Edit 1 year later and it keeps getting better. Looking forward to the next year of development now that all the business stuff is under control.,ASTRONEER

2017-10-25,0,0,836,True,Recommended,"I am not an accomplished gamer (I cut my teeth on ZORK and Atari) and you can take my thoughts and easily ignore them but all together I like this game. It appears on the surface to be a juvenile program but once you play it for a while you see the subtle unwritten threads of possible quests and puzzles lurking in the final finished version.Controls are a little confusing some time like where is the ""fill"" button on the controller when you have taken out half your landing site. But mostly all activities are smooth and seamless. Graphics are outstanding.Beta needs to start developing a story line to tie together all the main areas of the game. That is in orbit underworld and normal world plus all the research items you find. Looking forward to that.",ASTRONEER

I love base building games and the mining in this game is fairly easy. It's pre alpha so pretty rough to play. I can't stay on more than 5 minutes or the game freezes up. Ill be back after a few updates to review some more.,ASTRONEER

2017-11-22,0,0,26,True,Recommended,This game totally pulls off what so many other space centric games try to do make planetary exploration interesting.It's still in early access and there's plenty of room for more content but I strongly recommend picking it up on full release.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-15,0,0,32,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I think this game has a lot of great potential! I really enjoy looking for research expanding bases traveling to planets and going to space. I would like to see the developers add Aliens some sort of combat system meteor showers more transportation methods online multiplayer and mods. I know this game is currently in Pre Alpha but I would like to see a lot of bug fixes as well. Over all I highly reccomend this game if you like science and space and I can see this game becoming a top game on steam. Great job so far!,ASTRONEER
2017-11-15,0,0,45,True,Recommended,First of all I highly recommend this game. It's definitely worth the money. It's everything No Mans Lie should have been. You can watch Youtube for true reviews and gameplay so I'll just talk about the few down falls this game has. The end game is non existent. Once you've built a couple bases on a couple planets you really don't feel like building anymore. There just isn't enough variation in base building and no enemies whatsovever to defend against. The atmosphere and environments are PERFECT but there's no enemies other than some plants and those are easily avoided. Your biggest enemy is falling in a hole or glitching through the ground.What this game needs is some enemies and some base defense. Some walls to put up around your base. More base structures. Some weapons. A climable rope to traverse holes you find. A new storm type or two. And just a lot more craftables. Bridges Housing Floors Doors Lights etc etc.This game has so much potential but like every other Early Access game I feel like this is about all you're going to get. If they would just add the things I mentioned this would literally be the best space game out there. Until Star Citizens release of course.Anyway if you're listening devs add some aliens (Include a scary giant alien that walks the planet) some guns some settlement building stuff and a couple new storms (Lightning with EMP and maybe a Radiation Storm),ASTRONEER

2017-02-09,0,0,193,True,Recommended,Fun game Amazing game. still bugs here and there but nothing 2 major that the host cant fix in multi in a second. Alot to do because of the new system they applied..... BUT.... my only issues is frame rate... this game seems to get worse frames as the multi. server goes on. (the host gets fps lag) one of the things i can see to help any lag in general is to give more display options like fov render distance motion blur &gt .&gt (like who in the hell like motion blur anyways?!?! it always screws with fps...) but other than that its a fun game lots to do i just hope it doesnt full release anytime soon because they have alot of tweeks and fixes here and there. I would easily suggest this game though!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,83,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is a very robust immediately interesting execution of the ""sandbox exploration"" genre I've been having an amazing time of exploring discovering things and making my own fun.That last part is I think the most important. Any fun you get out of this game will be the fun you make for yourself.This game is in pre alpha and is at the time of this review $20. This is a lot of money for an early access game. To be honest if you have played this game for 5 hours you've more than likely seen 90% of the content on offer. There really isn't that much to the game at this stage in its development so if that worries you maybe wait.As well this game is very buggy trying to use vehicles is a hassle it's not uncommon for your character to phase into the ground and idiots online are constantly using bugs and exploits to do increasingly stupid stuff (making podracers getting infinite resources etc)That being said the developers are constantly updating it and I've already put a ton of time into this game. I am finding it to be a lot of fun and I can only imagine the shinanigans this game will get me into once I convince some of my friends to play it with me.If you've been considering buying this game and are just looking for a review to verify your tastes ask yourself if the above complaints matter and happy exploring!All hail the zebra ball.",ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,69,True,Recommended,9 hours in ive got three bases built up. one on the moon two on the planet. controls are good and the interface is minimalist but gives you everything you need to know in game with tips about low oxygen and power popping up when you run low or out. driving is a little goofy but the vehicles make exploring farther from base better. a solid start for a promising EA title.,ASTRONEER

2017-11-22,0,0,18,True,Recommended,"""Pre Alpha."" I love that in the early access description for this game. I've played full release games with less content and less fun.Once I saw that the Steam Awards were available I immediately hit this one for ""The Labor of Love."" I can't remember ever being so surprised by a game. I didn't know what to expect and at first was really wondering what the point was. Run away from base.Get more materials.Place more tethers.Get further away from base.Before long I finally found out about vehicles. About research. About the caves. This is a game that for me unfolded into something just too fun to notice the time I had spent.Sure there wasn't an end game 'goal' that I even knew about. It didn't matter. It's a game it's fun. If you like exploring the unknown in a 'true' survival horror game (where the enemy is only the environment and your own carelessness) then I am sure you will enjoy it too.",ASTRONEER
2017-01-20,0,0,150,True,Recommended,Amazing game. Love the idea of extracting resources and building a base. Travelling between planets in search of rare resources and artifacts keeps you coming back for more. As it is still in pre alpha stage there are a few glitches mostly in multiplayer mode but with regular patching the game keeps getting better and better. My friend and I love playing open world games and Astroneer provides just that. Always fun to plan out a proper base layout for maximum productivity solo and sometimes with the help of friends. With the presence of caves it truly feels like there is second and hidden world in every planet waiting to be discovered. I guarantee that most will lose track of time as there is so much to explore and discover. I truly hope the developers introduce new features resources artifacts and newer planets. I just can't wait to play the end product. A great game!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-16,0,0,5,True,Recommended,First of all I cannot compare this game to No Man's Sky. The only real similarities are the mining and the space/interstellar theme. Astroneer is more in the tip of a space themed Minecraft. For an early access pre alpha game it runs flawlessly. No frame drops or crashes whatsoever. The visuals are gorgeous as well as somewhat cartoon ish which is actually fitting. I started up the game and what I initially hated was the lack of info. However this is a development choice that I have quickly come to love. You are thrown onto a planet and forced to figure out how to mine build a base manage your oxygen and travel to new worlds. This made it much more exciting whenever progress was made. The game brilliantly makes players work hard to get started however it does not feel like a grind. It just feels like discovery and learning. Definitely reccomend this game. My only concern is that after a few hours I begin to wonder what the point in all of this hard work is. The game states that you are one of many people looking for their fortune in a space gold rush. I think that a currencey system as well as purchasing things with said currency would make all the work more understandable. As of now there isn't too much of a story or overall purpose but it is undoubtedly hours of fun and I'm excited to see how the game develops. It's really off to a great start.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,51,True,Recommended,This game is definitely more than it seems.For a game in Early Access it's amazing how I still can't find the boundaries and limitations of development for the amount that I have played.This game throws you in with little instruction. This brings such an amazing sense of nostalgia to when I played Minecraft as a child. Making a torch was such a big achievement that I will always remember just like learning how to make a research station.This game is truly a lot more than it seems. Being able to travel to different parts of the planet the weather system and the general complexity are things I would never expect in an Early Access.TL DR This game is incredibly fantastic and indepth for an Early AccessIf you want a calming exploration and development game this is worth every cent.Multiplayer is simple easy and a whole lot of funBest thing i've gotten this Christmas besides a fresh new pair of Retro 3 True Blue Jordans GET IT,ASTRONEER

I can't believe that the pace of early access games is coming to this level of commitment with a game. I seriously hope that the developers stay on top of this one and don't let it go. I am looking forward to all the updates and what is to come for Astroneers. The style of collecting and using your items and such is kinda cool. It's a nice change from your average inventory system in most games. I'd love to see expansion on this concept.I got this game awhile back and I still find myself coming back to it over and over.

There are a fair few bugs (as to be expected in pre alpha) but nothing majorly game changing just revert a save. Personally i love this game and would definetly recommend to anyone . 9/10 (just because of bugs) .

2016-12-16,0,0,15,True,Recommended,5.3 h with just one crash for an alpha build! Great game. After almost 6 h i feel like I just started the game 5 min ago. Very intuitive and beautiful mechanics. I would like if there was a way to see beacons from anywhere but atm it is all good. You can get lost easily and sometimes it can take even 30 40 min to find your barings. But it is a survival game so I think it captures that feeling of frustration and confusion but without over doing it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,162,True,Recommended,I've been looking forward to this game coming out for a while and was surprised to see that it came out yesterday. Already put a few hours into it and imagine many hundred more in the near future. The game looks beautiful and plays smoothly for me so far. The crafting takes a little bit to get down but once you do it's pretty enjoyable compared to some other open world games.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,57,True,Recommended,I've found this game to be a wonderfully relaxing but nonetheless very engaging experience. Its mechanical foundations are already quite solid and show great promise for the future. While in a reductive sense you can exhaust the progression (in terms of the 'tech tree') quite soon that just forms a basis to then branch out explore and establish bases on other planetary bodies. There is a decent amount of environmental variety and even just exploring for its own sake has been fun.It isn't without issues for sure. For example performance declines over time. With 16 hours on my current save my framerate is now down to 30FPS (a poor look for an i7 with 16GB RAM and a 980ti). But even in the short time I've owned it the game has been regularly updated.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-27,0,0,79,True,Recommended,A diamond in the ruff if I ever saw one. This game still has a long way to go but its fun and worth the buy. Keep an eye on this game in the future I can tell its going to get even better.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-27,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,1 Month Into Playing Honestly one of my favortie games ever. I can't really explain but to put it simply when you play this game alone or with friends it's just satisfying and you can easily get lost in the game and not know you've played hours of it. 10/10 I would buy this game 100%.Almost 1 Year Later Now that it's almost been a year I can offically say I am disapointed. I bought this game with high expectations and when I got it they were met but now a year in they haven' added much to the game and it's basically the same thing over and over again and as we all know that gets boring real quick. Add more stuff devs...... please.... and then you might get some people to actually play this game again.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-01,0,0,29,True,Recommended,this game is lots of fun if you like the ideas of survival games and exploration but don't want to spend hours on end with it. Astroneer is tons of fun with challenge to make it ingaging but not stressful. I definately suggest getting this game if you think you'd like itI only have two complaints. One is that the game currently is buggy. Vehicles constantly move through floors making you lose precious materials if you are unfortunate. That of course can be patched but currently as it is in early access it has not been fixed. The devs as I've seen so far have a great community focus as they have hot fixed some problems so this could be already patched when you are reading this.My second problem is with the research mechanic. You find pods around the world and bring back to your base using some energy you will discover a new crafting recipe. Once you've researched an amount of a certain type of them it will give you rare resources. I can never get the habitat recipe which is required for more bases. I get things like drill heads filters winches and everything else but I never get this essential recipe. I hope this can be patched in some way in the future or at least some direction on how to get new recipes. This really stops my fun of the game quickly.At the moment I would give a 6/10 though fixing these bugs and adding more content could bring it higher. I'm excited to see what they bring.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-26,0,0,44,True,Recommended,My kids really enjoy when I play this and I enjoy sharing the gameplay with them.

2017-01-24,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Love this game. I just wish there was a little bit more detail in the space crashes some different biomes (i.e desert water and forests etc). Some more structures to explore for example ruins and abandoned things. To improve the game I think it would be nice to add some animals both hostile and friendly that appear at different times of the day and night. A thing I had trouble with was using the terrain tool. When I wanted a smaller brush it was not possible to change its size. Overall I enjoyed this game and I think some of these suggestions would make it better. Personally I think Astroneer has a bright future ahead of it for players all ages to enjoy!! This is still an amazing game ),ASTRONEER
2017-11-27,0,0,7,True,Recommended,So far very relaxing and fun really satisfies that wanderlust itch to load up a rover and cruise around the surface of a planet looking for resources.I hope to see good things from this in the future as more content is added and a bit of survival difficulty and more rewarding tech progression is worked out.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-27,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This game was amazing! When I started to play it there were some bugs of course but those bugs made the game anything but unplayable. Bugs often make the game hilarious. The game has an amazing artstyle and very relaxing.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I never like these games but this... this is amazing it is lacking in content right now you can pretty much get everything in a few hours except all the research parts. I just bought this game and love it. tip for the winds storms Build a wall around your base that you can hide behind. I about have my base in a dome with outlets for the cars and spaceship. also build a hide out near where you are gathering stuff so you can atleast make it to that make sure to add air. Overall i cant wait to see more stuff in this game!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,15,True,Recommended,The game is simple looking but there is a large beauty to it and i'm looking forward to playing more.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-31,0,0,10,True,Recommended,I love this game and play multiplayer.But I found a few annoying glichs. For example my truck got sweeped up in a sandstorm and now is stuck in the sky. Then I randomly fall through the floor loosing all my stuff.,ASTRONEER

2017-11-25,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I'm surprised how much I love this game. It's really cathartic. The music and design keep it relaxing. They're keeping updates regular too. I look forward to the finished product. There's already so much to explore and discover.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-01,0,0,36,True,Recommended,This game is a very nice concept of what it would be like to live in space as an astronaut! It's fun and beautiful! If I had to give it a rating 10/10 of course! If anyone ever felt like buying it I'd recommend it!,ASTRONEER
2017-11-27,0,0,31,True,Recommended,If you're ever looking for a game that is fun to play when you've got nothing better to do or you want to just relax this is the perfect game for it. It does have a lot of glitches and bugs unfortuneately but the dev team is constantly releasing updates and adding content which makes the game all the more enjoyable. If you want to play with friends I advise against that because the game doesn't seem to like having multiple people in a lobby.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-31,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Huge recommendation only in pre alpha and it's already great. Can't wait to watch it evolve.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-31,0,0,17,True,Recommended,After seeing this game was a pre alpha I had to buy it to see if it was any good or if it was terrible because who releases a pre alpha? I started playing and hit NO bugs at 1st and i connected to my brothers world who had just got the game from me with no issues as well. The game runs smooth only getting 20 60 FPS on an over powered rig but still smooth as butter. Iv played the game for over 10 hours now and have hit no real game breaking bugs except caves that are not there and instantly kill you on other planets. A pre alpha with more than one world surprised me and my honest opinion is that this is not a pre alpha it it been too advanced in the engine and mechanics to be tagged with pre alpha and just called an alpha but that's just my opinion.All in all I say this is a great game and better than some full releases of late. I would recommend and can't stop loosing hours upon hours playing this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-01,0,0,32,True,Recommended,Love the game. have had hours of fun while playing it and the artwork is great too. the only complaint i have is that it gets a bit laggy when i play with friends,ASTRONEER
2017-01-01,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This game is one of the bests survival games.There are some bugs but it's in early access.5 stars,ASTRONEER
2017-01-01,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Honestly This is a very VERY good game and im having alot of fun and recomend it to others. However my system isnt the best so it does lag a little bit. One improvement note to developers This game would be so much better for me if there were more settings for the graphics so it can run better.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-23,0,0,34,True,Recommended,I love this game. This game has a future and almost everyone that plays it can see that. It mixes the unknown with a littke bit of pretty. There are some lag problems but they are going to be fixed in the near future. For now there is a guide to help you solve the lag problems. Just check the community guide if you do have lag problems.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-01,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Nice but controls need to be refined.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-28,0,0,23,True,Recommended,If you're into free roam open world sandbox style games with no strutured missions/objectives then you will probably enjoy this game. The game starts a lot like Minecraft does. You're dropped off into the world with little to no guidance. It isn't hard to figure out though. Resources are easy to spot and it's obvious you need to use them to advance. Gathering resources and building up your base are pretty fun for quite some time. Eventually you can make a spacecraft to go to another planet and continue making more bases.The problem with this game is the lack of enemies. I hate to keep referencing Minecraft but if you've played it on peaceful (without enemies) you know how boring the game gets. The only thing that can kill you in Astroneer are plants that emit toxins falls from heights suffocating and storms which throw debris. These can all be EASILY avoided. So without any enemies there isn't any real difficulty. And after some time the game starts to get boring. Now if you're looking for a relaxing game this is perfect. I enjoy playing it while watching Netflix. The game runs well. It's straight forward and easy to jump right into which makes it a good game for a younger gamer.I do recommend the game but before you buy it understand it is still in its early stages. With the lack of enemies the replayability isn't too great. However if you're into the free roam sandbox style you will get your money's worth out of this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-04,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,It's a fun game with great promise but there simply isn't enough content to warrant a 20 price tag. My friend and I have played for 5 hours and we're done. There's nothing left to do.The game is still riddled with bugs too. Either wait until there's more content or skip this title.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-04,0,0,137,True,Recommended,"What a great little game.Full disclosure I paid full price for this game at the time I bought it ($19.99) and learned of it through my discovery queue. I'm writing this with 4.8 hours on the record.This game is so fun. Think Minecraft meets Spore space stage meets what No Man's Sky should have been. The controls are VERY easy to pick up and are very smoothand intuitive if not for taking a bit of getting used to as they are sort of odd. But certainly nothing you cannot learn.I've only unlocked some basic stuff so far but I'm having all kinds of fun. It's certainly a very simple game but that's the joy of it I feel. It's simple yet complex. It makes no promises to anyone and puts you immediately into the action. Very minimal game. The low poly graphics of the terrain are pleasantly done and it's a pretty small game to download. There's no real enemies I can think of so far just some passive flora that seem to act in self defense if perturbed. Oh and the windstorms. Bit scary there as you get hundreds of cubes falling/flying from the sky. It's a forgiving game it's fun to play and there's not even that many bugs for being in pre alpha. Not that many bugs at all really.Few things I'm not a fan of but none of them are game breaking more minor improvements. Sometimes the terrain editing bugs out a bit and leaves artifacts if you're not careful. That I'm sure the developers are looking at. The rover controls are....Weird. They're WASD but it's always relative to the camera. So if you are kind of looking at the rover and you're wanting to back up cause you're against a wall you'd hit S right? Well no S will keep driving you into the wall if you're looking backward. Really weird and I guess it could work over time it's definitely something that'll need some getting used to. The only other thing that kind of bothers me is there's quite a bit of choppiness during transitions but as an 8350 CPU user that might be my own fault. And again it's early alpha.Other than that I really can't think of any improvements maybe more will come as I discover more so we'll see there. Honestly the biggest thing I can appreciate in this game is the work that is put into the game play not necessarily the graphics. The graphics are NOT unpleasant in fact it's refreshing to see a game that puts just the right amount of cartoony ness into the graphics while still keeping them crisp. Another thing is that it doesn't seem to promise much. It's not creating illusions of grandeur whilst in actuality failing to deliver on the promises that the advertising made. Maybe the developer learned from the folly of No Man's Sky. But you see it here the description is plain ""A game of aerospace industry and interplanetary exploration."" That's it. There's no words or dialogue in the videos no promises made other than basic gameplay mechanics. The developer delivered the game in a way that allows you to discover for yourself. And that's something that very few games enable you to do now days.In game there's work to be done sure. Collecting resources keeping safe from the windstorms and building and supplying your base with power. But it doesn't feel like a grind. There's always something new around the corner. For the $20 I paid for it this has been great for the first 5 hours and I only expect it to get better.Great and refreshing game highly recommend if you enjoy open world games and making your own way.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-31,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I've only played 16 minutes of it and it's already a way better game than No Man's Sky was. Aesthetically pleasing AND more engaging thn the non stop grindfest of NMS.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-23,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Relaxing as Hell. The smooth music and laid back mining and exploring aspects of the game so far have made it a great stress reliever. As long as you dont stray too far from your base and tethers and run out of oxygen get killed in a storm or poisoned in an underground cave..... Other than that! No stress!,ASTRONEER
2017-02-26,0,0,82,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER even in Pre Alpha still is full of so many fun things to do exploring industrialization studying planets and the high quality great state that the game is already at shows a lot about the development team. They've done a fantastic job at every turn.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-26,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Been playing this game a fair bit already and enjoying it a lot. Looking forward to where the direction of the game will contiune towards. Still requiring more optimization but running much better than a typical Pre Alpha game.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-26,0,0,3,True,Recommended,It's a good concept. The gameplay and mechanics are pretty solid. There's not a lot to do right now but what there is is interesting enough. The 3 hours I played had me make pretty much every vehicle tool and building as well as do some building/exploring on the other planets. Would do more exploring but turns out it's all the same on each planet maybe different plants and the rocks are a different colour. Pre Alpha though. Lost a few saves to some interesting glitches like getting stuck in things and all shuttles spawning half in the ground (thus unable to fly). Be very careful.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-20,0,0,83,True,Not Recommended,Great game and I loved playing for 83 non stop hours but... not enough content.,ASTRONEER
2017-10-15,0,0,76,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a relaxing alternative to other survival crafter games similar to the big daddy Minecraft. Here you just have to worry about not getting too much crap for stealing the rocket lander and stranding your friend to die... and watch your back around them on the next playthrough.PvE mainly the dust storms forgetting Oxygen sliding down ravines and losing your precious rare elements. There's no manual and they don't have sources recognized in the keybinding section for what could be considered Mouse3 Mouse4 etc. thumb buttons.Only place they can go is up unless microtransactions are added like how AAA companies are making a trend of it.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-03,0,0,27,True,Recommended,First thing to say amazing game. lots of exploring and crafting to do lots of challenges to overcome and minerals to mine. i have experianced alot of bugs but thats because its in its early stages. would love to see this game develop and add new items. e.g more things to research and craft. i recommend this game to those who like exploring. base building and well just a game to have some fun in,ASTRONEER
2016-12-31,0,0,41,True,Recommended,"I tend to find that reviews highlighting a game's weaknesses are usually more helpful so here we go. Poor performance especially after playing for an hour or so. BUGS. Be it planets ""exploding"" vehicles glitching through the ground or simply falling through the ground this game has all the bugs. Some of them are harmless and often somewhat funny (such as the exploded planet) while others can cost you a lot of resources such as vehicles falling through the ground. Very little gameplay (for now). As this is in early access this is very likley to change. Anyhow for the time being once you have everything and once you have everything there is little more to do than explore and horde resources in your many bases.Despite these issues I think that Astroneer is capable of becoming a great game. I just hope that we get some form of performance update soon.",ASTRONEER

2017-01-23,0,0,25,True,Recommended,This game is super super fun. It has a lot of potential and even this early (pre alpha currently) version is still satisfying and worth picking up.That being said if you can wait I'd wait until some of the bugs are ironed out and performace is increased. I run a 4790k and 980ti and get 20 35fps. Maybe wait until its in beta at least. If you do decide to get it anyways it's very fun.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-26,0,0,12,True,Recommended,"TL DR Charming little early access game with promise. 8/10.PRE ALPHA REVIEW WILL UPDATE WHEN THE GAME DOESSo far this is an amazing game. We've all seen the joke reviews of ""what No Man's Sky should have been"" (and if you haven't scroll down I swear they're there) but I disagree with that. This game is different from NMS in many ways though I admit there are some similarities in the concepts. Where NMS was a game that was more about the sheer cosmic scale of things ASTRONEER is more of a focused experience. What follows is a review where I will try to mention NMS as little as possible.So far as I know (I only have two hours logged and have only left my starting planet once in that time) there is only a single star system for you to explore which is literally Infinitesimal compared to NMS. However that's not to say that it's a small game at all in the two hours of my gameplay I've probably explored less than a tenth of a percent of the first planet's surface let alone the massive cave systems that perforate the landscape. The planets are decent sized and there are quite a few of them in each system.There's also a really in depth (for pre alpha anyway) crafting system that allows you to build vehicle assemblers 3d printers smelters et al. One of the things I'm looking forward to as this game goes on is seeing what new stuff we're going to be able to build.As for story there is none. AT. THIS. POINT. According to the ASTRONEER road map trello.com they plan to add story elements in before the final release. I'm very interested to see how that pans out but that's about all there is to say about it.The graphics are amazing especially for a pre alpha build. There are a few hiccups (specifically when getting into and out of vehicles on uneven terrain but it's easily fixed by deforming the terrain around you) and framerate drops (landing on a planet drags it down) but it's a pre alpha so it's going to get better.The sound is great. Enough said.To sum up this game is already off to a great start and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. My only complaints can all be chalked up to being a pre alpha game and hopefully they all get addressed before 1.0 drops. Altogether at this stage I give it a 8/10 with high hopes to bring that up in a few months.",ASTRONEER

2018-01-18,0,0,26,True,Recommended,My experience with the game is a positive thumbs up with a BIG helping of a reminder it's in early release. If this was the final concept of the game it would be thumbs down and I'd be wishing for a refund.It has all the stability to be a great game if they do something more with the end goal which i'm glad it's still has hope while it's in early release. It has a solid feel to it but on to other thoughts.Right now you research mine resources and then travel to other planets to mine the same resources. Sure they can make it longer/tougher to research so the game can't be finished in 8 hours but the end result is the same. I wouldn't recommend the game to others with out some true challange/goal being introduced.I do have issues with controling the charactor with the mouse/keyboard and don't get me started on driving the rover but there are not game breaking for left or right handed people.I also want to make clear I only got this game due to a friends mixup and I'm going away from buying games in early release in 2018. Been burned with to many dud's in 2017 industry never learns that they hurt themselves more getting the fast cash then the long game plan. Hope steam is also reading since im tired of being bombarded with indie trash where you can see the developer is pushing trash for cash. My love of gaming is slowly being destroyed.,ASTRONEER

2017-12-28,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a fun game with pleasing graphics. Once you get into it you might not know what to do but once you really learn the mechanics you unleash yourself into hours of gameplay. This game is currently on sale and well worth the money. I'm already hooked even when it is still in early access just wait until it releases its full game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,9,True,Recommended,I do like this game. Fun a lot of things to explore and build able to go to other planets beautiful visual (especially when the sun rises).

2017-11-14,0,0,42,True,Recommended,I watched markiplier play this for short time and because he never continued I thought I would buy it myself and give it a go. This is my first review so sorry if I ramble! &lt 3I can say for sure is Astroneer is an absolutly amazing game that I can see a bright future for for a game in alpha it's vastly amazing how much stuff/content is already implemented and is unique and very entertaining the world is super cool to explore the graphics are beautiful soundtrack suits perfectly and makes me feel genuinely happy while playing &amp exploring what it has to offer and to create the mechanics are simple and easy to understand and pick up from the start!11/10 would reccommed to anyone! I'll even be bold and say that I enjoy it more than No Mans Sky! Well done to the amazing devs for creating such a fun &amp unique game! I'm suuper excited for it to be complete because I know it's gonna be fantastic. Kudos for all of you!,ASTRONEER

2017-10-04,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Absolutely amazing game! Lots of bugs and there isn't a MASSIVE amount of things to do. BUT it is beautiful to look at the mechanics are fresh and interesting the multiplayer is funny as hell and its just something that when played with friends can easly have hours sunk into it. However there isn't a massive amount to do so once you made it to space and set up bases on different planets single player gets a bit boring. Still worth the money!,ASTRONEER
2017-11-14,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Good job with the update guys. Please dont use lootcrates etc. I know you dont have it. But please dont!!!Every game these days has loot dont ruin your game with that.Keep up the good work,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,1061,True,Recommended,This game took my life my wife and my job. I now bend to its will and it tells me what to buy at the grocery store.In all seriousness this is a fantastic game. A lot of people have been comparing it to what No Man's Sky should have been and I feel like that's correct to an EXTENT. When they add flight etc then yes. It will be what NMS should have been.For being an Early Access game it's surprisingly bug free. Maybe it's just me but I've had only a few small issues that were taken care of promptly. There's plenty to keep you occupied for several hours but in all reality there isn't much to keep you coming back (like Take On Mars) yet I still come back. Maybe I'm broken. The game is incredibly relaxing. It's nice to come home after a long day of work and relax collect some oxygen pebbles and all that.You can terraform the terrain into anything you want. That's one of my favorite features about this game.All in all get this game if you enjoy these types of games. You won't be disappointed.I'll update this more as I think of more things to add. I just woke up so I'm still a bit tired ),ASTRONEER

2017-11-14,0,0,11,True,Recommended,In its current state there is not a ton of content and for still some decently large bugs (vehicles). That being said you should'nt expect more content considering it is early access. Even with its limited content it is still a lot of fun especially with friends. I have played through done everything there is to be done about twice both with my friend. It does not take long to do everything and takes even less time with the more people you have. The Devs have been consistent in doing at least one large update each month along with a few patches/hotfixes during the month to fix whatever bugs they can. You can go to thier website they have a whole roadmap planned and are very good at keeping people updated on what is going on.If you dont buy it now its understandable but I highly recomend buying when it has released or at has a few more major content updates. I think for the what the game is and is going to be it is easily worth its price.,ASTRONEER

The game will be buggy (although I've seen very few in nearly 10 hours of gameplay and the ones I have seen have been hilarious) there will become a point where there is little for you to do as the game is still very much in development and isn't set for full release until the latest of 2018 and the game my crash (although this is yet to happen to me).The potential for this game is HUGE.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-16,0,0,0,True,Recommended,I have about a half hour into the game. Initial thoughts... this is going to be a fun game to play. I can't wait to see what the developers do with the limitless possibilities of the game world. For $25 I was happy to buy the game + soundtrack to support further development of this concept. The graphics are appealing and it does have huge potential. If you factor in the likes of Minecraft and Terraria... something like those in space would be amazing. I enjoy the gameplay so far.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,8,True,Recommended,The concept of the game is similar to No Mans Sky however it comes off a lot more cartoon based which isn't a bad thing. In my 1 hour of playing I was constantly finding new resources and figuring out exactly what you are supposed to do. Personally I would like some more information on how to do certain things such as researching where you get/find vehicles etc. However the base premise of the game is solid and with some time I think thins could turn into an amazing game. Now I just need a friend to buy it so I can give multiplayer a go.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-02,0,0,62,True,Recommended,I really enjoy this game a lot it does a great job of open world exploration and I can't wait to see what this game develops into but I really wish I had someone else to play with.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-16,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This game seems promising. Even in pre alpha the gameplay is fun without too much grind. The devs just released the roadmap which I always appreciate when investing in an early access title. What the game primarily is at the moment You can explore planets looking for resources and tech to research to grow and expand a pretty basic base. Use resources to build basic but fun to drive buggies and trucks. Use resources to build a rocket. You don't directly control the rocket but just use it as a way to get to other planets. Kinda like a menu but with actual movement. Worry about energy and oxygen. You use tethers at first to keep a lifeline of oxygen to your base. As you progress you get a bit more indepentent but don't expect huge hour expeditions at first.That is pretty much at at the moment and I haven't tried multiplayer but I have no doubt it would be fun. Give this one a try if you want to go a currently short but fun space adventure!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-31,0,0,87,True,Recommended,To all of those that wasted money on No Man's Sky and are looking for a bandade to balm your wounded hearts this game does not fall short. I like to refer to it as Yes Man's Sky ) It's a good game as it stands. The main framework is there and it's updated constantly. I can't wait to see what it becomes. It's already multiplayer so they're beating No Man's Sky by a long shot lol,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,7,True,Recommended,I was suprised by how fun this game is building researching exploring and modifying your environment (terrain) is primarly what this game is all about at this point. The colorful landscapes are fantastic and unique while the storms are great to look at and experiance. The sky is out of this world. Excellent foundation to build a very interesting game on. Base building is simple interesting but somewhat linear (you just place finished objects which you are able to build right away or through research). I have not experianced a frame drop while playing the game for a few hours but a friend did experiance a considerable frame drop.Considering the game is in early stages of development my suggestions for imrovements are 1. more indepth base building (e.g. being able to build complex structures to live in make a single planet a more permanent home while being able to build ships for e.g. gathering resources on other planets or setup secondary bases in case your main one gets wiped out by a disaster)2. more relaistic life experiance (e.g. what about food what about dehydration what about bathroom breaks what about radiation what about more dramatic temperature changes etc.)3. the game becomes boring after several hours of playing as the environment becomes predictable the base building is limited to a small number of pre designed structures etc.)4. enemies would expand the game considerably (e.g. giant worms in tunnels which appear and move rapidly powerful storms which can damage/destroy structures meteorite strikes which form powerful aftershocks and deposits thick layers of sediment over your base tectonic movements which can modify the terrain considerably forming huge ridges mountains or canyons poisonous gas vents which can become active aliens etc.),ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Its a really nice game i played it since the release and its still playable but the only thing i dont like is the framedrops when you have built too much on your base with vehicle etc.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-29,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"A beautiful and calm game that makes you want to explore. Very simple/logic to the point that possibly my grandmother could play it which is a plus. It's not yet released officially as far as Im aware of and if there is anything they need to do is it first of all the colossal lag you get at a certain point after creating a lot of things and especially on the planet ""Exotic"" which brings my i7+1070+16gb to 20 30 fps. Also a very big part of the game or that should be is the rover you can get but that drives no matter what it needs more traction. They also need to add more things to make I think it would fit perfectly if they added houses/villages that could essentially be build and a lot of the game is based around having enough/fast power so there are little to no down time depending on sun and wind. Im glad that I bought the game I usually refund everything I buy in the survival category but this one was cool. But the price 159 nok was in my opinion a bit pricy for an ""alpha"" game. You can play with up to 3 friends I believe and about 5 saved games that can be deleted and continued on as you wish. Also the game needs more settings both in gameplay and in video.",ASTRONEER

2017-01-03,0,0,21,True,Recommended,The reasons I recommend this game This game is literally one of the most interesting and most fun games I have played in a long time. I m so excited about this game and where it can go in the future. I will probably even buy it for Xbox One just to be able to play it on both platforms. I think this is one of my favorite games of all time. If you get lost you can use the Astroneer wiki or YouTube to find out more info and what to do. You can do everything you could want in space exploration. You can harvest research build create explore and even blast into space to go to different places on your planet or even to another planet. This game is well worth the price and well worth your time. Once you figure out what to do and how things work you will get hooked on this space exploration. If surviving and exploring on your one isn t enough there is even multiplayer! You can work with up to 3 other friends to survive in this amazing universe. The state of the game As with any early access games there will be bugs. I realize there are ALWAYS people reviewing early access games and complaining about the bugs. I know there have been some games that were so bad they are essentially unplayable. I get being mad about that. If you expect NO bugs don t get an early access game. There are bugs but nothing unforgivable. I have found that sometimes exiting the game and coming back can fix the bug or issue. When you exit the game to the menu or desktop you save the game. So if you re in the middle of a planet and you lose your goodies don t exit! Go to your desktop or ctrl+alt+delet and close the program externally. You will start the game at the last save that way. If you do loose it all don t worry because you can get it all again in this expansive game. Bottom line If you want an amazing game with incredibly fun elements and mechanics and aren t afraid of some normal early access bugs buy it today! If you re looking for a finished game with no bugs that is also amazing buy it on full release. If you buy it now or later you will love this game. I would recommend not waiting since it s the kind of game you want to play as soon as possible. The devs are great and are working to update the game regularly. I don t see this becoming an abandoned Steam game like so many others. I also see this game becoming better and most likely adding content and stuff to do over time. Not a bad investment for my money personally. If you re still unsure watch some YouTube let s plays and get a feel for the game. Thanks for reading and bye!,ASTRONEER
2017-03-29,0,0,68,True,Recommended,"Fun game can't wait for more content to be released!Some people say it's buggy and glitchy personally I haven't experienced too much of that. The ""Arid"" planet sometimes go ape and divides itself into 4 slices of pizzaplanet. But as soon as you get on it it shapes up again.To be honest you kinda need a sense of wonder if you are going to enjoy this game.I've spent 17 hours now and Im pretty much done with all the content. I can keep exploring if I want but there is no need for it really.If you are bored as hell like me and looking for a good solid 20 hours entertainment then this is the game.And since more content are probably going to be released in the near future I can highly recommend it. There are materials in the game that have no current use at this moment. But I love the crafting system and the art style so yeah thumbs up.",ASTRONEER
2017-03-30,0,0,139,True,Recommended,While not in its finished state Astroneer is still a fun relaxing game. I like the self motivated progression rather than being driven to finish one thing or another. I usually find the game is stable especially in its latest build.If you are looking for a gritty survival space game this is not for you.If you are looking for constant excitement and danger this is not for you.If you are looking for a fun and relaxing game with some beautiful scenery and not too many threats this may indeed be your game.,ASTRONEER

Basically creating stuff and additional life extensions to extend and expand my exploration.Sheeet i just typed "" EXTEND N EXPAND your space EXPLORATION"" sounded nice.XD i am an idiot. anyway the game looks promising.

There is a note that it's still a pre alpha and it's early access. So don't mind these morons complaining about too few content or bugs.It's a small team and content is coming pretty slow. But there is always some movement. Just don't expect too much.Still recommendable.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-09,0,0,24,True,Recommended,"System Era is a very small team that has put together a beautiful and refreshing early access game which I think has great potential.On March 27th 2017 one of their artists suddenly passed away. Needless to say it was a time of reflection for them but are now steadfast on rolling out updates. You can see the game's development roadmap on their website which is nice.I'll bet anyone with Astroneer was happy with the $20 they spent but are being a bit too critical about the content rollout right now.I was honestly surprised at how polished the stylized artwork looks and how intuitive the UI feels already the main reasons I'm endorsing this $20 game as opposed to saying ""wait"".If you do buy this game treat it as an investment. Playing it is loads of fun (alone or with friends) but watching this concept grow are being a part of the game's development is more valuable to me. We need to (now more than ever) ramp up interest and education in space exploration for the next generation and I think Astroneer can play a small part in fostering that culture.",ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Even in the game's current state it is worth the fun by all means. But let me firstly get out of the way yes the singleplayer is fun and the co op is even better but be prepared for fairly high data usage at the current time for multiplayer. Secondly the thing about active Early Access game development is that we shouldnt always look at the relationship between the games completion to the amount of fun it can bring. With every update and new implemented content in the course of the development brings a sense of satifaction and well ... more fun coz its always fun to get a stream of new toys over a period of time than it is to get it all at once. Yes we all want it now but hey look at the bigger picture you have fun over a longer period of time.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Listen I've never taken the time to review a game on here in my life. But let me tell you this game is incredible. For a game that's only in a very early access alpha stage it has so much potential. I played for only a few hours with a buddy of mine and this game is truly amazing. From the base building to finding resources to researching for new materials and build I don't have a single complaint. The controls are a bit wonky sometimes and when you slide down a semi steep hill/mountain you sometimes won't stop sliding even when you reach flat ground but those are the only bugs I've encountered thus far. 10/10 co op is incredible the gameplay is great the graphics are beautiful and too easy to run on any rig you play on. What No Mans Sky should have been.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-31,0,0,55,True,Recommended,I love this game. This game has so much potential. I look forward to seeing this game develop more and more. Thank you for creating this game. I get the a lot of joy when I play with friends and when I play by myself it is still fun. ) Its a good time.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,4,True,Recommended,This is again another diamond in the wasteland of early access titles. There is so much potential for this game. It seems like the devs are pretty serious too. This really is what no manssky should have been,ASTRONEER
2017-05-10,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Right up my alley. I love exploration games. This game is like No Man's Sky but with rotating planets. Neat,ASTRONEER
2017-01-03,0,0,409,True,Recommended,Great game lots of potential.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-29,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I absolutely love this game so much. Theres so much content and things to do. Barely any bugs which is great for an early access game. Some people are saying it gets boring after a while but I disagree. With the ability to go to other planets it adds hours and hours onto every single save you make. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. This game allows for so much creativity and ingenuity that if you can think of doing something theres a good chance you can do it.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-11,0,0,62,True,Recommended,Great game if you have a love for space but needs servers.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-31,0,0,2,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is great fun etc. but I wish the ""laggyness"" will be cured. I hope the great devs can optimize it more and I know they can. so calling the dev team. hear us out. D",ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I LOVE THIS GAME. one problem though that i found though. when i go to different planets i cant build things with lander. dont know if that is a glitch or not yet implemented. besides this the game is like if No man sky (if it was good) and minecraft had a baby. this thing is going to sell amazing when its out of alpha and is fully released.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-10,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Product received for free. First thing's first This game is in Early Access so there's bound to be issues and/or design flaws such as players who join your game tend to crash land *directly* into your establishment or the bug where when smelting Copper or Aluminum the material can become unobtainable and unmovable from the Smelter. That being said if large open (and I mean open) world exploration games are your thing give this an honest chance. I would like to see more customization however with increasing backpack slots or upgrading the terrain gun more than just the modules.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-11,0,0,14,True,Recommended,was fun for about 8 hours. after that there was nothing left to do in the game but i loved the small amount of time that it was still interesting,ASTRONEER
2017-03-29,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Amazing graphics great game in general. I just can't wait untill the game is fully released... it will be AMAZING! I recommend you buy this game. When more updates come out there will be much more to do as well as more to discover. A few cons are that there are still many glitches and bugs in the game but thats only because its in early access.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-26,0,0,46,True,Recommended,Fun game to play when you just want to relax. The deform tool sound when sucking up resources is like an to the ears. There isnt much to do after reasearching everything but the devs are slowly adding more features to the game which is always good to see.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-26,0,0,6,True,Recommended,When this game came out I was super excited for it. Even though I only have 6 hours on record I have lkearnewd to love the game and I am far more excited for what is in store in the future. Keep up the good work guys and KEEP UPDATING!,ASTRONEER
2017-03-27,0,0,78,True,Recommended,I fell in love with this game the moment I saw items being plonked onto backpacks. The art style is vibrant and unique. The gameplay involves using a glorified vaccuum cleaner to find and research tech fly to new planets and build bases. Lots of room to grow but I've enjoyed every minute so far.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-31,0,0,5,True,Recommended,This game is great and the game play is fun but you HAVE to have the recommended or higher for it to run smoothly at all. I'd say its best to wait until there are patches that are added in where things like the extremely high amounts of particle effects can be lowered or disabled lense flares can be disabled or disabling things like shadows because literally everything has one every blade of grass every item even the specks of dust have them.Other than the occasional frame rate issues that you'll encounter every now and again the game is great and if you have the recommended specs then it is definitely worth picking up. Especially due to its low price and how it's getting a decent bit of updates to adjust and fix the bugs and glitches (because there is quite a few but it's to be expected due to it still being early access.),ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,20,True,Recommended,This is an amazing game. have played a few hours now and really don't want to go to bed i would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes the sound of minecraft mixed with space engineer maybe?,ASTRONEER

2017-04-25,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Its pre alpha so yeah you are not buying a completed bug free game duhA team member passed away recently so updates might be expectently slow while they adjust.Dont forget you can dig and place dirt...Fun game multiplayer is the reason I got it... if it makes it to a stable build will be a beatiful thing. Keep it up.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-21,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Enjoyable however there's nothing really to get in your way the PVE aspects rn aren't to hard to avoid or take care of some mobs/enemies of some sort would be nice. The game is just farming really.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,46,True,Recommended,This game is awesome so far and i love it except for the frame rate which can probably be reduced by taking out some of the cubes on the ground or in the air or some stars its just a suggestion.,ASTRONEER
2017-04-26,0,0,41,True,Recommended,FOR NOW i honestly would not recommend this game if you are expecting huge gameplay. but if you want help the Developer build this game seeing its grow till the full game released i really recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Good little game art style is toppers game doesnt have too much to do right now but the elements that are there are a great start no major issues besides a crash that ive had twice from the time ive played so far.Although i find it hard to recommend right now in its current stage maybe wait till the game gets some more content,ASTRONEER
2017-02-25,0,0,42,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER it's an early access game. So don't expect much at the moment if you're all about features and content but there is enough ATM for me to suggest the game. I personally like to buy early access games to see them grow in content over time but unless you hate waiting you might want to look for other games.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Very fun and looks great. I love having to figure out everything for myself and having to survive with oxygen and energy. There are some bugs like falling into the terrain or the game crashing but it saves often and I never lose much. I understand its still in early alpha and its expected. I can't wait to see what comes next with updates. Also very fun with friends. Highly reccommend. ADDED MAY 2017 I have not played this game other than the 20+ hours directly after release. While the game is fun content is currently limited.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-22,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Very relaxing to play lots of fun with friends and plenty of new things to discover and explore! the game is very pleasing to the eye and the music is chill AF. Look forward to updates constantly cause the new improvements are always exactly what was needed. Good Job devs for giving us a game worth playing over and over even as an early access title!,ASTRONEER
2017-02-25,0,0,51,True,Recommended,This is a really fun game but right now there isnt much to do because its early access dont expect much right now.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-18,0,0,8,True,Recommended,The game is good holy if this was release same day with no mans sky i'd get this.since this is in alpha i get 30fps for a while then my fps keeps on going down but all in all 100% gewwwd.,ASTRONEER
2017-06-22,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Very promising. If you like sorta grindy games like stardew valley minecraft or terraria then this is definitely a game for you. Right now it's in a very basic state but even now it's still pretty fun. It's a little buggy and inconsistent at times but i still got several hours of gameplay out of it. I'm sure more content is on the way. My only complaint is that the menu is kind of confusing at first. I give it a solid 8/10 taking into consideration that it's an unfinished game.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-25,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Pretty awesome! ) a little glitchy and sometimes runs slow but its worth it!,ASTRONEER
2017-02-25,0,0,5,True,Recommended,It's loads of fun in terms of being a sit back and let time go by game with no real end goal but to explore and build. It surprisingly has content that's well thought out for its early stages the controls of both your Astroneer and vehicles are great and the game has a nice polish both mechanics and graphics wise. Not much to do now but it's looking to be a great game.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-16,0,0,105,True,Recommended,superb game to fill up your time plenty to do and discover i hope they continue to build on this game as for players like me who have discovered and done everything there is to do in the game but all round a great concept game,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,0,True,Recommended,AWESOME,ASTRONEER
2017-06-23,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Extremely fun with one or two friends for the first few hours. Once this game gets some more content it will definetely be worth revisiting.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-25,0,0,37,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is already a great deal of fun. It's one of those games that makes you go ""...OOOOHHHH I get it!"" when you crest the learning curve. I also appreciate the nod to actual orbital mechanics when flying (though it's understandably simplified). This game made me rethink my position on procedural voxel based crafting games (I was very tired of them). I'm excited to see how it develops.",ASTRONEER
2017-05-16,0,0,16,True,Recommended,When I impulsively decided on buying this game I wasn't even aware it was in Alpha stage. Not that I bothered because it was the sheerly amazing artstyle and mechanics I fell for. I didn't quite anticipate the fact that there were multiple planets to explore in one save until i had played this gem for about 4 hours. The concept of this game is fantastic. It beard that solid low poly artstyle combined with a sandbox style world. Unfortunately though since it's in early alpha it's not even close to being complete. I estimate myself somewhere at 1/3 of what the game has to offer. There are naturally many things I haven't figured out yet but the majority of mechanics and buildings I've learned about rather quickly. I predict the game will hit a great audiance once it's finished. For the future I hope to see more buildings and mechanics. Perhaps animals new base foundations and add ons and other vehicles and vehicle addons and my personal most wanted a purpose for those old broken spaceships lying around randomly. Also some containers to store large objects in would be nice.Overall the game is fantastic. With more development it will make a great one. For now I'll just wait for the next patch.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-16,0,0,14,True,Recommended,I love the game. I find it fun but like all games it has drawbacks. The first is that like many EA games there are a few bugs. The biggest that i have happens when I enter or exit a vehicle mainly the truck. The car LITERALLY flips out thiis bug is funny for the first few times but then annoying especially when it gets stuck in a cave and you nearly die trying to save it. That bug has almost ruined the game for me. The only reason it hasn't is because of the true gameplay (this is looking past the EA bugs). It is fun and relaxing and I have spent much of my time exploring the HUGE landscape of the planets. The research is tedious so I would make it A) More controllable. Rather than having luck choose what new invention you get you should get a skill tree which you choose what you want. B) make the research resources more available and abundant. That is all I have to say about this game. For now i give it a solid 8/10,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,38,True,Recommended,Great Game!!! i love it! keep going!!!good job devs!!!Wainting for more updates!!,ASTRONEER
2017-06-23,0,0,24,True,Recommended,"I really like this game. It has great visuals a relaxing soundtrack and I can play this for hours. However they need to add more content.

2017-02-26,0,0,15,True,Recommended,As for Early Access this game has a lot of potential to blow up in the future. Yes it is buggy yes it can be annoying sometimes but on the other hand this game is fascinatingly beautiful very fun to play and I can't wait for further updates. Definitely would recommend!,ASTRONEER

2017-06-23,0,0,12,True,Recommended,PROS It is very asthetically pleasing game set in multiple biomes on multiple planets. It has a very nice terrain manipulation system and Is fun to adventure.CONS There are a lot of bugs as far as dropping items goes and items on your station/vehicle. Climbing over some terrain is just cancer and the sliding is absolutely annoying.,ASTRONEER

2017-06-21,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Ok when i first saw this game i knew id love it so i bought it. I was right. The atmosphere of the game is of nothing ive seen before. But it is in early access so you will experience bugs. If you like the space exploration genre get this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,2,True,Recommended,So far its a fun game and works very well at this early in its state. Missing lot of things but still got lots to do and explore so give it a try and help develope this amazing artwork.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,8,True,Recommended,It crashes all the fecking time. I can play it like 3 minutes and then is just freezes. Now that can be my computer and my Graphic Card that is fawlty but still. When i load the game I have to rearrange the things in my inventory. If you wiew the guy sideways you can see that the items (Power raisins etc.) are totaly outa place. But anywhoo the game is playable and quite self explanatory intuitive despite the fact that there is little text to be read.,ASTRONEER

If your can deal with bug or two I say grab it. When the game is complete I will not hesitate to say get it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,13,True,Recommended,its a good game how ever it would be nice to print walls for a house an if there was some sorta alins to kill an print a wepon or even a portable station that u can put on other planets insted of just tethering ur way around a nother planet,ASTRONEER
2017-02-26,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Pre Alpha or not Astroneer is a fantastic game with tremendous potential. Very playable (and fun) in it's current state which is more than I can say for 75% of the early access games.Highly recommended.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Loving the game so far and its great fun 3 hours in and suddenly major FPS drop. System is i7 4790K CPU 4.00GHz GTX 780 Ti &amp 16GB ram so should run game easily. I will recommend the game but I don't think I am only one with the FPS drop issue so maybe worth waiting till you hear its optimized a bit better.Update 1 The FPS drop seems to be directly connected to the amount of tethers I used once I collected quite a few tethers back up my frame rate returned to resonable level.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Cool Survival Game... The feeling of Building an Habitat and Survive deadly storms ..exploring the planet surface and everything in deep caves... great!!!,ASTRONEER

2017-06-04,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a beautiful game in its own category. Although it still is in its alpha stage the game is crazy ammounts and has lots of content inside already. THIS is what No Man's Sky should and could have been. Astroneer still has all the potential to be an even greater game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,300,True,Recommended,You need this game. I bought four of these games so my brother and his 2 kids and I can get into a game and have serious fun. We explore and dig and build and race rovers and refine and mine and trade and space travel and dig holes under each other and bury stuffs and explore and in the end you trade the carbon for 4 compounds..... we all know that compound makes tethers and the whole world revolves around tethers.... You can spend hours making art work out of tethers and 6 year olds luv those tethers. The game is in ALPHA and has a few bugs but I have played alot of finished games that run worst than this game. Even the bugs in this game are an adventure you overload the truck and 2 trailers with heavy loot and bam truck falls through the map and me and the kids spend the next few hours digging and exploring caves. What comes to mind when you say DYN O MITE !!!! ( not j j walker from good times ) thats right you can find dynomite on fallen explorers. Theres nothing better than saying hey kids better check the tires on the rover before we take off ( while parents are standing waaaay far off in the distance ) I have over 90 hours on this game and I still play it after work with the kids. We are looking forward to growing with the game and the new adventures that await us.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-26,0,0,6,True,Recommended,This game is really fun and great to look at. Def worth a look if you like to explore planets and deform them too.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Great game that I would recommend to anyone! The art design is really nice and it makes a nice mix between no man's sky and minecraft. I personally love it and would like to see it become a bigger game in the future!,ASTRONEER

2017-04-17,0,0,17,True,Recommended,"Don't let the ""PRE ALPHA"" description scare you off. This is solid and deep and extremely well done. It's ready to purchase now.As a software developer let me just say that this game in it's current ""pre alpha"" form is more solid and complete than most final releases. It's really well made and although I wish the terrain colors were different once you get used to it it's really quite something. It's deep but not overly complex although initially frustrating as the one thing the alpha is missing is some guidance on methods. It has one ""cheat sheet"" help screen which covers a lot and it's quite simple once you get it but there's a small frustrating learning curve for the first 30 60 minutes while you figure out what a tutorial would probably show you in the final release. So just a bit of alpha/beta pain that can be overcome. Same for the terrain editing but once you get used to it it's better than most and very solid in terms of reliability. Overall this is already one of my favorite exploration / survival / space / engineering / building / resource gathering games actually probably my fave. And officially it's ""pre alpha"". Not one crash. Not one problem. Not one weird bug. Amazing.So if you THINK you might like this or you're wasting time with inferior things like Minecraft grab a copy of this. It will only get better and better has incredible potential and is already very wonderful. Well done guys. Finish it off and ship it and it will be a classic.",ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,8,True,Recommended,This game is amazing.its that PERFECT game everyone needs to play.PROS Basic graphics yet so amazing and beutiful. No HUD so no distractions. In game crafting.(meaning you don't have to open somthing up to make somthing other then the backpack.) interactive crafting Grinding is not to boreing De forming mats and ground is sasisifying. Mutiplayer havent tried it but sounds amazing. Vehicles are interesting.CONS Early access. why cant this be out yet?!?!? Crashes for some every 5 10 mins or so. lost alot of progress cuz of this. I have a GTX 970 and this game likes to lag spike alot. still playable tho. and alot of fun. Probaly many bugs.11/10 would buy again.TL DRNo mans sky and terratech had a baby. Astroneer.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,7,True,Recommended,After just over 2 hours playing i can easily say the game is good but not fully there yet. In my opinion what puts this way ahead of No Man's Sky is the multiplayer and the interface that being said Multiplayer is extremely glitchy not even just a little Me and a couple friends have encountered our vehicles teleporting to the sky glitching under the map and dying numerous times and a lot of rubberbanding no matter who hosted the server. I personally can't see anyone fully enjoying the game without friends (just like minecraft) so with the money that is being flooded from early access purchases I do expect fixes to these bugs as well as allowing more people to join in one server. As for the quests and different interactions to continue playing more features should be added down the line but it shouldn't be a direct priority. A HUGE NOTE Terrain building and removing sucks even with ctrl which is meant to smoothen it out it is a huge fail. Overall the game may have not had the best initial execution but when compared to No Man's Sky it is the best option and all of my issues can be addressed through updates Astroneer is still a huge thumbs up in my book.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I've never bought any game in Early Access this is the first time I bought one in its early stages due to the concept and the look of the game. So far I have no regrets this game is beautiful. Being in early access expect bugs glitches and crashes(as of the time of writing I only experienced one ctd) but aside from that everything is good. I really liked the game so far and I will keep on playing it. The lack of content is understandable but in it the game is functional. I already travelled to 4 planets had to wait for my home planet to be close in order to travel back to it and the feeling of going back is great. Anyway to end this I'd give it a 7.5/10. Playable!,ASTRONEER

2017-01-29,0,0,370,True,Recommended,Amazing little game which has so much potential. At first this game will hook and reel you in but after 3hrs you'll find that you've researched eveything you need and all is left is to make strange sculptures with the terrform tool. Needs more content and goals.More solar systems.Online multiplayer servers that you can join.Custom spaceships or different spaceships.Personally I would like a jetpack please.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Man this game is great. I've only payed the game for 4 hours but the experience ive had so far is amazing. The devs are some of the best devs I have ever seen the game while it crashes a lot is feature packed and the lowpoly artstyle fits perfectly. The only recomendations i would hav for the devs is to one and a TEMPARARY save buton in the escape menu or a quicksave feature (Because the game is so unstable right now ) and some graphics settings to reduce the toll on peoples computers (for example i only get 30 FPS when i coud get up to 60).,ASTRONEER
2017-01-29,0,0,14,True,Recommended,This a great game with so much potenital! It still needs work but with support the game devs could do so much.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,35,True,Recommended,I fricken LOVE this game. It has its bugs and an unessasarily long load time and can get laggy at some points but nonetheless fun. I love the crafting system and i think some improvements like named becans can be added but the running around space part is fun. I hope they add in some aliens or sandstorms more frequently because its hard to die and i love that frustration of arg no i got to find my stuff. Anyways if this game is this great and only in pre alpha then this games got potential and this thing is what no mans sky should have been.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,16,True,Recommended,So far SO GOOD!Very promising for a Pre Alpha game. I just bought it today and have already put in 7 hours. So much fun so far.I can't wait for the future updates of this game!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,89,True,Recommended,In pre alpha state it's already everything that I'd ever hoped No Man's Sky could have been and quite a bit more.

2016-12-17,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Does what an early access title should. Engine works well had a single crash when I tried to create a connection with a kink in it but otherwise stable.

2016-12-22,0,0,28,True,Recommended,TL DR Devs are very active w/ the community and are asking us for some feedback like ideas or any bugs we come across. There is lots to do for the first 45 hours then you gotta think outside the box. Ex. Race to setting up every crafting station with a friend making art with the deformer conquer every square meter of the solar system and/or rover races. This game is do able alone but all the more fun with up to 4 friends. ...But everytime you say Astroneer the game gets better. This is the worst game ever never touching it aga.... This has to be the funnest space crafting game I've played thus far and heres why. Pro's and other nice things The menus and GUI and very clean Your thrown right into the game with easy to learn controls You get to choose 4 adorable Astronuts D There is much to do much to see and all the time in the world Con's None(It's early access so yes your going to fall through the world in a super fun way and get shot up into the next planet over yes the game will crash and yes the multiplayer is a pain in the a** 1 out of 15 times but this isn't forever and it't not game breaking to the point where you can't play.)b Opinion /b It popped up in my recommended games and I just yolo'd my way to the buy screen and it was the right move.This is a great way to pass a few hours with some friends as it Currently supports 4 player co op.This is very early access so keep an open mind. The dev's are very active with the community so far and thats great. They have a planned road map (not very detail because they are just working on bugs atm for all platforms and are working on getting feedback from us such as bugs or ideas and thats amazing!) MY ONLY GRIPE is that you can't change the size of the deformer tool. Having an option to make or carve smaller or larger pathways/creations would be awesome! Do yourself a favor and JUST DO IT!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,149,True,Recommended,This game is pretty damn cool. It does still have a lot of bugs of course which is to be expected. I would definitely recommend it though. The most wonky thing right now in game is the driving around in vehicles IMO. ALso You do fall through the terrain quite often at least I do. Some of my caves that I have explored are all jacked up too. You can see through the walls and see where all the resources are. The game does crash every now and then while saving the game. Ive already explored 3 different planets which are sorta similar but have different resources on the surface. Im just curious how often the game will be updated. I give the game a solid 8/10 right now.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-17,0,0,179,True,Recommended,One of the best space sandboxes I have been in and it being early access dosen't stop me one bit from loving every second of play. Not to mention the Devs have been very hard at work to give this game updates almost once a week if not every other week at the most. As for were this game will end up when its finished is going to be an amazing journy to find out,ASTRONEER

That being said the game has a kind of Minecraft ish feel to it and the graphics are very pleasing. The roadmap for this game is available online and some of the features they plan to include are things like trading AI animals Loot/Drops a hunger/farming dynamic and more.

2017-02-17,0,0,6,True,Recommended,I think this game has a ton of potential. My fiance loves these types of building/exploration/resource games and being a aerospace engineer this definetly stole her attention. Colors are great seems like there is some solid gameplay and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. However make sure you have someone to play with it definetly ups the experience. Also I seem to have some pretty major performance issues the longer the game runs due to optimization. It really kills the experience for me once we get the bass to a respectible size. However I know the devs are working hard on getting these kind of fixes into the game so for now I'll give it a thumbs up. If performance issues don't get solved within a reasonable time I might vote down since going from 60 fps to 15 really kills the experience. Also screw sandstorms.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Early access. Sometimes you win (Prison Architect Factorio) sometimes you lose (Godus and many many others). Thankfully this conforms to the former a solid Alpha release that is an intuitive albeit rather casual third person exploration/base building game.Exploration is a key focus in the procedurally generated environment. Rewards of rare minerals and research development are granted to those brave enough to venture away from the safety of your base. I am not qualified to comment on multiplayer I have only been playing single player. Spoilers Below.PROS For me it is a calming experience watching the planetoid rotate in concert with other planets and stars. Minimalistic art direction. Not everyone's cup of tea but I appreciate the aesthetic. Music is soothing. Backpack mechanic upgrades will sacrifice precious inventory space. Choose wisely. Animations are good intentionally ragdoll the Astroneer with a debris storm. Oddly satisfying. Vehicles are limited but varied each with their own unique attributes and handling characteristics. Kid friendly. Casual game style no gore limb amputations or unpleasantness. No shooting aliens. However you do disrupt the lifecycle of various flora based life forms. Accessible and intuitive. No HUD. Think Dead Space. Spelunking is rewarding. Terrain manipulation is fun. Procedural world generation appears to be balanced quite well. Obvious pro active Developer support so far so good! Well communicated actively engaging the community Early Access done right.CONS (Early Access not representative of final product) Frame rate issues. After playing for awhile the game gets quite choppy. Terrain flora pop ins. Camera issues (rare) Bugs (Clipping physics also rare) Needs more content. Late game needs some kind of reward system/motivator.As it stands I am giving this a 75 out of 100 I could realistically see this being bumped to low 90's once the bugs are ironed out more content added and everything is optimised. Very promising.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-21,0,0,14,True,Recommended,I love this game even though its just early access.I love the adventure the research aspects of the game and accidentally falling down a hole I didnt see and dying upon impact with the earth below.Not only that playing with friends makes the experiance more enjoyable especially when you hear your friend wailing in the distance because they forgot oxygen is a thing.My only gripes though are... Vehicles in multiplayer. You cant move 2 feet without the truck bugging out and flying into orbit hopefully it will be fixed soon. The framerate. I dont know if its just me but the framerate is pretty meh. I get about 5 10 fps even with the draw distance at a minimum. Running out of research real fast. Once you complete all research theres not much to do but get materials. With there was more to get from the special research nodes. No multiplayer lobby. As much as I love playing with friends its hard to get started and have them join you. Sometimes it will force them into the game alone or join someone else's game that you didn't intend to join (Aka thats not your friend)Other than that I would totally reccomend this game to play alone and with friends!,ASTRONEER

2017-02-17,0,0,88,True,Not Recommended,I loved this game played it alot thoroughly enjoyed exploring the planet and building fancy structures that help me drive through caves easily and fast. Once my beautiful structures were made to get down to a great central place in the cave I get the brilliant idea to run tethers from my home base to the cave so I'd literally have infinite power for all the mining my little heart could desire. It was a little bit a journey but in no seems was it a length that should cause any kind of issues with how the game runs. As soon as the lost line was connected frame rates drops to a level that was unplayable. I disconect one of the tethers runs perfectly fine connect it back runs like hot garbage. Not a deal breaker i just disconnected it and went back to mining whatever I wanted to. After a while I had grown tired of my home planet due to the lack of rare resources. So I build a great ship that can voyage the galaxy as well as carry plenty of supplies that I would need in costructing a base on a new planet. Worst decision of my astroneer life. The new planet was full of riches and beautiful colors. The weather system on this little piece of hell is the same of Jupiter. Huge storms ever 5 10 minutes that completely hault any kind of work being doing or navigations that are being traveled. Not only that one of the boneheaded developers thought it would be an amazing idea to add plants the size of tuleps these stupid little plants the size of about 3 inches completely stops any vehicle you are trying to drive. These plants are what kill this game. So not only do I have to try to drive around on a planet full of nothing but craters around every corner these stupid little plants that serve absolutely no purpose but to annoy you and make you spend time trying to drive through a forest like patch of tuleps that are better served as spike strips. Then there are the endless amounts of boulders that serve no purpose but to get in your way and slow you down. Maybe if they could be broken down into smaller rocks or serve some kind of material purpose then it would be understandable. But to have over half the items on the game to have no use other than to get in your way is more than a head scratcher. The lack of any kind of compass map or any other device that would be able to help you navigate where you are going to/from. The game is still in early access so that could be the blame for the frame rates but makes no sense that a few tethers would cripple this game. My PC is able to run any game that I've got on ultra so that is no the issue. The game is actually pretty decent other than a few issues that could be easily fixed. Freedom of taking a blank canvas and building huge structures that help you maneuver throughout the world is something that I was really drawn towards. About half of my gametime was probly spent on building things like this. However the past 2 3 hours of game time have simply been me trying to find my way back to my base. Hours of driving through canyons just to get stuck on a stupid little plant. An indistructable plant that is not used for anything and has no purpose. There's also times where you will be digging and BOOM all of a sudden you fall through the ground. While this has screwed me over a few times most of the time you can figure it out to come back out where you fell through but this is quite a hinderance.The basics of the game are great haven't came accross many bugs other than falling through the floor. But at times this bug will either get you killed or drops you to a lower level in a cave which lets you run around then eventually die of lack of oxygen because it is impossible to find your way back to your vehicle. Until they make some changes and add some type of navigation I wouldn't really recommend this game. You will get to a point where there's nothing to do but to drive around a mine but you will come accross these stupid little plants that make mining an impossible task.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-21,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Pretty fun game so far couple glitches here and there and a couple irratating things that will most likely get fixed like the winch or the fact that if you find a huge solar panel in mountains good luck getting it out because digging and reforming is such a pain. All in all I like this game and it has potential once you first start out and get a good chunk in. Have discovered 85% maybe of what there is to find. Travel to other planets possible?

2016-12-18,0,0,20,True,Recommended,As of December 23rd the game has made leaps of improvement. The game is now playable in both singleplayer and multiplayer but it still has FPS issues and various annoying bugs. The FPS very quickly reaches unplayable levels if you venture too far into one direction even on very high end hardware. The framerate will continue to chug until you start new on a new planet. In multiplayer if you collect more resources from a vein than you can store in your backpack the extra resource will drop on the ground and you will not be able to pick it up. There are many other small annoying bugs that make the game less enjoyable but Astroneer is definitely at least playable in its current state.If you can look past the buggy state of the game Astroneer provides a very compelling experience with plenty of potential for improvement. There's several different types of biomes with different terrain features and aesthetics. It seems like every cave you enter is unique and they seem to go on forever. The terraforming tool is very intuitive allowing you to raise lower and smooth the terrain any way you please. You can even build a skybridge to space or tunnel right through a planet to the other end. If you start to get bored of your surrounding you can build a spaceship and fly to a different part of the planet or go even further and explore new celetial bodies. There's six different types of planets in the game and they all have unique environmental hazards and resource distributions. You can colonize all six planets in one savegame and travel between them easily. Currently there's about eight hours of content avaliable in the game. That's a fairly small amount for a sandbox type game and I hope to see the game expanded in the following years. The game has more content than most games fresh out of early access and it just went on sale ( in early access) a couple days ago. The devs have fixed the biggest issues with the game in record pace and they're already working on new features to add to the game surpassing my expectation of slow moving development. The game was unplayable in multiplayer on launch day and now it seems to be mostly stable despite framerate issues. 18 Dec Previous Review The game is nearly unplayable in multiplayer with crashes and framerate drops that gradually get worse as you progress. If you crash your character simply disappears and your items are left behind floating in thin air. This is especially frusturating when you're deep in a cave and there's no way to tell where you died. Tethers in the game can detatch from each other seemingly randomly and this can leave you without oxygen deep in a cave system causing you to lose all your items. Sometimes a party member will crash while joining the game leaving behind a ghost capsule that persists through reloads. After this the game will crash if you try to join a friend through the steam interface without them inviting you.Luckily most of the game's shortcomings persist to the fact that crashing is persistant in multiplayer and less frequently in singleplayer. If you're looking for a good singleplayer experience and you have a mid range computer with a good CPU you can play singleplayer to an extent. Make sure to save frequently as crashes are still plentiful at an average of every 45 minutes or so but this is much better than 15 minutes for multiplayer. If you can look past the crashing Astroneer provides a very compelling experience with plenty of potential for improvement. There's several different types of biomes with different terrain features and aesthetics. It seems like every cave you enter is unique and they seem to go on forever.

Currently there's about eight hours of content avaliable in the game. That's a fairly small amount for a sandbox type game and I hope to see the game expanded in the following years. I can't recommend the game in its current state. The game is completely littered with bugs framerate drops and crashes. However Astroneer has a lot of potential but keep in mind that you're buying the game as is. Updates are not guarenteed as with any early access / crowdfunded product. Be prepared to part with your money if the developer decides to abandon the project. There are no consumer protections when it comes to buying this game (nor any early access title not trying to single out the developer) and you can't get a refund if you've played more than 2 hours or owned the game for two weeks. Don't buy this game unless you're willing to accept the chance that the game may never be fully fixed.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-25,0,0,12,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is a very great game. I reccomend it to everyone. It's very fun and addicting and just... cool. Here are some pros and cons PROS Addicting Fun to play The concept of the game is creative and really cool. If you've seen Markiplier's lets play of it he says ""OMG this is soooo cool"" too many times and you will most likely have a similar reaction. If you used to like Minecraft and got bored of it or quit becuase the community just sucks now you'll probably like this game. It's ""crafting"" is a lot more hands on and i'll say it again more cool. CONS If your computer isn't to great the game lags. It's not horrible so dont worry unless your computer is really bad. The game is in it's pre alpha so there's only 9 12 hours of play time before you have everything and there really isn't much to do. Of course you can start a new world but I'm hoping that much much more will be added in the future. Moving around and some other things are kinda wierd in general even though it could just just be my lag because my computer sucks. Sometimes the camera angles are weird like you'll walk into a structure and it'll show a close up of the wall of it rather than showing your actual character. I wish you could switch into 1st person.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-18,0,0,25,True,Recommended,This game is everything a early acess game needs to be and then some. Active devoulpers game runs good enough for early access and while it has a lack luster ammount of content atm i belive this game is going to take System Era Softworks far in the industry.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-21,0,0,227,True,Recommended,Fun game with good visuals and interesting planets. Its awesome for being pre alpha and doesn't have too many bugs. I look forward to this game having more progress done with it. Right now it's a little limited with the number of things you can research and the game loses it's goal other than making more bases. I hope to see more vehicles some creatures more plant variety.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-21,0,0,63,True,Recommended,Loving this game! Multiplayer has some small but not game breaking bugs. The game overall still needs more end game content (imagine that its in Alpha). It was well worth the $20.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,1,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER is easily the most visually appealing game I've come accross to date. I am blown away by the breath taking artwork of this game and look forward to delving deeper into this growing adventure.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,33,True,Recommended,GAME OF THE YEAR!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Absolutely loving it so far. I was a bit hesitant to buy based on the reviews/comments regarding framerate/crashing issues. I watched a couple of guys stream on youtube and none of them seemed to have this issue so I gave it a shot. I have played for around 2 hours without any issue whatsoever regarding either framerates or crashes. The game runs butter smooth for me well above 60 fps and ive had no crashes. Not even as much as a stutter. Im running a 1060 with an i5 6600K. Based on a couple comments it seems that one of the issues had to do with the tethering system. I tested this out (through regular gameplay need them to breath) and they havnt seemed to affect my performance (ive built 100+ by this point). Obviously there is an issue for some but I have yet to see any sort of problems with perfomance. The only bug I have come across was when I built a module while standing in its path. I kinda got stuck inside it and my character starting panicking it was quite funny really. After some squirming I was able to escape deaths grasp. Other than that flawless gameplay so far. The graphics are beautiful. May not be for everyone but man I think it looks amazing. My first experience with a storm was great! The animations for the main character are done really well and are quite charming im really digging the entire design direction of this game. I am really liking the music as well very relaxing. *Edit* The music is fantastic plain and simple.* Ive found two caves so far one of which has a hole that goes deep deep down. I see some rrealllly cool looking stuff down there but I Havnt gone down yet because im not sure how to do it without dying from the fall xD. Ive spent the majority of my play time exploring one of these caves which is MASSIVE and building a few various modules on my base. Just built my first vehicle now im ready for the real adventures! On that note the vehicle controls are a bit loose. But i mean....ive never driven in an environment with different gravity so this may be an intentional aspect and I dont really fault the game for it either way. I am really looking forward to seeing what the devs are able to do with this game and I'm glad that I made the jump into its early access. Happy exploring everyone!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,28,True,Recommended,ok ok ok i love the hell out of this game but and this is a big but like omg look at the bubble butt there are some save bug that are killing it other than that and some funny little bugs its so good,ASTRONEER

2016-12-19,0,0,1,True,Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU EXPECT A SOMEWHAT COMPLETE GAME! This game has a lot of potential and is very fun but there is not a lot to do currently so unless you want to actively help the developer and watch the game grow it is best to wait. Still you can currently get a few hours of new material if you play now and I'm sure more will be added regularly. Also the game is still very buggy due to it being in production still.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,31,True,Recommended,A game with already playable features huge promise and a %50 chance of running on your rig without fatally frezing up every five minutes. If this game progresses as intended DEFINATELY worth it's asking price. If it stays a buggy freeze o matic windstorm then it will not be worth one red cent. I have an FX 8320 EVGA GTX 970 SSC ACX 2.0 8 GB of Aveir RAM all on a 990FX ASRock Extreme 6 and as of right now I have reinstalled this game twice and the only way I can play for even twenty minute intervals is turning down all TWO of the graphical setting options two the absolute bottom (render distance and V Sync).,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,2,True,Recommended,My name is Laika and I'm an Astronaut in real life and I would like to confirm that everything in this game is 100% accurate to reality on other planets. In so much that I would much less call this a game rather than a simulator for real life especially my life... But I digress. If you're thinking of buying this game consider a few things first Who should buy this game If you're preparing to leave Earth at some point and live on another planet this game is for you. If you want to know how to attach a research module to your space pod (you need 3 Resin btw) this game is for you. If you're a hobbiest into the following things Building sh*t researching sh*t terraforming sh*t or doing sh*tty things of the like this game is for you. If you like mincraft then f**k off. This isn't minecraft...Who shouldn't buy this game If you liked No Man's Sky. You're lying to yourself and you'll probably give this game a bad review cause you're an idiot. If you're a billionaire... Why are you reading this if you're a billionaire? If you're dead.

2016-12-18,0,0,55,True,Recommended,VERY Beta... STILL a better game than No Mans Sky. LoL! Once the crashing gets fixed a bit for Multiplayer this is going to be an amazing game. Good purchase for now just dont expect to do much with all the crashing (curently 12 18 16 build) Overall this will be a great game for open world explore/build/Multiplayer fun. Looking forward to future builds. Good job!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,18,True,Recommended,The game has an adorable style it runs smooth except for a few collision bugs hasn't crashed once simple to play but also enchanting in a way. Great game especially in pre alpha state can't wait to see it grow.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,38,True,Recommended,Wow currently my favourite game. The introduction says it is in Alpha even pre Alpha but they are doing beta testing. I think it is further along than many beta games I have played. Many people say it is similar to minecraft I don't play minecraft so I wouldn't know. What I do know is that I quite often find myself playing till 2 3 am in the morning losing track of time and playing for 8 hours. While it is in alpha/beta there are few bugs left and reporting them gets them fixed.In reviewing this I decided to describe the game so you get a gist of what it is like.So basically you start with a landing capsule on a planet and build your base up. At first you have to stay in range of your base because you need oxygen and energy the latter is not essential. You need compounds (which you mine or trade for) to build tether lines which link you to the base and provide constant oxygen and energy the latter provided you have built energy collectors. You can upgrade your character so you can carry more oxygen and more energy. Energy is produced in 3 ways you can mine it you can regenerate it with your suit by building mini solar collectors or a little wind turbine or even carry a little generator around with you in your backpack or you can build vehicles and mount solar collectors on them. Your suit stores oxygen but you cannot produce it in there. Vehicles have constant oxygen in them it seems but without energy in them they won't run ) they can be used to weather out storms.So basically you mine explore build in this game mining is simplistic as you find the item called compound mine it until you have enough to make one stack and then depending on the number of stacks you need of a particular mineral you can build firstly the extension to your base (with resin) then build the work top for example smelter to melt minerals raw copper into stacks of copper etc. trade centre vehicle station research etc.Uou power these buildings by building additional power generator/collectors in your base these are different from your suit but suit versions can be used in your base initially. It takes energy to mine and you can basicallty dig minerals out and dig further under ground into whole cave structures with minerals and find hidden items research items crashes space ships with techniology you can then research.There is a multiplayer option I have not really encountered anyone.You can build vehicles link them together so you have more space to carry things build upgradews cranes winches build additional storage power etc.So you build the main base then you find the research for say rover truck shuttle spaceships p Yes you can use a shuttle to land elsewhere start a second base or you can find the research for a spaceship and build on a new planet.So far things that have killed me storms throwing rocks at me poison underground and falling off a cliff into an area underground.No monsters thankfully I hope they don't add any Ossiris New Dawn is a similar game thopugh more realistic graphics it has monsters. this game uses anime style graphics beautiful tundras vibrant colours etc.Pros Explore mine research build craft grow more advanced tech use vehicles build shuttles and ultimately a sapce ship vibrant colours beautiful landscapes very impressed price seems really low I think once this game is finished price could double.Cons Ok so it is in Alpha/Beta atm and there are some bugs and they fixing them as well as adding new content so my main gripes atm are to do with pregame bugs they will fix. If you build too many vehicles it slows your game down if you build too many tether lines same thing (though they have fixed that now former is still a problem) you cannot presently unbuild something so if you build too many vehicles and it slows game down then you prolly need to go back to an older save. There is less control over saves I think it would be nice instead of just saving when you get in a vehicle or on a spaceship/base to be able to save with descriptive saves so it is then possible to over save your good game with a laggy game.Awesome Game though playing this while waiting for Mass Effect 4 dig the whole exploration theme build craft etc. ),ASTRONEER
2017-01-18,0,0,36,True,Recommended,A great early access game SO FAR. I expect more content in future updates. There is a good amount of current content which works well and is implemented well. The game does a great job of keeping you immersed in the game. There is no extra menus that need to be pulled up in game. As you interact with objects you will put them directly on your backpack and take them off just as easily. Immersion in this game is 10/10.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-18,0,0,26,True,Recommended,I bought this game so I could play with friends but I also played a lot by myself. There are TONS of bugs in the game mostly in multiplayer. Some cases I fell through the map and lost a lot of items that I needed. Also rovers too many will break your game believe me my friends and I broke the game after building too many rovers. Even though this game is buggy it's really fun game and would highly reccomend this game as patches and bug fixes are gonna come and fix a lot of stuff (hopefully).,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,11,True,Recommended,its a realy fun game that id like to get into more but it crashes quite frequently and keeps me from progressing. however this game has a whole lot of potential. very fun and surprizingly beautiful for an early access game. tip for now untill there is better optimization and crash fixes. if the game starts to lose frames and lag dont move and let it cach up. if not usualy ends in a frozen frame. save as much as possible. all in all better than most early access games ive tried. keep up the good work devs.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,7,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. I played around 6 hours so far with my girlfriend. You start from nothing and the grudally create different blocks like a printer vehicle facility etc. One hour later you have a huge truck that drills the terrain. It's a game about exploration and having fun. As usual the exprience is way better when playing with friends. And yes it has some weird bugs as expected but I have seen betas way less stable. The future is brigth!Public roadmap https //trello.com/b/UoZgKrd3/astroneer road map planning,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game is amazing! I'm not kidding I love it. I'm running the game on a AMD 8350 GTX 960 with 4gb of ram and a WD Black HDD. it is stuttering now that I've been loading the map but I'm sure that'll be fixed in a future update. If you were disapointed with No Mans Sky then this is the game for you. I would definatly recommend this game. If you're debating if you should get the game then just do it. it's got a decent price and I'm sure you'll love it. If you have a windows 7 machine you might have some problems loading the game that's what I had but then I just re upgraded to windows 10 and the problem is gone. 10/10,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Despite the game being in pre alpha state I can say confidently that the developers have something special here. The art style gameplay and foundation are all here. All that lacks is polish and more content for this game to erase NO MAN'S SKY from our memory. My quick thoughts below.Pros Simple but intuitive gameplay Fantastic art style...reminds me of cel shaded graphics from Wind Waker back on Gamecube Fun discovering blueprints/research materials keeps you wanting to explore Captures the sense of discovery and loneliness on a deserted planet Very fun with a friend/multiplayer Can get hooked for hours Cons Pre Alpha stage so lacks polish Some framerate dips despite well exceeding recommended requirements Needs more content (nitpicky as the game is still pre Alpha) No NPCs or enemies Get this game early if you want to support the devs. There is potential here!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Its cool has a lot of potential but its not ready yet.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-27,0,0,42,True,Recommended,Great game. Lots to do even in the early stages of development. Driving mechanic bugs are probably to most annoying but they are getting better with each update. Can't wait to see what is added as development continues.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-20,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I've been burned by Early Access titles many times so I was nervous about a game that looked so promising right out of the gate. Now that I've played for a little while my worries are gone. Astroneer is a ton of fun with a unique mechanic that makes shaping the world and gathering resources fun again. While it may be a bit light on content at the moment Astroneer has enough to keep players engaged. I can't wait to see what this game shapes into. As long as the developers keep the quality level as high as the initial release this game has a bright future.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,121,True,Recommended,A simple but elegent UI. Expansive exploration and survival. Myriad of options for discovery and death. I'm seriouly liking this pre alpha even with the issues most of which are minor (except maybe for the horrendous FPS due to sound defects at certain times). So much going for it and I'm still finding new and wonderful things that I have no clue as to how they work within the game world (glowing black &amp white striped marble I'm talking to you). For the price point this is at you'll get more hours of fun than a number of AAA games that are over in a day. Just read the discussions on Steam and decide whether you can accept the short comings and glitches. I'm on to my 3rd play through and still enjoying it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-20,0,0,29,True,Recommended,Amazing game if the devs keep up with bug fixes and adding more content this game will soon become one of my most played games.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Astroneers is a good game for alpha but the beginning is a little hard and it does not explain to you how to play very well. I overall recommend this game to people who like to take risks on adventures without having to much of a challenge.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,85,True,Recommended,This game is extremely fun. Anyone who has enjoyed Minecraft will enjoy Astroneer even more.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,22,True,Recommended,"(Early Access Review)Astroneer is a cute little game that has a beautiful game engin irrisitable sound effects and a wel made crafting system that I myself have not fully explored through.Indeed this are some of the good qualities of the game for the first 5 hours of the game I found those aspects very riviting howver now I started to find the game a little boring. Perhaps the multiplayer aspect could fill the void for some. (but i got no friends) XDI would recomend this game to a gamer who might want to play this when they have a little spare time and likes voxel based games.This game will not suite those who want to fill the void where ""No Man's Sky"" should be and you wonn't be able to get 100's of hours out of this.Overall I would rate it a 8/10 as there is still more to come.",ASTRONEER
2017-01-11,0,0,3,True,Recommended,A game with GREAT POTENTIAL.

2017-01-28,0,0,28,True,Recommended,This is a really Special Game. It is a fun new take of the Open World Builder Genre and I have to admit it is a take that surprised me with how well it works. Exploring the world finding caves and canyons digging up strange plants and hostile envrioment is quite challenging as you always have to look on your Oxygen and Energy. The World building tool is well implemented as it is vital for shaping the landscape for your Base.I fell in love with this game and showed it to my 3 Mates which immediatly bought it as well and joined me.The Multiplayer has a few flaws but works WAY better than on any Alpha Game I played so far. It runs smoothly with a few lag spikes here and there the only real issue I encountered was that when visiting someones elses Game on a different Planet I could not see any buildings.Designing Building and Traveling with the vehicles is can be improved but works fine so far.I have to say I am really looking forward to the next updates and patches. This game is a great promise to what is yet to come and I have high hopes for it.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-19,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Great game so far and worked great on my PC. Played about 9 hours and I think I have seen everything. Base building and vehicles with lots of mining and exploring. Very early but looks great and has potential. Cant wait to see how the devs handle everything. Its very easy to find a stream to check it out.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Asthetially VERY pleasant! A good relaxed sandbox enough things to do to occupy several hours not so many threats to keep you stressed out all th etime but enough threats to keep it a game play and not just a creative play. I was hesitant to go with $20 for the level of development but it looked good enough to take the minor plunge. (If it were to stop development as is it'd still have been worth about $10 to me.) Potential for new rescources alien life forms additional planets building options etc looks very goos and currently no sign of slowing development.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-19,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Honestly this is probably one of the best games I have ever purchased minus the old c&amp c games and the fallout series of games. This game was recommended by a friend I checked it out and fell in love with it. I like how the game itself is chill you just have to be mindful of basics I imagine that since this is pre alpha they will probably add more modules and dodads for us to build with the latest patch I seem to have a small issue with loosing sound but I am sure it will be caught and that is far better then the bug where my trucks went flying away then swallowed up by the ground in multi player when my friend and I had played it. Definatly a recommended game if you want to take a break from all the commanding conquering and defending various universes and just kind of do your own thing in what I believe to be a uniquely rendered game envirionment. Kudos to the creators and developers keep it coming I cant wait to see what alpha is like ),ASTRONEER
2017-01-19,0,0,40,True,Recommended,A great game to play with friends and alone but theres some problems that sometimes you can glitch under the map but ofcourse its only early access so they are problably going to fix that but its a good game i recommend it,ASTRONEER

2016-12-19,0,0,17,True,Recommended,It's visually stunning has pretty fun things to do to build your base up and It's great with friends. It's early access so it has a few bugs here and there but it's still playable.Go try it out !,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,5,True,Recommended,So far this game is very very early in developement so there isn't too much to review. But what's already there to review is good indeed! The graphics are charming the sounds fit the visual design very well while still sounding realistic the gameplay if simple is still plenty of fun and there's still so much yet to see added by the developers. The only three downsides to the game right now is one that there isn't enough to keep players busy for an extended period of time and as it is right now this is the sort of thing I could see myself sitting down to play an hour or two a day in between working on other things and playing other games.As for number two it's simple. The game isn't optimized. It lags far more than even my heavily modded Skyrim client. But for what it's worth those issues are being cut down on piece by piece with each and every update and I'm excited to see where this game goes. As for the third this is just a personal complaint but some updates seem to re generate the map leading to weird holes in the world that you can fall through. To TL DR what I just said here.Pros Beautiful graphics always fun to look at.Good sound effects fits the graphics yet still sounds realistic.Simple yet fun game mechanics. Oxygen power and resources easy to manage once you get used to it.Casual gameplay easier to get into than more challenging competitors such as Space Engineers and From the Depths (which I am guilty of playing so I should know.)Good background music. It is simple and subtle yet benefits the alien and wondrous atmosphere quite well.Cons Not optimized yet (lots of FPS lag.)Some bugs present such as occasional crashes to desktop though the game's apparent autosaving behind the scenes can help make that a bit less painful.Not enough content yet (for my tastes at least ) this problem will be fixed over time as the developers add more to the game.Overall would I recommend this game? Definitely. For twenty dollars? If you can afford it then yes it's worth the money already and should become even more so as time goes on and more updates get issued.,ASTRONEER

Having played a fair amount of games *especially ones in pre alpha &amp beta* I can already say that this is a game I will be playing for a while.Pros 1. Beautiful Game period what can I say just have a look at some of the screenshots people have taken.2. Creatve in where it is somewhere of a successful re imagination of Mincraft with landscape modifications and crafting but different. Not at all a copy but rather improved and changed to fit the astetics and playstyle of this game *very nice*.3. Open having played a fair amount of alpha and beta games this is easely the one that is the most open. Even before buying the game I joined the Discord server and the steam community getting some quick thoughts on what are some of the games pros and cons also being able to suggest improvements directly and together with other players seeing them being put into the game a couple hours later so something I have not seen in a while.4.

It is realitvely empty yes there theoretically an endless amount of things you can do you find yourself doing many things over and over again and not just like the grind game it is but rather cause there is nothing else no missions no ""larger"" idea behind it *yet*. 2. Its glitchy laggy and does a little what it wants There are a fair amount of glitches crashes and other things you run into! But we can assume it gets better and better as we play along.3. Basics the thing I found most annoying was not having the basic settings one is used to where I should be able to have some sort of graphics settings saved games cant be deleted and other things that one assumes cant be so hard to add. Overall Astroneer is a cool game it looks amazing and plays okay. I would recommend it to any one who will give a game a couple hours someone who can enjoy chatting with other gamers of the stupid glitch that killed them both a couple of minutes ago. I would not recommend it to a jump in and play gamer this is not such a game. This is a long term investment where you give in to glitches lag and other sometimes frustrating things to be a part of it to enable yourself to come a level depper into the creation of the game. *this review may be up for edit every 6 or so playhours*",ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,11,True,Recommended,I was chosen to explore the planet we were orbiting so I launched off from the station within the small pod that I hoped would not become my grave any time soon. But it nearly did as it plummeted downwards and ended up landing inside a canyon that proved to be an entrance to a vast network of tunnels below the surface of the planet. I started to carefully examine my surroundings and soon noticed that to my luck there was a natural ramp upwards to the surface of the planet as well as one leading deeper into the canyon and the tunnels. I had little idea what I was supposed to do next as I had slept throughout most of the classes back the the Astronaut academy. I figured out from the simple user's manual the buttons to my equipment after some.. considerable time. After learning how to do some simple landscaping I started my quest for materials for some heavy duty base building. This planet would soon yield me its bounty! Little did I know that the underground caverns were filled with hostile lifeforms and they surrounded me in every direction... I realized that I'd have to science the %&amp # out of this in order to survive. So like in that movie where Matt Damon becomes a potato on Mars* I began to build my Empire. I would soon rule the land with an iron fist! *I did not actually watch that movie... yet. This game is absolutely fantastic by the way.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,62,True,Recommended,Review date December 19 2016It's rough. It is a pre alpha. There are bugs there are hilarious physics blow outs specially with the truck . Frame rate drops will happen in most systems. Multiplayer is broken and at this moment I'd only consider that aspect of the game a demo. That being said this game is absolutely worth it. Devs are diligently working on it it is a labor of love and it shows. There is lots to do lots to explore lots to build and lots to speculate about as the game is clearly not finished. It is what it is a pre alpha early access game. A really really REALLY good and fun pre alpha early access game. 16 hours in and the worst thing I experienced was the buggy co op which was about an hour of that game time . I will update this review as the game continues to develop.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,1,True,Recommended,I recommend this game when it's out complete because it lags so bad that I have to restart the computer if they fix it then it would very fun to play.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,75,True,Recommended,This is an amazing game. The graphics in my opinion are awesome. There are some faults though and yes I know it's in Pre Alpha.1. Many of the worlds are corrupted and have cracks in them which causes you to lose many ground vehicles. My friends and I worked towards a truck and crane for a long time and then it glitched through the world with our stuff.2. There really needs to be over 4 players allowed in a multiplayer game /,ASTRONEER
2017-01-28,0,0,36,True,Recommended,This game is very fun. You should add a multiplayer button when you start,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Its the best game i have played in a long time worth every penny cant wait for future updates. 100% of Amazing,ASTRONEER
2017-01-30,0,0,5,True,Recommended,This game is astonishgly beautiful. Even if the style is somewhat simple and cartoony The colors of the various planets look outright gorgeous at times. It's a nice game for when you just wanna calm down chill and relax. Just exploring the great big world. Finding crashed ships exploring caves upgrading your base. Of course there were some bugs here and there (Me and my brother were playing Both of us got hit by one of the rocks in a storm and died on my screen But we was still alive. We were crawling jumping building corpses for the entire playsession) but still pretty fun. 10/10,ASTRONEER

2017-02-08,0,0,41,True,Recommended,Okay so I only have 3 hours in this so far but it's a ton of fun. Took me a little while to figure out what I was doing but once I did its great. Really hope this won't be one of the early access games I end up regretting because it has a lot of potential.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-09,0,0,39,True,Recommended,A fun space exploration game with a simple yet appealing artistic style. A bit of a lack of content at the moment and not very well optimised (my fps never rose above 50 on a gtx970 and would fall to about 20 after a few hours). but that's to be expected from a pre alpha early access game. It's pretty fun for a few hours right now but once complete this game will be a real gem.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-09,0,0,16,True,Recommended,I think it is already lots of fun! Hope they will add more content so you can keep exploring! The game is still pre alpha so I can only imagine what it will be like when its done.I recommend it in its current stage!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,126,True,Recommended,Great game fun to play.This isn't a full sizes game with 60 GB of files but a rather small pre alpha but still a fun game which keeps at least me interested for quite some time.Hope there will be a lot more content coming to the game but a huge recommendation to all those who like to collect resources and get down to build great stuff out of nothing!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,49,True,Recommended,This game is in pre alpha bur it is worth any single dollar. It deserves because its simplicity but from the other hand there are advanced features. I really would like to see how this game will look like in the future so I reccomend it and I encourage everyone to show intrest and support devs. They deserve.Game score for me 78/100 (can't be higher cause it is pre alpha),ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Game is love. Needs way more content but I highly recommend it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,12,True,Recommended,A nice creative game. Allows you to build a base and explore in all directions. Has some performance issues but it's in early access so I'll let that pass.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,24,True,Recommended,One of the best games I played so far.It's in Pre Alpha so it has lots of bugs and performance issues which I hope getting fixed in the next patches.Some bugs are funny like sliding arroung like the Silversurfer but some are really annoying like glitching in the ground and disappearing vehicles.The Game gets updated a lot and has a nice forum were you can send in crashes and bugs.I'd recommend this game to everyone who likes this exploring researching farming and crafting stuff.I'd say it's a perfect mix of Minecraft Space Engineers and No Man's Sky.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,32,True,Recommended,i would write a longer review but im too busy playing astroneer,ASTRONEER
2017-01-22,0,0,0,True,Recommended,its a fun game but i really wanna sell it back,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,7,True,Recommended,bretty gud for an alpha. space and other planets actually feel big and scary. wish there was more endgame content but i'm sure it'll happen. very pretty terrain manipulation feels good.sometimes your resources get eaten by various devices especially in multiplayer so be warned.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,25,True,Recommended,I just think you need to add an option where you are able to name each world in game so you don't accidentaly pick the wrong one...a frequent problem for me and my friend LOL. NICE GAME!!!!!!!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-25,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Gotta say this game hits the right points its still a bit clunky here and there but so far I have had a good time with only a few performance issues in prolonged play.The multiplayer worked well with minimal issues only thing myself and my mate noticed was sometimes things would show differently between players such as missing items (fixed by picking up and replacing) invisible trade platform rockets (they would only show for the host) but besides that it was an good time would definitly recommend.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-25,0,0,5,True,Recommended,I don't play many games I just look for something to unwind with after crazy days at work. This game hits all the marks relaxing atmosphere simple yet complex enough not to be boring tons to do and see. Once you make it and figure things out it can be very fun. Really enjoy what we have so far and looking forward to what comes.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,11,True,Recommended,awesome game considering how early in development,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,63,True,Recommended,Looking forward to seeing the crafting/recipe finding being expanded. Ive enjoyed three different playthroughs currently working on establishing complete bases on each planet. Whats it like playing? Id say a simple minecraft in space with easier mining and no creapers. I like the gravity difference on each planet.. well the moon especially. Fun doing stunts and flips over craters!I havent looked at the forums but I am interested in the story behind the game. With all the crashed pods and other space debris on each planet. What disaster happened? Will we find data recorders that provide pieces of this puzzle in future patches? The crashed pods are rather large for such small cargo they contain or at least with whats found in them.Id like to be able to patch into some of the large damaged solar panels that still power up as do the cashed pods. Its a short game to play before you have exhausted base building. Then the other planets are barren/tundra/exotic/radiated. Each has an different variations of the basic resources. There are questionable items though. Like why all the cave lifeforms are on each planet or underground. I really liked the yellow bones below ground. Made me wonder if one was alive somewhere.....Great game for all ages. I will be looking forward to its development.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,66,True,Recommended,I see a bright future for this game is curently very good but needs improvement it has been a lot of fun to play and this game hascs lot going for it so don't mess up and continue the good work,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,0,True,Recommended,"fun but still needs quite a lot of work i fell trough the floor and died twice durring my first half an hour and couldnt find more than one patch of a ""common"" resorce in the first hour despite finding both more rare resorces and a ton of a diffrent common resorce. i will be checking in with this game for every update as it was still enjoyable but if i just fall through the floor and loose everything with me it's too anoying to play in its current state.",ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Very fun great looking game. needs more content that will be here with time but i love it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,9,True,Recommended,The game is amazing dor being in pre alpha seriously. But there is one thing that is bugging me and it is that sometimes I have to get a friend to put things in my backpack when they are on the ground.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-12,0,0,22,True,Recommended,This game is AMAZING but if you could make it so i could i could chang the graphic because i dont have the greatest computer you know maybe turn down the light quality make an option where the wind doesent blow the grass aroundmaybe make the particles less powerfull but other wise THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Very promising sandbox game had some glitches on the first launch but haven't had any problems for a long time,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Awesome sandbox game. The first one I really like after Minecrft. Even Space Engi didnt make me so happy like this one.Even if it's still very simple I mean it's very few things you can build and do in the game still it have very lite future if devs will not stop to develop it.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-12,0,0,62,True,Recommended,If you want a beautiful mesmerizing relaxing space simulator this is the game for you.You create your own sense of meaning and your own adventures while working withinthe framework of Astroneer's reality in terms of physics survival and crafting. It's handsdown one of the best games I've ever played and it is isn't even in alpha yet. If you'veever dreamt about exploring new worlds download this right away.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Astroneer is an open world masterpeice,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I love this game so far. What they have done is great but... its also in pre alpha so there is alot of bugs. plus the game doesnt have alot content with it. but i really hope they keep updating and making the game better,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Love But Performance.I absolutely love this game and everything that revolves around it including community and their plans for what is to come. The performance however is below par. It is a little dissapointing at how laggy and slow it runs but that is expected from an early access I can't wait till this issue is fixed because I know it has attention. I would also like also love for it to be on PS4 and I am sure all of my other playstation peeps would agree. Even if that doesn't happen this is still a great game thanks to everyone. &lt 3,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Amazing game very hopefull for this one. Looking forward to more content. That's not to say this game is lacking as it is clearly the developers have done an excellent job at laying the groundwork for what could be the new Minecraft of the decade.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Such a wonderful game! The graphics the exploration and also the whole aerospace industrial aspect of this game are just flawless! But there was one flaw with the game The unstable fps lag. There will be times where youll be playing smoothly for a couple second then all of a sudden a lag spike hits you. I thought I was the only one with the problem but I did some research about the problem and turns out there's a significant amount of players with the problem. Other than that its a beautiful game!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Really good game. VERY buggy though and awful framerate. I have no doubt it will get fixed I believe in this game. Wholeheartedly recommend it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,5,True,Recommended,I think this game has a lot of potential however it has a long way to go. To start off with the progression is way to fast. I played for 2 and a half hours and i had already made a rocket ship. In order to give the game a lasting playtime it needs to be slowed. This could be achieved by Increasing backpack space and increasing the amount of materials for recipes. Also when i tried playing with a friend it was so buggy almost to the point of being unplayable. Sometimes we would die for no reason. And when respawning we would get stuck in the ground and die more from suffocation. Losing all of your items and potentially your rover/truck is a real pain in the However i loved this game in the short time i played it alone. It was aww inspiring and fun. I would recommend it if you had the extra cash but waiting for now might be the right move.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,68,True,Recommended,I recommend this game to enyvone who's loocking for adventure exploration and building. its a fun game and i think that the opportunity to delete saves could been great. I have too meany saves.A better tutorial would also been a good thing to add. It took some time to get around the game/finding out how to play.But plz dont make it too long. If you do make it too long it will get boring. ),ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Beautiful game! You can easily get lost in the music and scenery. It does a great job in teaching you how the world works without actually telling you. Within an hour you'll be on your way to creating a new home. My only downside is I have gotten to a point that the game lags pretty badly due to how many tethers I have dropped at least that's what I think caused it. Unfortunate indeed. I'll wait for some support patches before continuing my journey.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,18,True,Recommended,So far I've loved this game. It's still early release so the bugs and stuff I've been running into such as game crashing with 4 players or game crashing with the tethering of rovers I've been able to look past. This game benefits a lot from having multiple players however having 2 3 more people causes a lot more bugs to rear their ugly heads. Which is a shame because this game is amazing with multiple people. It's okay when playing single player but the game gets monotonous without small bits of emergent gameplay.Either way would reccomend.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,11,True,Recommended,This game is for sure still in Early Acess form. It's a lot of fun overall but it crashed twice on me so far. First time it slowed my entire system to a crawl and all my OBS settings went with it (streamers beware) and second time I just called it quits.I am going to follow and support this game but the numerous issues from frame drops glitches in and out of the world and optimization all need to be addressed in the long run. If you are not a fan of testing games just wait till full build. Otherwise this game is well worth it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,8,True,Recommended,The thing about Astroneer is it doesnt feel like a game. It has a lot of ways to go to keep the momentum it has now but i belive that it will be able to keep it up. the game needs more survival aspects and 100% needs more aspects of pve and combat cause as it stands right now all u need is compound and u can surivive for aslong as u want death doesnt really matter so really it will get boring at one point new planets is a great idea to keep the game new and fresh but as of right now the only thing that changes is some times gravity and the color of the planet. id love to see this game grow considering its already a well worth purchase but it needs a lot more content to keep us all playing. my main point is to add more survival apect maybe hunger thirst? this could allow a lot of content to be added just off those ideas. building needs a huge upgrade u need to make me want to stay at my planet as the game is now u can build a full size base in about 20 min if u rush we need a actual building system foundations walls windows doors all that. and finally combat/pve the game litteraly has no difficulty other than the gas and u can just take a few steps back and wait for it to go away and continue with what you were doing. add mobs add alliens add weapons combat even with other players if they enable it? this can create so many things to keep us playing. This whole thing probably doesnt sound too convinving but i promise u even as it stands right now its well worth 20$ but to keep us hooked itll need a lil work. but its a great game even greater with friends. Its a nice breathe of fresh air seeing such a simple concept taken so well and i cant wait to see this game grow!,ASTRONEER
2017-01-09,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Overall good alpha. I refunded it for now because it doesnt have many features on it for the moment. The alpha has came out for almost a month so its no surprise it doesnt have many features. Just buy the alpha in a few months.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-05,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Even though this game is just early access it's better and more complete than many other games already released.Me and my buddy tried it out yesterday and was amazed at how much there is to do in this game even at this state there was like no end to it. Atleast for the 7 hours we spend playing it last night. We managed to build a spaceship and travel to a few other planets and we were mind blown.Astroneers is one of those games that I wish I was part of making. The artstyle animations interactions building etc everything's just perfect and fits right up my alley.I can't even imagine what the full game is going to be like when it releases.It's an instant classic for me already one of my favorite games.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-10,0,0,21,True,Recommended,ive seen many people play this game and i finaly got it but now i can not launch it becaus i have to install UE4 prerquisites to run it. i installed it and nothing happens and when i minisize it and try to lanch the game its propering to launch then it says error app is already running someone plz help me,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,52,True,Recommended,Early Access Very fun so far. Very plauable. Look forward to final release.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,0,True,Recommended,This game has a very unique concept and it very fun when played with multiple people. Personally I liked the concept and how simple and almost animated/ toyish the game feels. To some this might be a let down but to me it gave the game an upbeat and lively mood. However on the other hand i disliked how hard the game is to run and how small the inventory spaces are. As for the performance issues this could just come with time since the game is in pre alpha. The same goes for the inventory issues which is just an issue I had. Overall it is a very fun game and is a really good idea but do to my average computer and possibly the pre alpha issues i cannot play it. But if you have an above average computer and a group of friends to play with this is a must buy!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,11,True,Recommended,this game getting incredibly stucked today for no reason i just have a pretty low fps at every planet and at any place time to time. hope this will not happen tomorrow,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,21,True,Recommended,I know I only have 3 and a half hours on this game at the time of writing but I have to be honest here... this game is absolutely amazing! It's not trying to be something it's not it's not showing off content that you can't find in the game and it's not trying to be anything more than what has been shown or released so far.You're on a planet with some sort of machine that can harvest and terraform the planet as you see fit. You use the resources you find to initially build your settlement then you start using those buildings to branch out and find other resources and explore more of the planet whether it's underneath or on solid ground. But it does it in a way that's fun and enjoyable and exploration is gradual you can't explore freely immediately due to your limited amount of oxygen so you have to build and you have to progress slowly in a natural feeling way. At the end of the day I can say this game is amazing! And half the price of No Man's Sky I think I know what I'd rather play.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-13,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Highly reccomend this game! This is what No mans sky should of been. I agree you need a semi decent PC to run this game but this game has alot of potential as soon as the textures are updated little graphics settings are added and they add some more features are added this game would beat no mans sky any day. Im just going ignore the crashes its in early access what do you expect?,ASTRONEER

Recommended,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,7,True,Recommended,best game ever liked it. Its a very good game espacialy for a game in pre alpha looking forwards to updates. It also reminds me of subnautica but mostly on land. for a suggestion they should add in entity for a future update and maybe weapons or something close to a weapon to kill hostile creatures but that would ruin the game style but thats all up to the devs. in conclusion great game.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-15,0,0,118,True,Recommended,5/10 for solo playI would like to rate it higher the reason I don't isbecause it is prone to isssues which I hope can be resolved soon you get stuck (either in vehicles or falling through the floor) glitching vehicles that bounce around everywhere when you try interacting with them frame rate issues and the game crashes around sandstorms in my experience 4/10 for multi player since you have no way to keep your space pack contents if you leave then re enter or reload the game it counts as you dying the same issues as solo and the fact only the host sees whatever gets researched.overall 9/20 but it is early access so there is still a few bugs there to work out if they fixed the sandstorm crashes and getting stuck issues I would easily give it 15/20 and each mode would jump up by 3 rating. For me the early access is what makes me say possibily for reccommending the game instead of saying flat out no which I would if a game passed early access this buggy,ASTRONEER

2017-01-15,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Good game for exploring space. This game should have tutorial there is a conrols section but it is all tutorial there is. My first expirience went on wandering around and dying.It is pretty fun game when you get the hang of things and start understanding where every material is and stuff like that. If exploring space and planets does not intrest you then this game is not for you. It has open world and there is plenty of stuff to do and make. I personally like this game but there is also things that i didn't like. things i liked the game lets you figure out things yourself. there is many things to do make and find. Multiplayer (I haven't tried it myself yet but i have heard it works pretty well)things i didn't like There is not tips or tutorial Many bugs limited players in multiplayer,ASTRONEER

2017-01-16,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Everything in this game is done well. Only problem is that you make everything that can be done on base every vehicle (and it can be done in 5 hours played and no....I am not rushing progress...i was lost on my planet for 3 hours just exploring it) you travel to another planet and only drive to keep you going is to make another base with same equipment same vehicles and travel further...in other words it's missing content or drive to keep you playing and im praying that dev woun't f*ck it up. make more content remove multiplayer glitches optimize game (add graphic options) and it will be my favourite game (so far its portal 2 and it's 2011 so pretty please),ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Very aesthetically pleasing and well made for a pre alpha game although I have begun to experience frame issues at the latter end of the game when I have a large base built up and have to render it all. Subnautica in space or what no man's sky should really have been. Very easy multiplayer system and very fun to play although the lack of content right now has me stumped for things to do.

2017-01-15,0,0,58,True,Recommended,This game is amazing even in early access. As simplistic as it is and even with few things to build and do its still so much fun especially with friends. This game is beautiful. Everything isnt super detailed or have any fancy lense flairs but the simplistic art style is just perfect. One of my favorite things about this game so far is that you can build terrain or even smooth it! Not everything is taking the land away to reach where you want you can make a bridge from one mountain to another or smooth the land near your base the possibilities are endless. So seriously for $20 even in early access this is a game is worth it.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-27,0,0,24,True,Recommended,"I recommend it with the assumption that you understand you are supporting a game in progress. Astroneer is a third person exploration game with building elements survival elements (oxygen health and power) vehicles and modular ""snapping"". There are no goals at the moment but progression comes in the form of crafting and research by gathering materials.As of the end of December 2016 there is very little actual content and exploration seems limited to caves with a single dangerous element. The price is near exorbitant for what there is however it is currently in alpha and the ground principles of the game seem solid especially the UI and item/terrain manipulation is stellar.Do not expect more than a few hours of gameplay at the moment which will mostly be rooted in dragging items around and manipulating terrain.",ASTRONEER

2017-01-16,0,0,16,True,Recommended,From only playing a short time I already get a sense of peace and joy from this game. It's unique artstyle combined with the soundtrack and fun crafting system give it an incredibly different feel from similar games. It's a feel good game scratching that itch that you can't quite place but know is there. Try it out support and grow with it.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,3,True,Recommended,This is the best game of 2017 thus far and probably 2016. It is the space crafter that delievers fun. All the others try to do way too much while this game is really minecraft like simplicity with a much better theme and losing the voxels. The feel of this game is very zen. It generates a peaceful solitude that is almost medative. The game is honeslty what I would call near perfect. If there were any things that I would like to see improve it would be the ability to create flat planes somehow. I think that when you are mining or trying to clear room for rovers it gets frustrating that you are unable to make a smooth flat plane. This would also be useful in creating bridges. I feel this is something that will need to be visited as this game grows and cooperatively people want to develop large perhaps even server side based coop games where great works are the goal. But for now that certainly does not spoil anything. I will say this I am biased a little as Jacob Leichty (Sorry if I spelt that wrong) came to my house and played with my little brother at times. But I really don't think that has impacted my opinion much. I would live this game regardless.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,53,True,Recommended,Simply put For a game that is not even in Alpha yet it is insanely addictive and fun! The future potential of this game is dare I say ASTRONOMICAL!Yes there are bugs. Some are frustrating some are hilarious and some are both of those. Multiplayer while somewhat unstable is very much enjoyable.If you have the patience to stick it out through the developement process I highly recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-16,0,0,20,True,Recommended,(Version 0.2.117.0 at time of writing)Wow. This game has immense potential and such an amazing sense of atmosphere and immersion. I was scared to venture far out of my initial starting area out of the fear for what could be out there. While I love the idea of the whole inventory and machine interaction system as it doesn't break immersion like a UI(user interface) would it needs a little refinement. The researching and adventuring mechanics are very captivating even at its limited pre alpha state. With further update and additions to the game it can easily be a 10/10 for its respective gameplay.So in its current state this game is a 7.5/10 if it would be released right now. I recommend you pick it up and watch the updates role in.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-02,0,0,34,True,Recommended,What I like about this game The colour scheme is as vivid and beautiful as anything I have encountered in the last twenty years The soundtrack is soothing and at times quite enchanting fast becoming as memorable as such greats as Civ 2 and TW Rome The interface works well wonderfully well in places. Especially the sound and animation linked to the management and movement of inventory items. This is as good as it gets. The simple and pleasing design of items resources and machinery and associated sounds increases the sense of worth attached to objects in the game. The game is quickly accessible although it needs further levels of complexity after the first 5 10 hours of gameplay The tethering system. It lends gravity to the art of survival especially in the early stages of the game. The weather especially the storms which are reminiscent of The Martian. Things that I would like to see in the game's future development Fewer storms with some small degree of damage to infrastructure requiring maintenance or the research and installation of protection. Perhaps some researchable weather forecasting system which would allow for the deployment of protective measures. The researchable ability to create flat surfaces for more advanced base building. This might be in the form of a dozer blade or roadlaying machinery. It seems strange that we have the ability to raise and lower terrain but not form a permanent flat surface. Perhaps it is possible to build prefabricated interlocking base sections which would allow structures and storage to be placed in a much more organised manner later on. The current system works very well in the early stages but later on the ability to create coherent bases on a larger scale is all but impossible. The researchable ability to build roads. Again this would be an advanced research item and come with suitable reource costs. Inspection and exploration drones that would allow some limited aerial reconnaissance require retrieval and repair if caught in a storm. Conclusion /h Brilliant game. Immensely playable and engaging for an EA offering with huge development potential. The devs are building a game of exceptional quality with enormous possibilites. Tremendous value for money. This game has been a soothing balm to the devasting wounds left by No Man's (Pie in the) Sky! 0),ASTRONEER

From the moment you start expanding your base your framerate drops.Great game! 8.7/10,ASTRONEER
2016-12-27,0,0,86,True,Recommended,"WOW! What a refreshingly fun game. So simple and easy to pick up It reminds me of Minecraft when it was in early beta. Not a ton of end game content but soooo much potential.*WARNING* You as buying a Early Access game and it has its issues! Horrid frame rate in current build with memory leaks like crazy. (easily fixed with further dev optimization so don't worry). Crazy multiplayer bugs vehicles and items falling through the map people joining host can't interact with some stations correctly. (MP was just launched and im sure will have its own set of bug fixes). Not a ton to do at end game and no real ""enemies"" or aliens/creatures. Just some dangerous plant life.Those are my main issues with the game as it currently stands. Which Im sure the devs will address given time. If you NEED to have a perfect bug free game wait for a later build. However as is I consider it playable and very enjoyable.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-26,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a fantastic game even in Pre Alpha. The low poly graphics are charming the gameplay is simple but satisfying and the music is beautiful. Keep in mind that the game undoubtedly has its fair share of bugs and performance issues aswell as a shortage of content but such is to be expected in a game this early in development. Nonetheless definitely worth $20.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,29,True,Recommended,I just bought this game last night Dec. 26th in pre Alpha V 0.2. and started playing it more today Dec. 27th. I have only played it in single player and have clocked in almost 4 hrs. worth of game play.So far the survival and exploration elements work well together. With only having to worry about oxygen and power to live is super helpful in being able to do what you want most. Being able to wonder aimlessly and discover wreckages find resources or materials is already a fun time. In addition to keeping and eye on thoes two meters there seems to be a slight weather element. On the planet I spawned on there was a wind component which varies from a slight breeze to an intense dust storm that rolls by. Never knowing when the next storm comes and what the storm may bring in helps add additional boost of adredaline and tension in hoping none of your equipment or yourself blow away. There is already a bunch of machinery you can craft and resources to collect so this game has lots of content for you to enjoy. Among the machines there seems to be a shuttle you can build to explore the other planets that orbit yours in the sky. Although I have not yet gotten there it seems to be available. Also I have built a little rover which is fun to drive around and is super easy to maneuver.As far as criticisms go the game isn't optimized yet. So my decent laptop has a low frame rate. And occasionally there would be a resource in the planet's ground that there would be a portion you can not pick up. Not sure if it is picked up and the game is having a glitch or that part is just never collected. Also while driving around the way you steer is where you look. So trying to take in the scenery around you becomes a little more trickey without stopping the car. Lastly with the driving the vehicle seems to slide around a lot when I'm trying to stop but there is also a possibility that it's just my planet.BUT since this game is in the EARLY pre alpha stages thoes kinds of things were expected and I'm sure will be fixed by the time the game fully launches. My final thoughts is that none of the game's early problems effect it on a large scale. The resources are plentiful the art is beautiful and is loads of fun!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,3,True,Recommended,this game is very fun so far however I keep running into a bug where my stuff doesnt save from login to login (and before you all haggle me yes I know its very early access) I just thought id bring to attention. Other than that this game is amazing and has even more amazing potential. Will update this if anything new comes up but until then thank you and keep up the amazing work!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,46,True,Recommended,For a Pre alpha game its pretty dawm good. I thought this would be a game I regret buying I even selected not Interested in a queue . Then I saw some Youtubers playing it and discided to give it a try. It seemed to draw me in when I started playing and I found my self blindly figureing out the features and gathering resources as if I knew what to do .I would recomend you go into this game blind so you can learn everything on your own. Its better that way in my point of veiw. For the amount of content curretly in the game I feel it was fairly priced at 25 dollars in the future if they keep up the great work they have done it has the potenial to be worth more.Things I think would be good additions Some kind of oxygen production (maybe) Harder difficultys More Planets (with their own evirometal dangers (They have done a great job with the planets already implimented) More progression (love what they have done I want more ) a way to give a personal taste to the game (possibly a good idea but it could be a bad one if done wrong)Overall Right now its earned an 8/10 Its been a while since a games pulled me in like this one does I love it Keep up the great work. Would recommend!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,6,True,Recommended,This game was just beautiful looking on all the planets. (Even the gross radiation one) Content wise there was alot for a EAC game and me and my friend played it for 5 hours getting everything and building and exploring each planet. Besides some visual bugs and a base expander platform mishap this game was just execellent. I really hope content keeps on coming for this game and I will for sure come back to it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,307,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Amazing. The best praise I can give is that this might finally replace minecraft for me ( eventually ) it's early ( I'm writing this a little over a week after intital EA release ) it's still reasonably buggy. Though no game breakers yet and the devs have already released several patches for crashes and performance. I still expect there'll be at least one save breaking update coming and probably several. But that's early access take it or leave it... There's so much potential and a solid base already in place (litterally and figuratively) I've played 18 hrs so far... it's going places fast.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-26,0,0,21,True,Recommended,All in all a very excellent pre alpha. There are of course minor glitches and even a couple of major issues but as previously stated they are there because this is a PRE alpha and haven't been ironed out yet. Currently I'm in what can be considered the late game of the current version (0.2.111.0). I have unlocked all of the research that is currently available and visited all five of the available planets including setting up bases on three of them. I can't express my joy in words of visiting an Arid planet for the first time and finding about it's peculiar hazards. If you've visited one you know exactly what I mean and if not seriously take a stop over on one sometime it's a thing of beauty. Each of the planets has a unique feel to it from the Terran planet's earth like enviroment to the exotic planet's strange over domes. Even the barren planet/moon is wonderful with it's massive craters. Unfortunately there just isn't enough research to last more than a few hours if you are collecting research nodes on a semi regular basis. After you research all of them the research nodes just begin handing out resources with the occasional bug(?) of giving an unknown research. Again this will more than likely be fixed later as they add more to the game. My hope is that they allow you eventually unlock a larger space ship to travel to even more interesting planets.This is a game to watch and in my honest opinion well worth the money even in it's current state.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-17,0,0,1,True,Recommended,I started playing this and it wants to draw you in and does after you figure out what the heck your doing lol. At some point you will soon learn there is no file mangment for deleting your game to do a reboot which needs to be a done asap and yes its an early out but it really is a must do becaues rooting around in the pc to find a file to delete blows. I really hope to see more soon in ways of fixing this issue and for now its still a just paly around with it game good luck teather on.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-17,0,0,43,True,Recommended,This game is great especially for being in its Pre Alpha stage! The graphics are great but you don't have to have a beast computer to run the game well. There is so much to explore and building offers creativity to run wild. The only con is there isn't really much to do after you build everything there is to build. I'm sure MUCH more will be added to the game however so I don't think this will be a problem for long. I definitely recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-17,0,0,14,True,Recommended,This a solid start to a developing game. It shows real promise to the future. If you enjoy exploration games this is definately a pick up.My only complaint is there is a little lack of content and no real drive once all the blueprints are unlocked.Other than that it is a brilliant start with STUNNING graphics colours and music.Buy this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-17,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Haven't played much so far but this all seems pretty great. Nice organization of materials world generation craftables etc. One issue? The camera. I ( and I assume others if I'm alone on this I'll shut up) get nearly sick just trying to turn around. Perhaps I think the fix could be an option for 1st person? If 1st person is out of the question then could something please be done about the camera turn mechanic? Please and thank you have a rock and roll day.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-07,0,0,41,True,Recommended,While still in Alpha the concept and a lot of game is there. Yes you can research and acquire everything relativley quickly (6 10 hours) the fun is the exploration aspect. You start out on a Terran planet. Basic materials are on the surface which is relativley flat and hostile free. Go into caves for more advanced resource and native research items. There are some hostile plants in caves that can kill you but that is about it. The terran planet is fun and the base building while very basic is fun. The magic came in when I went to another planet. I realized that going to another planet doesnt mean leaving your home planet behind. In fact its the opposite. You go to other planets and farm more resources. For example Arid planets have copper and aluminum on their surface unlike Terran which are in caves. Build a mining base and bring some of that sweet ore or refined metal back to your home planet. The game is loads of fun even better with friends. So excited to see what the devs do with this game. Already it has soooooo much promise. If you like Minecraft or wished No Man's Sky was what it actually advertized itself as get this game you will not be disappointed. 10/10 would get killed by random tumble weeds or super storms again.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,34,True,Recommended,First things first this game is very good despite it being in early access. Most of the bugs I've encountered had to do with multiplayer and that's sort of expected so I can excuse that. However most of those problems were solved simply by starting a new world with friends seperate from my singleplayer one (so they turned out to be no big deal anyway).The first ten minutes of the game you're thrown in to a world that somewhat resembles Earth (not really but it does the most out of any of the planets). The first thing you're gonna want to do is get some compound to make some tethers so you can explore more of the planet rather than being constrained to the area nearest your habitat. After that the choice is yours and there are many choices you can make ranging from finding resources to scan to collect things like blueprints (unlocks for crafting) to creating vehicles that can take you to other worlds. The other worlds are nothing like the home planet one being arid and dry another being snowwy and icy one being exotic with odd plants and such you get the point there's a lot to explore and a lot to do in this game. Definitely recommended.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-08,0,0,8,True,Recommended,This is what No Man's sky should have been. It's still an alpha though i rounded most basic content with 4 5 hours playtime but the mechanics are solid! Good value for money imo. I usually pay the same or more for a trip to the cinema. Did not find any list of features that are to come though would like to see a list so that i know when to check it out again when it has matured.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-22,0,0,32,True,Recommended,This is a really good game Especially in early access. Lots of bugs turn out to be funny like when I was riding my rover and hit a boulder the rover flew up into space then when we left the planet the rover was orbiting it XD,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,29,True,Recommended,I've played a good amount with my friends and we all love the silly yet sometimes challenging atmosphere. I would say at the current stage of the game it's not quite worth 20 dollars. The only reason the price can be justified is that the devs are pushing out more patches and content quickly. So if you don't want to wait for more content then I would suggest waiting for a sale or for the game to leave early access.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,11,True,Recommended,This game is so much fun it has so much to offer for a new released game. It may not have a lot of content but please guys it came just recently came out so don't complain about lack of content just enjoy the game try new things.Very fun with friends not sure on how many people can join the games but I do hope i can get all my friend on this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,13,True,Recommended,When you look at other games in it's genre Astroneer struggles to deliver enough content for it's $20 price tag. There are a handful of $20 early access survival games out there that offer far more content Rust for instance. That being said the game is pretty fun when playing with other people. We were able to get about 14 hours of gameplay in a co op session knowing nothing about the games mechanics. However it's pretty easy to figure everything out. Base building is quite simplistic and requires very few resources to build. Finding the resources is where it might take a while depending on your location. There's really nothing you need to worry about in a survival sense either except for oxygen. Oxygen does not deplete as long as you are tehterd to a oxygen line. These lines can be made easily which basically negates this factor in your survival. On a whole Astroneer isn't much of a survival game. You don't need to find food you don't need to build a shelter and theres maybe 1 2 hostile plant things that will injure you if you get close. Falling off from cliffs also will injure you. When you talk survival you're thinking I need to manage food water find shelter sustainment fend off predators well theres no food no water no shelter unless you make yourself one for asthetic purposes and no predatory creatures that will hunt you. The fun right now in the game comes from the exploration and for maybe 1 2 hours the researching mechanics. Researching artifacts is how you are able to build space ships and rovers etc. There aren't many things to research right now so this facet of the game quickly becomes obsolete. Exploring the randomly generated worlds is pretty cool though. I just wish there was more to the game. The good thing is it looks promising it's early access so theres more to come. The gameplay is smooth and has appealing visuals. The art style is neat too. I'll still recommend this game if you have the $20 to blow on 14 15 hrs.,ASTRONEER
2017-04-06,0,0,32,True,Recommended,Great game.Very addicting at the start but starts to get slower 6 hours later.This game goes from fast to not to fast but i recommend this game and it is way worth 20 dollars hope the game grows more and i have one problem with this game and it is that my first/best world doesnt work anymore when i try to login the game crashes and tells me to report bug and stuff so i hope that gets fixs so great game,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,3,True,Recommended,I descend through the clouds of this strange new world that my astronaut has discovered. We touch down gently and I step out of my pod and take a look around. There s many strange looking plants scattered around and some crystals protruding from the ground. I start walking around unsure what my purpose is and where I should be going. A wind storm hits and I m dead. I respawn and begin my journey into the unknown again. My oxygen runs low and I die. Survival then is one of the aims in Astroneer because there are many ways in which this game will try to kill you.Astroneer is a space exploration/survival sandbox adventure game which is being developed by System Era Softworks based in Seattle Washington. There is no story line and instead the player must mine resources in order to expand his/her colony by creating structures with the mined resources. The team working on Astroneers come from a background which involves work on games like Halo Assassin s Creed Team Fortress the Sims amongst many others so they know what they are doing something that becomes plain to see when you look at your watch 5 minutes after starting the game and realise an hour has passed.So you start out by selecting your Astronaut who then detaches their pod from the orbiting station type structure. You head down into the atmosphere of the nearby planet admiring the beautiful looking clouds as you descend. You touch down and examine your immediate surroundings. You have nothing but your trusty suit and a mining tool that can deform the very ground you walk on and mine resources.As you venture further out you ll soon discover what resources are used for and how you can take advantage of their applications. You can extend your pod to include all sorts of useful applications from Printers to vehicle bays and machines that will research strange things you have discovered. I had no idea what I was doing to start with but I started to figure things out and I loved how things naturally start to make sense. Once you figure one piece of the puzzle the other pieces start to drop into place it s a very satisfying experience and leaves you wanting more and more.The control schemes are simple yet effective and do pretty much all you could want them to. it s the polygon game world though that impresses. It s simple yet looks gorgeous and all you want to do is explore. You can sculpt the world around you and even deform the ground right down to the planets core.So what features do you get in this early access version of Astroneer? Well the developers have a hand list on their website so lets take a look.Explore multitudes of procedural worlds.Shape completely malleable terrain. Dig to the centre of the earth or forge mountains.Craft vehicles and discover resources to reach ever further in the galaxy.Survive in ever more harsh and rewarding environments.Play with friends in online or local multiplayer.Astroneer is expected to be in early access for a year or two but it s certainly something that you should be keeping tabs on because this game has all the hall marks of a classic in the making. I can t wait to see what the developers have in store for the games future. So far they have done an astounding job this is how early access games should be and what space exploration done right looks like. This game is satisfying and beautiful to play.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Fun game I have only played for a short amount of time but can see great potential in it. Far more potential than that of other Early Access games of which I have played.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-24,0,0,13,True,Recommended,"Hey! It's a working no nonsense no hand holding cute ish procedurally generated universe space simulator game .. thing.Like No Man's .. yeah. THAT game. Unlike THAT game this is a) Fun.b) Actually delivering what they promisedc) Still very early access and still cool!d) Co op!I am so very very afraid of playing this too much and getting bored before more stuff is added.Devs seem friendly down to earth and quite rare in this business not overly keen on overhyping their game.Buy now or buy later. Just buy this if you want to explore planets.Cons Limited replayability right now unless you're REALLY casual and likes digging for stuff to build your (rather simple) bases and do this repeatedly. A rudimentary assortment of materials and (inventable) gizmos are there but it's still a bit short on things to do for more than say 5 6 hours. All planets though different cosmetically are basically the same at this time of the development. I do have faith in the devs to actually deliver more interresting and fun things in the future. Pros Everything. It's according to the devs a ""pre alpha"" and still hours and hours more fun gameplay than That Other Game even thojugh they sort of promise the same gameplay and stuff. This is the best kind of Early Access and the best kind of devs.",ASTRONEER

2017-01-24,0,0,235,True,Recommended,I personally enjoy this game. Even for an early access game it is fantastic. At first I was confused. How do I play? What is this? What is that? Don't die Ouch that really hurt!!!! But as I went on I learned and adapted. I find the scenery is beautiful on the surface of every planet and all throughout each cave system. There is hours of fun but with any game it has its limitations so you can only build up to a certain research point. Fairly new game still has lots of potential. I plan on playing the crap out it! Co op anyone? lol,ASTRONEER
2017-01-24,0,0,13,True,Recommended,This is a great game so far and I only just started my three problems are after a bit the game becomes repetative because your just flying to planets which is fun for me and isn't a big problem to me but may be to lots of people also a load shrieking noise happens everytime I finnish gaining oxygen and it is so loud it says ringing in my ear for about 3 seconds after the horrible noise is gone. My final and biggest issue is the lag for my computer lag is something that happens only on really intense games so for this game to lag is suprising. Part of the reason I got this game was for the non harsh sort of Polygonal graphics and I know it's early access so I can't wait for future updates that will fix all of these problems!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-29,0,0,53,True,Recommended,Absolutely loving it so far. I feel like the objective/intention could be more of a presence in the game? I found myself for the first three hours simply venturing out far enough to get one item before needing to return to suffocate. I dont fully understand what I'm building or how to cycle through build options. Also a slide animation dominates your character if you go down acute angles which allows you to kind of ride it like a surf and move over alot more distance. I found that would cause me to shoot off into deep caverns way beyond my control. Again LOVING this game eager for the tweaks,ASTRONEER
2016-12-29,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Very fun game! But needs something more to do. It didnt take that much time to do ost of the stuff you can do.

2016-12-29,0,0,84,True,Recommended,With the state this game is in now it is by far the best space exploration game out there. Yes Man's Sky or Astroneer has a very good sense of progression that has you think about where to go or what you need and the learning that leaps you to know what is what feels great. It could be best described as minecraft in space but with better UI and things to do. Whether I have encountered a bug or not has not really destroyed my experience and I yet to find new things and this is REALLY good for its state of bugs in pre alpha. I will follow this game until it is not worked on anymore and really excited for new stuff!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-23,0,0,90,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a fantastic open world exploration building game. The developers are open about their plans listen to community feedback and suggestions but make sure that their primary vision of the game is not compromised.I found this game thoroughly enjoyable and challenging with its whimsical but awe inspiring colours and visuals and hazards.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I have enjoyed this game very much in the hour that I have played. I feel that there is potental for a lot of content in the future and the development team seems very dedicated to the game. Despite my positive response I do not recommend this game to players that want a perfectly working game when they buy one. The game currently for me is almost unplayable bacause of massive lag spikes frequent freezes that force me to hard stop through task manager and general low performance thst seems to get worse regardless of what graphics settings I choose (I have experimented with all of them.) I am going to stick with the game because i have hope it it but in its current state it is just about unplayable.***Update Since the patches that have been implemented in the week following the release of this Early Access game Astroneer has not crashed on me at all. There are still somewhat frequent lag spikes but that can be remidied by setting my view distance to its minimum which only effects the foliage rendering into my game. This game has brougnt me only joy since the patches and I highly reccomend it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,9,True,Recommended,i've only played three hours but am in love with the game so far. It has so much going for it with lots of room to grow.

Though there is enough fun to keep playing through alpha.Keep up the excellent work DEV.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,20,True,Recommended,This is a legitimately good game. Sure there are bugs sure there are glitches and sure you'll unintentionally get into often hilarious situations but play this with a friend or even alone and you'll be amazed at the surprising amount of depth that's already present. On top of an amazing soundtrack and visuals to match System Era seems to be on top of the updates game themselves (thus far since the game's early access release they've released an update every other day fixing tons of bugs) so rest assured you're buying and supporting an actively developed game. This is what No Man's Sky should have been.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This is an amazing game! Very addicting for the stage that it's in. Obviously it will need changes it's in Pre Alpha so don't be harsh. At this point of the game it would probably take 4 hours to explore the full extent of a planet. This is a blast with friends I love the non isolation. If I was a dev my ideas would be to 1.Add a health bar2.Add some creatures on one planet3.Add more planets4.Possibly make galaxies that need more advanced spaceships to get to5.Add more craftable gadgets for the suit (i.g. Jetpack)6.Put more resources on other planets besides the home planet7.Add voice chats8.Possibly adding NPCs that can sell you thingsAnd that's all for my suggestions. This game is the better version of No Man's Sky that doesnt require high RAM. If any devs see this the please take some of my suggestions into mind. If you're considering buying this game and you're reading this Buy this game now!!!!! Chubbs The Astronaut,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I've had a lot of fun playing this game. It isn't too difficult to get what you want but requires you to go on an adventure. Lots of interesting twists and turns. One time I was trying to get Malachite in a deep mine when a plant suddenly stabbed me in the back. I must have died 3 times to that one plant trying to get my stuff back again. It was an unexpected suprise but goes to show you that this game isnt all calm crafting and building. It can put you into tricky situations and make you revise your strategy. If you ever got stuck in a storm far away from home you will know this. This game has a lot of good parts but also some bad parts. I think you should be able to scrap items. I have at least 8 generators just laying around ever since I switched to solar and I could really use the compound. Maybe add a furnace or trash compactor. Also you should be able to delete certain parts of your base. Overall this game is very fun to play. If you like adventure space and industrialization I would definitely recommend it to you.Edit I think that a helpful addition to the game would be a sort of weed killer. Maybe a mod on the terrain shaper that kills plants like the spikers acid pots exploders etc. This could be useful for mining and would allow you to get rid of plants without making the path more difficult to travel. Also maybe an unstuck button.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,117,True,Recommended,I absolutly adore this game.I'm a space junkie and an exploration fanatic.I've enjoyed quite a few hours of fun in Astroneer not without a few crashes unfortunatly but that's on me for trying to run it on a potato based laptop that's below the spec minimum.Whooops.I'll take that hit.But that hasn't driven me away from this game. I can't wait to see the end product and even more importantly playing it.From what I've done so far It feels like I own all of this space and am free to core a planet if I feel like it. Or built a thousand bases. Or drive my rover into the sunset. Then forget to attach a power source that can persist through the night and end up stranded.I admit I've barely touched the surface (or caves) of the first planet alone but it's left me with a lot better feeling than most exploration type dealios.The colors are absolutly phenominal.The weird gas spewing plants are hilarious.This whole thing is a definite favorite and I'm hooked.Now if only I could force all my friends to play with me.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-30,0,0,30,True,Recommended,My husband found this game first. He said he wants to play this game with me and I said let's wait because I learned my lesson from NMS. I didn't want to purchase an early access game. It looked really good from the trailers but that's the exact same thing that happened to me with NMS I got tempted to buy NMS because of their stupidly beautiful trailer. But yeah things just happened you know. Somehow my husband couldn't contain his desire for the game and he bought it for both of us. We started playing at around 11pm and well what do you know? It's now 630am. Where the frick did the time go? It's just THAT awesome. I have to say this game is the perfect game for adventurous couples who do not want to leave the comfort of their home.The graphics are beautiful vivid colors awesome lighting. The gameplay is nice very easy to understand. I love how there's not much UI to deal with. I understand that the game is still in its early stages but I hope that someday the devs add living creatures in the planets as well. This game gave me good feelings.

2016-12-24,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Don't let the few bad reviews deter you. It is early access (pre alpha) and should be treated as such.For what it is now it is a great game. You should buy this game if your into space and planet exploration if your into gathering resources and crafting/researching new things and finally if you want to support the devolopers because as said before it is a pre alpha game. As soon as you launch it you get a message from the devs promising future updates and work. So all of this is something to keep in mind.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Product received for free. has probably one of the best interfaces in games right now.also doesn't bog itself down with complex materials for its crafting system.really promising game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,28,True,Recommended,With interesting visuals and simple yet expansive universe sandbox. Definitely can tell it is pre alpha and needs script improvements and more polish. worth watching this develop to beta before buying.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,53,True,Recommended,EDIT 24 12 16They fixed the usb audio lag issue that was game breaking It's a beautiful game really nice to just chill out and dig then fly to another planet and run out of fuel haha gg.Old review*Plays beautiful in the character select bit Even 60fps while departing the station Stutters a little bit while landing NOW here it comes Here it comes boy I'm ready for an adventure and have waited a long time for this moment Press tab to exit the pod..................... this is where the fun happens STUTTER and 1fps.There is a bug atm If your using usb headset you need to unplug and plug it back in the audio buggs the game out atm Playing it at constant 60fps but without sound It's pretty epic I have to say*,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,22,True,Recommended,I am super surprised with this game and how well done and over all polished for an early access game! to me it feels like a full release! only came across one bug so far and the rest has been so smooth! the amount of content is amazing! best buy iv made in awhile thats for sure! get this game before it goes up to $60 because i think this game is worth way more then what its selling for and thats saying something! GREAT GAME! keep up the good work!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,28,True,Recommended,amazing but somewhat buggy,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Pre Alpha at time of writing.I love this game and am very excited for it's potential. The pre alpha is a phenomenal display of colors and creativity.For reference I imagine this game as a bit of a mashup between Minecraft and No Man's Sky but with a unique flair of its own. Armed with a backpack that can be upgraded to hold more oxygen or draw power from the sun you go about setting off on your own adventure. At the moment it feels very sandbox and open with not much of a linear storyline. However this only leads to the excitement of finding a crashed satellite researching mysterious objects and seeking shelter from lethal storms as you build a base of operations and eventually go explore the moon you've seen in the horizon.All in all at it's pre alpha stage I love it. Sure I fall through the ground every now and then when I get a bit overzealous with crafting my own mountains or digging massive caverns but I happily take it with all the good that comes from the game.Good buy good fun.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-24,0,0,79,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Got this as a gift and could easily say I would have glady payed full price for this (even in its current state). Runs beautifully for early access with most of the bugs being minor.Very relaxing exploration and neat crafting ideas. Space travel is seamless and really cool. Co op works mostly well.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Not very far in only a few hours at this point but I can give it a thumbs up. At the $20 price point even in early access this game is VERY worth it. It's fun engaging and chock full of exploring opportunities. Learning the mechanics of the game is a big part of the fun so I expect the game to drop off soon for me but adding friends in will probably help that!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,2,True,Recommended,"Bought this game and played for about 2 hours non stop and was having a blast exploring and trying things out. Building a base then gathering resources to build vehicles including a ""shuttle""(looks like the moon lander) was a lot of fun. I could see how for some the game could get boring kinda fast but I don't mind sandbox games. One touch that I enjoy is that there is no HUD everything is represented on your character. There is a blue tank on top of your backpack that is your oxygen and yellow pips running up the center of the pack represent your energy. People will compare this to No Man's Sky but I think it is more of a ""Minecraft in Space"" since there is a lot of focus on building(albeit you can't build a house of your design you control the layout of your base).Overall I do recommend this game as it is one of the smoothest best looking games with Early Access.

2017-01-01,0,0,50,True,Recommended,One word Speechless. I saw this game been play by Kubz Scouts A youtuber I like to watch. As he play I begin to be interested in the mechanics the game has to offer. At most the adventure where you should collect minerals to crated items you'll need. Not to forget the Soundtrack in the background while you play Amazing. If you like adventure and have patience to explore the depths and journey the game it has to offer you'll love it too.

2017-05-30,0,0,798,True,Recommended,A lot of fun. Exploration survival a mostly non violent game. I'm amazed it plays as well as it does for being pre alpha. If you want enemies to shoot at or shoot at you this is not your game. The three biggest problems are the windstorms dangerous plants and running out of resources (like oxygen or rocket fuel) you then have to run around and hunt for. It's going to be fun to see what the developers add to this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-19,0,0,205,True,Recommended,I originally reviewed this game on the launch weekend of this game. Since then there's been signficant improvement. Crashes have become rare and the bugs have less severe consequences than before. Additional content is slowly coming in as well.It's stiill in Early Access and there's more work to be done but I've put over 100 hours in this game already. It's just a nice and peaceful environment to play in (when you aren't running out of oxygen or in the middle of a sandstorm).It's been about 6 months since Early Access launched and I continue to be optimistic about where this is going.Original Review It's an Early Access Game and it has bugs crashes and could use some more content.Despite all of that that I still managed to put in about 18 hours in first 2 days! It's an enjoyable experience and has so much potential to become even better.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-01,0,0,33,True,Recommended,It looks absolutely great mechanics are fun and there's lots of potential in expanding the systems already in the game right now. Obviously the game could use a little more content but since we're in early access i have high hopes for what is to come.Performance wise the game runs great until you start massively expanding your bases on multiple planets needs some tweaking.If you're looking for something captivating relaxing and really good looking... buy this right now.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-01,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a great game and has a lot more potential to it. The game slaps you in the face with no tutorial and a habitat in which you quickly expand and admire the creative implementation of a hands on UI. The game is beautiful and gives some good challenges. The game has many pros but with little cons especially for early access.Pros Beautiful enviromentAmazing art styleCreative UI and HUDInteresting gameplayCons Frames are pretty bad even with high end specsNo graphic customizationSmall bugs with textures and teleporting itemsAnd some game concepts that don't make senseTips for the developersExploring caves on some planets is a pain in the rear with constant pink spikey and toxic plants. The only way to stop them from killing you is to unroot them after that its a giant entity sitting on the floor decreasing your frames and then I have to dig I giant hole to bury it. Same problem with items suit upgrades and buildings once you obtain them your only solution is to leave them lying around decreasing performance. There is also a lack of items to research after an hour and a half of gameplay everything was researched and the next thing was to explore the rest of the planets and colonize mass expansion but this issue is very minor because it is early access. Developers I would like to see you add more content as you do fixing bugs it's a mistake many make yes it is hard but it will pay off. It would also be great if in graphics options you added an ability to detail the way you want the sky to look like the amount of stars and detail of the planets because I feel like this causes a lot of frame drop. Every time I look at the sky frames drop from 35 to around 20.Hope this review is seen by many including the developersSincerely XxXFiTzxXx,ASTRONEER

2017-04-21,0,0,10,True,Recommended,This game constantly surprised me. It has affects that remind me of those good ol' creative games where you would go foraging for elements and then make stuff out of it. However it also has that Rust feeling of survival and when the storms come you'll probably just dig a hole. I recommend to new players have one pre built might save you some good elements and equipment. However to get the most out of this game you should just put some tethers down make a vehicle and get out there!,ASTRONEER

The best thing I like about the game is how it is so colorful and adventurous. The game on the other hand needs a little work with performance. When playing multiplayer it is really broke. The cars will fly up into the sky randomly and it needs a lot of work. Single player however has hardly no problems and it really is a fun experience and adventure that I love so much.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-16,0,0,15,True,Recommended,Really great game for Space and adventure lovers. As it is an early access there a few bugs which isn't that much of a problem.

2017-11-22,0,0,45,True,Recommended,A fun relaxing experience with an excellently crafted atmosphere. Not incredibly deep in content at this time but has decent replayability and is being constantly improved upon.

2017-08-30,0,0,96,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is a fun easy to pick up and play space explorer/builder. Base building is smooth and very streamlined vehicle useage is generally pretty solid there are a few hiccups here and there but it's usually when I'm trying to do something stupid in a cave. However to some extent it's strength in gameplay is also it's limitation in content. There's no real way to build anything ""different"" all buildings are a module system held together with powerlines. Vehicles are similar in this fashion since the whole build aspect is module based. This isn't a complaint per se just point of fact about the gameplay. Reccomend.",ASTRONEER
2017-03-16,0,0,28,True,Recommended,"Alright folks. If you are looking for a great space exploration game then look no further. This game is everything ""No Mans Sky"" should have been. For one this games art style alone is just incredible. Another thing I absolutely love is how you can really do anything you want in game. There are a few bugs here and there . Such as if you put tethers way too far from your base your frame rate will drop through the floor (I think the game tries to process everything that you have built items in at once)... But being that this game is in early access I would imagine that is subject to change in a future update. Another bug is you can push yourself though the world if you want (or even sometimes unintentionally) which can be useful if you get stuck but you usually accelerate through the unprocessed ground and die (can't retrive items) but again that is subject to change. A big positive I have for this game is that it's physics are phenomenal in all respects. Eg. During a windstorm if you build a wall in front or around you the windstorm no longer has an effect on you. It's the same story with shadows and solar panels. If a panel is in the shade it does not produce energy. (Sucks but at least realistic) one thing I might add to the game however is a box to choose a world seed at launch (from space) because occasionally you will end up in a world that does not have a certain element that you enjoy playing with. All in all a fantastic game!",ASTRONEER
2017-03-14,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Great game when it comes to gameplay. The content is amazing graphics are beautiful and its just overall a fun experiance. With that said the performance of the game is sad it works fine for a while but when you get a big base and stuff is going the performance shoots downhill quick. I had a base not even that large not everything was down and the game shot to 20fps when my rig can easily run this game. I know its pre alpha and thats why I upboated it it is an amazing game just needs better optimization.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,12,True,Recommended,HOLY THIS GAME IS AMAZING.I have been following this game for a while and instanly bought it when I had the chance. I have been playing the game for a couple of hours now and I have been enjoying the game from the second I started it.Once you open the game you are greeted with a beautiful loading screen with all the planets orbiting the sun. After the loading is done you can select your character and you're instantly 'launched' to your first planet.When you get out of the pod it's the best feeling in the game. you can walk around in this vast world full off colours and vegetation. There are mountains raveins caves and lots more.After you progressed a bit and have some basic machines running you can look into all the diffrent modules. You have options like a solarpanel or a wind turbine for power generation but there are also things like storage racks and batterypacks. You can snap these modules everywhere don't like them there? move them somewhere else.But the best thing in this game the vehicles. Trucks rovers landers. They are compatible with all the modules and you can even daisy chain them. You can jump to other planets and start bases there the posibilities are endless.Sure there are some performance issues especially when your base is getting bigger and bigger but that's to be expected with a pre alpha game like this.Really like where this is going looking forward to the updates!

Naturally I will need to navigate using some landmarks. I remember something I did at one point. I was returning to my base when I saw a crashed ship on the very top of the tallest mountain I'd ever seen. I naturally thought ""I need to knock that off."" I rode down the mountain in a chair inside of it. I was fine. I saw the mountain. I made my way around it. I got back home. Then my spaceship I was building fell though the ground.OVERALL 12/10. Very fun. The infinite power panel may or may not exist. I am neither confiming nor denying.",ASTRONEER

2017-09-03,0,0,2,True,Recommended,This game is well designed for Pre Alpha.It's so beautiful and so immersive. There isn't any story (yet) but it's very fun to play and explore the amazing terrain. I recommend this game!,ASTRONEER
2017-03-16,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Yeah it is cool.I actually enjoyed with a friend and I must admit that I am very sad that I already don't have anything to do anymore besides builiding a base on the other 3 planets...Hopefully I will come to this game again after some good months to see that it has been cleared out of bugs(frame drops objects disappearing falling through the map trucks disappearing).Also I hope they will make the multiplayer experience better so guests can do the same things the host can do(except closing the game or stuff like that).If you want a better experience I recomand you to buy this game after some months so you won't most likely play maximum 25 hours than you are done with it for some long time.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-16,0,0,54,True,Recommended,a little under 15hrs and ASTRONEER is a charming experience. The exagerated stylization of objects and terrain makes for a simple &amp intuitive UI for players. You can dive and and start base building almost immediately with very little need for context. There are bugs and glitches but none have ruined my experience. The inventory system and crafting system still needs work. During my playthroughs late game the base is messy with no tools or commands to move or remove objects. (as of the time of this review)Overall 7/10 great music fun environment playful design easy to jump into and start exploring.,ASTRONEER
2017-09-13,0,0,102,True,Recommended,This is a very fun game! Even after playing about 35 hours I still feel like I'm discovering new things and I always find something fun to do. I definetely reccomend playing with a friend or two though the multiplayer is not fully optimized. I haven't had any optimization issues but I understand that that could happen. I feel that people will find the most enjoyment out of this game if they have the openmindedness and creativity to find new places to explore and things to do. The possibilities are (nearly) endless when it comes to building structures roads bridges and massive bases. There are a few glitches that are often hilarious like dying twice (and sometimes even useful) but don't come by that often. I even have a truck orbiting the base planet on one of my worlds! While most of the glitches I've found hasn't harmed the gameplay too bad every once in a while you glitch through the ground and fall to your death or the truck your riding in gets launched into infinity and beyond. (which was kinda hilarious) This game is pretty forgiving though as you respawn with your shoulder attachments augmentations and whatever your holding with your mouse. In addition almost every resource is pretty easy to retrive once you've gotten to it once with the exception of Astronium which was useless to my dismay after mining down nearly to the center of the planet. Overall Astroneer is a very fun exploration and building game and with enough creativity you could play for hours upon hours.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Great start as of now Played the game to the extent I could handle. I can't play with more than 15 fps ATM however that could not be as much optimization more than im playing on an old laptopPROS Creative way of shaping land LOVE the tethering system and unique feel of the game Nice casual game to relax and play a bit Space Dodgeball is painful (yes this is a pro quiet you)CONS No Effective graphics options at all If nothing else let me turn motion blur off Inventory management can be confusing as many resources have identical color schemes Price may be a bit high for the game ATM but as it literally just released as an alpha I can see the reason behind it,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,45,True,Recommended,"First and foremost this is an alpha. There will be bugs. The game is incomplete. Understand this before writing a review.All that said this game is great! I've never aspired to do anything more than collecting space dirt with an oversized suped up vaccuum cleaner then 3d printing stuff with that dirt. Astroneer teases you with tiny bits of visible resources at the surface of the planet leading you down a rabbit hole of needing to find out just how much is actually there. Once you've finished with that patch there's another one within eyeshot of the first. You want to go mine that one too but you've got to go back to base to refill on air and power. If only there was a way to carry more air or power so you could go out longer. Your first mission... You now have the means to stay out longer and you've cleaned out yet another pit of goodies and there's still more to find but your backpack is full... If only there was a way to carry more. Your second mission... This is what Astroneer is. It is the progression based space exploration and industry that drives everything that is fantastic about this game. It takes the resource gathering and machine building of Minecraft to make your job easier and pairs it with simplistic construction while still having a deep enough progression system that requires you to keep making trips out to build that next module.Playing this game even in its incomplete state has shown me what this game can be. With their suggested ""automation"" update and the dynamic ability to build sprawling planetary bases in whichever configuration desired is a recipe for hours of enjoyment in building the most efficient resource gathering pipelines anyone can think of. Couple this with interplanetary travel and you have the makings for Spore's resource trading on a smaller more intimate scale. And the best part is you will be the one who creates it all.This is probably one of the best ""make your own fun"" games I have played in a long time. There's not a lot here since it's an alpha but it's the potential that has me excited. It's what the developers have said they want to create that has me captivated. It's their communication and devotion to the project that has me in love with this game. I can't wait to see what it becomes...TLDR Buy this. Support the small team creating a game for gamers not the publishers. Be open minded and imaginative about what this game can and will become and you will have a fantastic time.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,27,True,Recommended,"This is a game with a lot of promise. I already enjoy it much more than No Man's Sky. You're not having to ""feed the meter"" but get creative on how to best craft your survival toolkit. The art design is simple but immersive partly due to the fantastic soundtrack.If the devs keep expanding on the crafting system variety within the planets and maybe even a combat compoenent this could be an excellent game. I look forward to the updates!",ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,6,True,Recommended,I may only have 5 6 hours on this game but theyre one of the best 5 6 hours ive spent on a game great early access game few bugs that get patched quick. For a game that has no combat (that i know of) it is very intriguing and fun to play. I love exploring and going to different worlds it is 2000% better than No Mans Sky to me this game is what No mans sky should have been. Thanks for this lovely game &lt 3,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,13,True,Recommended,Fun game with a lot to explore and find. It's not even in alpha yet and it's already more enjoyable then NMS!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,30,True,Recommended,This game is epic and still in PRE ALPHA! The game itself is very relaxing and based on survival building and exploring. There are some bugs in the game that causes slow performances for everyone but remember it's a PRE ALPHA game still. For now I won't say $19 99 is worth for the state of the game but if you want to support the devs and help finding bugs/issues then I would say it's worth. Overall it's a pretty awesome game with very relaxing music and still fun/tense situations around you. This game has great potential to become a really fun CO OP game with your squad!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Great game but as of 12/17/16 It lacks much needed optimazation. 5/10 Needs more work. Before you say it. My specs are GTX 970 AMD FX 6300 with 8gigs of RAM and I get major almost unplayable framerate drops.UPDATE 12/18/16 Adding nosound to launch options removed all FPS drops.... Weird,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,34,True,Recommended,EPIC GAME!!!!!!!!i know it is just an alfa i have loged more than 20 hours so far i have confinced some of my friends to by this game but evertime they try tro join a game they eather crash or cant join when we are 2 players the game runs smooth up to a point but more then 2 we have issues please check to sort this out but wel done on how everything works sofar just need to delete save games and quite the game on the menu will be nice XD,ASTRONEER
2016-12-18,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,It's very early in development so any problems are understandable. I'm having a lot of fun playing the game but after exploring for the last 2 days the FPS drop has gone pretty bad and a lot of people are having the same problem. Once that is fixed I would recommend but I wouldn't buy until then as it's almost unplayable once it gets to that state.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-28,0,0,40,True,Recommended,I just want to start by saying for what it is so far this game is phenominal. The survival aspect is not very difficult but you can die when you least expect it or go afk and theres a giant dust storm while your standing next to your base. The exploration aspect is great but it does still need some work.pros great to play with friends lots of discovering to do The research system is great as you can't just build everything right off the bat you can dig all the way to the center of a planet alot to do as well as planet explorationcons optimization still needs to be achieved. you can only explore so far before your frames drop it is something they are working on.The distance i have gone out just trying to explore is still really good.As soon as the problem is adequitley fixed this game will be perfect.If you have a lower end pc you can run this but even the beefiest computers will struggle after some time if you explore alot.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-31,0,0,13,True,Recommended,I bought Astroneer a long time ago. I think it could have been a year since I purchased the game or longer but I'm just estimating. The game was good in many ways it had solid cute graphics and interesting space exploration gameplay as well as a sort of 'space movie colonization' feel but once you had finished up building everything for your station the game got boring for me. I set it aside for a while. A long while. But one day I was scanning my steam page and I was like 'Hey this game was a little bit fun when I got it and it's had a lot of updates since I last played so I'll give it another shot'. Astroneer could not have changed more from when I first played it. The graphics haven't changed much no but that really wasn't where the game was lacking before. The basic concept of the game hasn't changed much either. However so much of the core mechanics of the game have changed and have continued to change and are continuing to change. Let's unpack what this game is. It is a base building space survival game with beautiful textureless graphics. If you want a story then you're out of luck but if you prefer more opened ended choice based gameplay then this is a game you should look into.Now let's see what's awesome about it. It takes place in space With numerous updates all of the bases you build become more functional and more complex It lets you feel the thrill of space exploration as you blast of to amultitude of precedurally generated (I'm sure) planets in your solar system. Access youur machinary through interactive 3D pop up panels that simulate operating controls Use a construction/deconstruction tool to mine resources and mould the world around you. Want to do something with all that dirt? You can using (I think) the mineral extractor and special cannisters. Power your base through a variety of components like solar panels and generators. Kit out your backpack for adventure with the correct atatchments and materials mounted upon it via the interactive 3D backpack menu. Build up your base by buying blueprints with bytes obtained while researching strange alien anomalies. Combine everything you love about base building RTS with everything you love about interstellar survival. And so so so so soooo much more.At this stage in the games developement I cannot say much in the way of things Astroneer does wrong especially since thegame is in earl access and any problems are liable to get fixed.By and large Astroneer is going to be worth your time. I have never been more gratified to have purchased a game pre release except maybe for PUBG and since I have logged roughly 140 hours of PUBG that comes as a complement. Thus I recommend this game to virtually everyone who is interested in its genre mechanics or anyone who is simply looking into it. Astroneer is a good game and it keeps getting better and better.,ASTRONEER

2018-03-31,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Amazing Game. The Graphics are great for the style. The gameplay is amazing. The idea is really interesting. And I love the fact that the main menu isnt a whole different area. Its part of the map! Every planet is one area and you dont need to load much! Its very easy to run. Most importantly is the fact that you do what YOU think you should. You dont HAVE to do anything. And you can explore more and more forever. One last note is that you cant actually dig to the center of each planet!!! And even walk across them! But dont dig to the center.... Its very buggy! Other than the few bugs... This game is really amazing and I plan to play 100+ hours!,ASTRONEER

2017-11-12,0,0,130,True,Recommended,I've had my eye on Astroneer for some time now and I finally took the plunge this weekend... Totally worth it.The gameplay is similar to Minecraft so comparisons to it are warranted however the immersion level of Astroneer is in my opinion far greater. One moment you're traipsing across a verdant field of some random planet and the next you're running for your life to find oxygen or shelter from a massive wind storm.Originally I was drawn in by the minimalistic graphical art style which I love and I was kept engaged by the gameplay. As more features are added to the game I can see that I'm going to be sinking a LOT of hours into Astroneer. When I have more available funds I intend to purchase a copy for my son as well so that we can play together.As long as these developers don't go all 'Paradox games' on their customers and instead add lots of free features and content the upside for this game will be enormous. For Astroneer the future is bright indeed.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-12,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I love this game! Its so much fun!! There are so many possibilities and things to explore and do! I love the graphics but the camera angles are kinda hard to work with. Over all I think that this is the best game I have. Keep up the good work Astroneer.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-12,0,0,11,True,Recommended,AstroneersAstroneers is a fun new game my friend got it for me as a gift so we could both play together and I must say I like this game and the development team that is working on it.The game is simple and refreshing while also relaxing to playThe game is funny with little things almost like a cartoon in a wayThe graphics is nice clean and polished coupled with the variety of colors in the game make it enjoyableThe development team is new and constantly at work on the game to make it better which makes it that much better to joinI have seen many space games however this one is by far one of the bestI have played it for a while and I must say I can t find anything wrong with it and I hope the development team has many years of success with this game.,ASTRONEER

2017-12-31,0,0,23,True,Recommended,"This game.. Oh my god I love it. I love the choice of vector graphics art style.First of all this game is better than it seems in the videos. I was ""iffy"" on the game until I actually got into it.One thing to mention however is that the game doesn't have much longevity unless you like starting a new game over or you really enjoy the exploration aspect.I find this game great because it uses a very interesting concept that games like star citizen and elite dangerous achieve. However the difference obviously between the three is art style/gameplay. I think both are very well executed for these reasons 1. The art style is simple (Vector like mentioned before)and not very resource intensive. While its simple its also very beautiful. The worlds are very intereresting and vary alot.2. The gameplay is simplistic as well but in a good way. It's basically collect resources and build a colony. With the stage I am at in the game I dont know if you can visit other planets like the moons of your starter world but I think with there being a shuttle in the game you probably can. While as of now there isnt a ton to research it is enough to keep you occupied. At the time of me writing this the research system was completely reworked and they will likely be adding more items as they go on.It is important to note however that this game is in alpha and has a long way to go. I look forward to its development and growth and hope to see this game thrive.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-15,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Really awesome game. Well optimized runs so well even on the Intel HD graphics.Only complaint Why isn't the camera locked to where I'm pointing at? Like how GTA is? I mean perhaps allow us to have an option to toggle different camera types. The need to keep right clicking to move the camera view around is troublesome.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-15,0,0,10,True,Recommended,This game really scratches that explore/survive itch. So far it's incredibly fun challenging and looks beautiful. The first time I saw a dust storm roll in I just stood there wondering how the devs made it looks so damn cool.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,9,True,Recommended,9/10Pros Great Artstyle fully destructible terrain multiplayer large map with multiple planets good research system easy UI lots of items and resources to get lots of good updates and great diversity in landscape.Cons Still a little laggy some little bugs here and there some people don't see the same things in multiplayer and sometimes you die for no reason.In conclusion I reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys games that have a sandbox type feel but you have to gather resources. The open world is amazing and this game relates a lot to Subnautica yet without a story (so far).,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,64,True,Recommended,I had a dream. A dream that I could dig a hole through a planet and out to the other side then be able to free fall through the planet to find out what would actually happen. This game made that dream a reality. Thank you Astroneer thank you.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,244,True,Recommended,I've had the game for less then a week. I've already played it for 50 hours. Send help.On a serious note it's a little buggy but it's early access so what are you expecting? Studio seems really transparent and has some good ideas so I'm excited to see where they take the game. If you want Minecraft in space get this game.P.S. Learn how to use the flatten tool. You're welcome.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I love the exploration usually im more into fps games but this is just fun. My most played games are killing floor 2 pubg escape from tarkov and rust.... but something about this game is so fun the whole solar system feels and is connected which i love. I dod think that at about 30 hours ive reached the content pek but its still in early alpha and the devs are very commited so i am exited to see what will come in the future and would definately recomend this game.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Even for an Alpha this game is very enjoyable and interesting to play and even more interesting if like me you weren't told how to do anything beforehand (figuring things out feels like an aspect of the game itself). I love the sound cues (for research oxygen and sandstorms for example) the different dangers and ways to deal with them and how you get your research currency. I also love how you can slide down hills like you're using a snowboard though at one point that nearly killed me hehe. Sandstorms though dangerous and annoying are an interesting and nice detail which to me makes the game the tiniest bit more special.The only thing that has annoyed me so far is how tricky it is with making slopes like to go to a lower part of a cave or from the banks of a river to the bed.Seeing as I've played 2 and a half hours so far and have barely moved from the area around my pod I think I'm going to play this game for a while.,ASTRONEER
2017-12-31,0,0,224,True,Recommended,I got this game back in 2016 when the game first game out. Me and my friend both got it for Christmas and we finished up the entire tree in just a few days. We loved the game but started to find it boring. A few months later the creators of astroneer made the game a lot better more interesting harder and just a lot better in general. Now after only 2 years of being in early access the game has progressed tremendously. There is now research points better exploring less and less bugs starts on modularity and much more! I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes to just casualy play and explorer by them selves or with a friend!,ASTRONEER

The game was simple enough to get into and start but has lots to learn in the way of research types of minerals you need and general understanding of how to set up a base. There are you average bugs to be found in early access but I haven't stumbled on anything that broke my current game or caused long term pain. I find this game works great alone or with friends. Friends definitely let you branch out and grow quicker and it's generally a lot of fun running around mining together. Well worth the price in it's current form.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-18,0,0,12,True,Recommended,This is an early access game which means I would urge you not to buy it till it is complete. Currently it is far from completion. I only bought it early because I see merit in the game as it is. Astroneer is a casual base building game that allows you to explore randomly generated planets. It is in no way challenging or punishing death merely means losing items in your backpack. The game actually offers very little in its current state you merely explore research and build. This is worrying considering the game is early access open world and has crafting. We've seen a huge influx of these kind of games gaining far too much attention and revenue for the garbage they are. A prime example of this is No Man's Sky.However Astroneer is not in any form a NMS copy. NMS tried to create something expansive and unimaginably huge and beatiful to explore with minimum player direction. Astroneer can be seen as the polar opposite. Planets are much smaller but visually pleasing. Crafting and base building are simple but again pleasing. Instead of trying to create something expansive Astroneer is a much smaller package with a lot more polish on it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Astroneer is already going to be one of my favorites already love it and its only in alpha so many more things to come for this game. Theres a OKAY amount of content already in the game if you reall REALLY can't wait to check it out but I would suggest waiting for the next big update at least to get it.Edit 2/18/17 The new update really helped performance on lower medium end computers. If low perfomance has been scaring you away from buying the game I highly suggest buying it now! D,ASTRONEER
2017-02-18,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"As of 2/18/17 this game is in pre alpha state so keep that in mind. I've currently played about 6.5 hours &amp have been a fan of crafting/survival game for a while with both minecraft &amp 7 days to die being high on my list.A few warnings 1) don't knock down trees2) don't put modules where you don't want them.3) don't make too many items via the backpack use the printer.You can't delete anything at this point in time and having a tree flop around your home base is terrible. Or having 20 tiny solar arrays when you discover the normal size (more efficient) printed version means a lot of wasted resources.The Review Astroneers environment/artistry &amp play style is great. The backpack inventory is a bit clunky but after a while you get used to it. Moving items from connector to connector is quick &amp easy and occurs outside any sort of ""crafting menu"" which is a nice change of pace. Labels might be useful or an in game wiki to help identify which slot is which. But trial &amp error works too.The ability to manipulate the land on a whim is pretty awesome build bridges fall to your doom or build up into the sky. There IS a way to make completely flat land too just takes a bit of effort but then you'll have flat land forever. I highly recommend having a flat base area for sanity sake. But besides functionality you can't really ""build"" anything the game is more about exploring &amp discovery then building it seems.Vehicles are hilarious to drive. At this point there's no damage &amp you can end of creating quite some epic wrecks! Your character will fall out so make sure you at least land on something solid.All in all I only have space travel to do try yet. I've otherwise discovered all in game content. Yet still the games impressive weather nice graphics easy crafting &amp random generated world. Excited to see what the next update brings!",ASTRONEER

2017-01-25,0,0,21,True,Recommended,I am hesitant to give a thembs up to this at the moment but I'm going to do it anyway on the simple basis of it is still quite a ways away from finished as of writing this. Personally I very much enjoyed my experience slowly building my base up and exploring the world. The atmosphere presents itslelf in a way that encourages mello and laid back playing as you explore a desolate uninhabited planet. The purpose as of this build is to find things to research and gather the materials needed to build your base. That's where the problems start. Once you research the tradeing post and fuel compressor you don't really need to explore anymore. You can trade 8 fuel for the rarest materials in the game and the fuel compressor takes nothing but energy to run. It changes from base building and exploration to useless trading. Until they fix it or give me a reason to go back to exploring the world (which I'm sure they will as they appear to be quite engaged with the community) then you might want to hold off on the purchase. Personally I still think that it's worth the buy for its mello vibe.Pros Very relaxed playing. A great game when you don't want to play something serious. Minerals are actually quite difficult to find out in the world and even then require certain research to obtain. Use of tethers stagger your exploration ability which makes reaching new places seem like an accomplishment. Terrain modifier makes any landscape interestingCons Fuel compressor gives limitless fuel for nothing. This allows for infinite trade platform exploiting. Can find most materials in &gt 10 hrs Lacking content as of current patchI'll try to update as more patches go live.Edit 8/9/17 A few patches have gone live and since then I have noticed significant changes in the game. Pros Developers still update regularly. I see a lot complaining about a lack of major changes but if they read any of the updates the developers have a list of priorities and making sure the kinks are worked out is important before adding new content on top of broken old. Hydrazine trading post exploit fixed making exploration more of a necesity. Can no longer just use the fuel condensor to trade hydrazine for whatever you would likeNeutrals(?) if you are starting from a new save since the patches to the game the updates to the research tree stretch out the pacing a bit. More products to find means less chance to find the one you need right away. You might get a spaceship with no source of hydrazine for miles. While I enjoy the stretch in gameplay I can see how this would be an annoyance to others.As it stands right now I still give it a tentative recommendation. The designers make no claims of having a finished product and game design takes time. I knew it would be a while before the game is complete. Now if they released it without some sweeping changes that would be a different story.,ASTRONEER

2017-09-11,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Best chilling game I've played in a long time this is as casual as it gets. Objectives are to set up a base and expand the base until you are able to build a shuttle and leave but it isn't the true objective. The true objective is to have fun and explore this colorful and creative world with a beautiful soundtrack and great atmosphere you could get stuck in this game for hours but here is where we slide into the bad side of the game you will only play this game for a couple of hours because there isn't much to do in Astroneer hence the reason of EA. They add stuff and keep you in touch of what they are working on and it is great to hear how the game is going and it is going in the right direction for now but at a slower pace. Which is all good but I will only bounce on from time to time.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-04,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,I love this game originally for it for the kids but being pre Alpha of course there is no tutorial took me a few hours to work out what I was doing It's a great game collecting resources staying alive surviving storms making sure you got air power etc like the fact you can build your own spacecrafts and visit other plannets you can even build a road to the moon can't wait for the game to be finished one to watch for.....edit 14 months later....the game is still the same you buuild a base leave the planet build a base leave the planet then do it again nothing has changed gone from being happy to sad thumbs down,ASTRONEER

I usually rate a game on how many hours it sucks me in and replay ability. Even having researched everything in the game its still fun to explore and set up new bases on other planets. If you want a game that involves bad guys this is not the game for you right now. If you love to build a base and explore then this game has everything you have dreamed of.

2016-12-21,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Let me start by stating the obvious this game is NOT finished. With that out of the way I gotta say holy is it a good game. I know there's been a lot of reviews of people saying they have a lot of framerate issues or bugs but as to be expected from a small developer in a pre alpha game. Those things aside this game is marvelous. I love the unique style of it very simple but deep in a very similar way that Minecraft is. The sound design is very fitting for the atmospher too. It manages to feel very much like Minecraft without feeling like a complete rip off breathing new life into this create in a sandbox environment and survive genre of games. The building/crafting is smart and lends itself to the space theme of the game very well. With further polish and features enemies buildable items etc etc. this game will keep players engaged and having fun for a time quiet a bit of time. SUMMARYGraphics 8/10 (Mostly for unique style game has a lot of pop in/framerate issues very common in early releases)Sound 8/10 (Effective background music and audio ques)Gameplay 9/10 (Simple fun very easy to pick up and play for 5 min sessions or for much longer) Overall 8.5 (Minecraft meets Space Engineers in a very subtly simple awesome game),ASTRONEER

2016-12-21,0,0,10,True,Recommended,This is a very fun game. They have smoothed out some bugs over the past week that make it better and the devs seem to be working and adding pretty frequently. There isn't a lot to do in the game though. I still recommend it for the price. The graphics are great the music is good but if you are on an AMD processor you will hit a bug where the audio causes the game to chug really slow. Turning off all sound makes the game run buttery smooth. I say there isn't much to do because there isn't. The whole point of the game from a gameplay perspective is to build up a base to make it easier to survive the planet you are on. You collect resources to build more and more things and soon have a large base to the point where there is no more reason to build or collect resources. There are no weapons or fuana/mobs. It's pretty much an exploring game. The only surviving aspect is from the elements. Making sure you have plenty of oxygen and power is really all there is to the game. They have a lot planned for the game that will add greatly but it is alpha so there is a lot to be expected before final release. Their path to release and the things they want to add look like it will add greatly to the game and make it more fun. For the price right now it is totally worth it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-21,0,0,13,True,Recommended,This is an awesome game with really involved developers who care about and interact with thier community.

Relaxing and also funny... alot of glitches as its a pre alpha but most of them are hilarious making your experience that extra bit entertaining. Few bad glitches where you and/or your vehicle fly into the ground and lose all of the you had on you and can lose your vehicle entirely. Also BE CAREFUL AMD users can be very laggy around base or where alot of parts are going on. One world was extremely laggy so i restarted anew and new world is fine and looking good 10/10!!!,ASTRONEER

2016-12-22,0,0,43,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER is an incredible game. Seriously impressed with how addicting this game is. I'v had it for maybe 4 days and i'v logged over 30 hrs and counting. After playing the first little bit i understood how everything worked right away i love the simplicity and diversity that the game has. I spent quite a few hours just trying out different base configurations and designing different vehicles to suit my area/needs. I love how you can explore litterally everything on the planet and shape anything you want really. There are some expected bugs and glitches as it is early access and still in development but i cant wait for more updates and to see where this game goes. I love how everything is modular and snaps into place would love to see more items/research and vehicles but i'm sure we'll get there in the next updates to come. Definately worth 20$ would recomend to anyone who enjoys open world exploration and base design games.,ASTRONEER

2018-04-07,0,0,0,True,Recommended,I played Astroneer for a very short time as you can probably see. I've been following this game since the beginning and have had high hopes for it and still do. The only problem with it at the moment at least that I ran into was stability. But it IS in alpha. So this is understandable. My computer is perfectly adaquate to run the game properly however I experience frame drops and stutters constantly. Did not matter if visuals were set to high or low or anything in between. You may download the game and not have any issue with that and thats great play on! It's a great game! I recommend this game because I KNOW it has enormous potential and the devs are being very active putting out updates. Plus if not for the constant frame issues I'd be playing it like crazy right now. It's that good. So if there are devs reading this please look into a fix for framerate issues. ) A google search will reveal I was not the only one dealing with this. I'm taking a step back from this game for a while but I WILL be coming back. I'll be watching this game's progress very closely.,ASTRONEER
2018-04-07,0,0,42,True,Recommended,Lots of fun with the new base building mechanic. Now you have so much more possiblities. This increases the play time by a lot. With the new mechanics you can make underground mining bases. It won't auto mine but it saves you time. Because this is an early access game you can run out of things to do once you have built a base. However I got around this by going to another planet to make a base.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-27,0,0,29,True,Recommended,From the little i have played of this game i have loved it. The content itself is somewhat lacking but seeing as how its a prerelease game im really digging it thus far. My biggest issue is performance related. I love exploring in games like this but i have found in my quest to travel around the world that its kind of impossible. Once i get five or so minutes by rover away from the landing site the game seems kind of broken. Mountains look like a bad acid trip caves wind around the surface of the planet much like minecraft after the ravine update and my framerate drops to single digits. With 16gb of ram an 8350 and an rx470 i would expect better framerate from a machine that can handle most games on ultra without a skip. I would highly recommend the game for 20 dollars but one must keep in mind that its in prerelease. I look forward to watching the game grow and branch out as the developers collaborate with players and continually improve upon their product.,ASTRONEER

The game is pretty chill and is something I can see myself getting lost in while playing infront of my TV. You have to learn as you go and if that isn't something you're very into than don't bother with this game but if tedious and long hours of tinkering and gathering is your thing than you are in heaven. This game shows a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to what developers have to offer in the future.,ASTRONEER

2017-12-31,0,0,117,True,Recommended,Well I dont like writing reviews but I thought I would write one.Before reading below I will say they are a couple spoilers. (No choice if I want to give pro's and con's.)Pro's Great graphics and really smooth running.Sound is good (not music sound) and seems to match the type and style of game.Music I don't know as i never have music in any game.Controls on keyboard are ok and easy to understand and use.Content is good but at my stage in playing I miss some things I was expecting. Such as the ability to build a habitat that looks like a house or dome. (They may be in game but I don't know.)The in game weather is ok but need more types.Con's I have a few cons but not to many.So the game needs an ability to flip vehicles upright again. It takes long time to try to dig down and flip a vehicle in a hole.Next issue is the vehicle based drilling needs better control and the ability to move slowly while digging so you don't always have to jump in and out of seats.Also the drill should grab more materials at once when drilling it grabs so little (Or it does seem so to me.)And a big issue for me is the game needs a map that points out locations of bases on a planet. (I know there are beacons but they are little help unless you want to use 100's at a time. As you can not see them from a far)The dig tool needs a bit better tweeking. When you press ctrl to level land it should have a pinpoint section so you choose area level you want to make. Right now I get slopped hills up and down and rarely get a flat surface. Its even worse when you build bases bigger at different times.Thats it for my pro's and con's its not all but some.The cons look like lots of bad but they are not they are only what I think would make the game better.The game is fantastic and one of the best openworld games i have played and I have many.I know it is early access but it is really a great game at this stage and worth the cost even if not on sale.All in all I give this game at this point a big thumbs up and would buy it without a doubt or hesitation.So guys and or gals take a chance and buy the game.Thanks to the Devs for making this game and all the hard work.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-28,0,0,13,True,Recommended,An extreamly enticing game to fill the void of space exploration that no mans sky could not fill. This game is nothing short of incredible the engine how it plays the graphics are all brilliant and I love the art style of it. its very easy to get the hang of it without any tutorial or guide (there is a guide but I never used it as there was no mention of one) but exploring is very pleasent on the surface. Nothing will harm you other then falling into a ditch. or sliding down a mountain face. But underground the plant life have there own mind sets! Now I know this game is alpha and it's totally worth buying just to see how it'll grow playing the patches testing etc. but this game has so much potential to build something incredible and something no mans sky couldn't even dream of. I really hope more resources are added to the game too like compounds or chemicals. but honestly just thinking about what might be introduced to the game makes me feel giddy and this game has filled a whole no other game has in a long long time. Thank you!!!!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Sure there are still bugs here and there but despite all that this game is so much fun especially in coop! So much potential. Looking forward to every update!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,35,True,Recommended,What a fantastic early access game! There's about 4 6 hours of content here at the moment. Probably another 10 hours if you hop to the other planets you will be doing the same thing on each one but the climates offer an an oportunity to set up your bases differently. However really your imagination with the terraforming tool is where the real fun happens do you carve out the world build a ramp to space build towers dig to the core expand your base into the caves.The art style is cute and functional be it the polygons or the player structures it defintely has appeal and matches perfectly together. Performance is fine although control of the vehicles needs a little work. For me this is the surprise title of the year coming in at the 11th hour.There is so much potential here Subnautica esque.Buy it you wont regret it.,ASTRONEER
2017-04-05,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This is one of the best sandbox games I've played in a while outdoing Minecraft and Terraria. I have played (I think) over 20 hours of Astroneer and I never get tired of it! It is especially fun to play multiplayer although because it is still in pre alpha testing it can be pretty laggy. Also I have managed to do multiplayer only once. Despite minor inconveniences I would recommend it to anyone who likes sandbox games.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-28,0,0,12,True,Recommended,So I've only been playing this game a little over an hour now and I'm hooked.

I will leave you now to go explore this cave sytem I've just found hopefully without dying XD,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,10,True,Recommended,Its just relaxing and easy to pick up on there are a few bugs but nothing game breaking (WELL DUH ITS APLHA) and I expect to see major ammounts of content and improvements in the future.

2018-01-17,0,0,21,True,Recommended,My computer meets the recommended specs yet the framerate is very poor at lowest graphical settings. Maybe the game is not properly optimized or maybe it really is that intensive and the recommended specs should be configured. Besides that the game is by far one of my favorite survival games especially for an early access title. Love the game maybe work on the optimization and performance settings though. I realize that this game is in a very early stage and for that I will not criticize the performance that much. The game is amazing maybe just work on more content because the overall quality is great. Besides the many bugs.,ASTRONEER

2018-01-26,0,0,2,True,Recommended,"AboutYou start off on a planet you know nothing about It's a random planet and when you land on it you must try your best to gather it's materials resources and other precious things in game your base is an oxygen receiver once you come in contact you get oxygen and you can continue your journey. If you decide to leave your base to gather materials you might run out of oxygen and pass out once you pass out you lose all valuable resources you collected. But once everything is nice and settled your goal is to make it to outerspace and explore more planets by exploring planets you can set other civilizations and make something called a b solution which is pretty much a massive civilization where everything is put into one and you're the ruler of every planet you touched base on. GameplayThe mechanics and gameplay are gorgeous and well put together there is no lack luster in the timeline of this game it seems extremely well put and it all adds up in the end there is no missing spots.The creativity of the game also is beautifully fit the simple ways of gathering resources and losing oxygen on this blank world you know nothing about but all of a sudden you think of it as home as you slowly grind away in the objectives in the game.Something else that is extremely fun is that you have the freedom to search the whole planet and eventually get an oxygen receiving mobile junkie so you don't have to grind oxygen everytime you're farming resources. Graphics I can say one thing the graphics may be cartooney but this is one of the most beautifully crafted graphically state game i've played that involves cartooney graphics it's just really great and everything is a beautiful site and I just keep saying to myself ""thats a beautiful site"" because it just really is. ConsThe replayability is terrible in this game because if you already migrate on your home world you can easily do the same thing on another planet and pretty much make the same EXACT home base every time so you don't have creativity when playing.Another con about this game is the lack of content the content in the game is extremely minimal and eventually when the full release comes around there will be more but at the time of writing this review the content is minimal and it effects the gameplay as you need different items in the game to expand your civilization on your homeworld without these items it feels like once you're done with your civilization you can't use a different method by using other tools to create a civilization. OverallThis game is great I haven't played it much due to the fact that in 2.9 hours I made my whole civilization and I don't need to put the time to make another one.If you like space games this is for you just keep in mind that it's boring after your civilization is made but if you throw your friends in you'll have a more of a fun time.So I'll give it a 7/10.",ASTRONEER

2018-08-29,0,0,12,True,Recommended,This is a fun lighthearted game. I am not a big FPS fan as I used to do it in real life. I find such games have a place I find them to be a good stress ball but when played often they have the reverse effect. This game is about mining exploring and building. I love the atmosphere of the game as the stars moons or other planets cross the sky and you can fly to them. The mining is much more as the ground reacts in a fluid clay like motion not big square blocks. I would love to see more building brought into the game. I actually was attracted to this game after playing Terra Tech for like 2 days straight. Astroneer has more modular building aspect to it. You build a platform that has slots where equipment plugs into such as seats or power sources that are crafted at a machine or smaller components straight from your backpack. Equipment can also be salvaged as you explore planets. I wish it would introduce a building aspect somewhat like Terra Tech so you could get more creative in your mining and space endevours. I give it a 3.7 out of 5 in its current state. Fun game with great potential.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-21,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Even though it's in pre alpha it's a wonderful game that I feel is worth $20. I have never crashed or lagged on this game and it looks absolutely beautiful. Of course since it is a pre alpha there are some rough edges like you cant mine stuff without making a huge crater and you can't combat the gas in caves which has killed me numerous times. Vehicle of course are glitchy as well as multiplayer. When playing you just have to focus on the the main goal which is that the $20 you spent will go towards funding the game and make it better.

2016-12-16,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,"Alpha game is alpha there is a severe lack of content and polish. However the core game is very solid the mechanics intuitive and the best approach to an inventory system I've seen in a survival/sandbox game. I recommend buying in but unless you are ready for a long wait (Think Space Engineers or Subnautic) hold off. update After a year in EA not much has really changed in the game. Overall the research and base updates seem to have slowed the game down rather than make the experience more interesting/challening. Rather than adventuring for a specific kind of item to research to unlock something you throw the item on a scanner and wait an hour to accumulate enough points to unlock the item. As of now its really not clear what the ""game"" is.I bought into the EA with the pitch of exploration and complex industry. So far neither of these items have been significantly addressed or is it clear how they will be implemented. I think I'll have to double down on my origional thought of holding off as I'm not sure what this game will turn out to be at this point.",ASTRONEER

2018-02-24,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is recommended if you like just exploring and building a base in space but no intense combat. For me it seemed to start out a bit slow until I unlocked the space rover. Then it started to feel more fun. I personally would like for there to be more of a combat aspect to it but if you would rather it not have any combat this might be a good game for you. It mostly relies on exploring to find resources and then using them to build your base. Building is a simple concept and is easy to learn. Also you won t find yourself having to grind as much us some other games.However I have encountered some bugs with the multiplayer aspect of the game which is to be expected with early access games. Basically after playing for about an hour I couldn t move any objects in the game until I restarted it. And then I found out that when you leave a multiplayer game you die. Which is no big deal because you just have to run back to your corpse to re loot your items. That annoyed me but this hardly put a damper on the core gameplay. And by the way this game feels best when played with someone.Also any computer that isn t too old should be able to run this game.Over all though very fun gameplay nice feeling graphics and large exploration make this a recommendation.8/10,ASTRONEER

2017-12-31,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I love how early the game stage is in and how well it is in yet there are some bugs that usually end out as a 10 minute laughing session.Astroneer is a low poly sandbox survival game where you are in a different solar system (what in the actual fook are you there for?) and pretty much making a life there you can explore caves shipiwrecks and even fly to different planets and even solar systems!There is also a multiplayer feature in the game but it is only really meant for friends there isn't in game chat but assuming you're friends you can use steam chat or discord to talk. Multiplayer is also a little bit unbalanced in a way that the server host cannot kick nor invite friends it is up to the friend to join the game via steam chat. I don't quite like this feature because if you have lots of friends and one happens to be a troll well you're boned.But before you buy this game make sure your system can handle it even though the min. specs were quite low I found myself running through a few lagspikes during the game playing on my laptop while traveling.,ASTRONEER

2017-05-06,0,0,143,True,Recommended,"If you like things short sweet and to the point scroll down to the bottom After 103 hours of gameplay I can tell you that this game is a little buggy and lacks content after a certain point. BUT I will stand by this game for as long as it takes because it has A LOT of potential. And while this game seems like it was released ""too early "" I think it was for a good reason. The second you start the game it shows you a message from the devs saying that they want to build a game together with the community and I can really respect that. It's important for developers to keep in touch with their players as it only helps them progress towards a greater product.While there doesn't seem like there isn't much to do in the game right now I would say to give this game a go support the team with your purchase and maybe even post in the System Era forums! It's only going to help them.Thank you for your time )*UPDATE*This game is going to get a major update by the end of 2018 that the devs announced during E3. I feel as though now is a better time than ever to start getting into Astroneer if you're interested.

2018-06-23,0,0,116,True,Recommended,"I've had a chance to play around with Astroneerand find it rather compelling.I like it . . . a bit too much actually. 9.9 Sleep used to be such a LOVELY thing.I doubt the stuff exists anymore. )Having played Minecraft Space Engineers Avorian and Starmade I find many similarities Sans blocks.What I also find is a VERY nice visual astethic.The graphics are pleasant as a picture in a children's book About space.Although most of my time has consisted of tooling around on my starter planet rather than building a ship to check out any of the other planets . . . yet.And it has been an enjoyable trip.There's a definite sense of ""What's that over there?"" .Astroneers gives you lot's of toys to play with randomized planets to explore each with their own biome passive aggressive plant life no obvious options for PVP NO fantasy magic and a sound track that lulls you into a false sense of security whilst the Dust Storm stalks about like some menacing great volumetric creature.A note about blocky base building There ARE NO blocks like you would use in other blocky building games.You sculpt the terrain. There ARE tools to help make your work more polished. You'll need to unlock them via gameplay.That's just with making structure shaped sculptures.The actual working equipment of the base you build is a bit modularand all snaps together like a model kit with working bits.The tutorial was fine.I personally DID resort to searching online for more info.Someone is running an Astroneer wiki and there are plenty of Youtube videos to sort through although not many of them are completely straightforward to the point.The game itself is basic with some depth.Once you get up and running it will be mostly second nature to play the thing.Ultimately I get the impression that Astroneers is a great big scavenger hunt.Searching for all the goodies is a great deal of fun.If you can control how much time you spend on this game it should be fine.Otherwise You may end up discovering that you've lost 2 days on this thingwithout the foggiest idea as to where they went.Maybe you'll find them in one of the cave systems or over the next hill . . . )",ASTRONEER

2016-12-26,0,0,47,True,Recommended,GameplayThis is a really solid interesting and fun game. Firstly when I bought this game I was really overall thinking that I will just get bored on the first or second hour of playing this game but I was greatly wrong. There is just so much fun stuff to do finding caves mining resources finding blueprints building habitats. And the best thing is that this is just the early alpha meaning that in the future this game will 100% have much much more stuff and things to do. At the moment I am at the point where I have found all the blueprints as there arent that many but still a good amount tough. But I still haven't explored all the planets I haven't even gotten into exploring my own starting planet as much as I would like to. BugsDuring my gameplay I have found some bugs but not to an extent where I am really annoyed or mad. I have heard that for some people their saves have corrupted etc. But for me I haven't really run into big problems. Just the minor issues like getting out of a spaceship makes you stuck on an extension which you have to jump out of or being able to land your spaceship on top of an another one.Should you buy this gameIf you like exploring scavenging building space and stuff. Then it's a big fat YES. Keep in mind that this is the early alpha so this game isn't even close to being finished which might set some people off but I dunno at this point in my opinion it is really enjoyable and I think this might become a really awesome game in the future.,ASTRONEER

I don't need new content every week or even every month.

2017-09-01,0,0,170,True,Recommended,First I liked it a lot. It was something new and interesting but the lack of content kills the fun. It need a purpose or goal. Why keep exploring the planets and building bases since there are no purpose working forward to. It could be aliens friendly or hostile depending on which planet. Do you choose to make friends? Or fight them? Maybe your goal could be to build a big spaceship and then travel to a new system with new planets.

2016-12-26,0,0,6,True,Recommended,Really cool and lots of fun. Probably the longest time I've put into soemthing that was Pre Alpha and feel the need to leave a positive review. Pretty much 'No Man's Sky' but a bit more cartoonish with more character and actually fun. This game has loads of potental and I'm really looking forward to see how it develops. Would recommend.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-26,0,0,53,True,Recommended,36 Hour Pre Alpha Review Very good foundation for the game. Lacks game loops due to early development but what is there is solidly entertaining for several hours including *actual* multiplayer where you can *actually* see the other players ingame ) Very good potential am looking forward to seeing where developers take it.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-26,0,0,12,True,Recommended,After following this game since Jan. 2016 every blog every stream and YT video I have to say SES delivered exactly what they promised. Astroneer contains even more than I thought it would at launch.What's Unique? No obtrusive UI 3rd person only and we're able to dig to the planet's core. Negatives Limited content (which I'm sure theyre planning to add to) I experienced framerate lose over time and you're unable to control the spaceship.As with all EA games there will be bugs You'll get stuck inside a workstation fall beneath the world and be DC'd from MP. This game is for the creative explorer. If that sounds like you your money will not be wasted.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-10,0,0,114,True,Not Recommended,Just to be clear I do enjoy the game and believe it is a great and refreshing idea.

2016-12-26,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Those who wanted a great space exploration game this year who may have been hyped for No Man's Sky but ultimately dissapointed. You have come to the right place. Astroneer is a beautiful game (in my opinion) along with that really fun. Just take note it is still in early access and it is subject to bugs and glitches that could possibly break your game. So just be prepared. Along with that not all content has been added to this game either. Either way what's here today will keep you busy and intruiged especially with a friend.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-10,0,0,76,True,Recommended,"Astroneer is like Minecraft in space. It may be inaccurate but the combination of mining and ""crafting"" in Astroneer creates a sort of positive atmosphere easily comparable to Minecraft. It also helps that the Devs are actual people (with dev vlogs!) and connect with the community. If you like space and indie survival/exploration games Astroneer is probably for you.",ASTRONEER
2018-07-10,0,0,72,True,Recommended,I'm not much into casual games but this one has kept me entertained for hours. On top of that the devs are transparent and update frequently. Although the game is still fun as it I cannot wait for what they have in store for the future.,ASTRONEER

AnonymousI would revise this quote to include ""Travel too far into a cave and you'll fall into another cave that contains another cave. Then spend the next 20 minutes getting your stuff back off your corpse!"" +)Amazing how much detail there is in the environments lighting shadows and style. They are so clever in their ""less is more"" approach to design and put the right amount of detail in the things that you build compared with the landscape. This game is highly addictive and it is funny how much I actually die in this game compared to others. You get used to having a plan for how you want to build your base gather resources and progress. Then you fall off a mountain or into a cave are too far away from your oxygen supply and die. Then you spend the next 20 minutes getting your stuff back (which I call the walk of shame) due to your tiny stupid mistake. So much for your original plan but you learn a lot from your mistakes in the wild. I've lost track of how many times I've gone out the range of my beacons thinking to myself ""I know where the hell I'm going who needs beacons!?!""... only to then find a research ball and then look up and not have a clue where you are! Then spend the next hour and a half traveling over half the planet desparately hoping to stumble onto one of your beacons. So fun! For an Alpha I've already had more fun than some games that have already been released fully with tons of DLCs.In summary this game is perfect for the price (I got mine for $15 during a sale) they are constantly developing it they have a roadmap vlogs trailers and a wiki page that really helps new players learn what there is to build and what does what. Buy this game get lost in it and find your way back. You might just learn something about yourself along the way! Zombie",ASTRONEER

2018-09-30,0,0,26,True,Recommended,This game don't have much late game contents. Basically you mine you craft then you drive and launch the rocket.Some cool players might be able to build their beautiful astonishing base. But for normal players like me I don't do that a lot.So that's what this game isn't strong with but besides that this game give you many more awesome things so it definetly worth a try. Any way they are developing more and more into this.One point i think we can get better with is in game emotion. I like to use geture to communicate with people like in Dark Souls. But that's not enough in this space game. I think this game can provide both emotion and gesture to let us communicate ideas. This more suitable with a space game communication. Like I've bring back many Ti now! We need more iron! I wanna craft a vehicle (for myself can I?) Please clean up the base / gather up here / etc. I'm in the sandstorm!!!! Help me!!!(i don't have O2 or in sandstorm)....and many more. When we choose on emotion prompt it at a corner of the game or somewhat.

2016-12-22,0,0,43,True,Recommended,"I bought this game and in the first day I played 5 hours. Some say that ""It gets repetitive after 5 hours."" If you think that you probably have never left your planet built a vehicle or played with friends. Building any vehicle like the truck or rover allows for a whole lot more fun just cruising around the planet with the soundtrack in the background. And plus you can't really judge a game for ""lacking content "" when it's in alpha. In short the game is super fun with an amazing soundtrack and solid gameplay",ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,40,True,Recommended,This game is an absolute delight once you get used to the controls. however it is buggy and things in the game should be more intergrated. This game should be bought nonetheless and explored for its vastness. It does hold so far the potential for better upgrades and more things to unlock research and drive. bus should be fixed for when adding loads onto the trucks as it can spass out and send trucks flying. trucks should not be stopped by tethers or small pole shaped rocked fixtures especially with a drill. and something should be done with the way the 3 setting in the gun smooths out terrain.,ASTRONEER

I have mostly played MP and experienced crashes but the game is in early access and that is expected. I played around in a singleplayer world for a bit and learned how to build and do everything. I hope to follow this game as it develops!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I have about 9 hrs and have completed the game with all the upgrades. Each moment i spent playing this game i enjoyed it I would not buy this game for 20 dollars if it wasnt an early access game and was totaly out. Since it is early accessI know the developers will be adding more content and fixing the many bugs it will become much more interesting. Like the Minecraft devs these devs didnt back themselves into a corner are open minded and have seen other games like this they know what they are doing so they can add more stuff slowly until its a giant full fledged game. I hope this game will be a 40% subnautica for exploring 35% minecraft for building and 25% factorio for automated machinery. This is just my opinion though and the game could go manny different directions and im fine with that as long as its intreging. I hope the developers best of luck no matter what happens. ),ASTRONEER

It's beautiful fun and relaxing.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-16,0,0,96,True,Recommended,Holy cow. My younger brothers got this game and recommended I should buy it too. They were not wrong. It may still be in its Alpha phase but it has quite a bit of content and very few bugs. There is a tutorial but it's not as clear as it could be but it was good enough and figuring out how everything works is part of the fun anyways. The format of the game is adventure mining and building.You are an astronaut on some planet and you gather resources to build up your base. You have a mining tool that absorbs the ground and to get resources they need to be uncovered from the ground. Once one clump of resource is uncovered it gets compiled into the mining tool and once enough of one resource is collected it is automatically put onto your backpack. You use the resources to create platforms and modules that enable more and better different machinary that can build tools that can assist in resource gathering. Capsules can be built to gather the ground that is cleared to get resources which can then be used to mold the terrain removing with the mining tool and adding with the stored ground.There is multiplayer though it seems to be between friends as one can invite another friend to a game or join a game that a friend is in. There are no public servers to my knowledge.I cannot wait to see what more will be added to the game more resources machines some form of a storyline discovering histories of past civilizations.Even if the game got abandoned right now there is enough content and running bug free enough that it still would be worth the money and time to those who have or will purchase it.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-17,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Astroneer...Astroneer is a space surviving game.

It has good graphics and sounds that you can expect from a 20 game.

2018-03-24,0,0,142,True,Not Recommended,Feels like this game is getting worse.....peformance has gotten better but its not really fun anymore.Needs a creative mode to bring back some fun and freedom and experimenting its just dull now.Controls also feels more and more like the are made for a controller and its rather annoying.Feel a bit sad since i really used to enjoy this game but now basic stuff just seems to be trivial....like you used to be able to terraform as you pleased. So you could build all kinds of crazy stuff......now you have to collect the dirt This might seems as a nice Idea but really takes away 50% of the fun there was in the game. The other 50% are exploration and it dosent really seem to have gotten much new i noticed.......Albeit im now so bored by the game im not really getting past the start anymore....theres no surprice in what you are getting from research anymore....since i can look tru it all in a menu and thats very bad for actual exploration......I dont really have a reason to ever leave the hole i start out by digging...its will likely provide all the resources ill ever need.can build stuff like drills for cars.....But theres nothing worth drilling since you will likely have enough resources to build everything in less than an hour......So you just need to damn resarch nodes..that dont matter much anymore since they all do the same.....and not really hard to find.,ASTRONEER

2018-03-24,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Rating % Get it on sale!Impression Astroneer has a lot of potential but it's still early enough in its development that it yet remains to be seen if it will be a great game. The devs seem dedicated and appear to listen so that's always a plus. All that aside the concept is enjoyable colonize planets! gain tech! repeat! It's worth picking up on sale if you're interested or if you're very much into games like this at normal price point. That said it might also be worth your time to shop around a bit or simply watch this one until the development hits a point that sells you.Highlights Colonizing planets researching tech from strange alien organisms and dealing with interesting new dangers and mysteries.Fun art style!Responsive and dedicated development teamLowlights Does not play well on low end machines. Games like Boundless or Subnautica are still quite playable at lower quality settings on a basic 2 year old laptop but Astroneer chugs pretty hard even while doing something like adjusting the camera angle.There's not a lot distinguishing it from some of the other games available in this genre aside from the setting.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-25,0,0,42,True,Recommended,this game was bad with sooooo many glithes but then there came a update that made it double as good and not so many glithes any more so buy it,ASTRONEER
2018-03-22,0,0,12,True,Recommended,Since I've recently dipped my toe in the survival genre and I had my socks blown off by Unknown World's Subnautica I figured I'd check this little one out.In short up front great idea great work so far still a ways to go. Definitely worth a try if you have a spare $20 lying around (and I mean DISPOSABLE income) BUT I only got a few hours out of it before a bug (what I consider to be game breaking) made me put it down for the time being.The visual style and animations are fun and the interface is O K. I've seen/heard a lot of complaints about the camera/control system but I only had a real problem with it when driving the rover (I never got to the shuttle before the game broke on me). Lots of stuff to explore collect unlock and build but it would seem once one progresses to making travel between planets possible then it will get a bit repetitive. Again I got less than 10 hours out of my experience so maybe I'm missing something.As for the bug at some point after I got my rover ready to go the game stopped responding to the normal left click select function and a reload didn't fix it. I could unscrew it when at home base by unplugging the rover (or any other connected platform i.e. altering the local environment) but once out in the general environment I had no way to clear the bug. Without the ability to pick anything up you're pretty much hosed. Personally I'm not interested in putting 5 6 hours into a save game to have it break on me I just don't have that kind of spare time.So in the end I'll still recommend Astroneers because it is only in Alpha and I want to believe that it is still on a good path and the devs will give it the care and feeding it needs to turn into awesomeness. But seriously only drop the cash if you have extra to burn $20 is a bit steep for less than 10 hours worth of consistent gameplay (IMO).,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,30,True,Recommended,Its early access for Astroneer but they are off to a great start! game has its bugs but this is a pre alpha release so thats to be expected. Super fun game with a kind of cutesie stylized graphics going on. create your base and scavenge for resources. however unlike most games of this type you dont spend all your time constantly gathering resources at least not forever. I've got to the point where I have renewable energy and batteries that last all through the night and i can literally roam the planet and actually explore! somewhat simple but A BLAST to play!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-28,0,0,225,True,Recommended,"Fun and consuming. I'm looking forward to working on major ""public works"" projects and colonizing different planets/moons. There's so much potential here as a pre Alpha game. I started playing at 7 30pm then all of a sudden it was 1am.",ASTRONEER

2016-12-22,0,0,46,True,Recommended,It is still very much an early access game and it is quite buggy in multiplayer.However it is definitely worth it. I would recommend buying the game as I look forward to the future updates into a game that already has so much to do. I'm also not sure if the developers will increase the price for the game when it is finished a year or so from now. $20 well spent.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-22,0,0,26,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. The graphics yet simple are really stunning very beautiful. The gameplay and mechanics of the game set it apart from other space survival games very innovative easy and enjoyable to learn. You will pass a lot of hours just exploring and looking for secrets and interesting places.Take note that the game is still in alpha and lacks a lot of content. You will probably get around 20 hours before you see everything the game has to offer but the devs seems to be working fast and the game has a lot of potential to become one of the best if not the best space survival around.I totally recomend you to buy it.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-22,0,0,48,True,Recommended,This game is one of the best games I've ever played already and it's only in pre alpha. This game is just beautiful and gameplay is addicting. You can tell the devs really care and the potential this game has is amazing.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-11,0,0,4,True,Recommended,do you and your friend sitting at the computer super bored and have nothing to do? do not wait any longer this is the game for you.This game contains spacevehicles that will go in the opposite direction and get stuck everywhere but do not be afraid because if you try to do something about it you and your spacevehicle wil fly so far away that no one will see you again. and I forgot to say that you are on a nice planet that no one knows anything about. And have you ever been in a pit and then let your buddy bury you? do not do it! you will fall through the ground super slow and then get stuck in a dark cave under the ground and you will probably die because of all the dangerous gases and of course you have only about 20 seconds of oxygen in your oxygen tank so do not go to far from your base otherwise you will die a painful death. and it's fun to play with your friends so buy this game now only 19 99 sorry for my grammar but I'm from Sweden D,ASTRONEER

2017-05-19,0,0,67,True,Recommended,one of the best games in my library. Can't wait to see what's added next.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-19,0,0,31,True,Recommended,In general this game is simply amazing and gorgeous. Even though is still in early access it feels like almost a complete game the developers are constantly working on it and it's pretty amazing what nine people can do. The game has insane amounts of potential and for me right now this is the best game I've ever played about Exploration/Survival. In depth analysis ahead Gameplay The gameplay goes to the fundamentals of survivals you explore and mine resourses so that you can advance and upgrade your equipment and base/s. With simple controls I believe Astroneer brought an innovative way of mining resourses the Deform tool. Your basic tool throught the game that you'll always have. I found very clever the ways in which you can use the tool not just for mining but also creating new paths like bridges tunnels etc. Simple gameplay but very well made and kinda addictive. Graphics In terms of graphics Astroneer didn't went for a reaslistic aproach instead it went for a cartoony/low poly art style which is insanely gorgeous! The lighting effects are really well made and the low poly art looks really crisp and clean doesn't even feel low poly. The appeal for me is the simpleness of the graphics but the way which the devs made a very appeling and beautiful low poly art style is oustanding. Mechanics and Exploration In Astroneer the exploration is Open World which means there are no loading screens which is awsome. There's a limited amount of planets which you can explore but I believe this is for the better because then the game feels like it has a purpose explore all the planets rather than having an enourmous universe you'll never get to explore fully. Even though the World is limited there is a lot to discover just in the first planet that is smply outstanding. The vehicles for exploration are really versatile just with the Rover and Truck you can do a lot of different combinations of vehicles even combining between them. The same case with the Shuttle and Spaceship you can't combine them both but you can do several amounts of combinatins for each of them do you want a shuttle for exploration with just seats for your friends or do you want to do a shuttle with a storage for resourses? Both are posible and even more types of combinations. There could be more vehicles in the future that can bring a lot of diversity but right now even though that it is limited to four it doesn't feel like little. In terms of space traveling your are rigged to go on type of railroad with just the control of point and click for where you want to go but I believe this is for the best because the appeal of the game is planet exploration not space exploration still just watching the shuttle/spaceship move around the planets and landing is awsome. Potential and Final Thoughts This game has just insane potential the fact that this is still a pre alpha that is really well made is incredible. I have for 17 hours worth off gameplay and I think I haven't even explore 5% off this amazing world I know much people don't like to but early access games because it is a risk but for me this risk was really worthwhile. Finally this game will keep growing and becoming one of the best Exploration games of all time.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,31,True,Recommended,For early access pre alpha this game is loaded with features that make it rather enjoyable. It is running great on my current gtx1060/i7 build with very little lag unless I place way too many tethers around. Sure there are some bugs in the code but I'm sure they will sort them out and I will keep coming back to test out the changes. This has quickly become one of my favorite early access games.,ASTRONEER
2017-01-04,0,0,25,True,Recommended,Once I was able to get the game to run I've been enjoying it. It's a lot of fun to shape the surface of a planet and get good at creating bridges and walkways to lower level areas.

2017-02-13,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Fun but not that much content,ASTRONEER
2017-04-16,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Ok I see alot of people giving this game a thumbs down and I can't agree. Strictly because it is in PRE Alpha and they even said so in the game decription so I'm not sure what people are complaining about. Now about my personal opinion it's great. It's amazingly beautiful and fun to play. Now after spending some hours you find yourself at a wall or doing the same thing over and over but that's only because that's what they're testing. I find myself coming back and spending a few days starting over and rebuilding a base over and over because I just enjoy the look and feel of the game. The little guys waving and noises they make are perfect. The inventory and crafting system is unique and actually really enjoyable to use. If you're looking for what NMS should've and could've been this game could be it when it's finished. I've seen some Dev streams and they're doing their best to make a great game and if that takes time then so be it. I'd rather have an amazing game like ASTRONEER in a few years rather than a steaming NMS pile of crap. To people thinking about buying it to play with friends but hesitant about spending the money and having it go to waste nothaving things to do you can do 1 of 2 things. Get it and enjoy the stuff in the game currently or toss it on your wishlist and keep an eye on it because I feel confident enough to say this game is going to be damn near perfect when it is finished.,ASTRONEER

The multiplayer system isn't fully developed but has some fun features. There is too much to explore for better or for worse.

2016-12-26,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,Astroneer is a very good game nice graphics and in the first 10 hrs it's really fun. But there's is no long time motivation. Of course it's not finished yet but an update every 2 months? Sorry but I don't wait this long. The game has potential but you won't play more than 20 hours if you have discovered everything built everything and explored everything. It's too easy to achieve everything. I hope the devs will add many more items and possibilities in the future but yet I won't play it anymore.Even if it has a very nice atmosphere and style it's getting very lame after a short amount of time so I don't recommend you to buy it.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-22,0,0,9,True,Recommended,This game well and truly has the potential to become something great. As it stands right now not so much.I played Minecraft while it was still f2p and in Alpha. To some degree Astroneer feels the same to me now as Minecraft did then. It was unpolished multiplayer was a mess and there were some simple memory drops (performance issues) but look where we got from it.Astroneer is definitely worth a shot if you're into the whole research base building exploring the universe kind of thing although as it stands right now you'll be amazed for about 10 hours untill you realize there is nothing more to explore.I truly hope the developers are looking into what they can do to make this game better and have some sort of vision. Although as it stands right now simply the base aspect of exploring space in the way that Astroneer enables you to that is amazing.I really hope they don't get too caught up in building bases on the ground if it were up to me I would definitely set my eyes to the skies and embrace the stars because that is where Astroneer should be headed. One thing I was hoping to find in my first playthrough was to make a base in space shoot a satellite into orbit which I could definitely see happening considering how the space travelling currently works. (As a side note this was actually an idea I got from seeing a crashed solar panel on the ground it was insanely huge and definitely part of something bigger and considering I was able to hook up my rover in order to charge up power for my next move I think it is definitely something the developers are looking into.)It seems at the moment the developers are a bit caught up in hiring more people and setting up shop in their new office so hopefully they'll get back on track and start releasing more content on a regular basis.TL DR Buy it Enjoy it Wait for future content.,ASTRONEER

2018-02-19,0,0,28,True,Recommended,This is one of the best sandbox games I have ever played. If I have a bad day I can sit down and play Astroneer for an hour and it relaxes me so much. The game is so soothing and enjoyable and is even better with a friend. The enviroment is gorgeous and the player models are adorable. I have taken countless screenshots of the night sky and all the stars or a great sunset. I've been playing since the pre alpha and it has progressed slowly but surely. This game is already amazing and with more updates it could be even better. I highly recommend this game to anyone who was excited about No Man's Sky and was letdown. 10/10,ASTRONEER

2018-02-20,0,0,63,True,Recommended,"Very fun game!! Really enjoyed it! One thing... When the update came out all of my saves were unable to load or they would corrupt. So I had to delete them. And in a new version I think you should be able to lose your Bites for researching. How do they lose the bites if you use them to get something? Does it just magically disappear? I beleive that was a bad update for the corrupt files and the ""Unlimited"" Bites. I hope you realize more often then not people that make a world only have 1 resin farm and like 3 compound farms nearby. It's hard to make a world that is very vibrant and full of items.

2017-03-26,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Its a cool game with neat visuals and it runs pretty smoothly. Not many glitches on more technical details (like oxygen tubes and you explore caves etc.) but like most paid betas it's rather slow developing. My hour count is about as far as you get before hitting the end of game content. Then there's not much else to do. Still a solid buy to support depending on how you feel about supporting betas that are slow on content updates. I think they're mostly expanding their playerbase to consoles and such and it's taking most of their time.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-25,0,0,6,True,Recommended,great game. But unfortunately not ready yet. Not much to do after a couple hours. Wait a year.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-25,0,0,7,True,Recommended,While it's not finished it's still fun for what it is. Honestly the only things holding this back is more content and some way to make the game worth replaying.,ASTRONEER
2017-02-21,0,0,25,True,Recommended,This game is fun. Hear me out The game is fun and magical for the first 3 hour binge session. After that you realize that the game is mailny about farming for resources so you can keep going around the area unless you build a vehicle. (They have infinite Oxygen gen) But if you use your compound to build modules of your base you can run out of compound to keep making tethers and expanding the world. This is an issue the resources are non renewable. If you get this game be considerate of this. The game also has no goal it you never end up going to another planet or anything of the sort. This alone would improve the game 10 fold. This game has a lot of potential 100%. Maybe with better graphics and more straightforward goals it could justify the price. Still reccomend to buy if you're looking for a game that you start playing at 10 am then look up and find out it's 6 pm. If you're looking for a game to play casually 100% pick up this game.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-23,0,0,46,True,Recommended,So far so good!A pretty easy going game that has been fun to figure out survive build watch for storms. Yes it has a way to go until it is complete however I've paid for plenty of pre alpha games that haven't been worth it. This one is.... and I look forward to the feature adds!,ASTRONEER
2017-11-23,0,0,3,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This game honestly is great. Though it s in early access it s still a fun game that I can enjoy to play with friends after a long day at work or to simply play when I m not in the mood to be in full action mode. I m thankful that my friend got me this game when he did because this game is truly a great experience. It s exciting to see what else this game adds in over its time until release.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-24,0,0,143,True,Recommended,This is an amazing game. If you are wondering about buying it then buy it. For $20 I have played this game more than many AAA titles. The game is is Pre Alpha but it is one of those gems you find that you are so glad you did.With constant updates from the developer better intergration between platform and PC to the absolutly beautiful enviroment this is definitly my game of the year already. So many hidden things in this game and you thought you already found everything.,ASTRONEER
2017-11-23,0,0,11,True,Recommended,cool and nice but do not enter vehicles unless you want to phase out of the world and never be seen again. Is much better in multiplayer!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,60,True,Recommended,So on launch Astroneer had a rough start but holy hell if the devs haven't learnt from their community.The devs are incredibly responsive open to ideas suggestions a thriving forum for technical support or artistic suggestions. I've had the game since its first launch its come far and I know it has a way to go but I can sit and play astroneer for hours on end as a time killer.Its charming easy to learn and is just overall really quite nice.

2018-05-14,0,0,63,True,Recommended,This game has always been good but with previous bug issues me and my friends got bored of bugs like flying rovers. The new upddate was extremly needed and is the update this game hadd needed along with the base building update. Overall this game is super fun and I like how you have to work hard and find ways to deal with low resources in the begining of the game. GREAT GAME,ASTRONEER

2018-05-24,0,0,18,True,Recommended,Overall the game is great. Many things to explore and lots to do. However the game is only in alpha (as I'm writing this) thus there are TONS of bugs and weird experiences. Hope the devs can fix these and complete the game.,ASTRONEER

2018-03-11,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is truly amazing and addicting. The only thing that makes me mad is the poor optimization and the fact that you save everytime you sit. Maybe adding a system where you can choose to save whilst in a seat? Other than that amazing game,ASTRONEER
2018-03-11,0,0,21,True,Recommended,The short of it Fun game. It's chill and I like the things you can do.I recommend it overall considering it's in early access if you are up for supporting and playing a game in alpha.I don't recommend it if you're looking for a fully polished and fleshed out experience.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-11,0,0,2,True,Recommended,It is a Good game not the type that I really love. It is very Grindy and takes a long time to advance but it is well made The BaseBuilding Update changed A LOT. There is always something to do and sommething you have to do. My only dislike is the pace of the game which is a slow pickup that really doesn't pick up the pace. But other than that I really reccomend it to people who like space people who like modded minecraft and people who like grinding forever.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-11,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Really enjoying this game i love the look of it and the way it plays i can see so much potential for future updates. Keep up the great work developers.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-11,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Very fun to play with some buddies. Have come across a lot of bugs but playing an early access you should always expect problems.,ASTRONEER
2018-05-25,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Worth the price and more. Grand adventures and wonderful exploration will be had. I am looking forward to more content.,ASTRONEER
2018-04-10,0,0,53,True,Recommended,It has some issues but it's alpha so what can you expect. I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs and I really enjoy the gameplay. It's a drop in play a little drop out kind of game at least it can be if you don't have much time at hand to play it. It lacks more content to extend it's playability and is focused mainly at exploration but that's done quite impressively. The only thing that botters me is vehicle handling it's attrocious you can't drive forward or back and turn like in other games it's like driving a howercraft and pressing the directions relatively to your view but with wheels on the howercraft which interfere with terrain obviously. Well on the other hand I see why they made driving like this. The terrain is realy bumpy and your vehicles would get stuck on it. But I realy hope they change this in the future. I do recommend it though you can get past driving and it's a really good game behind it.Edit The vehicle handling was changed (repaired) now it's fun and controllable. Can't find anything to complain about I love the direction the game is going!,ASTRONEER
2018-02-27,0,0,25,True,Recommended,"I'm gooing to start this review by sayng what I said after 30 monutes of playing it. ""Holy what a soothing game""I'm working under high stress to complete my thesis and god every time I play it I become calm I just escape for an hour or two (often two) and just explore caves listen to the music or gather those weird little things that get you bits to build Alright it gets repetitive after a while. I'll grant you that.But understand this this isn't a game you grind. You don't spend hours on it.This is a game you play with your cup of coffee in the morning before going to work. This is a game you play when you come home wasted from a party and can't sleep. This game is the shell I get back into when things in my life become unbearable.

2018-03-12,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Fantastic example of how to do Early Access right! The devs are actively involved in improving the game which runs really well and is a blast to play solo or with friends.The only negative that I have regarding the game itself is minor please be aware that Steam users cannot play multiplayer with Windows/Xbox users. The product description is somewhat lacking in this regards. If you want multiplayer you either need to all be Steam users or Windows/Xbox users. I made this mistake and ended up having to purchase the game twice.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-01,0,0,15,True,Recommended,its good but it lacks much content right now. Has potential,ASTRONEER
2018-03-01,0,0,164,True,Recommended,Astroneer is alright prolly 6/10? Music is good game play is entertaining. I've uninstalled it after the latest patch probably never play it again. They changed the simple click to activate machinery menus to Hold either Q or E if you click wrong you risk popping the box off the platform which tosses anything it's hold off into the general vicinity. Also digging in caves is noisy as hell now. It's loud and it echos. Turned all the volumes to 0 saved and still hear nothing but that sound. It's an alright game and I have very little issue with getting away from the simple click to activate machinery but jesus christ... The sound while digging in a cave is obnoxious.I'm sure that will get fixed I recommend the game it's just very short on content at the moment.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-27,0,0,135,True,Recommended,Bought this game and already love it.You can build mountains or sculpt the ones you find. Dig into the center of the planets you are on or build into the sky.A lot of things to explore and build great relaxing music as well as game play.... starting out anyway.There are so many things that will keep your attention and keep you going for more!Bought this game as a time waster and I can already see it is going to be a huge success! D Pffttt... and everyone says new space games are a waste of time. Different take on space exploration and a great way to get your space exploration building and mining fix!Overview You start out being blasted onto a planet with nothing more than a tool that helps you excavate and recreate. You have to find resources and craft things to aid you in your exploration of not just the planet you are on but many many many others.Graphics Amazing especially for a voxel world.Game play Only 1.6 hours into it but so far I'd give it a 2 thumbs up.Music RelaxingStory There isn't one yetIf you love to build random things or just like to explore stunning worlds then you will have fun in this game. I bought it on Humble Bundle and it was well worth it for the $14 I spent on it.EDIT 4 hours game playCaves are full of surprises... from wonder to danger. There is a lot to find and a lot to explore. Dig deeper and deeper the more you find the more you want to dig down more.EDIT 27 Hours of Game play 3 new saves and 1 multiplayer game with a friend... I am blown away by how awesome this game is. I am sure it will bring many more hours of play time and fun!!!hands down one of the best games I have ever played and that is saying something since I have over 600 of them on steam alone.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-02,0,0,60,True,Recommended,If you like playing sandbox survival games this game is FOR YOU. Although currently it's still in its Alpha phase this game is amazing. And by amazing I mean completely STELLAR (haha see what I did there? Stellar? Space? Haha). The game is extremely cool there are so many features that are so complex yet so easy to use. You can design everything to your taste and do what you want to do. But since it's still in its Alpha stage there are a few graphics and lag problems. Aside from that the gameplay is just fantastic. Everything about it can be explored more and more. All the cool little details are there and I can see more and more popping up in the full release. If there is this much awesomeness in the Alpha version I see so much more (and I mean A LOT MORE) potention in this game in its full version. My recommendation? BUY THIS GAME.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-12,0,0,309,True,Recommended,I haven't poured too much time into this game. I used to have a computer that could barely play this game. Even when i was playing with about 5 frames per second I gave 30 hours to this game. When the basebuilding update came out I happened to get a new pc. Astroneer is so easy to learn and so simple. The way that this game progresses is amazing. When you're running out of compound you need to go and explore. But wait you need more tethers! Guess you have to go out without tethers and hope you make it back safe.Overall I give this game 9/10. Only suggestion is servers where you can play with others with either peaceful teamwork or friends and foes where nobody is safe.,ASTRONEER

2018-03-15,0,0,42,True,Recommended,For an early access game it is the most enjoyable SciFi space game I have ever played. The Devs continue to add new features that add more depth to the game with every update. If you like a good survival game in space than I recomend this game to you. It is 100% worth the cost.,ASTRONEER

2018-03-13,0,0,69,True,Recommended,It's a cute early access space exploration game with some survival aspects already including power and oxygen. You need to collect materials to craft tools to help you survive longer such as an oxygen tank or tethers which extend your starting habitat's internal power/oxygen supply. You find medium/large objects in the world that you can research to obtain 'bytes' which are used to unlock upgraded tools and buildings.Overall the concept is fun especially being able to drop in and out of friends games as you wish. While there are a fair amount of bugs it's still in early alpha stages so I expect lots of improvements in the future. I would recommend picking up on sale if you liked the idea of No Man's Sky Star Citizen etc. but wanna just have some casual fun.,ASTRONEER

Its still hard to figure out and it has lost an important part of the team to death but I still thought it was better and worth 30 hours of play if not more. They don't put a lot of effort into good tutorials in these early access games and this one is like that. Took me awhile to figure out but exploring is fun and mind boggling because of the style. Crafting and gathering is fun. Building with the tool is kind of limited but still interesting. I'd say its a 3.5 out of 5 game and worth buying. Not the best game you'll play but one you won't forget. As usual I haven't even tried multiplayer.",ASTRONEER

2018-06-25,0,0,1629,True,Recommended,Amazingly addicting beautiful simple visuals! The sound track and ambient random sounds make for great atmosphere. Well designed fun system no HUD. Just you the planet and whatever you put in between. Terraforming base building cave diving mountain climbing planet hopping mobile base creation. The main objective for now is building a base on each planet and exploring like crazy. It's early access so I don't get why people are complaining about not having enough to do. They don't read the news updates for an unfinished game but they have an opinion just silly please ignore them. There is a lot more coming check out the E3 release and trello roadmap for more info but remember that teasers aren't far from spoilers. Many updates are set to drop between now and the 1.0 release and future content after the release is going to be free according to the Devs. Sometimes the updates kill your saves and yes the game is still a little glitchy sometimes.I think $20 is more than a fair price even If you do get bored after 10 or 20 hours. Part of the fun for now is creating your own challenges and objectives like making beacon rings around your planets tunneling to the planets core etc. and fine tuning your skills for the big 1.0 release thats being kept secret. My motto is There's always something else to do waiting for one thing means time to do something else. Build a monster base be an astronaut or a gypsy! Don't wait around for guns and stuff to kill the Devs already said it's not that kind of game. Eating drinking and sleeping also aren't going to be part of the game according to Devs.Big landscapes mountain ranges crazy caves and giant caverns to explore. I spend a lot of time fine tuning base building trying out different ways of exploring. There is a lot to research and build and more to come! I can't wait for character customization!,ASTRONEER
2018-07-19,0,0,122,True,Recommended,English version Really love this game more fun when you co op. There is one more thing i don't like about this game Multiplayer (Online co op) is very bad and when you are host you may get dropped fps (others will encounter some bugs). Vietnamese Tôi rất thích game này đồ họa khá ổn lối chơi hay rất vui nếu chơi cùng nhiều người (tối đa 4 1 người host). Tuy nhiên game vẫn còn 1 số lỗi đặc biệt chỉ xuất hiện khi chơi co op Người làm host sẽ bị tụt dần fps theo thời gian nhưng người join cùng đôi lúc sẽ gặp mội vài lỗi như không hiển thị một vài vật thể. Nếu sửa được những lỗi này thì game thực sự hoàn hảo. Dù sao với mình nó vẫn rất đáng mua.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-12,0,0,14,True,Recommended,TL DR This is a very fun game with a lot of potential just needs a little more content and polishing.Played this game with one other person and had a lot of fun although in its current state only has about 10 15 hours of content if you do everything there is to do. There were some bugs that were apparently introduced into the game last patch such as only the host player being able to do certain things (manageable just slightly annoying) and the joined player in a game not seeing backpack crafting recipes. Having multiple planets to visit kept the game fresh a little longer but for the most part you didn't really NEED to ever visit a planet other than the starting one (with the starting planet resources you can build everything you need in the game). There was a little variance in hostile enemies on different planets but for the most part you never needed to wory about them.Suggestions 1.)need more uses for titanium and more things to build in general (i'm sure this is in the works)2.)unique resources for each planet with important uses making traveling/setting up bases there important3.)adding to the last one maybe an unmanned shuttle to send materials back to the main base4.)easier way to bring research and salvage back to the base was thinking maybe some sort of rover wagon that attaches to the player and can be dagged around and holds 2 4 research or salvages pieces (maybe different tiers of wagons) and slows the player down just like if you carried one research/salvage maybe make it so carrying a single one doesn't slow you down5.)special unique areas with special loot for example one filled with the ceiling grabbers and a ceiling too high to just break them so you'd have to dodge the tentacles,ASTRONEER

2018-03-03,0,0,133,True,Recommended,No man sky meets Minecraft but more fun. This game is a refreshing title in a time where every game announcement is a battle royal hyper competitive action game. Graphically its unique and appropriate. It's deep enough to keep you playing for a long periods of time. I find myself struggling to stop exploring and expanding my base. It's deep but not overwhelming like mincraft can be. It has a perfect balance of resource collection and customization.Highly recommend!,ASTRONEER

2018-01-19,0,0,17,True,Recommended,TLDR Good game expect bugs and glitches but an overall experience that is calming and relaxing that I keep coming back to due to the active devs. If its on sale its a must buy.If you like to watch a video version of this video you can find it here.OverviewAstroneer is a $20 game which fortunately a friend bought me. The price of this game is not justified compared to other games you can play for $20 in terms of receiving a polished product. That being said I would look at this game not as a ready to play product but rather an experience. As of this review I have logged in close to 14 hours but I don't plan on adding to that number anytime soon. The developers tend to prefer small changes as opposed to larger patches. Returning to this game to find many changes made is refreshing which is why I tend to return to this game periodically to note all the developments made. I was hesitant to review this game because of its unfinished state but I really wanted to explain how this game is different from others in the early access program and why it is worth at least a look into.OK THIS GAME IS PRETTY WONKY. Do not expect everything to work 100% of the time. Astroneer has this certain charm. The anger you feel for this game could be directed at a small puppy or an angry ex. At times when it messes up you can't help but laugh and start over but at times after you've put in all this effort into mining and gathering materials only to fall into a pit and die. GameplayWhen the gameplay does work its is really a unique experience the building/excavator tool in this game provides a whole new depth to the world as you aren't forced to react to events statically you can build a shelter or dig a whole. You mold the world into your needs which adds a dimension of satisfaction. Can't reach a mineral because it's across a trench? Build a bridge across. Gathering materials is this risky adventure. It seems mundae but in this game it becomes a risk vs reward situation. Should you go grab that extra copper you see or turn back now with all materials you have collected? The only major problem with the game is the end game there is none. Once you have amassed enough materials you are free to take your spaceship to another planet only to start the process all over again. I would like to see this concept expanded upon What if the planets you visit next belong to another player who has made their planet open to exploration? What if there was enough players on a planet that resources become extremely valuable and tradable. I know these are concepts that are really out there especially for an indie dev company but it would be really amazing to see this game progress that far. It will also be interesting to see how they keep the game simple and still attempt to keep the players attention.FeaturesThere is a really cool oxygen and energy system that forces players to get creative. Your space ship can have tethers attached to it which provide a line of oxygen to the player. The more tethers you chain together the further you can explore while still having an oxygen supply. Power is also derived from your spaceship which can be produced by generators solar panels and windmills. Power is supplied so long as you are hooked onto a tether. What this means is your rate of exploration is severely limited by how creatively you use your resources. It sort of works in a loop the more you explore the better gear you can make which leads to more and faster exploration. Atmosphere and PacingThe pace of this game is very relaxing. Currently there are no mobs in the game and the only things that have killed me so far have been sandstorms toxic gases pitfalls and major bugs. And usually major bugs lead to pitfalls so I guess there's not too many options there. Astroneer provides this relaxing gameplay but still manages an initially addicting sense of progression. This game is fun to play with friends or by yourself it is not really dependent on external factors for entertainment like some many other games are. However you will eventually find the pace of the game to become boring and strungout. The tasks you complete are extremely repetitive and while there is the aforementioned resource management it's not complicated and comparatively lands below games like Minecraft or Terraria. Anyone looking for a similar experience to those games will be sorely disappointed. Astroneer is a game designed to be a non competitive experience. A pure game which is why there are no mobs in the world. While it would make the game more interesting mobs within the game would just create panic. And I get the sense that System Era aren t really going for that vibe.GraphicsSo it goes without saying a game doesn t need realistic graphics to be beautiful and Astroneer does a great job of portraying this. Many indie developers are in a budget constraint for assets and it really provides them with an opportunity to be creative and make do with what they have. This game consistently looks pretty. Whether it be tunneling deep down in a cave or running tethers across a bare plain this game has got me in awe. The color choice in this game is really amazing and vibrant at times and dull and melancholic during others. The vibrant tones can clash hard with the somber musical melodies that are accomied in the game. While such a sharp contrast would not suit most situations in Astroneer it adds this mysterious almost eerie feeling. In a huge world it makes the player feel... small.Should you buy this game?Astroneer is a game that needs polish. However its core mechanics and design are very attractive so attractive that I believe that it suits the $20 price tag. While there isn t much depth to the game story wise there is a certain atmosphere that this game builds that I really don t find in other games. It treats itself so casually but once the player starts to explore the word and becomes immersed you start to realize just how lonely it is especially you are playing the single player. Maybe that's the point of the game maybe that's the only goal of the game. To make you realize that no matter how much you do there is still more to discover. That is till you reach the end game. Would I purchase Astroneer if I was you? Yes but maybe wait till there is sale.Pros+ Active Devs+ Simple Yet Beautiful Graphics+ Complimenting Soundtrack+ Initially Addicting Gameplay+ Fun with friends or Solo+ Much to Explore (But can feel hollow at times)+ Moldable Environment+ Lot of mechanics available for the player to explore+ Casual and Relaxing gameCons Lacking a good End Game Can become grindy past the mid game Can feel slow paced compared to other games Bugs and Glitches are apparent Little variety in Environmental Hazards,ASTRONEER

Looking Through The Negitive Reveiws I See Theres A Ton Of Complaint With The Controlling Of The Rovers And Some Promblems With The Interaction Buttons Which Really I Don't Mind The Problem... I'm Used To These Kinda Buggy Controls By Now I Know To Look For The Text Promt To Know What I'm Doing... I Know To Hold The Interaction Key... Ect Though I Can't Really Say It's Bad Controls It's Just ""Differnt"" It Seems Wrong That People Gave This Game A Poor Reveiw Due To The Controls They Can't Get Used To But.

These Bugs I've Found Are Not ""GAME ENDDING PROBLEMS FIX YOUR DEVS"" Nor Are They A Pain It's Early Access I'm Alright With Such Problems As Long As The Devs Care ( Which They Do ) To Fix The Problems When They Can But More Importently To Keep This Game Growwing...Now The Big Talk Of A ""Story"" To Astoneer Thats Not Somthing This Game Needs. I Mean If You Want Story Try ""Subnautica"" (#SPON) Or Somthing ( I Won't Go Into Detail This Is For Astroneer ) But This Game I Feel Is Wonderful With Or Without A Story Line ( But Incase Thats Not Enough For You Check One Of The Other 1 000s Of Suggestions/Reveiws To See Their POV On A Story ) If The Devs Wanna Make A Game Thats Been About Making A Base On All The Planets Zoomin' Around Orbits And Crusing Terrain In A Rover Then Hey. I Say They Go For It But It's Just Not Nessasary For This Sandbox/Exploration Game...

Overall there is very little content. I jump on every now and then but it's still essentially the same game as when I bought it. I can't recommend it in it's current state.

2018-04-03,0,0,105,True,Recommended,I am so engrossed in this game ! The sense of adventure is truly amazing for example I ve spent many hours building my base and finding things to research just with the terraan island and it s moon barren. There are like 5 other planets I have yet to explore and I can t wait until I m advanced enough to venture there and acquire all the resources. This game is something that everyone should give a go. There are new updates often as it s still in development and the game has been greatly improved through the recent base building update.,ASTRONEER

Overal this game is really fun and you dont need a itense gaming rig to play meanin i can use my laptop or my rig and evel allow my friends to sign in with my laptop and enable us to play together.Though for some reason on my gaming rig it has a really bad motion blur and bad FPS and the graphics settings only do so much.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-21,0,0,31,True,Recommended,"No refunds required here. Best Pre Alpha EverThis is what all Early Access games should be like. A joy to play and test. I'm not going to sit here and say it's perfect of course it's not the driving physics and control method leave much to be desired. But what the hell? You're on an uninhabited planet in a vast uncompromising (except for when it compromises.... usually with compond) universe. So the physics are going to be funky.I didn't hate No Man's Sky... at all. I just got bored of it. But this is not that game... nor is it ""Minecraft in Space"". This is a world unto itself that continues to engage me after almost constant play for 2 days and too many hilarious and infuriating deaths to count (suffocates 1 step from tether line.... falls to death while tunnelling through a mountain.... gets killed by a flying research item 3 steps from shelter during a dust storm)11/10 Would go in search of ""Compound"" again",ASTRONEER
2017-01-21,0,0,44,True,Recommended,This game is incredible for a pre alpha version. it still has some bugs that makes the game frustrating but other than that the game is amazing. It isnt very customizable but it makes up in map content. I do reccomend this game but if you're thinking on buying it now wait a little bit to see what the developers put into the game. If all they do is add more worlds(maps) then dont buy. but if they add more base building and vehicle content it will be well worth the money.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-21,0,0,17,True,Recommended,A cartoonish game in which you can mess around with voxels. It has few options in terms of building and might even lack a bit of content (again in terms of building) but the game itself is a creative masterpiece. I have personally not come across any bugs or performance issues so far but I feel that the game is easy to master and hard to forget. You can't expect that you will be shoving as much time and effort into this game as you would an MMORPG but you can expect to want to launch it randomly throughout your life whenever you see the title or logo. As odd as it may sound it's worth buying even if you only play for a few days or hours.,ASTRONEER

2018-09-02,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I came back to the game after quite a while of not playing it. I have to say after the updates this game is now a very different experience from what it was a year ago. Although there are still tons of bugs and some performance issues the game has a very promising future. Currently there indeed aren't much to do after you explore all the planet types. But to be fair it is a 20 dollar game and I think it is already worth the price not to mention more content will be added in the future.By the way really hope the next update include repacking unpacked modules... I accidentally unpacked several modules on rovers instead of platforms and now it's a huge pain to move them around the base.一年没玩之后回归 游戏真的变化挺大的 说明工作室还挺靠谱 现在游戏内容还不算太多 基本上所有星球类型探一遍也就没了 bug比一开始少了很多 但还是偶尔会影响体验 总的来说国区68真的挺值的 看个电影的钱可以玩至少20 30个小时,ASTRONEER

Most people do not figure out how it works. So indeed my first 15 minutes were literally helplessness since I did not know what I was meant to do. Then I realized that F1 not only shows you ""the newest features"" but basically tells you how to play. Maybe some sort of tutorial would be great or at least some pinpointer with text telling you like ""get some cargo"" ""unpack this sh*t"" ""check out what it can build"" ""place this sh*t"" ""plug this sh*t into the base"" etc. Or getting some notification that tell you why things happen like ""Oh your base has a power problem. You should somehow get more power."" Give the player some hits what he is actually searching for. This would definitely short cut the part where most players are just to bored to explore everything. I only found out about the terrain flattener by scanning the keyboard shortcuts and I had problems finding the things I can get with my bytes.

2016-12-27,0,0,67,True,Recommended,I honestly came into this game with low expectations. I saw the E3 demo and thought it looked ok but didn't think mutch of it. Fast foward a couple of months and me and my friend decide to both buy this at the same time. And holy it blew us away how the game was played and looked. It destroyed both his and my expectations and left us in awe of how much fun it was. Now imagine if No Man's Sky was good. That's this game an amazing expierience from when we started to when we eneded. The only complaints that we had during our game was the lack of a tutorial. We of course don't want to spoonfed the content with directions on how to do everything (that would be boring!) just a bit more directions other than basic controls. For example the game never tells you that the ending hubs can't be added on to. We didn't know that and it ended our first base. Other than that and minor performace issues They could release this game right now and I would be happy.Edit Now that i have played a bit more of the game I have to say that I think that they release the pre alpha just a BIT to early. By the time they release a majority of the hype around this game will be gone.,ASTRONEER

Havonta egy két frissités érkezik ami egy korai hozzáféréses játéknál elengedhetetlen. A játék maga nagyon izgalmas tele van lehetőségekkel felfedezhető területekkel/dolgokkal. Azoknak ajánlanám akiket érdekel a felfedezés kaland. Van még vele bőven munka de egy nagyon jó játék sülhet ki belőle.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-24,0,0,5,True,Recommended,So much potential in this game excited for the launch hope they keep working and adding to it. It is in Early acess and not aton to do but im excited for the full game this december. Worth a buy with friends! The only thing to make the game better is add more to it. Thise could end up being what No Mans Sky was supposed to be. I think adding enimies in creative ways would make this game a for sure sell. Adding more to the base building and adding different threats like weather plants and hopefully eventually other life forms to the worlds would make this game perfect. Also as it stands right now theres no clear end goal so maybe there is a big potential for something creative there too. Love the game just needs more to it which its coming and im excited the game deserves support and appreciation so it can build its self up at launch.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-25,0,0,63,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a really fun game especially when you play with other people. The game is simple relaxing and peaceful with active developers who consistently add new content. The game design and gameplay is simple yet it doesn't get boring with all of the stuff you can do. I get satisfied just exploring the planet I'm on and there's so much more to do. You can create portable bases on top of rovers attach thrusters and making a speedy mobile and even create awesome bases with a huge amount of customizability. When I first bought the game I wished it was slightly cheaper as $20 is normally the threshold for casual gamers when buying games so the $25 mark was slightly over budget but after a couple months I finally got it and with all of the new content added since I bought it I would say that the money was definietely worth it.,ASTRONEER
2018-07-27,0,0,69,True,Recommended,Great game Only problem is the game is very limited to what you can do Once you have a base setup and you have tons of research there's basically nothing left to do. You can travel to a different planet But there's nothing new except the terrain (No new research items etc). But then again this game is still in beta and new things may be added in the future I'd definitely recommend buying this game It's a lot of fun.,ASTRONEER

2018-02-13,0,0,28,True,Recommended,I got ASTRONEER a little over a year ago and I can say without a doubt that it's one of my favorite games ever. The gameplay is fun and with continuous updates you can count on new things being added. There isn't exactly a way to beat the game however the feeling of finally getting your first vehicle or going to another planet is awesome. You do have to keep in mind the game is in an alpha stage so there WILL be bugs and glitches all games have them. With the constant updates the bugs are fixed almost as soon as they come out. My personal favorite thing about the game is the multiplayer function by pressing Shift + Tab you can open a menu and invite friends into your world and play together. Overall there are few down sides however with the ever expanding community and new things being added all the time this game is one of the best.,ASTRONEER
2018-02-13,0,0,61,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER is a fun andexsiting way to spend time to have the best expirence you need friends that also have the game as i would recomend i also recomend trying glitches to push teh game to its limets and try and find the more rarer items (easter eggs) you will not be let down. sincerly Cooper,ASTRONEER

2018-07-28,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Before I start people have to understand that this is just an ALPHA so far!Seen SO MANY reviews saying not enough content bad graphics and very buggy considering when you start up the game it even states that you can submit issues and bugs through a given website.I like this game only 9.1 hrs on record while writing this but I have enjoyed it so much it's nice because there is no stress to it you can progress at your own rate.I have been playing it Co op mode and we found that we rushed it because we wanted all the tech once we thought about it we found we could have multiple bases solar farms a fleet of vehicles the list can be endless.There is obviously going to be a lot more content and stuff to this game and I'm hoping more possible enemies as gas firing plants seems to be a bit weak.I would recommend this game if you want something to take you away from the stress of MMORPG or MMOFPS it's pure chill.Enjoy,ASTRONEER

2018-02-21,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Im about 24 hours into the game now and Im absouletly loving it. It takes a little while to get going but its a super fun learning experience. You start on a planet explore that expand your base and explore other planets. Currently the game has 5 or 6 planets but that really seems like alot with the fact that Im 24 hours in and only gone to the moon. Unlike most survival games its not an anoying grind every material does something and the new bytes system gives you a reason to keep playing.,ASTRONEER

2017-04-22,0,0,153,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. It looks good runs decently although don't expect 60fps on high is you don't have a decent gpu. The gameplay is amazing. I can spend hours on end in this game. The big updates have somewhat slowed down you get a big update once every 1 2 months but they are always full of content and bug fixes. Conclusion this game is definitely worth the money and is constantly evolving so you won't get easily bored.Old review If somebody tells you this game is buggy you can trust them HOWEVER first its an indie game second its still in PRE alpha. Its not even an official game yet. Its an amazing game with a very good concept. The community is as alive as ever and ive not seen a week pass without an update. On my setup (hd 6570 2gb from sapphire and a fx 8350 a 4ghz 8 core) it runs at 20 fps but feels very smooth. Also perfomance has gone up a lot the past updates. Older reviews may say it runs very poorly but if they are older then a month the performance has probably gone way up in the meantime. All and all if you have the money or you are looking for a game you can spend hours on end on go for it. You wont regret it.,ASTRONEER

2018-02-22,0,0,595,True,Recommended,Astroneer plays really well but doesn't entirely deliver. With the platform patch promised for today (but still not dropped) I'm hoping to see the playtime extended with some new content.The graphics are awesome and the controls are really smooth as well. I play on a PC not console IMO this game would be hell on console but that's just me (die hard PC gamer I'm afraid). They do get clunky jumping in &amp out of rovers (which saves the game).Where it fails are in places that I have to keep reminding myself that this is an alpha game The rovers come with a learning curve (tip when wanting to drive them make sure your view is directly BEHIND. If you're backing up make sure your view is from the FRONT) and takes some getting used to. They still drive like a drunk albatross but considering how difficult they were before they've been vastly improved and it shows.Your carefully collected resources have a bad habit of floating off in to space (as do rovers but they're retrievable with a sky bridge) or worse falling through the planet to who knows where. It's a really bad glitch and is serious enough that it has made me have to delete and start over.I've been playing since the game came out (maybe a few weeks after) and my first huge disappointment with it is content. Once I figured the game out (there were some world deletions there especially as I had a habit of stranding myself on planets) from start to finish it only took me several hours to get a base built on every planet. I kinda like a game with an end (unless it's an MMO which this is not) and there is no end here. I just kinda went 'Hunh. Soooo... now what?' And quit playing for a few months until something new pops up.Then the patch came out and they gutted how resources work. HIGHLY love this update as I'm not in early pre rover stage and getting something useless. Now I can choose.But I feel like this new research is a bit of a cop out. They've extended play time by making research take for freaking ever depending on how much power you have going through your base and even then it only goes so fast. They didn't extend the content just stretched it out for eons. Luckily you can throw research in leave the game running and go find something else to do for 30 minutes like laundry.I'm greatly looking forward to the base update (today or so we're promised... still waiting!) to see what the devo gods have spewed forth upon us mere mortals. Would I recommend this game? At the price it's at now yes. Highly. I'm really looking forward to seeing where this game goes in the future and really hope they extend the game play both on &amp off planet.If it stays as it is now (just colonizing planets?) it's blech.,ASTRONEER

2018-05-08,0,0,101,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER is a genuinely fun yet also relaxing game. I've spent hours building bases slowly crawling along the map marking points of interest farming materials and just exploring a simple yet very pretty world.This being said this game is not perfect. As expected with early access games there are many irritating bugs and issues. I've had vehicles fly randomly into the air and become unusable too many tethers have caused my game to freeze or crash and spending hours building giant walls around my base proved useless to prevent wind. But still I do love this game and recommend it completely.,ASTRONEER

2018-02-22,0,0,53,True,Recommended,ALPHA REVIEW So far a great title that sets itself apart from many other Indi games out there not in the 'craft build survive' sense but in an artistic and immersive way. Bugs are plentiful of course but this is to be expected from any title in its alpha stage. Updates come out for Astroneer around every 1 to 2 months from what I have observed recently and every update pulls me back into its ever evolving worldOverall it is a great game and it will get greater with every update. If you want an early access title that promises to keep evolving and changing then Astroneer is a great title that is worth your money!,ASTRONEER

And they are transparent and give frequent vlog updates about WIP features. I would reccomend this game just on that. The most recent update the Base building Update was fantastic the biggest update yet. It introduced a lot of new things to the game. And brings us one update closer to launch ),ASTRONEER

2018-01-20,0,0,133,True,Recommended,So much fun! You have to become zen with the bugs and glitches. Rovers are particularly perilous and most of the surfaces are only suggestions not actual barriers to other objects which just leads to hilarious superpositions. My family has spent hours and hours exploring the solar system and are ready for new research items!,ASTRONEER
2017-05-06,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Firstly image mindcraft. now add no man sky and the un pixelated version of mindcraft and booom you have astoneer! lol.. its a farming game with plenty potential and loads of fun in 2 ways. so that is why I am going to break this down in 2 reviews First one being. The multiplay. anyone at any one time can join your game.So the game goes alot faster and gets fun faster when you get through the basics of establishing your base. when you land on the planet hunting for the upgrades becomes alot easier with a friend and in doing so makes the game go better in the short term. trust me you want to jump in and out of planets and start new ones when you can and if you made mistakes with your digging etc.. its cool though each new start gives you a different planet colouring and style and layout. the tunnels underneath vary between each new game you make too so once you find the perfect tunneling near your habitat (home/rocket) dont play around with it too much. just build yourself to get ready for making an underground network once you have unlocked the habitat upgrade from the shells.once you get yourself a habitat and a decent tunnel network underground the potential of farming is unlimited!! and becomes more fun and faster to gather resources.the 2nd part of my review is. Playing by yourself.well unlike playing with a mate. the game goes alot slower and can potentially become boring fast if you dont have a good strategy. so i suggest you turn on your music and play it as if you are guna play for 5 hours or so. because its a grind. but becomes fun once you have sorted out your oxygen and power supply. On top of all this . the game is a typical grinding game which means all your doing is gathering resources to expand your base networks and also gives you the chance to unlock a rocketship to travel to a different part of the planet which you can start a new game within your own game... very handy when you want to start fresh but still keep your old network at your original base.fun game for people with an open mind. not a game you want to play when emotional or not happy.. definately a chill out game and mellow gameplay.,ASTRONEER

I see many people talk about how de developers kinda stopped stopped making updates and I disagree the devs share much information of the progress and are hiring many new people to develop the game further.

I personally wouldn't want to spend lots of time on the game for singleplayer gets quite repetitive after some time.

2017-08-11,0,0,18,True,Recommended,I can honestly say ASTRONEER is a great game and that I highly recommend it. BUT...That said it there is not much content but what there is core gameplay with smooth controls and few (if any) glitches. The developers are also active and releases new content steadily but this is also here where the catch is. They rarely release new content as in new object and tools . But instead they realises updates that are stable reliable and improve upon the core gameplayunlike most other developers in this age of cash grabbing pre releases.And if you really want to follow the progress the even post regular blogs/videos about the progress in the studio/office on YouTube System EraSo to sum it up Core gameplay not really any content.Edit I have just played it again after almost a year a lot has changed but not much new to find. Still it's a great game were you find yourself spending 12 hours straight playing only to ignore it for a year again. Great fun when it feels new not so much once you have tried it all.,ASTRONEER

2017-08-07,0,0,1,True,Recommended,Update! this game hasnt received an update for 7 months with game changing content. this disproves the the fact that they wont use an excuse like ARK's developers. i really hope i am not right on this... At least No Man's Sky has been getting huge updates lately...end of update.This is a great game! And no you cant compare it to no man's sky. not because this game is better. because they are different. Anyways off track this game is still on early access but its not anything like ARK which the developers have an excuse for the bugs! The game is not even in alpha yet and its ing great! the developers keep making HUGE updates! I really recomend this game especially if you have friends you can play together because this game also offers a great and fun multiplayer experience!,ASTRONEER
2017-09-23,0,0,14,True,Recommended,I love base building games where I dont have to focus on combat constantly. I've played many different games solo and with friends and while many are great there are only 2 that keep me coming back for more and that is Astroneer and The Forest. To me they are different sides of the same coin and both are defintly worth the play. I played this for a few hours when I first got it but it was extremely choppy and laggy and had bad framerate all because of my laptop I have to play on. However they have had a few updates since I last really played and I tested it out again to find everything has been polished alot more and runs much smoother! I can finally sit down and really get into this game now and to me that alone is worth my time. This is probably going to become one of my biggest titles I'll play between classes on campus since its so relaxed calm and goes at whatever pace I wish.

2017-07-29,0,0,30,True,Recommended,I would like to put animals to tame to help you in your adventure to save you from the plants to climb on the walls to carry the weight to dig or to obtain strange materials. You could take them in the car or the spacecraft and keep them in the den. I tried the new update and it has many bugs you can see underground and there are caves that I had explored and have completely changed. I would also like to be able to connect with people like a server,ASTRONEER

2017-12-07,0,0,131,True,Recommended,An amazing calm and relaxed space game with a small survival element. Unique art style and hardly any bugs in early access less than a lot of AAA games. As an aspiring aerospace engineer this game is perfect for when I have some down time to have fun with friends in co op. I would reccomend this game to anyone!,ASTRONEER

2017-12-07,0,0,38,True,Recommended,I bought this game whene it was at square 1. Now it has been updated and optimized like crazy. I used to only be able to run this game at 30 40 fps becasue it was poorly optimized when it came out. Now I run it at a solid 60 fps. The dev really care for this game and it shows. I strongly recommend this game if you want to have very relaxing fun by yourself or with friends!,ASTRONEER
2017-11-05,0,0,537,True,Recommended,I come back to this game again and again because it is so relaxing. A bit too much focus on mining for now but there s lots of potential in the game for exploration and discovery. Rovers are pretty stable now and there are not too many glitches.

2018-03-23,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Lots of people say that this has no replay value that it becomes boring after 20 30 hours or so (even if you only play it for 20 hours thats $1 an hour a hell of a price) and what they say has some validity to it. However as you can see I have 140 hours in this game as of writing this review. The developers have so much passion for this game they love the community and they keep releasing great updates. They are all unbelievably skilled and they have crafted not only the most well made game I have ever seen/played but also the most gorgeous. Of course there are bugs and some slightly broken gameplay loops but for god's sake it's called early access for a reason. If I had the funds I would easily buy this game for every single person that I know who I haven't already convinced to get it. If you like beautiful incredibly fun games that are still evolving and that the community has a huge voice in the development of get this one.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-23,0,0,68,True,Not Recommended,The controls are TRASH!! Hold the RMB to move the camera and the LMB to use the multi tool but you can't use them at the same time! It's like cleaning up salt one grain at a time.,ASTRONEER

2018-04-04,0,0,11,True,Recommended,"I went into this with ""meh"" expectations. The first 15 30 minutes are kind of slow as you start to learn more about the game I almost quit because I didn't understand some of the terrain altering controls and the items required to do so. Once I figured that out I was good to go.After playing almost 6 straight hours with some friends I can say that this game is immensely fun for something thats only in Alpha. I've seen ""fully"" released games with less content and triple the price.Speaking of it being in Alpha there are definetly bugs but I haven't encountered anything game breaking yet. The one bug I commonly encounter is when entering your homebase sometimes I get stuck but after reentering and exiting a few times it corrects itself.My biggest complaint so far is the vehicle controls(using KB+M). Whenever you're driving the controls change directions as you rotate the camera which is horrid. I didn't see an option to disable this in the settings but I could have overlooked it.Overall I enjoy this game especially with my friends. I highly recommend it and can't wait to see what else they add to it as it goes to beta and eventually full release(lol).",ASTRONEER
2018-03-18,0,0,63,True,Recommended,This game is awesome.... Until you acquire the game breaking bug that causes you to not be able to interact with the world. I was able to verify that this issue has been reported since AT LEAST mid 2017. I found a dead astroneer pulled up his backpack grabbed an object off it then my backpack and his sort of flashed and i could no longer place the object on any socket in the game. Cant get in my vehicle that is like 200 meters under the surface cant repower the organic generators with all the organic i came supplied with Cant even place a newly gathered power brick on the vehicle to charge it. It should be noted that should you aquire this bug IT WILL PERSIST BETWEEN SAVING AND RELOADING.... Please fix this bug... im done with this game til then.Edit I am now changing my review to a Positive Recommendation. As of Hotfix 0.6.7 (which strangely is not mentioned on the store page i had to pull up their patch note history online) My issue is fixed and my game save is now usable!!! Thank you for fixing this issue you have won my loyalty.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-17,0,0,32,True,Recommended,This is a good game there are loads of bugs but it early access so that is fine. For how much this game costs its worth it because it gives you a lot of stuff you can do. I would say it does get repeatitive because going to new worlds is basically starting from scratch a little bit. Although getting to a new planet is kind of cool though new biomes and explorations more research etc. Pros Very addicting at first Rather large worlds Easy to get the hang of Contols are good a little annoying here and there (I saw some improvements from updates) Little to no monsters so a rather peaceful game Pretty grindy getting enough recources to build etc Visuals are pleasing colorful and cartoonish Multiplayer is fun buggy here and there and lags when your in multiple worldsCons Not good for replayability its basically the same thing over again from the first play through Not long game you will start to get less intreseted when your done with the first planet your on (Most likely will be made bigger and more things to do but for now it small) Starts to get real laggy when you have a lot of building pads and vehicles i would recommend one or two vehichles per planet it starts getting laggy noticably when you have more stuff. (will probably get fixed) needs to have a building pad made specifically for storage and a lot of it because i ran out of space fast i had the storage units but it wasn't enough,ASTRONEER

2018-09-03,0,0,8,True,Recommended,I was courious and bought it.

I look forward to a Server where the players can work indipendend jet together.Pros*) RelaxingIt is very relaxing. The big threats are some plants a storm you didn't see coming or your own carelessnes when loosing to much oxygen.*) Nice and easy to playMany games nowadays need high end components. This game runs so smoothly on my almost medival PC*) Its different.Looking at other survival games this is different to them. Easy Relaxin and positivly confusing )All in all I like this game for its fun. I can recomend it and look forward to the next updates.,ASTRONEER

Definitely worth the money for me. Soundtrack and art has kept me hooked and I eagerly await more and more content as the months pass. I've joined the discord group and followed the youtube channel which is incredibly rare for me. I don't think I've even taken the time to review another game before.

2016-12-24,0,0,69,True,Recommended,For an Early Access Game it is well done and is operating well.It is worth the price currently and if they add to the game as the have laid out it will be well worth it and maybe even a price increase for a few bucks more. As of now it is perfect.A bit demanding on some video cards because of the world having so much content. So be sure to update all drivers when installing. Also it would not hurt to use that Christmas excuse for a better card right about now. It will run but when you get your base big enough it will slow you down.So what can you do... well here is our first hour in playing Vaccum our home planet like a boss(with your TURBO 10000 sucker thingy)Research after building some cool thingamabob's Vaccum some more(enough to make your mother proud)Run out of Oxygen(damn)Respawn and get caught in a Sandstorm(Damn Damn) Respawn again go to retrieve your loot get spit on by a plant(Son of a B**)Respawn Sandstorm block to the face(Mother F*)Try to go deeper into the planet fall to my death while placing a tether(Face Palm)Respawn sit in my ship because its safer there and dream of what could have been...8/10 Would sit and call it success again!September 4th 2018 UPDATE!AFTER A LONG YEAR BREAK... we decided to visit games of promise and well ASTRONEER certainly has delivered from a year ago!WOW the changes in all directions graphically gui execution ect... are fantastic.

2018-04-12,0,0,1469,True,Recommended,I'm about 30 hours in so far with about 10 games restarted for various reasons. Very few glitches for an Alpha game at least that I have experienced to this point. I like the keyboard interface over the gamepad (wireless xbox controller) that may change with the next update.Even with no tutorials plotlines or goals prepared for you this game is really smooth playing and fun. You have to go to the forums and FAQs and sift through a lot of outdated stuff to learn how to do things in the game. Once you have some of it down learn to build/print different items to expand your base and NOT die from running out of oxygen or getting hit in the head by a big friggin rock blown by a storm... Its like opening a box to find a few hundred even cooler boxes nested within.You pick what you want to do and when lots of room to explore caves exotic landscapes random dangers Huge learning curve but really interesting gameplay. I haven't tried to do multi yet still trying to finger the SP game all out. Unlimited lives so if you die another pod comes down and you go search for your previous spaceperson's carcass and raid the backpack so you can continue what you were working on.Waiting for an update but really playable challenging and a great time sucker (that's good). Very well done.,ASTRONEER

2017-11-22,0,0,93,True,Recommended,I come back to review this game with its nearing 1.0 release and all I can say is this game has come a long way.When I first played this game back in March 21 2017 it found it to be a fun and peacful game. While there were a couple of game breaking bugs (Like rovers flying in the air not being able to pick up things crafting errors things like that.) as there are in early access games it was still fun. There was a time though when there was a bug so bad that I eventually had to take a break from the game. (The bug was were you would go through the ground and then die somewhere in a cave far below the surface. This happened constantly and was very annoying.)Then there was a period of time from what I can say was the the golden age of Astroneer. I came back after a while to see that they had updated some of the mechanics and also had fixed many bugs. Things like the reasearch update changed the mechanics of it from giving you an instant and random item to make to it now being a system that works where research is being slowly converted into bytes which from there you choose what to obtain. Then came the base building update and the rover update. For me this was a very big change in the mechanics of the game. It allowed to to reoriante your whole base in new ways that made things a lot easier. (Before you would extend your base out and it would be permanent.) It also added new features to putting things in boxes before you would unpack them making it easier to start a new base by loading a truck (or large rover now which makes more sense) with a bunch of boxes to drive over somewhere and unpack it all into a new base. It also updated how power is used and new fuctional Going into the rover update they really imroved the rover mechanics fixed lots of old bugs with them and gave them new features and a visual update. In fact a lot of the new updates include lots of visual updates. Ores really had a major update to visuals and in the newest crafting update all kinds of new items and other items already in the game got another visual update. In between this they fixed the trading platform which had bugs that would cause it to not come back new visual update that looks cool as well of a new way in trading scrap made from the new shredder to get ores from metals easier. But going into the latest update which was all about crafting I really got excited because this added a whole new point to going top other planets which a lot of people complained about in the past about there being no real point to go somewhere else. It added many new methods and levels to the crafting system and right now I'm getting a grasp to it and from what I can tell it made a sort of upgrade path. What I mean by this is that to ghet a large rover or a large shuttle you have to make thiings from the chemistry lab. To make that you need ores from another planet. Thus you have low tier stuff to use until you explore new worlds to upgrade to better things making it easier to progress and set up bases.Honestly I had a lot of fun with this game. I hope you can too.,ASTRONEER

It is easy to see that the developers have been working hard at giving this game what it needs to be a sustainable game that people will always be happy to go back to. I haven't had the chance to play this with friends yet but I know it could improve the gameplay.

If i should say one bad thing avout the game that must be the difficulty level. I played about 3 hours on a planet with my friend and we almost had everything researched. It could also be nice with some kind of navigation system(since i have used literally hourd on finding back to my base) maybe some kind of map that when you explored the world it would fill out the places you have been. The game gets a 9/10 by mePs nominated to game of the year (,ASTRONEER

2018-11-25,0,0,6,True,Recommended,I can see that the game is getting better however the process is slow and it's not doing enough for me to stay interesting. It's fun for a while and it's good for the people who love rpg crafters but after a while it lacks luster. worth a buy though. It's good for alpha.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-22,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Amazing game It's really fun to explore the planets really good art style it is also better with friends. It does get repetitive after a while though.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,59,True,Recommended,Wow ! Just try it and you will love itAstroneer you would be the perfect candidate to be nominated for the Game of the Year. Game is still in EA but this is the best space exploration game I ever played. Long life to Astroneer!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,14,True,Recommended,My friends convinced me to buy ASTRONEER and I've been having so much fun playing it! I love the world generation and I love all the systems. 1.0 COMING SOON HYPE!!!!!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,83,True,Recommended,This game is great. Especially for an early access one,ASTRONEER
2016-12-17,0,0,28,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a game I've heard of and have been watching from time to time to see how it's going. Now that it's out I could not be happier.This game combines all of my interests into one game and it does it well. Even though the game came out 3ish days ago (as of the writing of this review) and has some bugs the game play is very very well done and I can see myself putting many hours into it.EDIT Since the updates that allow you to move base objects around this is by far one of the best space exploration games I have played.,ASTRONEER
2017-03-18,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Astroneer really scratches the exploration itch for me with just the right balance of survival gameplay. Learning to play the game is a huge part of the discovery in itself it does not hold your hand and that is part of the charm. The core gameplay revolves around exploring and crafting and there is definitely a lot to see. I'm 20 hours in and there are still secrets I haven't stumbled across. This is an exceedingly pretty and relaxing game I highly recommend it!Update As it heads towards full release the team continues to really push the game forward adding new systems changing the crafting planet generation etc.Feels almost like playing a new game going back to it now.Regular dev diaries are a really nice way to keep up to date on everything too,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,21,True,Recommended,Amazing game good devs.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-22,0,0,19,True,Recommended,Fun game that unleash its full potential in MP mode with friends! Waiting patiently for the 1.0 version,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,57,True,Recommended,This game is great but like all games it has its short commings. There just isnt a whole lot to do but the gameplay is solid and is nice to explore the world and figure out all of the mechanics on your own,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,70,True,Recommended,This game is astounding. since the days of random research i have loved and adored this game. The devs are interactive uploading QandA's every now and then to their youtube channel and the game in general is just awesome. one flaw is that there is no real driving factor as of yet however the E3 trailer for this game shows the possibility for an exceiting plot which feels asthough it may be reminisint of the plot of Subnautica. The game runs well (40+) on my i5 8th gen laptop with intergrated graphics and there are very few stutters such as when loading into a new world. all in all would reccomend to any gamer casual or otherwise,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,59,True,Recommended,Excellent Early Access game for exploration and crafting in chill and beautiful environments. The System Era team is wonderful and has made great progress. I can't wait for the 1.0 launch in February (fingers crossed for no delays)! The only real complaint I have is that the UI is fairly unintuitive at the very start. Once you are used to it though it's not a problem at all. There's just a lot to do and a lot of information that would be helpful from the beginning. I'm not sure how to best convey all that info the brand new players apart from guiding them to the Wiki (which I do recommend but watch out for spoilers). Don't let this discourage you though it's a fun challenge learning to find and use the control panels.Multiplayer is a little buggy for the non hosting player(s) especially as you explore more planets and build multiple bases. But I still highly recommend playing with a buddy or two. It really speeds up with all the resource gathering and researching.It's also been incredibly helpful for my anxiety. Life has been crazy lately but sitting down for a couple hours of Astoneer solo or with my friends is a wonderful way to give my mind a break from the real world. Pretty much zero stress in this game (apart from occasionally getting lost).,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,55,True,Recommended,The graphics are awesome the controls are easy and the game is fun. I do like that you can play with friends however the biggest issue I found is that after around 2 hours of playing the game loses a lot of FPS. The only way to fix is it by restarting the game which is kinda annoying.,ASTRONEER
2018-08-16,0,0,32,True,Recommended,i like discovery things but once you find all the unknown that is it. hopely once early access over might be adding some more things to do.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Incredible game really well made,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,33,True,Recommended,Atroneer may currently be in early access but it really feels like a full game. Im really hopeful for this game and want it to continue to prosper. The devs contine to update the game with new content and keep us posted all the time with youtube. You should deffinatly check this out if you are interested in space or playing with friends.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-24,0,0,46,True,Recommended,A greate game so nice to play allone ore whit friends!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-24,0,0,38,True,Recommended,Fantastic Game! Simple Graphics Creative AdventurousDon't be afraid of this being an Early Access Game. The DEVs are up front and honest and the game is receiving updates regularly. Play Co OP with some friends makes this even more fun highly reccomend.,ASTRONEER
2016-12-16,0,0,57,True,Recommended,Awsome game!. specialy with a friend ),ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,31,True,Recommended,Amazing game although co op issues are still present.The graphics are stuningly beutiful in thei simplicity and feeling you get while exploring the different plannets is gret. it allmost feels like a childhoot drem come true.As I said amazing game with huge potential. Can't wait unttil alpha is finaly over in February.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,65,True,Recommended,One of the Best CO OP games of this year IMO. easy to learn. hard to master all around cute/good game,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,29,True,Recommended,A perfect game for co op. Despite being early access the multiplayer is very simple and just works. Though it still has bugs that you'll want to leave and rejoin to fix. This game has a lot to do but once you get your base all maxed out the addiction wears off. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game at launch and with each large update it brings you back in to start over and see what's new. This is definitely the go to space co op adventure for Steam.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,96,True,Recommended,Buy this game,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,530,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I dig this quite a lot. I cannot wait for the v1.0. I love the direction this heading.Essentially as a single player game if you like being isolated and working on your own really gives you the feeling of being trapped and isolated on a different planet where you try to survive the environment and build your base and try to leave the planet (my story not theirs). But it is fun to imagine.As a multiplayer game it's fun to work together perform assigned tasks (if you want) compete to build as quickly as possible (competition is a bit of a stretch since it's all cooperative) and maybe play hide and seek among the planets! Of course these are not the officially designed purposes.This is quite fun actually.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-25,0,0,14,True,Recommended,Astroneer is my go to game when I just want to relax and empty my head. In Astroneer you're walking around on extraterrestrial planets gather stuff which can be used for crafting things creating vast caves while gathering all while listening to a soothing soundtrack/sounds is perfection for the mind.More or less the only attention you need while playing is to keep an eye on oxygen levels which is easy to get into and it can be increased improved and streamlined once the crafting gets going.I have played the game during Early Access and it's a little painful with the constant savegame resets and the inevitable bugs but they have finally set a date for the release and I can't wait to get this started for real when it's done.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,112,True,Recommended,The game glitched my pod went through the planet to the other side and I had to build dig and tunnel my way back to my original landing zone. It took hours and hours. 9/10 Would do again.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-22,0,0,246,True,Recommended,The best space game out there do I have to say anything else? If so It has endless exploration breathtaking scenery and a baller sound track which I have bought twice both on Steam and iTunes. (my personal favorite is mineral music) I have also bought the game itself twice both on PC and Xbox though I think it plays better on PC. Pajamas is the best Astroneer and everyone knows it. The game is continually expanding and with each update it gets better and better. System Era Softworks are the most transparent developers I've ever seen and pour their hearts into the game so that we can do the same. spaceboy mike,ASTRONEER
2018-11-21,0,0,9,True,Recommended,Has potential and is also adorable!,ASTRONEER
2016-12-30,0,0,176,True,Recommended,Early Access pre alpha review Astroneer is a great game considering it is not complete there is so much to expand upon in this game for the developers can't wait to see what happens from here. If you're considering whether or not to buy it because it is not finished it is still enjoyable and fun regardless of its incompletion.0.10.5 pre 1.0 review This game has gone through so much in its development. So much I can't list here. The dev team has proved that they listen and work tirelessly on their game. They've earned the $20 I gave them two years ago and much more than that. I didn't want to admit it two years ago but astroneer was an impulse buy and rarely do you actually like the things you buy when that happens. This was one of those times. Seriously tho this is a kickass game worth your time and tour money. Hats off to the devs for not abadnoning this as some other devs have done.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Honestly a solid game. I have owned this game since its release and have played it as it has evolved with each new update. Its definitely worth purchasing and a blast to play with friends.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,99,True,Recommended,94 Hours and counting System Era has done a great job at keeping me hooked on this game with each new update to the early access model. Cannot wait for 1.0 next year.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-24,0,0,47,True,Recommended,It is certainly a good mix of survival and exploration! The immense destructability of multiple planets means that if it remains stable on a save file there is no limit to what you could build eventually out of the terraformer. Kind of buggy when I have played it but they keep fixing it!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-21,0,0,59,True,Recommended,Seriously fun game with friends fun mechanics nice low poly worlds with some new twists,ASTRONEER
2018-08-16,0,0,648,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. I learned to play it just after they added the research (version 0.5.0). It is a multiplayer and single player game that dumps you on a planet and you can dig tunnels and holes looking for materials to build with and research items to earn bytes which allows you to unlock platforms storage machines vehicles and shuttles. You can explore above and under ground and also travel in space between several planets. Soon they will be adding objectives and/or goals. Game is due to release 1.0 February 6 2019 (for $29.99). If you buy now (and you should definitely) you get the full release for free (you don't have to buy it again). I've bought this game for Steam and Windows 10. Cool thing is I can also play the Windows 10 on my Xbox One and cross platform allows multiplayer between Windows 10 and Xbox. Eventually Steam Windows 10 and Xbox will all be able to play together. Very active and informative community (including devs from SES) on Discord server. I nominated both System ERA (devs) and this game for a Steam award. Biggest difficulty was there was more than one category that this game fits into. I could only choose one. I picked (Labor of Love). I highly recommend you buy this game!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-24,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Although this game is still under development it is already a great experience for those who like this kind of genre. I loved it even more when playing with friends and I am really looking forward to the release in February 2019!,ASTRONEER

2018-11-15,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Despite my relatively low hours on this game it has to be one of my favorites. The game in it's current state is so simplistic yet so complex as to you can explore where ever you want and do whatever you want. 10/10 I can't wait to see what they continue to do for the game. yeet,ASTRONEER

2018-11-24,0,0,28,True,Recommended,This game provides hours of fun and while it is especially fun to play it with friends playing solo provides an experience that is just as incredible.

2016-12-26,0,0,550,True,Recommended,I saw some play through on Twitch and loved what I saw. This is the first time i've purchased a pre alpha game. I enjoy casual sandbox games among others. Sometimes you just want to explore find fun things make new things and create. This game gives me that along with a really nice atmosphere to do it. I'm having so much fun! I do hope the development continues because the potential is amazing. Definitely worth my limited gameplay time. Love it!Update Astroneer has become one of my absolute favorite games. Adding to the intended gameplay being able to build wonderful structures with terrain adds so much more tothe game. The developers System Era are an amazing bunch. The game goes 1.0 in February and I can't wait to see what's next. Buy it!,ASTRONEER
2018-11-25,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This an amazing game. I would like to see an addition where you could go inside the habitat and could use gadgets in there.

You never know what you will discover next and the game has a certain pacing where you find pieces to a certain machine and in your mind you understand what you must do next. You learn to build you learn to fly to different planets you learn about all the machines and much more. Buy this game sale or not. You will not be disappointed.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-01,0,0,62,True,Recommended,Basically it's Minecraft in space. It's similar principles to many resource gathering games establish a base mine for resources watch out for perils etc. The problem is its incredibly addictive and relaxing. There's no real pressure (apart from running out of oxygen) and you get to wander and explore fascinating planets. As it's still very early access please take the following points with that in mind There isn't enough notable differences between the planets so exploring tends to get slightly monotonous after a while (but still thoroughly stress free). A little more diversity would certain aid in exploring.So far there's only a few modules to research and work with I'm pretty sure this will improve over time and at the moment it's fun and functional. The bugs I've come across are minor and relatively pain free its so far never been game breaking. Astroneer is such great potential and I have no regrets about recommending that people buy it play it and enjoy it. It's a game made with a lot of heart. Thoroughly enjoyable.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-22,0,0,56,True,Recommended,Survival is tough. It can be challenging. But it doesn't always have to be tedious and boring. Astroneer excells at this bringing the survival experience in a way that makes it fresh and exciting. The resources you collect are distinct unique and always important. The worlds are large vast and varied with breathtaking landscapes that are procedrually generated to create something new every time. Everything about this game is calm and soothing an experience that doesn't make you think about trying to survive but about having a great time.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-24,0,0,118,True,Recommended,if you like games where you have to gather materials and advance in technology then this is a good game to get. I've put in a lot of hours and still come back to it. It's still in beta but will release next week. The only negative I really have is there are times where you had to start a new world when there was an update. I don't imagine it'll be an issue when they release though. The new changes were always welcome and has improved so much.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-28,0,0,10,True,Recommended,over all a verry appeasing and well crafted game that is heavily exploration based if you like that genre of game. But do make sure that you have a decent pc to run it for it can be quite laggy at times if you are on a verry low end machine. how ever over all it is a stunning game with great visuals and atmosphere.

2017-04-04,0,0,98,True,Recommended,(UPDATED REVIEW AT THE BUTTOM)This is my review about Astroneer. Please repsect my review thanks.Well were should i start this game is about survival and exploration in space. What it contains (Look down below and it WILL contain SPOILERS!!!)The game comes with Open world with mineable terrain ore's broken space ships and lots of plants and flowers. I comes also with industry to make vehicles smelt ore upgradeable gear to your Astronaut or vehicle and solar panels or windturbines. It also has sandstorms. When a sandstorm arrive it will push any phycis object and thats not the last of it. It can also kill you if you dont seek cover or somewhat. Colored caves and mountains are also included. Theres also something called research object that be used to create new gear and other things. Overall it has good grahics and beautiful landscape that is random generated. Also you can travel in space to other planets for other materials.For my this is one of the best Early acces games that i have ever played. It's not beta or aphla. I's ing Pre aphla and in my own inpinion this is amazezing to a bug free game(have not seen any bugs yet). But it also include online co op to explore and survive in Astroneer. But NOTE its pre aphla and im sure there will be more content in the feature.11/10Update The game is on the path of growing up (coming out of early access). I had many adventures with one of my closest friends and damn this game dosent end here for me with this exploration in the game. Looking really foward to the next update of the game this is a must have to have before launch!.Thank you for reading my review. Cheers,ASTRONEER
2018-11-23,0,0,133,True,Recommended,Bought this game when it released as early access in 2016 has never dissapointed.Frequently updated great devs who always listen to the community and really fun to play with friends.Can't wait to try it when it comes out as 1.0!,ASTRONEER
2018-06-02,0,0,55,True,Recommended,This game deserves a review key elements like exploration base building crafting aside i remember having great fun building enomous ramps to slide around. This game really IS early access devs are really working constanly bringing up new mechanics and content i can't believe how much it developed almost 400% of what it was since i played it first one of the few games that didn't disappoint me for supporting in early access. Oh and if you have friends to play with don't even think about it twice i think co op supports up to four people but even with two players it is several times more fun.

2018-11-21,0,0,114,True,Recommended,A very relaxing sandbox game in which you are more tempted to just slow down and stroll around instead of scavenging for resources even though you know you want those resources anyway.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-22,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Such a fun game both playing with friends and on your own. I recommend buying this and supporting the developers. The style is amazing and I love how nice everything looks. I cant wait for this to be released fully. 10/10,ASTRONEER

2018-11-21,0,0,62,True,Recommended,"I purchased Astroneer just after the Research update in December of 2017. Ever since I've followed the game's patches almost religiously each one inspiring another 10+ hour playthrough. The main thing about Astroneer is how easily one gets lost. Both literally and figuratively one gets lost in this game. Beacons help literally but its hard to pull oneself out of the simple neon world System Era has made. I've lost countless hours countless times with this game the simple gameplay loop and easy going difficulty curve makes it easy to just ""space"" out and relax while playing.Multiplayer connectivity blows but its still fun.The soundtrack is fun but I forget it exists sometimes.This is what No Man's Sky wishes it could be.",ASTRONEER
2018-11-21,0,0,38,True,Recommended,This is the most chilled out survival sandbox you could ask for. The design of everything is very laid back abstract pastel worlds and plants even the soundtrack is chilled out. Only resource you have to worry about is oxygen which you get free when near any of your structures or vehicles. There's a bunch of tools and structures to unlock and use to further your exploration. Favorite pastime so far is hitching rovers together and slapping a crane with a drill and some storage on then gradually tearing down a mountain. Developers have been continually ironing out bugs and reworking systems since the game hit early access. (Writing this Nov. 2018 game hits 1.0 Feb. 2019.) Overall as of now the game runs smoothly and is almost bug free. Only downside is it cooks my old GTX680... a non issue on current hardware.,ASTRONEER

2016-12-17,0,0,67,True,Recommended,My original review was very early in the pre alpha. i want to update my recommendation and just say this game still deserves a bunch of support. the dev's have improved upon the base release quite extensively and i look forward to the 1.0 release.first time i played this game i lost an entire evening. (had to work the next day too)i'm purposely holding off till the 1.0 just so its fresh on release. but i can recommend this game whole heartedly. it's amazing!,ASTRONEER

2018-11-21,0,0,81,True,Recommended,This game's terrian manipulation is awesome.I really like the crafting system and the exploration to other planets to get some of the resouses to make higher tier stuff unfortunatly there's not really that much of a need to leave your starter planet at the moment but I hope in the future there will be at least a couple of resourses and thingys unique to each planet that are also very usefull.At the time of this reveiw there is only enough content to reccomend this game when it's on sale but there will be much more in the future.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-24,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Great Game and an even better game with friends. The Devs are really cool and just want to release a good game and even though it took them a bit longer they expected are finally releasing the game in january from early access and raising the price inorder for them to continue to bring content to the game.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-10,0,0,4,True,Recommended,My review will focus solely on the multiplayer aspect as I have not played singleplayer yet. It is intensely fun and addicting this game has done so much right. You feel so alone on these planets but man having your friends there makes it so much better! Going in caves running as far as you can while still having enough oxygen to get back... it's intense and fun and few games execute atmosphere in such a way that you feel lonely and comforted at the same time.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-10,0,0,14,True,Recommended,It's still in alpha so I wouldn't recommend getting it yet if you don't want to have to restart if save games are made incompatible and things like that. It has happened at least once.In the time I've had this game every time I have launched it I have found more interesting refinements and improvements.The music is relaxing and immersive and the progression and exploration is steady and fun without being grindy. For a game so early in its development it's great.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-13,0,0,24,True,Recommended,Very fun game to play with friends just wish it was a longer game,ASTRONEER
2018-11-14,0,0,36,True,Recommended,I absolutly love and adore this game. while end game and story drive are a bit limited in early access i still had alot of fun with one of my friends playing this game for hours on end. i also love how single player doesnt detach from multiplayer and you can even play this game in offline mode. it definatly got me through some times with entertainment even though i had no internet which is a big plus. As far as story progression i hope they come out with something that drives the player to explore the other planets like special quests with dynamic events but im only a critic. Overall i would reccomend this game to anyone who love space and simplistic graphics with intreguing mechanics.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-12,0,0,27,True,Recommended,TLDR More fun with friends. I can see this game getting bigger and bigger but right now it seems as if there is not enough to keep you engaged. I still recomend it but not full hardily as other games.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-12,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I love this game. The soundtrack is awesome the game play is engaging. Base Building and reasearch keep you facinated. The best part is the exploration aspect though. The planitary system is sweet you can even use the suns orientation to tell which hemisphere you are in on a planet. (I used this often to find home base again after long explorations) Every update brings new aspects and better quality to the game.I love Astroneer,ASTRONEER
2018-11-21,0,0,76,True,Recommended,As I'm sure other have already said before me Astroneer is close to what people wanted from No Man's Sky when it was released. Astroneer is a great exploration/crafting game set in a space exploration setting. The graphics a great mix of cartoony and breathtaking the gameplay is always evolving and exploration never gets dull. Plus the developer System Era is VERY invested in the game and continues to take feedback from players to make the game even better. Pick this up ASAP!!!!!,ASTRONEER

2018-11-17,0,0,63,True,Recommended,I don't say much about good places. Others have comments. I'll talk about it here.(Without special annotations most of the problems occur in online mode and I'm not sure if the single mode is the same.)1. game cartonI configure gtx1080 i5 8600k 16g not to say a high end machine but full effect play some large multiplayer online games is no pressure in this game 2 people online 40 FPS3 people online 25 FPS4 people online 20 FPSSandstorm weather 10 15 FPSAuto save 1 FPS (usually 3 seconds or so).2. game BUGOften can not take things can only push back. Occasionally the game wears a model perspective. When a person touches a car sometimes the car will go to heaven and the 4 engine characteristic of illusory? Minerals sometimes float in the sky and they can't be dug. It's very uncomfortable. A has been testing for two years.3. magic settingMy 6 tank car will be moved by several grass and several small stone cards.What is the use of sandstorms besides wasting time and letting me drop frames? For a wind power generation players can't hide anything for a few minutes?Hundreds of tons of tank cars will be blown away by the wind and people will be fine on the ground.4. game modeWhen you first enter the game you will feel that the game is really fun and there will always be something new to discover. Later it was discovered that the game had only one purpose mining. You don't live in your home. Studying things is just to build things for mining. It feels very NB to go to other planets but in the end you can only dig. It feels fresh to find ruins at first but it's customary to look at them once or twice. The more boring and boring the game mode is the more I don't know what the overnight wealth refers to in the introduction.Several suggestions1. game trouble is changed to drag bar one point is really slow. You can't ask all players to change to config.2. Create some constructable elements so that players can build their own houses garages and other things even a simple wall can make the game more playable.3. sandstorms can be changed for several days only once but very destructive. Players can learn ahead of time and make a lot of preparations to prevent losses and come up with rare materials that can only be collected with special devices in sandstorms.4. More accessories can be added to the car such as brakes headlights bulldozers off road tires nitrogen accelerators.5. If there will be biological systems in the future different civilizations can be set up on different planets and different civilizations have different facilities. After learning the structure of their facilities they can be used at the base. If I want to shoot a gun I suggest that a laser gun be used instead of something that can destroy the terrain.The 6. bomb can be larger than the explosion range now or it can fry large ruins into metal fragments. I didn't even unlock the bomb because the bomb was useless.7. set the angle for the ctrl+ right button so that the OCD player can make a flat plane.In the later version if I make some useful changes I will praise it.,ASTRONEER

2018-11-21,0,0,47,True,Recommended,One hell of a game that WHANT know more on its development!,ASTRONEER
2017-03-16,0,0,56,True,Recommended,"This will be a positive review since the game is in its alpha stages so I am just reflecting on that part for now.The game will be very great as time progresses as I enjoy it's core concepts such as its UI art style and gameplay as a whole. This does not mean it's perfect again I stress that I know it's in alpha and this is just feedback so far.To dive into the negative aspects as of now the game is lacking content wise (YES I KNOW OF COURSE THEY WILL ADD MORE I AM JUST SAYING YOU CAN'T PLAY IT INDEFINITELY) but that really isn't my concern the only negative part about that is waiting since it will happen eventually. My main concerns as of now are the ""behind the scenes"" issues. To start I almost always play this game with a friend and this has its problems. These problems include connectivity issues (which for the most part have been fixed) crashing at times when extensive travel is done (players on 2 different celestial bodies) and worst of all the servers (AND YES I KNOW THIS WILL BE FIXED TOO). I feel bad for my friend when we play becuase he can't drive anything around without the game throwing him into the ground (losing all that he has and the vehicle).So over all this game WILL get better and I know it's early access just warning about what to expect. Though for now the main parts i've expressed are that content will come but it will take time. Ive done almost all there is in under 20 hours (though you can still play more depends on yourself). The other thing is coop is very buggy as of now and there a more bugs in general. (AND I KNOW ALL THIS WILL GET FIXED THESE DEVS ARE GREAT) This is just my experience with the game at this stage in time and that's why this review is positive.Update they've improved so much and continue to show growth. Worth it still!",ASTRONEER

2018-11-21,0,0,52,True,Recommended,First of all woah! I'm amazed at this game given the fact that ASTRONEER is yet on ALPHA stage this game has expressed a huge potential and I hope it remains that way. The devs are doing an amazing job always including new updates and will be launching it's v1.0 on February 6th of 2019.I do recommend this game a lot!It's fresh OPEN WORLD and survival NO MONSTERS but environment CAN kill you so watch out for that. Game is currently priced 27.99 but soon will be 29.99 Try and buy the game at 17.99 like i did PLAY WITH FRIENDS it's even better I've played 22h by myself and I haven't got bored not one time...Graphics are VERY GOOD!Game runs VERY SMOOTHLY!Controls are VERY EASY TO LEARN!Overall if you like this kind of game... This is the game you'll want to have in your library ready to be played... ASTRONEER!,ASTRONEER

2019-01-03,0,0,13,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. its a great game but there are some little things i wish would be changed such as storms being a lot rarer since it would allow me to do more and not camp inside my base 2 The old cable texture was way better in my opinion also we should be able to choose which planet we start on or have some choice between some and the terrain tools ""flatten"" function dose not really flatten very good im ok with the new dropship system but still kinda liked the old dropship as the center of base but i kinda get that you added a new center of base since the dropship was kinda small",ASTRONEER

2019-01-04,0,0,6,True,Recommended,As of now I can't really recommend the game at this price yet unless you REALLY love everything astronaut/space themed like me. But as it is still an early access game I hope the dev team would listen to the players and add more content because I really like the simple cartooney astronaut/space theme and having played it for a while it does have potential.+ Pretty colourful graphics+ Relaxing soundtrack+ Astronaut/space theme+ Finding resources to start it all off is easy No other threats besides lack of oxygen makes it seem less survival. A few types of hostile aliens would make it more interesting. tutorial seemed a tad unclear Lack of content makes it boring after a while Far too few things to craft The landscape and scenery is pretty but what you see there on that planet when you first landed there is basically what it will be everywhere else on that same planet as well. Or at least it seemed like that to me that I was trapped in the same environment no matter how far I traveled.Get this when Full price On sale x On an even saler sale (like 60% or something...) x Someone else gets it for you No... Just. No.,ASTRONEER
2018-08-07,0,0,32,True,Recommended,I enjoy this game with gusto. At least the beginning few hours. Having a friend with you for four hours of just ing around and exploring is absolutely great paired with unique graphics and enjoyable mechanics. Granted I did say the first few hours. This game lacks all replayability. There is no pve pvp or any interaction in the game. After you've gotten a rover maybe explored a planet or five what's next? What's the main goal? After the charming introduction it's unfortunate to have to say there's really no substance. I would still recomend this game but play it with some friends. It's worth the price but it lacks in the aspect of replayability.,ASTRONEER
2018-10-29,0,0,17,True,Recommended,"As an early Alpha it's absolutely amazing so far I've seen. It weilds great potential to become one of the best space games on the market on full product release (depending what will become of this game in the future).If they manage to put in a fun questing system or anything else that makes it's self a target/goal for the player then this game is set. I can't stress enough how much they need to put work into keeping the player occupied with more and more and more goals to reach. This way ""The new experience"" doesn't need to run out and so this game does not need to fall into the same endless loop trap that most modern open world games fall into.Other than all of that. Buy it if you can't wait to try it on early alpha. Though the price tag is a tidy bit high to get your money on the product when it's not complete so you make the choice.",ASTRONEER
2019-01-02,0,0,56,True,Recommended,My only complaint for the game is that it doesnt seem to have any true graphics settings. The render distance for terrain objects like rocks and plants is incredibly short... Running a system that has a 2070 means thast I am 110% not using its full potential.But in regards to everything else this game feels (to me) like it is the achiever of want No Man's Sky couldnt achieve A multi player multi planet exploration game. The game stays true to its 'lego esque' piece by piece style even in its crafting system. Over all I would say this game goes right next to the games Terraria and Minecraft as it is a sandbox game that is not repetitive and its VERY active update schedule helps prove that. I have had a lot of fun playing this game. so much so that I bought it again on the windows store to play with my Xbox friends. I totally recommend this game to anyone who even remotely enjoys open world exploration games.,ASTRONEER
2017-05-17,0,0,69,True,Recommended,"so yeah. great game we got here lads. specialy when your friends join in and you end up retriving the truck you just made from the atmosphere cuz for some reason when they drive in your world. lets just say some intresting ""phenomoneons"" tend to happen. moving on it is in all a great game to be in EA. could use a few tweaks here and there. looking forward to seeing a full game D10/10 would retive trucks from space again.Back again after 2 years of devolopment i can say i enjoy the huge increase in stuff they added and bugs they fixed. The game looks the same but it is also just to vastly different from when i started playing Dec 2016. 2019 just began and i can say i am looking forward to the full relase with my friends. Now i have praised the game i will admit the game kinda dies after like 20h in a world. The goal of discovering more stuff and trying to get even more effective dies. there is no ending however this games does deliver the nice take away from everything else i play. The game is so cute and innocent the only violence is you massmurdering plants to get further down your cave. It is a nice game mostly every bug i encountered with orbit launched rovers have been resolved and hence i can now say it is (to mostly 90%) a certain degree a stable mulitplayer experience!",ASTRONEER

2018-02-25,0,0,38,True,Recommended,I highly reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys being on a planet alone anyone who's an alien wanting to get away from their family or just anyone who likes the movie The Martian.I have been getting a bug where when exiting a vechicle it would just ping off into atmosphere (Probably to get away from me) but other than that it's a solid experience with tons of exploration just remember to place beacons every mile when adventuring I have lost my habitat many times when entering a cave and exiting on the enter side of the planet....Just remember your legs are infact made of tin foil so falling off a pug's back would kill you.,ASTRONEER

2017-12-18,0,0,34,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. This game offers so much in terms of freedom and replayability. Also System Era has done a great job of supporting this game to max and is devoted to getting this game out of early access. They are always adding new content to explore which adds even more to the replayability this game has. Just take some advice get the game and you won't be dissapointed. You'll know whether or not you like the game in around the first hour so it's not like they want to trick you out of your refund. I'll continue to support this game and I hope you do too.,ASTRONEER

The content is absolutely awesome so far and MORE of it is coming.It never crashed or hanged on me it just gets a little bit slower when you discover a larger area of the planet in one sitting. Please bare in mind that the game is in Pre Alpha stage and has already won me over and become one of my favourites...

2018-11-24,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Controls are clearly for use with a gamepad. Even just standing still and looking around with the mouse is highly annoying because of the delayed and oversmoothed camera movements. This cannot be turned off or changed in a config file.

2018-11-23,0,0,16,True,Recommended,Love this game with all it has so far. Tons of potential. Met the devs at PAX who were nice and had a fun booth which makes me like the game even more. Really fun to play with other people but great and relaxing to play solo. Art style is fun and bubbley soundtrack is quite nice as well. This a game that I really hope continues to get love and support from the Devs. I will say the only major con is that it's rather easy finish building everything and move to your next planet with the major differences in planets being distribution of resources. This con can easily be attributed to the game still being early in development. Can't wait to see more from these guys in the future.,ASTRONEER

2017-03-01,0,0,28,True,Recommended,"*Updated from last year*So I've been following this game for a while and I've learned two things... The devs are chill and open with the community. In a sea of early access titles being half this is a lighthouse of hope. The game is good and people should play it.I started playing this game when it first popped up on steam and it was this weird little game with a ton of bugs some weird art and incredibly peaceful music. The entire atmosphere was ... ""newness"" and I frequently came back to the game just to escape some stressful points in my life. The more I came back the more I started to see a finished game come into focus and now with the announcement of 1.0 coming out... I'm just so happy about this game growing up.If you like space aesthetics sandbox games semi survival games and the ability to be very creative with terrain/world manipulation I would highly recommend this game. Like a solid 8/10.(Although warning to those who can't find a 'grove' and who may get bored easily this game is probably not for you. You kind of have to let the monotonous aspects be part of the fun.)",ASTRONEER

2018-12-23,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Product received for free. I enjoyed this game so much I had so much fun playing with my brother and friends. Though throughout the entire journey we struggled with such things like 1. Lag of DOOM Tends to happen occasionally or when the planet cant load properly. It also happens a lot when youre not near the host.2. The Cracks of Void in the Planet There would be these spots in caves where you can see through the map and when entering you gravitate up to the surface but if you fly too high you'll die when you land.3. Monsters/Ores that tend to Respawn after being Dugged up There would be ores that are mined such as Malachite or Lithium but when we re enter the game the ores and hostile plants would respawn which if you dig the ore again you basically get nothing.4. The Magical Non interactive Moments Whenever you do something like spam the ping there's a 50/50 chance you would not be able to grab anything/pick something up.5. The World that Broke in Four Whenever i fly to the Moon(Barren) the Earth(Terran) would be split into 4 pieces flying through the Moon which jumpscared me a lot of times cause of the scary BG sound that plays and a huge green wall that just flies through the caves quickly at my face.6. The Shuttle that just stays in one spot Once you craft a shuttle it's stuck there unless you fly it and landing somewhere else which leads to fuel waste flying it to another planet build another one etc. Basically if you left a shuttle in a planet and fly another shuttle to that spot they just phase through each other.7. Loading In Issues There would be some issues where it says it couldnt connect to the host or the loading just completely crashes.8. Entering the Game There would also be issues where you dug a spot some objects such as a rock or plant would respawn there resulting in you having to remove it again.,ASTRONEER
2018-12-22,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a very interesting game. It's a really neat fun and very enjoyable. The only problem I've had with it is that it begins to feel repetitive and can start to get boring after 6 hours. I've began around four characters and it only takes a couple hours to get a ship and go to other worlds. If you put some time into the game and learn what needs to be done and how to do it you'll enjoy the game more than you would by just looking around and trying to figure things out as you go. Go watch some YouTube videos on the game they help a lot. I recommend anyone reading this to get the game but take their time with the game and enjoy it.

I can't wait for this game to come out of alpha and see whats in store for me! Also random question does anyone know how to view when I purchased this game? I wanna know how many patches I have played through. Thanks!,ASTRONEER
2019-01-01,0,0,82,True,Recommended,ASTRONEER Ah A great little game that i actually sumbled across by acident when looking though a steam sale and while at the time of purchase i was unconvinced that this game claimed alot of the things that it did. So i bought the game and booted it up and i expected to play about 10 15 minuets of this game before getting bord and refunding it....2 Hours had past and i have got to say that this game without a doubt is the best $20 i have spent on a game ever.This game has a beutifull art style good graphics frequent updates interplanetary transprotation and literal mountains of different resources that you can craft from AND it also supports multiplayer!So if you like resource management Awsome sights of landscapes and Epic planetary travel.Then this is the game for you.,ASTRONEER
2019-01-01,0,0,27,True,Recommended,Hello This is my first review ever but I have to make a review on this gameThis is one of my favourtite games of all time it is so much funIf you really like sandbox style games this is fun! (games like minecraft subnautica)It is really noob friendly with the amazing tutorial it's very easy to learn.Multiplayer friendly as well if you want to play with your friends!1 downside is almost each update you have to restart your world buut it's not fully out so I understand Brayden,ASTRONEER

2017-01-31,0,0,65,True,Recommended,So just gonna say i love this game even in pre alpha this game is great now that being said i do not recommend this game for people who hate bugs and lag bc there is a lot of that in this game i am only recommending this to people who enjoy a game for what it is. i love this game i could play this for hours on end but like all games could always use improving.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-06,0,0,192,True,Recommended,I have around 130 hours in Astroneer from the time writing this and can easily say that it is one of the best games I have ever played. The developers are dedicated and update the game regularly adding bug fixes and exciting new content. The world generation is perfect with little to no bugs and the game has different yet beautiful graphics. After a few hours of gameplay you will know how to play fairly well. Even with all the time I have I still experience new things regularly such as a new thing to research or occasionally even a new mechanic I never knew about. It is worth every penny and I wouldn't blame System Era for charging more for such a great game. The only thing I could possibly say they could improve on is adding more content for late game. Perhaps a story or maybe even NPCs? Recommended to all those who like relaxed gameplay still with some challenge to it.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-07,0,0,100,True,Recommended,Great game while its still in early access and the main goal atm is exploration/building everything in the game the devs are comitted to improving it and have a great roadmap. Can't wait to see what else they will add to the game in the future (especailly the story).,ASTRONEER
2018-11-07,0,0,30,True,Recommended,I must say Astroneer is an awsome game! There is just a kind of aura to it that draws casual players like me to spend countless hours building up bases farming for bytes and creating new resources! The Exploration is Fantastic and I hope this game grows from an indie into a full blown Game witha full release! There are of course things to improve like how the game is very low poly but it still takes up alot of your cpu usage and sucks the living life out of my medium sized laptop. Though I'm really excited for the new 1.0 update thats coming out! It could add a plot to your adventures and just seams like a massive update. I hope that the devs fix the bugs and improve this game since it is early alpha after all all in all this game is in its development stages but it has big plans for the future!,ASTRONEER
2018-10-30,0,0,226,True,Recommended,I absolutely adore this game! Building your base exploring the planets and interacting with the fully deformable environment never really gets old for me. It's also been a super cool process watching it evolve over time in the early access phase and I'm really excited to see what the developer puts out in the full release.,ASTRONEER
2018-10-28,0,0,4,True,Recommended,I saw this game on youtube and I was like I should buy this bur I haven't really played it that much I was very impressed about the game. Hopefully in the future i'll play it more cause I haven't had the time to.,ASTRONEER
2018-12-19,0,0,33,True,Recommended,hello system era and anyone who reads this. honestly i love this game and suggest it to my friends to play multiplayer. i havent really looked into multiplayer and to be honest havent seen how to do it. ive loved seeing the updates and all also i havent found any bugs tho i would suggest making the settings screen make the game pauze or at least a way to pauze it. i watch system era on youtube and am VERY hyped for the release and the new skin(s) and hope and im not fully sure but i think theres no exclusive stuff for beta testers tho then again im not sure and havent searched for it. im just hyped for seeing the game and community grow. and i would like a story added further than u land and u try to survive. apart from that the game is amazing,ASTRONEER

I have had this game for a long time now not many hours but for the hours I do have its was enough to say that this game is really good. I really love it and it was just amazing when I first started playing. Who does not like space I mean this game is absolutely stunning and I really love how the Devs are really working hard on this game to make it as stable as possible before cramming in a bunch of new stuff. I definitley recommend this game.,ASTRONEER
2018-12-30,0,0,0,True,Recommended,nice!,ASTRONEER
2018-12-31,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Yes I may only have an hour or two on this game as of the time I write this review but I can tell this game is incredible so early on. For those of you that like Terraria Starbound or other games like that ASTRONEER is sort of similar. There is grinding and underground exploring but what I love about this game is the space themed gameplay. If you don't bring tethers with you you will die of oxygen loss. You need to make a rocket ship to explore other planets to get more resources. I have played with a friend who has been playing this game for years and I suggest you do the same because this game can be confusing. All in all though this game is a fantastic creation I wish I bought sooner since I love Terraria but a 3d experience in space with stunning graphics and music is infinitly better. My only problem is the slight complexity but don't let that stop you!TL DR Beautiful slightly complex game similar to Terraria and Starbound with it's own unique twist.,ASTRONEER
2018-06-21,0,0,15,True,Recommended,"this game is almost perfect. i like almost eveything of it. the physics the way the game plays the gamplay it self all those things are very nicely done. manny people thing there is no goal no ending. thats what keeps me playing. you make your own goals. for example ""today im trying to go to this planet and set up a base there"" you can choose what you want to do and not having to follow a storyline of some sorts. the only thing i really miss is... Muli Player.it would be such a perfect game if it had Multi Player. like you can shearch your favorite server in a server browser and encounter new people there. and an option on what world to land would also be great. i rate it a 9/10",ASTRONEER
2018-12-30,0,0,34,True,Recommended,It's almost at it's release date time flew by so fast. I remember staying up for hours into the morning losing track of time playing this game. It's a fun relaxing game to play with friends and family nothing ridiculously difficult and tons of stuff to do. I enjoy a solid online coop game not big into space but this game is just great one of a kind. Pick it up if you have the funds to do so and maybe gift this to someone you play with it's better with friends and a little spooky alone.,ASTRONEER

2017-02-13,0,0,76,True,Not Recommended,This game has a ton of potential! The visuals are absolutely amazing I love the art style. There isnt a whole lot to do at the moment you can essentially accomplish everything in about 6 hours all while trying to figure it out. I recommend this game to you if you want a beautiful game that you are going to periodically check back in on to play the updates.UPDATE This game has not had a content update since the day it came out. I dont feel the developers are focusing on what people want too busy adding errors logs and changing physics variables. I had really high hopes for this game but it has fallen flat.,ASTRONEER

2018-12-28,0,0,106,True,Recommended,This game is one of the most fun games I have ever played System Era is a small company who responds to emails for support very fast. This has been one of my favorite games since 2016 when it released into early access. Overall i love this game and the company who made it and I can't wait until it releases into version 1.0.,ASTRONEER
2018-12-25,0,0,35,True,Recommended,Game feels like lego building space exploration. My thoughts Very nice resource system building system Expolorating is fun Power management can be annoying but it is also nice As with any early access game there's numerous bugs Items clip into the ground and dissapear below Character models either desync with the host or clip into the ground and go flying sometimes Teathers appear sometimes as powered even though they are unpowered Massive lag if there's a decent amount of terraforming that has been done cross secor Percision bugs where they clearly used single percision floats where they should have used double percision. Or a better coordiante system that is planet dependant insted of universe based.If they can fix the bugs and spruce up endgame conrent then this game will be super nice.,ASTRONEER

2019-01-20,0,0,4,True,Recommended,Amazing open world exploration game. It is filled with lots of different things to do and you are not limited to do things by any quests (because there are none).

2019-01-20,0,0,307,True,Recommended,Very excited for the Feb release this game !#$ing rocks. The only thing that could make this game better is just let them do more of what they're doing. I want more of whatever they come up with. For those wanting to know about why you should purchase this game... sandbox style open world survival not a lot of interaction with npc's however complete freedom to explore mine and craft a procedural solar system. Very addictive. Gameplay feels meditative and relaxing. You barely feel the grind which propels you to further tech levels for your ever growing domain in this survial exploration sandbox. The graphics look amazing and the conceptual design will make you question everything by it's modular approach to exploration. You will answer mysteries of the ancients as you embark into a fresh solar system with modern tech. Why did they build pyramids? It's all right here! Sure they've got room for improvement but that doesn't mean the early access should you give you delay in purchasing. People who won't like this game??? I suppose sportball heros and 1st person kill streak oriented folks will balk. Take care!,ASTRONEER
2019-01-20,0,0,75,True,Recommended,Astroneer is a beautiful expansive game that is so much fun to play with friends and also so much fun to play alone. I swear i have played more than what it says on my profile it feels like I fully immerse into the solar system and live in it i sincerely enjoy playing this game every minute of it. I discover new things about the game that I am unfamiliar with and love to explore. I sincerely recomend buying this game if you like survival games. I ALSO recomend mining to a planets core and mining the core completely out because that is fun.,ASTRONEER

2017-04-27,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This game is super fun for a little while and definitely has the basics in place however they never update it anymore with anything interesting and the lead artist and project manager have both now left the company (one through death one not) so I am not optimistic about getting anything out of this game.EDIT I admit I was wrong the game is being developed fairly slowly but has nonetheless seen a lot of new content therefore I have changed my review to a positive one.,ASTRONEER

2019-01-19,0,0,11,True,Recommended,A very different style of game that really brings something unique to the space/exploration genre. This game for me feels a bit lonely solo but as you create your base and travel from planet to planet you gain a real sense of purpose in the universe. Personally I really enjoy this game with friends. I had a lot of buggy experiences in the past but the last time I played after the game had a massive patch (Might've been full release) the game felt great and my friend and I racked up hours and were hooked!,ASTRONEER

2019-01-01,0,0,17,True,Recommended,Astroneer is an amazing game though I only recently bought it I have played it for extensive periods of time on friends devices. The game had a pretty good start back a few years ago (bugs aside) and had a moderately sized following. I have noticed that the game has evolved in just the right way to where it is the perfect balance of exporation crafting and somewhat of a tech tree. The game isn't that difficult or easy putting right right in the perfect blend of difficulty where it won't be too easy for hardcore gamers and won't be to hard for people who are just starting to play video games. The game's performance is outstanding and runs like a warm knife through butter on my disgustingly underpowered laptop so performance isn't anything to worry about. Overall I'd have to give Astroneer a 9.5/10 it is an amazing game and because it runs so well with such a small file size pretty much anyone can pick it up. Which you absolutely should.P.s. I it's also one of the veeeeeeeeeeeeery few games on steam to make it out of early access.,ASTRONEER

I may not have played it the most but it is a good game to progess and wait a bit and return to. There is so much to explore in the multiple planets wonderful art style and great graphics make this game full of moments to make you stop and take a lot. Don't stop too long if your not as a base because this game can take a little bit of planning and difficulty. When I had to get a metal from the moon I had to know what i need and what i have to bring and I like that. Good Game 10/10 Will Play again.,ASTRONEER

2017-06-27,0,0,27,True,Recommended,fun game definitelly not a game for potato pc's. but i have a powerfull computer so it runs fine and playable. it gets boring after a while but if you make a goal to travel to other planets then it is fun. i hope the developers will proceed updating the game but i wish there were objectives. now its basically an open world game for exploration.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-24,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"I never write reviews yet here I am. Wow this game is fantastic I am dumbfounded that this is pre alpha. No its not perfect yet there are a some bugs I have experienced only one crash. The freedom this game provides is fantastic it is all about ""doing"" you are givin extreamly little guidance and just get to experience the world for yourself. Alot of people are concerned with paying for a ""pre alpha"". I AM A CHEAP MOTHER F... and I am very happy with what I got for 20 bucks.Devs keep kicking Launch Edit I'm so happy to see this game launch! This is a stupendous game very relaxing and nearly everything you do feels fulfilling and yields some sort of progress. The worlds have grown brighter and more vibrant teeming with color truly a beautiful game. I can't say I've been dissatisfied with any changes the developers have made since since the pre alpha days.",ASTRONEER

2019-02-01,0,0,8,True,Recommended,There's definitely a lot of fun to be had with Astroneer but there's still a lot of room for improvement. The game has a nice progression curve and is overall extremely polished and delightful to play with friends. However this game desperately needs some sort of enemy or lingering threat that will spice up the gameplay signficantly. The only things that you can currently die to (as I am aware) are lack of oxygen fall damage a random poison plant and debris flying at you from the occasional dune storm. My only other real complaint (so far) is that the game relies heavily on symbolism and visual information for a lot of things (such as power oxygen levels) since it avoids using a standard HUD layout. It also utilizes extremely convoluted interfaces for crafting and inventory management. This is something that I am not sure if I like or dislike because on the one hand it feels very unique and interesting but on the other hand it feels really counter intuitive in a lot of cases. A lot of time spent on your first playthrough will be you just figuring out what anything even means.However I would still recommend it just because it's definitely a fun experience (especially with friends) and it's really well made in almost every aspect. Hopefully we get some future updates to flesh out this game into a fuller experience.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-05,0,0,19,True,Recommended,only played alittle doing its launch but i like it if you are into silly cute space games this is for you 8/10 could use more things that could kill you other than plants,ASTRONEER
2019-02-05,0,0,53,True,Recommended,This game is so simple yet so hilariously fun. The art design is beautiful and the online co op really makes it enjoyable for hours on end. Can't wait for the official 1.0 launch.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-05,0,0,58,True,Recommended,I built an awesome exploration truck with a bunch of cool extra trailers and gear built on it. Set off for a huge drive through caverns and ended up MILES from my base. Completely lost.Had to navigate back using planets rotation and alignment of stars. Took 2 hours. 11/10 would get lost again.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-05,0,0,206,True,Recommended,This is a very engaging game. You can easily lose hours to this game and that was when it was still in the Alpha and Beta stages. Now that it is fully out it looks so much better and finally having a goal to play to makes this game even more attractive than it was before.,ASTRONEER

I disagree with adding hostiles to the game. They made the right choice leaving it PvE the vibe is strong.,ASTRONEER
2019-01-19,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Great game as is but can lack replayability at time. Not going to give any big complaints until launch on February 6th as the full build of the game is promsing to greatly enhance the gameplay. I adivse to wait until launch to buy as the promises may not be fufilled but I am hopeful and trust that System Era will deliver.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-07,0,0,2,False,Recommended,This was great in early access and it's even better on release. I wouldn't say that it's a stress free game there are still a lot of systems you have to get your head around and the possibilities are almost endless once you figure out how everything fits together...kinda like Lego.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-07,0,0,54,False,Recommended,This is a great game that can be quite relaxing. The only issue that I have with it is that I got a bit too used to the alpha and now have kinda miss the old type of starting planet.,ASTRONEER
2018-12-24,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Not until the LAZY developers FIX the following things!I hear you ask ""Why you call them lazy?"" Because THEY ARE! I sent them countless emails about improvements bug fixes general fixes ideas etc and I didn't get a SIMPLE answer from them!It's a really nice and relaxing game BUT there are a looooooooot of staff that need to be added/fixed so we can keep playing calm.1. (FIXED) FIX this thing when driving the buggy/rover! I use the arrows instead of WASD and I can't steer my vehicle! I NEED the mouse to look around the vehicle not steering with mouse! Also! Up arrow means forward relative to the vehicle not relative to the camera! I have my mouse viewing the right side of the vehicle and when I press the vehicle goes RIGHT! What kind of mechanic is this? I haven't seen this before since THE FIRST HALO! (FIXED)2. Larger backpack capacity. Seriously! I have TWO hands and I can carry more things than this guy in the game! The following backpack attachments solar panel light oxygen tank and wind generator should take no space3. I want to change the terrain modules by pressing 1 2 3 etc. Not by opening the backpack &gt selecting the terrain tool &gt and adding/removing the modules. Also there's no need for the modules to occupy space. Do it like an ""update/upgrade"" on terrain tool. Also WHY THESE MODULES DRAIN POWER!?4. Here's the big deal. I built a smelting furnace on the one side of my base on the other side there's a vehicle bay. So if I want to build a vehicle I MUST carry the items with me! Insted of that since all the buildings are connected together the items would transfer among powerlines like a conveyor system.5. Make a cargo container.6. Also crafting items should be stacking like they are in Space Engineers Minecraft etc. I mean yes to build a buggy you only need 4 items (seat included) but that means half of the medium storage module. For example make a stack of maximun 9 of every item (9 resins 9 glass 9 scraps etc.) 7. A GPS system would be very very helpful.8. Enable us to build something to move in the air like a hover or a little plane (not nessesarily with aerodynamics physics) so we can roam around the planet. I know that launcing at the atmosphere and landing again is something new and convenient too so keep both.9. (FIXED) We NEED to dissasemble the modules from the platforms ex the ""Research Chamber"" from the ""medium platform A"". (FIXED)10. We need to deconstuct the buildings and return the half of the resources.EDIT 26 12 2018 (FIXED)11.(FIXED) FIX this thing with the key bindings! Every time I play the game I MUST change the keys to play. WASD is NOT convenient for me I prefer to play with the arrows! (FIXED)EDIT 27 12 201812. I went to Radiated planet and every 10 steps I had to struggle with INVISIBLE walls blocking my way! Also I couldn't build with my terrain tool every 10 steps too!EDIT 28 12 2018 (FIXED)13. (FIXED) FIX this thing with the planets! Everytime I go to space ALL the panets are ""deconstructed (FIXED)14. (FIXED)Came back to Terran planet from Radiated planet (Radiatied is a very windy planet) When I landed on Terran plants went crazy and the Astroneer was walking like there was a massive storm and protected his head head with his arms. THERE WAS NO WIND AT THIS MOMENT! I spent about TWO hours on Terran and the INVISIBLE STROM was there ALL THE TIME!(FIXED)EDIT 29 12 201815. I made a rover train of 4 rovers and ONLY the first rover has power to move the other rovers. Since they are CONNECTED they SHOULD powered and move all together with the same amount of energy like in Space Engineers.E_D_I_T patch 1.016. This game became havier than an aircraft carrier ship! We don't have NASA's hypercomputers! We don't even have Z1 gamings's PCs! Do you remember this testing buggy planet at the previous patch? Well now it's worst than that!17. EVERY single time I use the terrain tool it sounds and it moves like an AK47!RATATATA you ugly rock RATATATA usefull resin RATATA everything in the area!18. OXYGENATOR? REALLY!? R_E_A_L_L_Y??? Remove this thing! I prefer the tima that was FIXED on the Hub! Now I have to drive the rover with an oxygenator to provide me with oxygen!These at the moment. I'm sure I'll find more if I keep playing this game. Please consider my thoughts and keep pioneering!Now on the good impressions.1. The game is a really relaxing game the music is awesome for this kind of game. 2. You don't have to think how to spend resources there are plenty resources in every single pixel. 3. You don't have to worry about the power either the sun the wind and the organic are always there for you.4. Fun base building technique.5. The new cave system is AMAZING!6. Those purple ""pyramids"" are AMAZING too!",ASTRONEER
2019-02-08,0,0,155,False,Recommended,I really love this game. But I think there is a obvious bug in this game. when the crane dig the soil the soil bottle on the back have no any change. At before the soil bottle can quickly be filled. But now it is empty.,ASTRONEER

The Version 1.0 release has been great and they've added lots of stuff to *still* keep me interested! As of this review my stats show me having only 116 hours which is a lie as I've been playing for way longer (I think stem doesn't include offline play time?). If you like open world exploration games I highly recommend Astroneer!,ASTRONEER

2019-02-06,0,0,90,False,Recommended,I recommend this game to anyone looking for a great and original game however i'm very disappointed (personally) with the look and aesthetic of the full release of the game. In my opinion the flora has gotten a very Earth like appearance contrary to the alpha look and the main menu has change for the worse it is hard to pick a skin as you are only given the name and they have become quite unappealing and the overall look of the game changed almost completely leaving little of what it originally was. I'm not saying its bad not by a long shot. For the 60 hours i've played I appreciated the extra terrestrial look of the planets not barren not overly decorated with flora but still alien. Overall the looks of the game make it feel like you're returning to Earth many years later and life has just evolved. Take the trees for example they barred leaves unlike any you'ed see on Earth but now they just feel like adapted pine trees. Gameplay is great its just the aesthetic of the game and the menu that has changed for the worse.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-07,0,0,61,False,Recommended,You're gonna look at this game and think oh another survival sandbox game to add to the pile of games that I'm not interested in.I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. I'm here to tell you that this game is full of ideas that are well fleshed out and blend well into a lovely experience. Even if it may not seem to have a goal there are structures and planets waiting for you to find and explore them things to unlock and a gigantic tech tree that will have you digging deeper into the planet or going to other worlds entirely just to find the materials that you need for that next piece of the puzzle.This game is lovely to play to relax on your own or a blast to play with friends and work towards those otherworldly alien orbs in the sky the stars far beyond or even just mess around! Using plenty of clever design decisions and choices your inventory is limited without weighing you down the terrain is freely deformable but easy to manipulate (think rollercoaster tycoon brushes) and while there are no hunger or thirst systems there are just enough hardcore elements to punish you. Astroneer succeeds where Space Engineers Starforge and many others have failed.Even the graphics and terrain generation while appearing simplistic in nature are leagues above MANY other games on the market. It sticks to a simplistic clear and attractive style and does not stray away from it for even a moment yet continues to amaze me with its beauty.TL DR if you have even a slight interest in this game if your dreams are to explore the great unknown or if you've ever wished Minecraft wasn't as blocky buy it and give it a go. It will not disappoint.P.S. The problem of the game being unoptimized is subjective. While many say they can't run it with their chunky 10 series GTX cards I myself have a 1050 Ti and an i5 6600k and can run all settings at High pretty well. Just understand going in that it may hit you the same way it has others.,ASTRONEER
2018-06-22,0,0,18,False,Recommended,Something has changed with the latest update that affects how your character moves around. It's slower and more lethargic.This greatly affects the game and how it plays exploring the different planets just feels bad now.EDIT They changed it back now. Sometime between when my review was posted and full release.,ASTRONEER

2018-01-01,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,What they did with astroneer v1.0 is not a game realease. You can't do a serious release containing lots of bugs. I lost my save after more than 10h spent. They should not work in new features but full bug fixing instead until the game is stable as it should be.,ASTRONEER
2018-03-30,0,0,57,False,Recommended,This game went from good to bad then back to good it seems they've fixed this game. It's changed a lot since I've played it but so far after playing again it's good.,ASTRONEER

2018-01-17,0,0,96,False,Recommended,I really like this game. This is a game for those who like adventuring and survival games. I love the idea of how to make nase and collect resources. Also another thing i like about it is how the terrain is voxel in a way. 9/10 game!Edit I have watched this game grow. It has been amazing so far and I am pround of what the Devs have done so far. Wish there would be a optimization update though and so does my friend on his faulty potato laptop XD. Keep it up the amazing work and continue to suprise the community and me!! steamhappy Fun fact the terrain is generated by sound waves which also adds to the wow! factor of this game!Edit Now that the game has just been fully released. I just have to say that I am so proud of how System Era have made this game turn out. New beautiful cave systems to explore new terrain and plants. Unlockable dances player characters and colour palettes for them too. Me and my friend are really enjoying the game and this game deserves and 10/10 from me as a SCI FI and space lover. I was so overly excited when I took my first step into the breath taking world of the 1.0 Astroneer!,ASTRONEER
2019-02-07,0,0,33,False,Recommended,To start out this is an absolutely outstanding game. I bought this game on Feb. 5 2019 and 2 days later I have already put in 17 hours. Overall it is incredibly aesthetically pleasing and also is somewhat the ultimate relaxation game. The soundtrack mixed with the graphics creates a calm environment to enjoy either alone or with friends. Although I praise the creativity and look the one downside is that there are many optimization issues that result in major lag spikes (goes from 50fps down to about 10fps then back within 5 8 seconds). System Era is currently working on fixes for this but for now beware the lag. Other than this Astroneer is definitely one of my more favorite games in my library and I would highly recommend it to everyone.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-10,0,0,30,False,Recommended,Oh my goodness this is such a good game. I can not stop playing it. Highly recommend buying this game.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-10,0,0,35,False,Recommended,While ultimately I do like the game's content it does seem rather limited in diversity. The individual planets aren't very unique outside of a few surface biomes and underground layers that are only differentiated by depth and look the same throughout making it easy to get lost within seconds of tunneling into one.,ASTRONEER
2018-09-29,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I bought this game years ago in early access and wow has it come a long way. It's a sandbox explorer where you get an entire solar system to play around in with unique and charming planets to explore. There's no combat but there are plenty of ways to die if you aren't careful storms surprise holes in the ground dangerous plants running out of oxygen getting stranded on dangerous planets taking the rover too far and running out of power then oxygen etc. Your base is your hub for a while until you learn how to make spaceships and fuel then the real adventure starts. The terrain tool is still awesome you can make giant sculptures or ramps and see them from space. Situations to avoid Running out of fuel on an irradiated planet without any base structures or resources with you then having to build a small makeshift base and finding the materials to make fuel while dodging massive radiation storms that sweep across the planet.Mining the underside of a cliff while standing at the top to discover that you were on a boulder that is now falling.Sprinting without looking and falling down a giant hole that looks like it goes to the core. Exploring too far from your deployable oxygen lines and then getting distracted by a weird tree. Being outside during a severe storm and getting whacked in the head by debris.Taking a rover convoy far from your base and then accidentally scrapping the only solar panel/power source. Walking next to suspicious looking plants. There's a reason they look suspicious.Building a ramp high into space and then falling through the planet in a rover. Allowing your friends to build a giant that can be seen from across the solar system.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-07,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Low FPS Issue needs re optimization and the Draw distance needs to come back for lower end PCs and Better optimization for Hosts when playing with Friends.Other than that the new content is amazing and alot of fun and a Awesome game just needs more optimization,ASTRONEER
2018-09-13,0,0,173,False,Recommended,EDIT THIS REVIEW WAS FOR THE EARLY ACCESS. MY FULL RELEASE REVIEW WILL BE AT THE BOTTOM.This game has incredible potential and the company that is working on it System Era is putting a lot of time and love into the game. This is their first game and with everything they have done so far it shows how much passion they have for it. I am extremely excited to see what they do in the future. Hopefully more things to craft like different space suits that have a variety of benefits. The game is still in Early Access so expect a few minor bugs but nothing severly game breaking that I have found so far. The soundtrack is amazing. The crafting system just got a massive update and makes things more complicated which is actually enjoyable because it forces players to explore different planets more and collect more resources. Astroneer makes you want to explore. It prods at my curiosity and always lands me in sticky situations but it's always fun getting myself out of them. And when a game rewards you for exploring while also make the exploring fun and enjoyable then you know you have yourself an amazing game. I've made everything you can in this game up to this point. And within the day of me making this review I'll be making a ramp to space and launching myself in a rover. I haven't even touched 3 planets yet so the exploring is certainly not over yet. I absolutely love this game and anyone who enjoys resource based adventure/exploring games such as Rust ARK Minecraft Subnautica etc. Beyond that you have the option to play with friends which is why I would put this game above Subnautia. Hoping into a server with friends and chatting over discord or in person have been some of the best hours I've had playing video games. Exploring planets in buggys cave diving rescueing people off planets recovering someone's dead body launching into space together in different rovers and the list goes on. Everytime this game gets a new update I make a new world and spend way too much time playing it all to the end again. It's a game where you make the end goal. You don't have to do anything specific you can sit on the main planet and collect bytes forever if that's all you want to do. You can spend a whole day getting high and collecting debris from wrecks (that's from experience). Updates are few and far between but when they come out they are often big updates that add a lot to the game. This can be good and bad if you don't want to wait for a long time between updates. The developers are involved in the game so I doubt they will stop updating it which is good because if they don't then the game will have little to no replayability value. Things that I think should be added AchievementsEnd Game ItemsDifferent Suits (Low Gravity Jump higher and take less fall damage More Oxygen Harded resistance to physical damage like spikers storm blocks etc Gas Suit immune to both gas mushrooms Light Weight Run Faster etc...Emote Selection (Each model have their own emote set)More Variety in Enemies but Less Abundance (I hate trying to go into a cave and being walled off by 30 spiker mushrooms. That's 20 too many. Lower the amount I run into these enemies) I remember watching an update video about plants that can push the player around or plants that erupt in a volcanic way. That's a yes from me.Let me connect more than 4 large rovers together please. I want to make a rover train. * Give Marbles and Astronium a purpose. Give Diamond and Nanocarbon Alloy a purpose (new items and I think there can be so many craftable things with them).Another Planet (Just one for now) Bugs that need to be fixed If you try and craft another object while the chemistry lab is running you can break the lab and make items get stuck in it so it becomes unusable.Somtimes Tundra appears to be cut in 4 quarters while on other planets or in space (while on and orbitting Tundra it looks fine).Sometimes I'm able to see through the map. The ground kinda opens up.If you build a cave into a mountain and a storm goes by the game can't detect that it's underground so blocks will still spawn in the cave if it's big enough(in a natural cave the block don't spawn).If you plant a spiker seed on the unbreakable ground at your main base it's impossible to remove it with a basic tool. I think that maybe you can remove it with a drill since the drill head break unbreakable ground for ore patches but I'm not sure if it'll work on the base ground or if there is a difference between base ground and titanium/lithium ground.See you out there Astroneers.FULL RELEASE REVIEW I played about 145 hours of this game before the full release came out and as I boot up the freshly updated Astroneer I am awestruck at the amazing improvements graphically and gameplay wise. Just from my first few hours I can tell that I'm going to be putting in a lot more than just 145 hours into this game. They got almost everything right. I have little complaints so far as I am still only on the first planet when I'm writing this review but this game hits an emotional chord with me that I just felt it necessary to write about it now. Things they got right When I stated in my early access review about how they should add certain things and how updates were few but generally large they didn't step out of line with the full release. Coming with the new release are achievements which I previously stated the game needed. This is a HUGE perk for me as I am a completionist and will play this game to the core (pun intended). My goal is to get all the achievements but I will not stop playing when I have them all. With the full release I was able to start my experience off right and have crew of 3 buddies and myself in a world together. Without a doubt this is how the game is meant to be played. Surrounded by friends and just messing around having a good ol' time. This game is amazing when played with friends but don't take that as it's bad when played alone. If you're someone who enjoyed Subnautica or maybe singleplayer Minecraft then this game is right up your alley. It's all about the adventure and the journey to endgame but not endgame itself. They took some of my advice and added more endgame items more variety to plants/enemies and reduced their spawn so it's not a living hell to explore caves. You have an emote selection list along with customizable suits. This makes just sitting at base with your friends and dancing a highlight in it of itself. Laughing as you all do the MC Hammer dance on top of your base. These are the things that make Astroneer special to me. Certain items that didn't have a use in early access now have purpose and an abundance of new items and crafting methods has breathed fresh air into the game. There's not much else for me to say. This has to be one of my favorite games in existence for it's sheer level of childlike wonder it gives me every time I start it up. Get this game. Trust me.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-10,0,0,111,False,Recommended,It's a good game. Love it. But I started a game yesterday and now today everytime I click on the game it crashes.. Very sad and makes me feel like I've wasted my time.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-07,0,0,407,False,Recommended,"I have played Astroneer on and off since it was first available but decided to wait until release to review it. I've been impressed by the teams dedication to improvement through early access and eagerly awaited the finished product dropping this February and I've not been disappointed. The game has a pretty unique feel and style which I enjoy and the attention to detail has kept me coming back to explore each update.The game itself is incredibly open yes there are tried and true methods of starting out and progression alike but sandbox flair of ""play your own way"" is ever present you're not driven down a particular path or forced to complete tasks in a certain order (outside of having the gather specific resources for crafting purposes). The game gently nudges you into exploration and experimentation the balance of risk and reward is easy going and your ultimate goal is left pretty much only limited by your imagination (or free time I guess!). Want to dominate the galaxy with your elite mining and scrapping empire ? Go for it. Want to build recreations of the great pyramids on every planet ? Go ahead! Just want to build treacherous go cart tracks around your base and challenge your friends to beat your personal best ? Do it !! TL DR If you're looking for a fairly casual approach to space exploration sandbox survival this could be the game for you. With its bright quirky visual style laid back yet still immersive gameplay and surprisingly in depth crafting system you can spend countless hours planning and designing exploring and surviving or simply pushing unsuspecting friends into the nearest crater for funzies.

2017-10-16,0,0,180,True,Recommended,Since I bought the game in early access the amount of content at the time of me writing this (just days after the Terrain 2.0 update) is low. However the game has huge potential and the developers aren't just sitting on their arses. If you're the type of person to have faith in early access games like I am you will definitely enjoy playing this game and watching it grow and growing along with it.In short buy the game if you think you can wait for the good stuff a little ways down the road. Wait to buy it when that content is released if you think you can't. Either way you should buy it.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-07,0,0,9,False,Recommended,After playing the game for about an hour I feel it is my duty to explain to you exactly why you should purchase this game. First of all in the new release a ton of bugs were cleared. In the four or so hours I have on my new account the only bug I experienced was a glitch in the UI menu which was quickly solved by saving going back to the main menu and logging back in. This seemed to be a big problem in the early days of this game so I'm glad they have this resolved.Another thing I want to point out This is not an rpg or an intense survival game! For those of you who like rust or dayz turn away. For those who like to explore build and have fun with friends in a more peaceful setting this game is for you. Despite the simple polygon graphics I fell in love after just a few minutes of playing. Plus it wont take a huge toll on your computer. A lot of people were upset about there not being a ton of new stuff in the update but I think in the future we can expect many more things to build create and do as the developers keep working on it. One thing people pointed out was that there wasn't much to do as it mostly followed the same pattern. Again now that the first official release is here the developers don't need to spend as much time bug hunting and spend more time adding new content. A big aspect of game play is building bases and crafting components so if you were into the sort of tekkit minecraft scene you'll probably love this as well. All in all 9/10. Great work guys!,ASTRONEER

2019-02-10,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"Would I recommend Astroneer the simple answer is yes it is a great little game.I was wondering last night when I was playing it and thinking of writing a review why I would and the simple answer is it reminds me of being a kid and the sense of wonder I used to get from them. Astroneer reminds me of a time when I played games and it wasnt all laid out on a plate for you you needed to go look for things make mistakes go the wrong way and then when you finally made it work you got a sense of reward. Does the game has its flaws yeah totally but it is a week into v 1.0 from a small studio so any issues are totally understandable and certainly dont impact on the game in a way that makes me want to stop.Finally and this is the best thing I can say about the game is the desire just to keep playing it for a couple more minutes just to do one more thing (it normally becomes 3 or 4 but you know what I mean). If you grew up playing Civilization and hours of extra playing that came from you saying ""just one more turn"" you will get alot of enjoy from Astroneer.",ASTRONEER
2019-02-10,0,0,39,False,Recommended,"Space exploration with friends. What can beat that? But really tho'. The game is stunning graphics are amazing music is subtle yet still has an impact on you. Just when you think you have done everything you can on the planet you find out that there is a massive structure that you can power up to give you god knows what unlimited poweer! I love the game. I do. The devs did a great job with it and I hope most of the games would be able to captivate my attention so quickly )Yet there is a major issue. This is probably the most bugged a** game I have ever played. Buggies tractors ... pretty much everything falls thru the floor every now and then people getting launched in space without reason (when entering a vehicle). Fps is abysmal. 1080 with a i5 6600k Oc to 4.5k ""cannot handle"" consistent 60fps not to say that the more you play the game (discover more and have more items out) the worse it gets. Lowering/Upping the Graphic settings has 0 effect on the performance. If you check their forums you will see that every day the frustration builds up. I have no idea how a game could be ""released"" on such game breaking bugs...Enough rant from my side. If you wish to have a really good experience with a minecraft esk space game and see all the progress go down the drain when you get bugged and either die or get saved in space (in where you cannot have another backup save...) feel free to buy the game. Otherwise I really recommend passing it for a while until it is at least playable to the normal "" a minute without bugs"" gameplay. And no way is the ""full game release"" worth 20+$ ... not while it is being debugged by a chimpanzee without hands.Devs please. I really plead you. I know you have to make money and stick to the Alpha test business strat. Don't release the game just because you think it's ok. Fix it first. Make it perform better than you want it too. hell have it in test mode for a year more but don't do what astroneer did and have the 1.0 game out with too many bugs to play the game.

2016-12-16,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,Haven't reviewed this game since December 2016. Whilst a lot has changed it's mostly been quality of life improvements and refinements.The release build currently isn't all too stable. Towards the end of the beta the game seemed to be running fine but with release FPS stutters even on lowest graphical settings and crashes are abound making the game stressful and not worth playing since progress is quite slow nothing's worse then delving deep into a cave and having the game crash because you can't save unless you quit or go back to your base on the surface.Stability adjustments need to be priority as well as glitches involving deformation of rock. Rock tends to warp and cause holes in the geometry of the landscape allowing you to look through the planet. It's weird. Not to mention cave systems are a lot more obtuse now the one's that I've entered are shallow and require precarious mining downwards which just creates awkward work flow and disrupts the far superior surface to cave formations from alpha and beta.Currently wait for the game to become more stable. It's not a bad game but not investing time into when it effectively deletes progress.,ASTRONEER
2018-11-21,0,0,59,False,Recommended,UPDATE This game hit 1.0 now. It is amazingly good and as of this writing I've been playing it daily since release in 4+ hour sessions coop with a friend. Caverns are incredible looking now with extreme variety both as you get deeper and between planets and the breadcrumb trail of the game's untold story is fascinating and had me freaking out the first time I saw That Thing. Wonderful game and my original review's wishes for a breadcrumb trail of a story line to follow panned out beautifully.Original early access review below As someone who can't stand pretty much every open world crafting game this is really something special. Gorgeous environments concrete goals to build toward oxygen is your only mandatory survival resource and is free and infinite at home base and the satisfaction of an expanding base and the ever growing reach of your influence do a lot for my enjoyment of this game where no other open world does.I just can't build for building's sake you know? I gotta have a goal to build toward and basically no other open world game I've played allows me to do that.This game's come a long way too first build released was completely intolerable to me but with the latest version I've put in at least 4 playthroughs to the point of setting up a permenent base on another planet which is where the current version's goals kinda dry up.But the developer's roadmap include plans for an optional breadcrumb trail of goals for you to build toward and something of a story which I am greatly looking forward to.

Not officially launched version 1.0 comes with a lot of improvements. Astroneer its a survival game there are others like it but this have an very unique flavor goofy charismatic visual with simple animations cute plant design beautiful atmospheric enviroment shaders lots of items materials and several planets all procedurally generated.This is not a FPS RPG RTS or even a common survival. You can beat it in a couple of hours but the game thrives in its purpose to keep you bussy exploring new places expanding your base and travelling through harsh and beautiful landscapes.,ASTRONEER

2017-01-29,0,0,7,True,Recommended,Unlike many other people I've experienced very few issues with the game. It runs smoothly never dropping below 60 frames no screen tearing without vsync all while maintaining beautiful graphics. I've come across almost no bugs whatsoever and the ones I have seen are fixed upon a simple exit and restart.So what about the gameplay? There's not much to say about it other than it's an absolute blast. Very relaxing but interesting not so complicated that I don't understand the mechanics but not simple enough that it's boring. After the fiasco that was No Man's Sky this really is a breath of fresh air.Albeit at the time of writing I haven't put that much time into the game (a little over two hours) but so far I'm loving it. If it weren't for exams I'd be playing this nonstop.So far the game is wonderful in its execution and I'm eager to see where it goes in the future. I've heard many complain about lack of content which is an issue I would agree. But in its current iteration I believe this game is absolutely worth your time and money especially if it's on sale.Overall 9/10. I love it.,ASTRONEER

2018-10-23,0,0,78,False,Not Recommended,My first impression and review was a not recommend due to the options menu not being fully functional (could not change resolution). With the full release of the game I deleted my review because the options work and thus my review was no longer relevant. Unfortunately I just died do to a glitch that launched me through a planet from underground. I was not worried because I figured I could use console commands to get the stuff I lost back. Nope not going to happen as there are no console commands which is not good enough. Subnautica had similar quirks but I could fall back on the console commands to redeem the situation so all was forgiven. Not here I now have to go through the trouble of harvesting and recreating everything I lost on my character while walking on eggshells hoping it does not happen again no thank you.I suggest everyone read the EULA for this game.

2016-12-16,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,Patch 1.04 ReviewAs of this update I am no longer recommending the game until game breaking bugs are addressed. Until that time I suggest that it sits on your wishlist.There are two obvious bugs that are GAME BREAKING. Not just random either but consistent and heavily reported bugs. 1.) Players being randomly EJECTED upwards regardless of height. Surface Cave or Core of the planet it happens too often. This usually kills the player as well.2.) Vehicles getting stuck for no reason. My Large Rover Train that is only 3 rovers long will get frozen in place after exiting then re entering just about every time. Considering how often you will do this you can imagine how a 5 minute trip suddenly turns into 20 minutes of frustration where you just go back to your base and do something else. Oh and hope #1 doesn't happen or you'll have to find your rover again while hoping you don't die to #1 on the way assuming you can even get there.Simply put these 2 bugs are completely game breaking. The number of times I've died inside my base from bug #1 is absurd. The best part? It rarely happens on the starting planet so you are easily 2 hours into the game by the time you discover how often this happens when you get to the other planets (Calidor was by far one of the worst Novus wasn't far behind.)Yes this is single player still we haven't even touched multiplayer.Add in the poor multiplayer experience with missing terrain lag spikes when entering/exiting vehicles disappearing objects and other such nonsense that you'd expect to have been fixed before release. Oh and some of these bugs were not even present BEFORE the game came out.Finish it off with broken achievements and you'll find not a polished gem at release but a buggy mess (which some people reporting using the buggy just crashes the game entirely) that was not ready to be a Steam Feature. Simply put I wouldn't (even if I could) ask for a refund but to be fair the game when it works is a stellar game. There have been plenty of great moments in the game. Unfortunately these bugs dim any light because it has been a nightmare to play.Original ReviewI was quite excited to play Astroneer when it came out. My buddy and I started playing co op right from the start and we were not disappointed. If you are into having some co op exploration mining building etc then I recommended this title.The game is not without flaws but for the state the game is in it is pretty good. The planet is pretty large and I haven't even checked to see if I could goto another one yet albeit I have gotten into orbit to look around.I'll clean up this review once I have more time in and update it as the game progresses. If you were hyped about this game you will not be left disappointed.System Specs CPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 4790K Processor 4.40GHz CPU Cooler Corsair H100i GPU GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming Memory Corsair Vengeance 32GB OS Windows 10 Pro,ASTRONEER

2019-02-11,0,0,51,False,Recommended,"I've followed Astroneer for a while sort of checking in/out.It's a fantastic niche game. Exploration lite in the sense of it's not hard and yes it's grindy but it's very relaxing. I love that it doesn't hold your hand too much. A super game for 10 minutes of jumping in for ""one more mining run"" or for hours of exploring and checking out that ""next mountain over the horizon.""Worth the cost? I don't know. I think so but it's easy to see criticism of it It feels like it is a little light on content. But at the same time I really want to plow ahead research out everything build everything set up easy travel between all the planets find all the structures on each planet etc. So it does drive you to keep moving forward even though truly there's no real end goal.Some QoL bugs that are super irritating (currently the tractor bug where you occasionally have to hop in/out several times to get it to move) but unlike many developers I'm confident SES will fix it (and likely soon based on past performance).",ASTRONEER

2018-11-17,0,0,25,False,Recommended,I've been playing since wayyy before all these big updates and let me just say that this game has grown a great amount since the last time I looked at it. I thought I'd give a review while the sale is going on to get people to purchase it because these developers are awesome. This game was released a long while back and it's STILL getting big updates. Although it's been in early access for as long as I can remember it doesn't matter. The devs don't know when to quit its truly awesome. If only more triple A companies would learn by these guys' example.1.0 UPDATE REVIEW Holy damn it's finally out of 1.0 and I've already put several hours into the game to see what I've been missing out on and so far everything has changed for the better good. The annoying storm that came around every so often is gone which is great (although I'd like to see it on other planets to show uniqueness of each planet) and they completely changed how some things work like research (now you get currency from researching which is then used to unlock new buildings instead of just getting the building straight from simply researching one thing). Vehicles are still as a fun as ever and everything feels a lot more balanced and fleshed out from the last time I played. Also I get a cool retro outfit so there's that.

2019-02-11,0,0,183,False,Recommended,Look I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game. I picked it up in early early access and have always found something fun with it. I even recommend it to anyone who likes these types of games. BUT it is not bug free This is how a bug has ruined my enjoyment. TLDR Vehicles get stuck in objects because of a bug no consistent fix. Ruins late game IMO. If this doesnt bother you great it bugs me to no end.This is a complaint coming from a long time fan they need to fix the vehicle mechanics. Right now if you get towards the end game you can make a vehicle called a truck and check them together. You will also most likely encounter a bug where your trucks get stuck ALL THE TIME. I dont mean stuck on objects though that happens i mean literally stuck in the ground.. This bug has been around for years I've lost vehicles through the ground into the sky and now just the pure annoyance of not being able to go out and collect you know a major mechanic of the game because of a game jarring bug is too much. I was very excited about this game going 1.0. I put in 20 hours that week which for me is a lot as a parent. But this bug has made me turn it off. Do i recommend this game sure the devs have put out a love letter to the genre its a lot of fun if you are into this genre but this bug is driving me away.,ASTRONEER

Of course it's an early access currently on a pre alpha state and you will encounter many bugs some crashes and whatnot but overall it's a very enjoyable experience if you like the resource gathering/management games then you will find its uniqueness and for sure you're gonna love it. So yeah the devs are working hard based on the community feedback to bring more content such as fixes new features performance improvements and plenty more stuff. And for 20 bucks i think it's worth it give it a try i'm confident you won't regret it.Edit 02/12/2019 1.0 is finally out and a lot more stuff has been added to the game. What can i say if you liked the game before you will like it even more now!

2019-02-11,0,0,103,False,Recommended,"Edit Wow. The communications guy himself Joe Tirado(I assume judging by the jt) informed me that SystemEra changed the EULA within a day and posted what happened. It was their first EULA and they wanted it to encompass ALL current/future games made by SystemEra(I can understand that). This MIGHT include phone games developed by them that need more invasive permissions or ads for example(not their words mine). They quickly realized the mistake and fixed it for Astroneer. All Astroneer collects is anonymous user crash data when a crash happens. I LOVE this game again! Thank you all at SystemEra for listening to the players and staying on top of things. The only question now is ""do the rovers still get caught on every frigging rock!?"" lol. I'll know when I get home and reinstall XDBelow is my old review and is now completely obsolete LOVED this game since Alpha then it released on Feb 6 to full game and I HAD to uninstall it due to invasion of privacy EULA being shoved down our throats.

2019-02-11,0,0,38,False,Recommended,Pros Beautiful game great color and design.Interesting base building.Interesting research mechanics.Lots of room to explore.Lots of depths to uncover.Multiplayer!Cons There's no real threat at any point. The few environmental hazards are easily overcome.The exploration tends to be simply for the sake of exploration with a fairly uninteresting slog up the tech tree.Storage is a complete nightmare. You can't even build a storage container that holds more than your *backpack* until decently far into the game. Overall I find Astroneer to be a pleasant first experience. Great animations color palette and world generation makes one constantly pause in admiration. The base building system is well fleshed out and clever. The research system while a bit opaque with no tooltips is interesting and keeps you exploring.Where the game falls short for me personally is that with no real *threat* or hardship to overcome no real danger the game is really only interesting for a while. There's nothing to draw one back for another playthrough nothing to add that spike of excitement.I'd say the sale price is a good time to get what to me is a wonderful first experience with nearly zero replay value.,ASTRONEER
2019-02-13,0,0,29,False,Recommended,Terrific! 1.0.4 gets choppy as you expand the base to an industrial level especially with friends as the hosters fps stumbles but that's easily fixed. 30 hours in and don't plan on stopping.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-11,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Due to the fact that the devs have quickly responded to people's concerns and have addressed the EULA debacle I am changing my review.I am not a fan of survival/crafting games in general but Astroneer has won me over. No pun intended but it's so atmospheric. I have not tried the multiplayer but the single player experience gives the lonely feeling of being stranded on a planet far from home with only your wits and a dwindling supply of oxygen.It's a relaxing exploration experience yet there are moments of drama such as getting lost in a cave as I took one too many side passages looking for that hard to find material desperately searching for the exit as the seconds ticked down. The vibe is kind of like the film The Martian where your adversaries are not sci fi monsters but the occasional storm and the tyranny of a limited air supply.And I loved the satisfaction of finding wreckage making a new device and finally building a ship that could get me off the planet. Astroneer is probably not a game for everyone but I really enjoy its chill vibe.,ASTRONEER

Anyway for now though thumbs up for clarifying effort!OLD Remove the 3rd party advertising app from the game COMPLETELY and INDEFINITELY.

2019-02-11,0,0,31,False,Recommended,The core game is solid. There's plentiful examples of solid design choices (making the shape of metal ores have a more angular shape versus the softer edges of harvested resin or organic material ore color/geometry makes your increasing stockpile of resources easier to manage) the game has a gorgeous colour pallet &amp eye pleasing animations. Many aspects are very intuitive. A few are not. This is my only complaint with the game is that the tutorial is very short and while the F1 tooltips are nice simple and trimmed they still don't fully address a couple core questions I had when booting the game for the first time what am I doing here? I mean exploration sure....but do I have an end goal? Or maybe that's part of the game's meta. Either way I can say with confidence this was $30 well spent.,ASTRONEER

This has been an inconvenience from the start but it hasn't really come to mind 'till now and this is about beacons. When used underground they become quite useless another rather underused feature as well is the compass that appears around the player when the backpack is hovered over with the cursor. I though to add fuctionality to the compass and improve beacons was to add some direction indicator for beacons on the compass.,ASTRONEER

2019-02-13,0,0,254,False,Recommended,I have experienced the progress the game made from EA(Early Access) until it's release I like building and exploring and I just LOVE space. So I bought it EA and I have to say that my faith in the average creator was restored with every patch that the game brought. With every patch there where new and exiting things to find making it worth to start over with your character and see what the developers had made for us. I can truly say I enjoyed it every step of the way.(Aside from the time that collision wasn't really a thing and characters would just fall through the layers in the very early stages of development ')The release of the game was just more then I hoped for. Especially with the many unfinished realeases of the year I was in extacy to find a solid game. The mechanics work there is a WIDE variaty of materials and worlds to explore and when you reach that other planet I really does feel like a whole new world to explore. The game has extended the durability of it's gameplay by hours since the release but most of all it feels like a finished game. I will give this game and temporary 8/10 due to not able to enjoy the multiplayer experience yet. TBH I'm waiting on the other guy... anyway I will give them a big fat badge of honor. Because so many had failed where these guys these TRUE developers have succeeded. To deliver an enjoyable finished game.,ASTRONEER

I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes the kind of exploration and mining found in Empyrion. I enjoyed what I got to play. I've read about a few bugs at the moment and only saw one myself but I wouldn't describe the state of the game as buggy. but heads up to anyone who's careful with what they download and leery of potentially intrusive data mining by third parties. You may want to take a look at SES' Privacy Policy before you purchase not the revised EULA. That's irrelevant since SES insists the Privacy Policy supersedes anything else including the EULA. One of the non starters for me was the broad range of powers ""without limitation"" the policy gives to third party business partners and associates that may be installed on the consumer's computer at SES' leisure. The Privacy Policy is the main reason I requested a refund. I want the game without all the legal fiddle faddle. If they ever remove some of the ambiguities I'll snap this game right back up.",ASTRONEER
2019-02-13,0,0,31,False,Not Recommended,Very disappointed in the final release I think I played it more when it was early access.There's a lot of good points in Astroneer but there are too many negatives for me. I won't be trying to finish it.Third person camera argh! Soooo easy to not see the edge of a crevasse and the poor inertia means you don't stop in time.Weird physics acts like you are on the moon one minute then you can abruptly be turned 90 degrees by a small obstacle. I'm in a spacesuit so how am I getting poisoned by gas clouds? And don't get me started on that surfing rubbish....Respawn system sucks because you will clean out all resources near your base so you are effectively starting the game with less resource each time. At least allow us to respawn on nearest vehicle or something. Going back to same point just makes this game a grinder.Too random the last game I played there was sweet FA in way of resource at my landing site and crevasses everywhere. When I fell in one I just gave up been there &amp done that way too often to like it.,ASTRONEER

To think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game no matter how old the game is is just to update a new user agreement.That would be like Nintendo in the 80's locking a NES copy of Super Mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter.

If you hate Dwarf Fortress you might not find Kenshi a pleasant experience.If you love Dwarf Fortress though as I do may Armok smile upon your efforts as there is a lot of FUN here to be had.You and your team are going to have multiple unpleasant experiences.Beaten up? Knocked out? Lost a limb? Jailed? Enslaved? Killed?This will happen and you will carry your wounded to a bed so they can recover if you have managed to stabilize them enough to not lose them on the way. You will replace their limbs break them out of jail or you will bury them in the desert.My experience of Kenshi after first few days of playing with it I've played it safe had a house in a city earning my living by some mining cooking my own food training the new orphan girl I hired from the Hub to do things around the house. Never stole a thing except looting some bandits who died when they chased me to a ninja trading outpost. Ninjas ain't no joke. On one of the mine trips we've got attacked by hungry bandits again. We've run to the guards and they pacified the bandits but my trusty companion Ruka got hurt in the head really bad. I've carried her to the town it was night all shops were closed and we had no bandages to stop her bleeding and they didn't have any at the bars. Got to use all my money 6k cats to hire a guy who said he is a medic. He was and he had the bandages and all the fancy medical stuff and he saved her. She got way stronger since then my brave Ruka sometimes she even helps City guards with the bandit criminals. The medic name is The Wall he is a bit lazy but we keep him busy training with the crossbow turret and making medkits at home. We're glad to have him.Sometimes I go out in the desert hunting goats bonedogs or mighty garru. It takes a lot of kiting with the crossbow to down an animal but I can always use the training in both crossbows and running. I'll get better.We've started our own camp few minutes away from the city gates wanted to mine stone so we could make our own building materials as the store in the city doesn't have such a strong supply. We had the production facilities set up but not the walls some raiders came claimed the place as their own they were armed and armored we were not a match so we just ran. We will get back our camp at Crossroad Wreck one day. The orphan girl got good at researching too and we already know how to build decent walls and proper crossbow turrets. I frequently visit the explorers shop just down the street when we run with Rukka with backpacks full of Iron every morning to increase our strenght. They have books there some of them tell stories about riches in the swamps and the dangers there. We will go there too in time. Conclusion There is no winning at Kenshi. There is no victory condition set out for you. This is a good thing.It is a storytelling device a sandbox a plaything.You play it like you would play with your lead soldiers back in the day when there were toys that were not computer programs.Your experience depends entirely on what you chose to do when you play with it. Play it as the RPG immerse in the story that unfolds however grim and unforgiving it might be and you will surely have an interesting story out of every attempt.I bought it exactly for that and if you're looking for a storytelling device set in a post apo alien world mad max drifter samurai ninja robot setting... well friend... there is no other game that will scratch that itch.Update after 158 hrs in the game Squin life was going pretty slow and easy as town life should be. We made pretty big money mining and we hired all the Shek warriors that were looking for work in Squin bars. They're Ruka's squad now and we call them ""Black Guard"". You should see them how they deal with bandits nowadays. Namir tall as a mountain with this tiny high quality sabre in his giant hand Ruka with a plank worth twice as much as our house sweeping it like a scythe through a field cutting down the enemy as if they were blades of dry grass. Loudmouthed Kang and quiet Nines both good with the Sabre too and two medics all well equipped with the best armor of our own production. They're no joke now. The entire roof of our house was dedicated to their training for months. Weightbenches training mats attack training dummies we had it all. Plus two cages where we kept whatever we could catch. A knocked out Garru a wild Bonedog or a Bandit. We mostly used those to train defense. I've went to Hub once again recruited that sweet cook Molly she was the first person I ever spoke to in the Hub back then when I only had a rusted iron stick to my name a ragged shirt and a pair of pants. She now makes our cactus food while the orphan girl Heft works the crossbow turret at the Crossroad Wreck entry gate. We have double perimeter walls and enough turrets to perforate a small army to look like Garru cheese. Invaders do not get to live long. That group that threw us out of our town back when we just placed first production facilities... Last time they came the fight lasted around a minute and we had really hard time trying to stabilize just a few of their dying to save them for the fight house. Times have changed. Our fields of cactus hemp and wheat whisper softly in the northern wind. We are essentially independent of Squin right now. Wind turbines whirl lights flicker water burbles in the wells. A life we have built in this at first sight inhospitable desert did not come easy but that makes us cherish it even more. In a shadow of this giant wreck of a mysterious ancient structure we have made a safe place to call our own. To build what we wish and how we wish it. We've researched almost everything we possibly could from the books available at Squin adventure shop and I see our Chief Smith Engineer Foren sometimes standing on the roof of the industry building looking west. We brought her from the waystation that way and she says somewhere beyond there are places where hidden knowledge and treasures lie waiting to get discovered and claimed. We also brought a Bugman named Hep from that place. A funny looking tiny very thin fellow. An extraordinary nighttime operator. It is not a problem for him to sneakily knock someone out and carry them away. We had him actually steal a prisoner from Squin tower once. A cute but angry looking girl with one hand. We brought her home healed fed she didn't mind joining us. I mean who would? We bought her a robotic arm from a Hiver caravan it goes well with a drifter jacket. For now we've attached her as crossbow girl to the Special Ops squad. Our army needs to branch out if we're to conquer the wasteland.I imagine we will go west soon. Once we're ready.

2018-07-11,9,189,101,True,Recommended,"Kenshi is ugly opaque confusing buggy and unwelcoming. It demands patience and persistence with no immediate rewards. It makes no allowances for the inexperienced the inept or the videogame illiterate. It actively defies you to give up and uninstall within the first 10 minutes of play. It also happens to be a little bit brilliant.Having vaguely followed Kenshi's development for years and having bounced hard off the free demo released a few years ago I finally picked it up on sale confident that I would probably Steam refund it after my second try. One week later and I've hardly played anything else. It's quite likely you're suffering a little cognitive dissonance as your eyes drift from the rather unpromising screenshots and trailers packed with outdated graphics an ugly UI and vague overambitious sounding statements to the Steam reviews which are currently 87% positive. You may be worried that Kenshi is one of those games that is really enjoyable for hardcore min maxing basement dwellers but totally inaccessible to anyone else and that's a legitimate concern. Kenshi does ask you to invest time and patience to get the most out of it I want to convince you that the investment is worthwhile.As the trailers suggest you start off as a nobody in a harsh post apocalyptic world filled with people (and monsters) that comprehensively outnumber outgun and outclass you. And that's it. There's not a main quest that doles out steadily improving powers and gear there's not a friendly NPC who gives you some cash and directions to an easy fight with decent loot. You exist in a hostile world that can and will kill you moments after leaving the starter town it's how you bounce back and start making that world your own that makes Kenshi stand out.There's a moment of existential dread that sets in when you look out over the scorched wasteland with nothing more than some rags a rusty iron stick and half a day's food in your pack wondering what the hell to do next and if it's even worth it. Fight through that dread. That feeling of aimlessness and hopelessness is just mainstream videogames leaving your system you get so used to a smooth tutorial and a clear path ahead that all the freedom in front of you is straight up daunting. What should you do? Just start walking. The world of Kenshi is huge and contains rather more colour and diversity than the trailers make out. There are roaming bands of marauders mutants cannibals and religious zealots there are fortified cities hardscrabble farmsteads and infested ruins there are foetid swamps blasted deserts and weird fungal valleys just as peculiar and intriguing as anything out of Morrowind. When you start out this world is going to reject you there's nothing you can face in a straight fight and nowhere safe to lay down roots. To get anywhere you'll have to sneak steal starve and yes get the kicked out of you every now and then. Life at the bottom of the food chain is tough and it can feel like you're not making progress but in reality everything you do is making you tougher. Getting walloped makes your character hardier losing fights improves your combat skills and the scraps you pick from the aftermath of procedural battles between NPCs can provide some much needed gear. In my first few days I scrounged up enough money for the materials to put up a small shack. I built it away from civilisation tucked into the crevices of a mountain by the swamp hoping maybe to scratch out a living by farming before venturing out and doing some walloping of my own.Bandits came and beat me up. Raptors ate my first crop then my second crop then every harvest after that for a week. Desperate I wandered deeper into the swamp looting the remains of swamp bandits who had been eaten by blood spiders (blood spiders?!) as I went. I found a settlement pawned my paltry pickings and signed on a couple of outcasts willing to join me for free. Back to the shack we went where once again the raptors ate our crops and the bandits doled out humiliating beatings. The next time they came back there was a wall and a big gate. They just knocked down the gate. The time after that there were crossbows mounted on the walls and a few more drifters on our side. They got through the gate but no farther. We do the walloping now.Kenshi erects some fairly high barriers around itself and a lot of the best fights and features are locked behind those barriers. This starts out feeling like a problem but you come to realise that overcoming those barriers make every success no matter how minor seem immensely important. The struggle to survive never stops being real and no threats ever become so trivial that they can be safely dismissed. This means you are invested in your characters and in the world in a way you rarely feel in other games by the time you get a handle on things you've come so far and have so much to lose that the drama of the game world is always gripping. How many times in other games have you been warned by some Cortana knockoff ""Oh no a wave of dangerous and battle hardened foes is approaching try not to poop your pants!"" only to be faced by more of the same goons you've been absent mindedly mowing down for hours? This never happens in Kenshi. Kenshi never has to artificially inflate the stakes because the stakes are always real. Kenshi never has to script its drama because its drama is generated automatically by your interactions with the world.Once you've got past the rocky start the dodgy presentation the occasional wonkiness of the AI and the overall hostility of the world the freedom the developers promise really is there. You choose your own adventures and your own goals there are fights to be had rivals to be made bounties to be collected factions to befriend or destroy and a surprisingly deep city building element you can pick up or ignore completely as you see fit. Kenshi will reward all the time imagination and obsession you pour into it just give it a chance!",Kenshi

With a few cherished moments of pure elation! I still haven't explored the entire map. I like to look into every nook and cranny and climb every hill just to see whats on the other side.I've owned homes in every city. But the place you build for yourself is always the best. I've built small mining outposts ninja hideouts fortresses and vast cities. I've built in narrow canyons atop mesas in rainsoaked swamps windblown deserts in a tranquil forest (if you don't mind the cannibals) on mountaintops the spiderplains and one place best described as hell adjacent. Ok so maybe two three places were hell adjacent.I've tried every starting scenario that comes with the game. My favorite is still Rock Bottom.Rock Bottom Things you don't have friends weapons armour clothes first aid kit food left arm hopeRock Bottom Things you do have rags you call underwear ribs showing through your skin because you are dying of starvation true grit no hold on that grit is just some sand in your rags right arm complete with middle finger for the world that left you here to die like thisI like to roleplay. I come up with a main character idea and role play how they would survive Kenshi. You can pay some NPCs to make them join you I wanted to try a playthrough where I didn't pay anyone to join me so Atticus was born Atticus was a lone wanderer who had recently escaped slavery himself. He scraped by mining and selling the ore to earn enough to eat. All the while keeping his eyes on the slavers manhunters slave mongers and slave hunters who scoured the countryside of the United Cites for their next victims. And when he noticed some flesh peddler marching their fresh catch to off to the market he followed behind. If one of the slaves was too slow to keep up with their master he would sneak up and pick the lock on their shackles freeing them. Occasionally a grateful slave joined Atticus. And then another and another. With several new friends they set off to unsettled lands to build a new home where everyone could be free. But they still went back to free more slaves. Eventually Atticus built an army powerful enough to crush the United Cities and their Nobles who'd grown wealthy off the forced labor of others. I've even done a solo bounty hunter play through hint do cardio. I've done some crazy play throughs where I pick a TV show movie or a book and name all characters I recruit after a character form that source and do my best in the editor to customize them to look like their character. I also limit myself to the number of named characters (the base game allows up to 30 characters but mods extend this to 256). The key point is to roleplay them as if they were that character. I've done this with Archer and Futurama and had a blast with both runs.I like that I get the freedom to do whatever I want in Kenshi.Mods. This game ha0s 1 521 mods and it's not even to version 1.0 yet. I've made several custom start scenarios for myself and a few other simple mods (that didn't require new 3D models) after about an hour of research in the forums at the Lo Fi Games official website.Some things that will eat you Cannibals a simple people who live life free and au natural. Skin Spiders fast moving hard hitting nightmare fuel. Fogmen poor unfortunate people who've been reduced to their most savage drives. Beak Things malformed love child of a chicken a giraffe and a tortoise. AKA ""The Gutters"" Blood Spiders smaller bloodier redder fast moving hard hitting nightmare fuel that can smell the delicious blood of your unbandaged wounds from much further away.. Cannibals there are a lot of cannibals. Bonedogs they wont actually eat you but if you lose an arm or a leg they'll run off with it while playing keep away with their packmates until one of them eventually eats it. Adorable.Do I like Kenshi?I'm still not sure. Maybe I need to put in a few hundred more hours. Yeah just a few hundred more... This game is not for everyone. There are some simple tutorials in game but it doesn't hold back on the brutality. You start off much weaker than everyone else in the game. Your characters skills improve only by using them. The only way to get tougher is to get beat down. The only way to get better at fighting is to fight warriors better than you.A lot of reviews mention that the graphics are not great but they are good enough for me. I like this game for the gameplay and re playability not the graphics (just check my hours!). This game isn't made by a big corporation. Its designed and led by a single guy with a passion for gaming and a dedication to his vision. He got some backers and started making this game. It is a labor of love. Harsh cruel brutal love. To get a really good idea of what this game is like check out the following on YouTube Biscuit Dog's Kenshi series. He's been playing this game since 2016 and has over 200 vids! You can see the game evolve over time. Don't recommend watching too far into his series unless you're OK with spoilers. He explores the entire map and does all sorts of cool things. Note that Biscuit Dog's vids start off kinda slow but you also get to see him develop as an YouTuber and his vids become very cinematic tightly edited and highly entertaining https //www.youtube.com/watch?v txtAWDcZxgAbyssle's 'A Noob Kingdom' where he starts building a base right away and suffers for it...a lot. I'm honestly surprised that guy's Noobs have survived as long as they have. Really they go through a lot in one place. Its kind of amazing. Also great for the sarcasm and burtality https //www.youtube.com/watch?v PrEL7YXfcsQ",Kenshi
2018-05-05,195,415,42,True,Recommended,"My first experience of Kenshi. I spawned in the desert town of Sho Battai a thousand credits to my name a few rags for clothes and a pocket full of marijuana. My name is Eddie. The randomise button on the character creation screen had randomised me into a dishevelled version of formula ones Eddie Jordan so my name was set. Sho Battai looks like something out of Mad Max 2. Post apocalyptic types wander around going about their business a guy casually walks past with a body slung over his shoulder etc. I make my way toward the nearest public toilet. It s a small shack made from poor quality wood and corrugated iron sheets but an NPC beats me to it. He sits there smugly with the door open taking a dump. I decide to wait for him but he s obviously enjoying himself or skiving from work because he takes ages. I give up and leave. The next most obvious place to check out is the local bar so I head there. The bar is pretty busy with various shady characters sat about. I hover my mouse cursor over the most interesting looking ones and it changes to a speech bubble as it graces the head of a particularly dodgy looking bloke. I saunter over and awkwardly start a conversation. Turns out hes a fence and hes pretty open about it. I wasn t planning to be a thief but its good to know where the local buyer of knock off goods hangs out. Making my way to the bar I have a look at what they have to offer. They sell various alcoholic beverages as well as an appetising sounding food called nutrition block. In the end I purchase myself a water jug and a few rations of dried meat because thats what I would have done IRL. I check out a few more vendors in town. Theres a guy who specialises in crossbows another in swords and a general store. It dawns on me that im poor as I see rusty short swords going for thousands of credits. Disheartened I wander back out into the desert air. Out in the street (if you can call it that) a fight breaks out. I have no idea who the protagonists are but about ten guys are slogging it out with iron bars and crude swords. Its not long before someone gets battered and collapses dead in a heap at the periphery of the battle. I smell loot and run up to the corpse. I grab his backpack and rip off his tatty but better than mine clothes and slink away. Looking back to the still raging fight I see the apparently now not dead guy get up and limp away disorientated and minus his pants. He swiftly gets battered to death by what I assume is a local copper. My smirk quickly fades as the copper turns his attention to me. Before I know it fight or flight kicks in. Very much in flight mode im running about six coppers with clubs and swords chasing me down. They catch me and after a sound beating im dragged off to a jail. They confiscate everything I stole from the dying fighter except the backpack which turns out to be empty. They let me keep my hash and my dried meat. The tutorial informs me that ive been imprisoned and I can either serve my sentence or try to escape. I opt for doing my time and wait patiently. Other prisoners come and go. Days pass the light rising then fading in the foetid jail house. From my cramped filth ridden cage I see other prisoners being dragged in. Some seem ok others are near death and have obviously received a beating far worse than the one I did. They lay slumped in their cages blood oozing from their bruised bodies. There seems to be no hope of release so I start messing with the huge padlock on my cage trying to pick it and find a way out. The guards don t seem bothered by my change of routine. Perhaps they know its futile. After hours of fiddling with lock I finally get it open. Its around 3am now. I ease the cage door open and sneak toward a door which leads out to a balcony which I figure is a good way to go. Either the guards are all psychic or they have just been waiting for this moment. They appear on the balcony and thrash the living crap out of me. Only this time they want to make sure I don t escape again. One guard hacks off my left leg below the knee. My severed leg is hurled from the balcony and jams itself into some railings on the floor below. My amputated body is hurled into a new cage and securely locked within. They take my back pack. Covered in blood I bandage my stump as best I can and wait fully expecting to bleed out. Days pass again and yet I still live. My leg is gone forever but the wound starts to heal. Eventually after a couple of days more a guard approaches my cage informs me im free and opens the door. Im thrown out of the cage and onto the jail house floor. Im not escorted from the building and I have to crawl like a crippled mess down the stairs to freedom. The guards all turn to stare as I humiliatingly crawl through their post apocalyptic staff room and out into the night air. Efforts to retrieve my undoubtedly decomposing leg from the railings fail as its out of reach. I crawl through the sand back to the bar. Hauling my crippled frame through the entrance a patron remarks that he s surprised I don t don t get arrested on the spot for looking so pathetic. I survive now as Crippled Eddie I steal bits and pieces from around the town selling them to the fence for next to nothing. It does make me enough money however to buy some dried meat now and then. Inevitably a week later I end up back in prison for burglary. Theres a prisoner in the cage opposite me. Shes also missing a leg. Well not entirely missing it its on the floor just outside her cage. Shes also missing an arm. I start a conversation with her and she hilariously suggests that we break out together and ""Make a run for it"". I turn down her overly optimistic plan and she passes out. I watch her food bar tick down to zero. Shes starving to death.Kenshi doesnt care about you you arent a hero. Apparently you can raise armies build your own settlement become a farmer etc. I doubt it though its a harsh harsh world in Kenshi. Youll probably end up a crippled beggar like me or worse. You are irrelevant here. Even when you die the game keeps on playing without you as if to emphasise that point. People stroll past your rotting corpse probably just glad it isnt them laying there.",Kenshi
2015-01-25,934,3067,141,True,Recommended,I remember when I first got this game back in summer of '13. I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back some cash and a rusty sword. First thing to do was to find some buddies to help and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then luring guards to get killed by starving bandits and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss effectively saving the town.It was the three of us for a good long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out myself having a good long coat Vedi with a huge cleaver and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point or dead there wasn't much worry of our safety by now. We had almost finished the small base with Vedi and I working on some some construction so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?We didn't even make it halfway across when we found him laying on the ground. His hat and sword weren't far from him and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried I stared for a good long time before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment which some members looked wounded and slaughtered them all with Vedi after he finally caught up.Time has passed since that day and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town with nearly eight residents there all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people and would die for them they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.R.I.P. Dirt.10/10,Kenshi
2017-04-27,14,540,40,False,Recommended,You know it honestly feels like a joke at first. There s thousands of games out there some offer compelling storylines others offer non stop thrills and pretty much all of them let us escape the dull monotony and grind of daily life... And then there s Euro Truck Simulator 2. Which unsurprisingly is a simulation game where you drive trucks around a crude rendition of Europe. Okaaaay. To emphasise the absurdity of things you only need to look at the basic gameplay loop that s taking place here you pick a job from a list of options in your area. You go and hitch up your cargo. Then you slowly trundle towards your destination taking into account every road law and speed limit and spending the great majority of your time on vast highways and never ending strips of asphalt. After dragging yourself to your destination for 20 to 30 real time minutes you drop off the cargo and do the whole thing again.Suffice to say then that this isn t for everyone there s a good chance a few of you have fell asleep merely reading the last paragraph. If you do actually get to the point where you boot up the game for the first time it even does a lot to try and immediately frighten you off... You re instantly met with a plethora of menus that are incredibly overwhelming allowing you to do everything from create a profile to adjusting your X axis sensitivity for... Well something. The tutorial then doesn t help matters basically stemming down to telling you Just drive the truck and then buggering off and leaving you to work out how exactly you do that in the first place. Yet give it a chance to get things rolling and amazingly and most crucially it really works. There s a bunch of reasons why this is the case that go way beyond the primal satisfaction that comes with driving a hulking great big rig. For one there s an incredibly calming sense of slow progression constantly burning away in the background with the sat nav in the corner of your screen always slowly ticking down the miles left towards your destination. It s surprisingly satisfying to watch the numbers keep dropping and finally whittling a distance that seemed impossible to begin with down to nothing. Secondly there's the option to turn on your own music while driving or even tune in to actual radio stations across Europe. Set one of these up and hit the perfect moment where the right song comes on as you watch the sun slowly rise and peep through the trees and it all just feels Right. Heck take my word for it when I say that having AC/DC s Highway to Hell blasting out your speakers as you re racing down the road at max speed is something that s hard to beat. If you re daring you can even pop a video or TV show up in another window and zone out... But just like real life the chances of you suddenly finding yourself wrapped round the nearest streetlight rapidly increase if you do this. Still it s fun to try. In the game that is. There s also a healthy degree of strategy mixed in as well. Your truck needs fuel and your driver needs rest and managing the two becomes a delicate balancing act of effective time management where you are constantly checking out your route and seeing how far you can push yourself before you literally fall asleep at the wheel. While it takes way too long if you re not wishing to put yourself in a position of extreme bank debt (so much so it actually gets a little frustrating) you can even make enough money to hire other truckers to your cause. Suddenly you re busy plotting out an empire trucks roaming across all of Europe and your hard work being rewarded with a skyrocketing bank account. You can even make the core game more complicated if you re that way inclined. An automatic gearbox might be the obvious choice but there s nothing stopping you from having to switch through all the gears manually or even hooking a wheel up and going totally crazy. The choice as they say is yours.It s also worth pointing out all the mods that are available to enhance or change things up from the big changes to the little tweaks there s a lot you can bolt on to the base experience. Whether it be branding the sides of trucks with famous logos or subtly changing the map and the way your truck handles there s a lot you can tinker about with if things are starting to feel a little dry. Special shout out to the mod that lets you personalise the inside of your truck because there s something irresistible about decking out your cabin with a giant BB 8 and a bunch of other nerdy bits and bobs that fill up every empty space. While not offered in the game or mods themselves (and I can't say I tried this myself) there s also means out there to take things online hitting the road with truckers all over the world. Chances are you ll end up in a traffic jam trying to get a ferry to somewhere but hey whatever floats your boat. In the end whatever you choose to do and however seriously you take what s on offer Euro Truck Simulator 2 is perhaps the definite chilled out experience with everything always just coming back down to you and the open road. It s the perfect game to unwind after a stressful day where the challenge or intensity of most other games simply doesn't appeal and that's what makes it something so much more than something to laugh at.,Euro Truck Simulator 2
2016-12-14,111,781,2958,False,Recommended,As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily.

2017-11-14,93,320,32,False,Recommended,Man I'll keep this short.Started a job a small one from Plymouth (England) to Rennes (France).Put on my favourite radio station through the game's radio streaming option Hotmix radio (French station that plays 80's music non stop with NO talking other than the odd jingle).Get 'Cutting Crew (I Just) Died In Your Arms' blasting out.Driving down the country lanes of France at night with 'Died In Your Arms' playing in the background... you know this game is good.I feel like you NEED music on when playing this game unless you like engine noises similar to those that enjoy that whale noise thing.It's not a complicated game. You pick a job drive form A to B get paid. You can run a trucker business as well. It's relaxing as f**k. Not going to lie.Just... just find Hotmix radio favourite it and you're set.You get all the greats like Queen Bee Gees Dead or Alive Erasure Culture Club Human Leauge Pet Shop Boys Kate Bush. You know... All the greats. The list goes on. I'm only 21 but f**k. I feel like I'm 45/55 (no offence to any 45/55 year old's).Got a cup of tea playing Euro Truck 2 with a 80's station on at the age of 21. It's just nice... to play a game after a long day in the evening for a couple of hours every few nights.Euro Truck 2 is worth it. Honestly. It might look sh*t I said that when I saw it but now look.

2014-11-10,16,400,62,False,Recommended,Much like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013 I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why. Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage but a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compelling.There is no way I can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab. You re a truck driver and are starting your own shipping company. You have to drive according to the law take rest breaks buy fuel pay for upkeep. There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game yet for what it is Euro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable. I recommend everyone to give it a try.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

Earn money level up buy garages and more trucks then hire workers to drive them. Build a trucking empire whilst traveling across beautiful scenery with realistic looking sunrises sunsets fog and rain. Works with keyboard mouse game controllers and steering wheels not to mention TrackIR and Oculus Rift. With great mod support and regular DLC this game remains fun and enjoyable almost three years after release. Just buy it then you'll understand.,Euro Truck Simulator 2
2014-11-08,18,493,130,False,Recommended,"Top notch truck driving simulator. With support for TrackIR wheels and pedals this game has become a gem of the simulation genre.Before having tried it it's hard to see why this game will be so addicting. I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers.You ""level up"" various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo.Driving the trucks is a pleasure. It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman. That said if you disable the speed limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow! Speed cameras will become your enemy though.Unfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate. In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly. Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either.In any case this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game. Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended and if you have head tracking equipment it's icing on the cake.",Euro Truck Simulator 2

2015-02-17,25,267,19,False,Recommended,It's very hard to hype this game up. You get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of Europe. Over time you gain experience for things like longer distances more valuable cargo etc. You can eventually buy your own truck(s) hire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuff.But basically it's about driving heavy sluggish trucks. I am having difficulties putting into words why any of this is fun. Perhaps fun isn't the right word at all.It's relaxing most of the time satisfying and sometimes tense.There's something in there about small moments. The moment where you pull out of the loading dock with your frozen peas or whatnot and find the highway. The moment where the countryside changes and you cross borders. The moment where the signs change and the language is different. The moment where you know you're almost there and are about to arrive. The moment where somewhere in the middle it rained for a while or got really dark. Or both. The moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium. The moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truck from a station that matches the country you're gently passing through.This is probably not something you'll want to sit at for multiple hours but if you're anything like me you'll keep coming back to it running a delivery once in a while because it's relaxing and the moments are tantalizing. Oh also there's a multiplayer mod. It's all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction. You'll both cheerfully honk your horns in greeting then continue on your respective ways. I guess that's also another moment.I am actually fairly excited about all things VR and the Occulus rift for a multitude of reasons and games I'd like to experience with it but my deepest secret about it is that I am really looking forward to playing ETS2 when the consumer version lands. Seriously.

Maneuvering can be a little tough at the beginning but quickly you get the hang of it and easily get used to the rules of the road. You can play music inside the game or on a player.

2015-07-25,0,0,18,False,Recommended,When I originally purchased this game during the summer sale I had no idea what I was getting myself into. A game about driving across europe in a truck roving from country to country and delivery to delivery? How good can it be? Turns out it can be damn good. Don't knock it until you try it.GameplayThe core of the game involves you guessed it driving around in a euro style big rig making pick ups and drop offs at various locations around much of Europe. You start off simply enough by taking jobs where a truck is provided to you and you can get your feet wet without having to use a lot of the games systems but soon enough you will earn enough to buy your own truck from one of the many real world manufacturers licensed in the game from the popular Scania to the recently added Mercedes Benz line. This is when the real fun begins.Once you have your own truck an element of strategy kicks in as you can now make a delivery to one place and then choose the best job nearby and it becomes a hunt to find efficient routes and maximize profits but now you have to balance the need for sleep keeping an eye on your fuel gauge and avoiding accidents that lead to the need for expensive repairs. Eventually you can even by garages and hire additional drivers and develop an international trucking empire of your own.As you drive and make deliveries you will gain experience which will allow you to unlock various certifications and boosts that will allow you to make more money off of jobs take newer and more challenging delivery types or simply make driving more efficient.SoundSCS put a lot of effort into capturing real truck sounds and it makes for a more immersive experience. As for music you can import your own or you can stream internet radio from across Europe in multiple languages.GraphicsThis isn't a AAA title but the graphics are pretty easy on the eyes. There is a lot of detail in the various interiors of the trucks and driving through the countryside or one of the many cities included in the game there is always somethig new to see from quaint villages and fields to larger cities with towering skylines. DLC and additional ContentThere is a bunch of DLC for this game. A lot of it is purely cosmetic in the form of new paint jobs that you can purchase for your trucks. There are also a couple of dlc's that you will want to pick up at some point specifically the Going East and Scandinavia dlc's which add new countries jobs roads and sights to see.Even if you don't buy any of the DLC there is new content regularly added with each new patch including new places to visit new vehicle upgrades new truck lines such as the above mentioned Mercedes trucks and more. SCS has shown a lot of support for this game and loyalty to their customer base who have already purchased the game by adding regular updates and additional content for free with no signs of stopping.Final VerdictETS2 isn't a game that looks like much at first glance but give it a chance and you may soon find yourself cruising around the highways of virtual Europe making deliveries and developing a logistics empire of your own. Give it a chance you won't be disappointed.See you on the road!,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2014-10-10,0,0,62,False,Recommended,This game stands out from the pack from the very begining. Other simulators like the Farming Simulator series are known more for their bad physics than their gameplay but this... this is quite different. The braking for example takes a much longer distance to stop with a 27 tonne load than it does with a small 3 tonne refridgerator van. And turning corners at speed is another thing. In the truck alone you can turn a corner with a fair bit of speed maybe about 70 80 Kph. Taking the same corner with a heavy trailer will make you feel as if you made a mistake. Time feels as if it has slowed when you make this mistake the cab flipping slower than it should and all because of the depth of the game.Even the gameplay sets itself different. Anyone would think that a trucking game could get boring but no. This game refuses to play by the rules. Wanna start in London and make your way through mainland Europe buying properties and drivers along the way? Sure. Go ahead. Wanna forget about that and run your company alone? Again you're free to do so.This game brings true simulation realistic open world camapaign and great atmosphere into one tightly wrapped bacon burrito!

2013-08-13,0,0,41,False,Recommended,I advise bringing along a gallon of water some snacks (preferably with high protein) and maybe a massage pad. Got all that? Good. You'll be on the road a while.Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the sequel to the lesser known Euro Truck Simulator if the titles didn't tip it off and does exactly as it suggests you drive a long haul truck across much of Europe for many hours. Now it's probably coming across as slightly... boring. And yeah it is a little bit. The scenery isn't always spectacular and the highways don't generally differ in design and traffic.But like the award winning Papers Please which was just about working a tedious desk job or Cook Serve Delicious ETS2 is one of those simple games where if you're not always on guard you're going to mess up.For real life drivers it's known that the road has a sort of lull where between the hum of tires vibration of the engine and stock sights you find it easy to doze off. Now behind the wheel of a huge semi truck it becomes a much larger issue. And this game simulates it not to mention the things like gas and money.There's also the hazards of speed cameras and sudden changes in limit cars cutting you off and sudden death at the hands of merging buses. It's always a good idea to remap the turn signals to Q and E if you're on keyboard which the game is against just so they're easy to use. You'll need them.While rather... empty what scenery does exist of Europe's classical countryside is attractive and some of the urban areas are actually very pretty to look at. Don't expect a full city to explore though we're simulating we're not stealing cars and taking peyote here.Some other features of ETS2 are the managment section where the player might develop an armada of trucks and build a real business out of the shambles you start in a working internet radio you can listen to while driving and multiplayer is in progress though in a separate mod.The main draw I think is just the simple idea that you can drive a huge gas guzzling speed limit busting truck without too much consequence. There's no police most places are sparse on traffic and you get the cargo to Strasbourg on time. With so many cities and a shrunk down map of Europe available to explore ETS2 is also a good sight seeing game. Makes me want to visit Warsaw.All in all ETS2 is a good game for an easy but not relaxing ride around Europe while making a pretty digital penny.Also if North American trucking is more your thing SCS software is working on that for their next game. All of the U.S. I for one am going to crash into my house multiple times.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2014-07-14,0,0,865,False,Recommended,"This is nice base trucking simulation ( only driving part included ) only ""few"" annoying things on it speed limits and signs need serious overhaul way too bouncy speed limits and often getting ticket from driving with the car speed limit ( sometimes you have to drive way lower than car speed limit to avoid getting ticket like in north side of france speed limit 70 speed limiter tickets if you drive over 50 ) and sometimes speed limit changes not by speed limit sign but by freeway sign or some other kind of sign speed limit signs nor street signs not showing in night without high beams and other car lights have pathetic visibility on night pretty much invisible on your truck mirror street signs need serious overhaul would be nice to be able to prepare for xroads obeying the street signs but they hardly never show lane info correctly always last sign showing right info ( giving you 1 second to adjust ) 2 previous ones showing wrong info npc cars have very low AI IQ they dont see the player at all thus specially at crossroads and just after customs gate they try to ram you then you have to pay from crashing into them and to your employer from damaging the cargo many times they crash into eachother or make traffic jams rain system at second lowest settings makes it feel like your in english summer... every day getting rain turning it 1 more step down means no rain at all no online game... yet ( only alpha version atm ) game has only 1 season summer many xroads that have just 1 traffic light that hinders seriously those who wanna turn left pretty much always they can turn left only by going over the line and waiting for the light to turn red then hit the gas navigator many times makes you do extra turns into small roads even when road going straight would be shorter and faster specially makes you avoid trips through towns no matter how big detour it makes you do would be nice if we could mark down to map to see what gas station has nice gas prices often you cant even tell what the gas price is next to the gas station sign ( signs hardly never show real price like britains prices always are 1.39.99 but gas pump charges 1.59 or trying to figure out what 413 or 51 price means )But atleast it has netradio and navigator and you can run your own company and its drivers",Euro Truck Simulator 2

2013-12-28,0,0,32,False,Recommended,"There's something strangely alluring about this game. I didn't think I'd like it. First off I hate trucks and the idea of truck driving. I even tried the demo then put it back down. But there it was for months popping up everywhere I looked saying ""Yes! You want this."" Finally I read a ""Games of 2013"" article in Eurogamer talking about it and I was convinced. I'm also fascinated by Europe and the U.K. and I wanted to learn a bit about the geography there where the towns are and things like that. I never knew until playing this that there's something called the Chunnel or the ""Channel Tunnel"" connecting England with France. That's just one example.Okay so you have those space trading games like Freelancer X etc. where you go from station to station buying and selling cargo to make money and buy upgrades so you can haul more cargo and buy more upgrades? Well this game is like that except it's set in Europe and you're driving a truck. Oh and you're not actually buying the cargo you just get paid to haul it. There's empire building too as you can upgrade your garage buy more trucks and hire drivers. There's a leveling system with perks and bonuses and the trucks are upgradeable too. Bigger engines more lights better transmissions etc. Unfortunately a lot of the descriptions of what you're buying aren't there. There aren't enough tooltips or feedback the shopping interface could use some work. As you level you can unlock the ability to haul more and different types of cargo with bigger payouts and more interesting routes.But it's a fun game mastering how to take corners without tipping over learning where you can go fast and where you need to slow down navigating traffic avoiding bumping into guard rails or other vehicles etc. I play with a 360 controller and it works fine. You do have to map everything and tweak the sensitivity a bit but it works well.If you like open world driving games and the idea of those ""space trading"" type games except on land and with a few differences and if you're interested in the sights and geography of Europe check this one out. It's actually quite fun!",Euro Truck Simulator 2

2015-01-04,0,0,80,False,Recommended,This is quite an amusing game. Never realised how much I could get into simply driving a truck around but it appears there is a lot more to it than that. It's quite tricky to get into it properly giving everything enough space and definitely reversing trailers but once you get the knack it's satisfying to continue. It's not without it's negatives though the creators/developers clearly have never been to the UK or look at Google Maps other than driving on the left the rules of the road are identical to everywhere else. For example the junctions are all wrong motorways are european style and traffic on roundabouts gives way to people joining it.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

Bought the Humble simulator bundle and I can't get enough of the game. It's so accurate and fun to play not once have I ever taken pleasure in delivering potatoes to a foreign country until I played this. It makes you set yourself challenges aswell such as getting cargo to Berlin without crashing your truck. Admittedly the multiplayer mod for the game isn't as good as I thought it might be but that's not down to the game it's down to the players. 100% recommend to anyone who loves simulators.

The object of the game is fairly simple you just transport your load from point a to point b. It sounds boring but I enjoy viewing the European countryside and listening to the funky European radio stations along the way. It's almost meditative. Also once you make enough money you get to manage your own trucking company. The online mod is probably my favorite part of the game and adds even more immersion. I like interacting with the friendly Europeans in the chat and driving recklessly has given me a few chuckles though people on the servers don't find it as amusing as me. The devs are good at consistently releasing content updates so there's always something new being added. A controller or steering wheel is highly recommended.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

If you're having a stressful day nothing like taking to the road and taking a cruise while pocketing some cash along the way.By far the calmest game on Steam. It's a shame there's no multiplayer included with the game something I hope they introduce in the future. I read somewhere you can download a multiplayer mod though.Personally I think the game needs more ""smaller"" locations especially in England/UK instead of major or big locations. Other than that worth it's money/price in gold.Rating updated on Aug 2 2017 9 &gt 9.5If you download and install the multiplayer mod from here www.truckersmp.com you can use your singleplayer profile and earn more cash from jobs there only with the company of your friends who have the game and those people who are also playing multiplayer!...also free roam driving in multiplayer is sooooo relaxing. Although I do recommend free roam driving in singleplayer as you may encounter problem players (trolls) who will ram into you and flip you on to your side...I speak from personal experience.The only problem is you'll need your own truck in order to successfully play the multiplayer mod.

2016-02-03,1,1,59,False,Recommended,Euro Truck Simulator 2 is good as a simulator genre game. I'm not really into driving/racing games but this is fantastic. The feeling of driving around Europe just feels great. Most people aspire to go travelling I know this is far from reality but you still get a feeling like that. It's awesome.GAMEPLAYGameplay overall is good travelling across Europe and delivering cargos is fun but that's not the heart source for the fun. The fun comes in when you're driving normally. Remember the times when you would try to drive in GTA normally? Like you would do in real life? Well that's what this game is about. There is even a section in game where you can add your own music (on the radio) and play it whilst driving. That's not a big part of the game though I don't use it. The trucks feel like trucks you can definitley feel the weight being dragged on your back whilst driving past the 30 St Mary Axe also known as the Gherkin in London. There is a wide range of trucks to drive and after saving money by completing quick jobs you can eventually buy your own and drive freely. There is one bug which is constant throughout the game unfortunately the only way to fix it is by going directly into the game files and changing a couple settings. The bug is when there are no jobs to do. Of course there are but they are not showing up therefore you can't do anything. Like I said the gameplay is great but that bug is annoying and we should not be fixing it ourselves.7/10GRAPHICSThe graphics are poor. No matter what setting you have them on they are poor it does not mean this is a bad game and you shouldn't get it. Look at Club Penguin. That's not even 3D yet but Club Penguin is fantastic! There is nothing more to say really The textures for grass isn't 2D that says enough.4/10MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer function is a mod which you have to download from a certain website. With roughly 2000 players on each server this is the best part about the game. I only play multiplayer because you can have a convoy with your friends and deliver your cargos together while passing the odd driver on his side in the middle of the road pleading for help. The admins run each server well and help keep it clean. There are rules though which you have to abide and if you break them you will get banned temporarily. In multiplayer everything is the same just without AI drivers around you. There are real people beside you and to be frankly honest some of them are s not to worry though press tab click on the person that is bothering you and report them they will soon be off your tail. 9/10OPTIMIZATIONThe game runs perfectly fine. I have a GTX970 and everything runs fine with no mind blowing graphics nothing should make you drop frames. The only time I drop frames is when there is around 30 to 40 people in one city on Multiplayer which might be a problem if you are in the same town and the same server with well known streamers such as Squirrel famously known for playing Simulator games.9/10OVERALLOverall game is brilliant it is worth the buy but not the 97% reviews. The only reason why I don't think it is worth the 97% is because of that bug that we have to fix ourselves. SCS should've fixed that a long time ago. I'm excited to play American Truck Simulator but I'm waiting for the Multiplayer Mod. The graphics are poor but if you judge the entirety of a games fun down to graphics then you are deluded (ง ل )ง and the optimization is fine. If you are looking to buy this game just keep an open mind as even I the reviewer was not into driving games but this takes it to another level for me.Thank you for readingI hope you enjoyed papa nicole,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2015-01-30,0,0,25,False,Recommended,"Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an incredible game. That's right a simulator that is worthy of being called a game. It is still a simulator and quite a good one at that but unlike many other simulator ""games"" out there this one is enjoyable. It creates a very satisfying experience out of something that you would at first believe to be boring.First of all the game looks good. The sounds compliment this and if you're getting tired of listening to the roar of your engine as you roam the roads of Europe you can play your own MP3s from your computer through the in game radio. Even better is the ability to stream internet radio stations through the in game radio which when I first discovered I was very pleased about it!So what do you do in ETS2 exactly? Well you can start off working for other trucking copmanies taking valuable cargo from point A to point B earning some money and experience points along the way. Once you start earning enough money (or decide to get a loan from the bank) you can then purchase your own truck instead of using other people's vehicles allowing you to earn more money and even more EXP. EXP is what allows you to ""level up"" which gives you skill points that you can allocate to various different skills e.g. improved eco driving or being able to take jobs that involve fragile cargo (better paying jobs).With the rest of the money you make you can buy more trucks upgrades/paint for said trucks and most importantly employees who will work for you (and garages to place them in). Soon enough you will be running the best trucking business in all of Europe which is ultimately the aim of this game (to build up your business and have fun doing it!).But what is the actual driving aspect of the game like you might ask? Well as I said before you drive cargo from point A to point B and earn money whilst doing so. This may sound tedious and boring but what makes it such a grand experience is a) the scenery (as you drive through a scaled down version of Europe) b) the excellent vehicle physics and mechanics and c) what you do with it all are you going to play seriously making sure to follow all road rules and never commit a speeding offence? Or are you just going to play casually listening to your internet radio stations and free roaming Europe without any cargo at all? Or perhaps you'd like to muck around with some friends on multiplayer (requires a mod) crashing into things and having fun doing it?ETS2 is truly a magnificent experience that seems to offer little yet offers so much! I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and will most likely revisit it in the future. All I can say is this if you want to drive around Europe in a truck earning money and buying trucks as you do so this is the game for you. And if you're skeptical trust me I was too. After playing it though I can tell you I had no regrets with it.Enjoy! )",Euro Truck Simulator 2

2014-12-28,0,0,28,False,Recommended,Don't be fooled by my play time on Steam I've played a lot more than it says (I owned the physical copy for ages before registering the key here) and I can say it's pretty addicting.Like most simulators the game is based on a mundane task and obviously this is based on driving a truck. Not everyone's idea of a fun time I know but it really can become fun if you put your mind to it. Or rather don't. The reason I love ETS2 so much is that it's so great to just load up on a lazy day that I'm not in college and drive around for a bit. It lets me forget the stress of the real world and take up someone else's life and just relax. Put some tunes on the music player from your computer or listen to a nifty in game radio that covers a lot of stations even the more obscure ones like Real XS only available in Manchester if you're listening on FM.Unlike a lot of other simulators the presentation is absolutely spot on here. The graphics look excellent and there are plenty of options to fine tune your experience (even my decent PC has frame issues on the highest settings) but even on lower settings the graphics are better than the majority of simulation games out there. The mechanics are great too and the physics engine really makes you feel like you are driving a real life truck.I do have a couple of issues with the game. One is that the collisions aren't very good/realistic and there is no visible damage to the truck at all. However if you intend to play the game at all seriously (i.e. not purposefully crashing into everything all the time) this won't be an issue. The other is that every time there is an update (and that is a lot) my truck gets returned back to my main garage back in Manchester which is annoying seen as I've already explored the roads around that area (Great Britain). I feel it would be better if your truck was moved to the nearest city considering they're not too far away from each other.Aside from those couple of very small problems ETS2 delivers in every area. Graphics sound gameplay and general presentation are well above the rest when it comes to simulators.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2014-11-29,1,1,71,False,Recommended,Driving trough Europe in a truck and taking some apples to London from Amsterdam is damn relaxing and very addictive. This game is cheap and fun especially with the multiplayer mod if you have friends that might be intrested in these kinda of games. Its not an usually simulator it is one of the ones that doesn t suck and does it job like it should do.It is very good feeling to get your trucking company going and getting some new wheels on your swaggy truck and get to the road and show your new wheels off to your friends. Anyways it is a good game and i highly recommend picking it up maybe from a steam sale if you are not sure or just buying it its hella cheap and lot of fun!And think about Oculus Rift with this game good god that sounds awesome in my head!

2014-11-11,1,1,56,False,Recommended,"Pros Great graphics Lots of neat destinations AI traffic is overall quite good I love that SCS Software is constantly releasing updates patches and even new features/trucks/etc regularly. This is pretty old school and very cool many devs today release no patches to their games and would NEVER include additional content for free.Cons I thought it was too easy to make gobs of money and expand your business quickly in fact I think it's pretty much impossible to ""fail"" without trying. Some weird sound issues. It's always way too quiet in the cab then it blasts out your ears if you switch to a camera outside and I've also heard some glitches in the menus as well. There are a number of road signs that are wrong and mislabeled. For example there are many times when you'll be on two lane freeway and you'll encounter two signs one showing an arrow pointed up for the left lane and an arrow pointed up and a second arrow pointed right for the right lane. To me this says the left lane continues straight while the right lane continues straight AND has an exit as well. Sometimes this is the case and sometimes it isn't and so I pretty much just dive for the left lane every time now since I have no idea if the sign is correct or not. Kind of frustrating.Overall this game is fun but not for everyone. If you're someone who only enjoys frantic fast action edge of your seat games this is not your game but for the rest of you (and you know who you are) it's a tremendous game despite a few flaws.",Euro Truck Simulator 2

2014-06-20,0,0,40,False,Recommended,"You might think to yourself ""Europe... and trucks? Who cares..."". While you're partially right (Europe lol) DO NOT underestimate the complexity of this game. To the average player this game may very well be ""boring"" but those people are simply playing it incorrectly. You must not drive the truck but rather let the truck drive you for aren't we all just on one long road into the unknown?This game will provide you hours of entertainment. As you drive past cow pastures corn fields and strange European cities you will contemplate your life your existence and what drove you to even purchase the game in its first place. When you're hauling manuer from Paris to Cologne you are actually driving deep inside your soul to truly discover yourself. I have personally witnessed people breaking down into tears as they latch their trailer and carry their load off into the sunset.I have few criticisms of this game with one exception The only proper setting is clearly America. After driving for over 50 hours I have yet to spot a single Bald Eagle. This clear lack of freedom is unexceptable and I expect this to be fixed in future DLC.

Even multiplayer mod available.+ Good DLC with bang for the buck. Even the base game has been getting new junk over the years for free. Only real negative side is the damage modelling which actually is non existant. When you hit something you get percent damage to either trailer or to your truck but the damage is not visible. Your truck has several systems what can take damage but in the end they really seem to end up causing only engine failures if going too high w/o repairs. Perhaps this is something they will focus on in the future.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2013-12-22,0,0,50,False,Recommended,It's a simulator yes but it is actually FUN. Nice graphics with detailed truck cabins and exteriors. The environment is detailed too although some variety would be welcome (snow in some locations for example). Perhaps this is something that the developers could introduce at a later stage. However the shadows and reflections in your cabin as you drive along really do look great.As you level up you are can choose new abilities most of these enable you to choose more profitable hauls (hazmat fragile etc). The option is there to take out a loan with a bank to assist in purchasing more trucks and garages if you feel the need to expand.Controls are smooth I highly recommend using a controller as with any driving game. You can assign functions to buttons as you prefer.Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a beautifully executed game that you could spend many hours on.

It gives you a challenge to strive to make your company one of the best in the nation with hundreds of modifications to enchance the gameplay and make it even better. Very realistic trucks are at a high standard highly detailed yet they still perform well. The original game consisted of just a few branded trucks with loads of updates getting released which has eventually seen all trucks in the game get their official brand (DAF Iveco MAN Mercedes Benz Renault Scania Volvo). The two major DLC's being map expansions are outstanding and expand onto the eastern side of Europe along with Scandinavia with the remaining of France getting released in an upcoming DLC.

2016-12-31,0,0,95,False,Recommended,Ladies and Gents!That is how you actually create and maintain a game in an era of rushed game development and selfishly greedy overpricing.Such a simple premise of driving around in a truck without any real story or overall objective is executed perfectly in Eurotruck Simulator. It is relaxing refreshing beautiful and goddamn more immersive than some of the triple A games on the market. Now as a newcomer the whole point of Eurotruck Simulator may seem dull but trust me once you give this game a chance you will understand why so many people adore the nature of the game.I want to congratulate the developers in SCS Software for the two steam awards that this game received in December 2016. They truly deserve every bit of the recognition and it makes me happy that we still have passionate developers like them who are willing to continuously support their products through constant patching and content creation.

You eventually buy and expand garages hire drivers and buy more trucks for your fleet. The scenery and weather are great. The trucks are beautiful.

2015-11-26,0,0,973,False,Recommended,"Пожалуй самая лучшая игра в своем жанре. После откровенно неудавшихся ""Дальнобойщики 3 Покорение Америки"" я уж было перестал верить в этот жанр но анонс Euro Truck Simulator 2 заставил меня набраться сил и терпения которые кстати сказать пригодились в ожидании данной игры выход которой переносили много раз. И вот наконец 19 октября 2012г игра увидела свет. Честно сказать ждал игру в Steam и лицензию не покупал а скачал пиратку и буквально месяца 2 играл просто без передышки настолько она затянула. Не смотря на то что в основе лежит все тот же ""Prism 3D"" у игры довольно сочная картинка приятная физика управления траком довольно реалистичные звуки грузовиков открытая поддержка пользовательских модов (что безусловно дает огроменный плюс игре). Также стоит отметить то что разработчики открыто выходят на контакт с фанатами прислушиваются к их мнению и вносят те изменения в игру что они посоветуют. Еще один не мало важный плюс постоянные обновления которые исправляют те или иные баги/лаги возникащие у игроков. Совсем недавно вышло DLC Going East! которое добавляет значительную территорию в Польше. Территория в дополнении выполнена по реальному ""живому прототипу"" ровно как и весь игровой мир. Путешествуя по Европе можно встретить местные достопримечательности которые в реальной жизни стоят точь в точь на том же месте что и в игре. Совсем не давно разработчики ввели такую практику добавления новых грузовиков. Первым был Iveco Hi Way затем Volvo FH16'2013 а не так давно был анонсирован новый DAF Euro 6 и прошу заметить что все это удовольствие достается нам бесплатно в виде патчей.Подводя итог хочется выразить огромную благодарность тем людям которые приложили руку к этой игре. Да по началу она не была идеальной не все грузовики были лицензированны но со временем разработчики смогли найти общий язык с гигантами и те дали добро на лицензирование траков в результате чего мы имеем 6 лицензированных марок тягачей. Что безусловно является большим плюсом ведь управлять лицензированным траком гараздо приятнее чем сидеть за рулем какого то Swift'a. Игра развивается анонсированы уже и другие проекты от разработчиков но наша армия фанатов еще на протяжении долгих лет будет бороздить просторы Европы на своих тягачах. Спасибо за внимание!",Euro Truck Simulator 2

The trucks feel hefty and substantial something which often lacks when trucks are put in games.

2015-09-17,0,0,8,False,Recommended,I personally love this game had it for a while but just started to play it for real. Controls are difficult in the beginning and take a lot of practice especially when entering roundabouts filled with drivers that have no consideration whatsoever to the rules which pretty much matches everyday life. Joystick controls are particularly tricky and need a serious reduction in sensitivity for it to become playable. I gave up on joystick and prefer the keyboard / mouse combination.This game is not for everyone as those who do not love trucking and driving as much as I do may consider this game somewhat monotonous. I find it relaxing to listen to the music I have copied into the Truck Simulator music folder and cruising the streets of Europe while making money and saving up for a more decent truck. I have just taken up a loan from the bank to buy a truck and a number of new and better paid jobs came up in the list. Just make sure you keep the tank filled and rest in time and you will be making good money in this game in no time. Absolutely recommended for anyone who loves driving.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

I have been playing this game with keyboard and mouse for about 150 hours but i must say my last investment in a G27 did the job! In this game you have a really big map with almost every country in europe. The landscape is really well done especially the scandinavian DLC. You have a big varity of trucks and it will take you years to test them all... Something that is also really great addition to the game is all the mods you can have. Especially the multiplayer mod. With about 2400 players online it is really fun to drive around europe with friends or just random people from russia. My advice is to go get it! If you are unsure if this is a game for you wait until there is a sale. You might pick it up for less than 2 euros!,Euro Truck Simulator 2

Well I enjoy SIM games (already play Football Manager and Roller Coaster Tycoon 3) and I enjoy trucks so when I saw Euro Truck SIM 2 and saw the clips of the game I thought I'd give it a try especially when I saw it on sale at under $4 so I thought ""why not?"". Glad I didn't pass it up as the game is superb and is HIGHLY addictive. I've had the game since Thursday now and I've already put in a good amount of hours.The game is massive. You start off as a driver for hire in a city of your choosing and you choose jobs to build up money (or just take out a bank loan if you're impatient) to get your own truck to start up your own business. You can choose from DAF Scania Iveco Volvo and more for your trucks you can hire drivers buy more trucks buy other depots...all the things you can do in a real life truck business you can do in this game.The actual driving part of the game is VERY realistic and the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're driving a truck. You drive at night through the day in the rain when it's sunny have to take a break every 10 hours or so....honestly it's very realistic to real life trucking.I cannot think of a negative thing to say about this game so if you love trucks and you love SIM games then this HAS to be on your list.

Everything here is about reality and developers make update regularly to make this game more perfect than perfect I have to say these words yes...

If you don't have patience don't even think about buying this game unless you don't care about losing money! This is also a game that takes time to play. When you first start out in the game it may only take you five minutes to finish a delivery but that wont last forever! When you get to lets say level 25 it may take you about a half an hour to fourty five minutes to finish a delivery!

2016-02-05,0,0,263,False,Recommended,If you're a fan of simulators and want to get the feeling of a cross country road trip there truly is no better game on the market that does it better than ETS2. You start out with some lame headquarters and you have to deliver cargo cross country to earn more cash and gradually your business grows as you get your first truck buy a new garage and start hiring new drivers all in a way that makes this game surprisingly replayable.The environments are gorgeous and the diversity of trucks never lets up. Volvo trucks Iveco trucks MAN trucks they're all here.As you sit behind the wheel of your truck you're free to control whatever you like on your truck indicators lights wipers retarders (on higher end trucks). Not to mention you can download your favourite music and put it in your Documents folder to listen to your favourite music while you're trekking across Europe. For me that feature is absolutely gorgeous. And even if you don't want to there are a plethora of European radio stations that you can listen to in the game from Pop to Rock to Jazz to news by BBC the diversity of music available with just a few clicks and button taps never gives up.However while I feel the driving experience is spot on in most areas rarely the AI can start doing some stupid things like swerving into the overtaking lane while you are overtaking them therefore crashing into your truck and causing more damage. However that is just a bee in an otherwise exquisite honey.I would definitely recommend this game to people a fan of the genre. It may not be for everybody but if you want a game like this one ETS2 is one of the best for you. I never get tired of starting my Volvo and heading to collect my trailer to deliver it across Europe.9.6/10.,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2013-12-03,0,0,17,False,Recommended,This game from the title and screen shots might seem boring and dumb but trust me it is a load of fun. This game is less about experiencing an epic story and fighting monsters but more about sitting back relaxing and enjoying the best made simulator I have played. The environments are beautiful and well detailed. The trucks are gorgeous and all different. You can found a trucking business and make it grow or just take trucking jobs all over Europe. The road AI is great with cars and vehicles that seem like other players. You can even see people walking on the street when your in town (and they dont look like ) This game is perfect for me when I get home from a stressful day and put on my favorite music. I dont have to fight anything or worry about death just chill. If your feeling adventerous take a job across Europe that will take you hours but will test your endurance as a gamer but you can get easily confused switching from England to the Europe mainland ( and England has more speed cameras!) Also the lighting from day to night and weather effects really add to the experience. One negative is that when upgrading your truck you cant easily tell what parts are doing what to your trucks performance. It would be nice if they added an easy to read stat system when buying and upgrading trucks. Other then some nitpicky things this is an awesome game and a great buy. If your not sure about taking the chance go ahead and wathc some videos. Nerd Cubed has a good video on his channel that will get you pumped to buy the game. If your still not sure wait for a sale (I did).I would give this game a 9/10 even if its hard to explain to my friends how much fun this game is P,Euro Truck Simulator 2

2017-02-15,0,0,523,False,Not Recommended,After having bought this game on PS3 PS4 and PC here's the outline of what's going on.Pro's Fun (mostly)Lots to doCommunity can occasionally be fun (to troll)Cons Stupidly high amount of hacking kids.Every lobby contains a hacker 100% every single time you can't avoid them.Vote to kick is useless in a full lobby.Cooldown on vote to kick is too long Report feature is there but Rockstar pay no attention to it.Cooldown on report feature is too long.They warn you you could break for ToS for reporting someone.Everything is too expensive like very expensive. You could say the hackers are the reason for this.Rockstar can't do anything or are unwilling to do anything about hackers.If you email them directly to report a hacker you get a generic response to use the ingame report feature.Hackers can unban themselves.Hackers can clear reports about them.Hackers can crash your game.Hackers can control your character.Hackers go undetected as they avoid using the game drivers and files directly.Hackers have the ability to delete your charcater and/or account.Hackers know Rockstar can't do a thing about them.Rockstar do their bans in waves but by this point there's already a new mod menu out.Rockstar are about 10 steps behind the hackers.As you see the cons outweigh the pros but it's mostly if not all down to the amount of hackers.Don't call them modders that's like trying to say the turd you just dropped is a chocolate log. Clear up the hackers and this game will go back to being fun until then avoid this game and probably safe to avoid GTA 6 when that is released around 2020.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-05,0,0,261,False,Not Recommended,The single player story was fun. GTA online is a scam. It costs over $1.2 Billion in game currency to purchase everything the online edition has to offer. At USD$99.99 for $8 Million in game it would cost about USD$14 998.50 in micro transactions to buy everything. Without spending money the grind to obtain even a decent chunk of the items is unimaginable. Hackers run rampant and pretty much suffer no penalties. I've never seen a video game with such an insane amount of sketchy websites dedicated to scamming players out of money and their steam accounts.

Although the single player story is decent with some pretty funny missions and moments R* has decided to abandon single player expansions in place for GTA Online content for making more money. If you wish to buy this game for the single player get it when it's like 10 or 15 NO MORE!GTA Online (World) The Online world multiplayer of this game revolves around using in game currency which can either be grinded or bought using Shark Cards to buy stuff you want. From cars weapons garages and apartments everything that you want you will need earn cash to buy. The only problem is the payouts for doing missions ansd heists (the best ways you make money) are constantly being nerfed and / or patched by R* to get you pay your real life hard earned money on Shark Cards. There are many different kind of shark cards from Red Shark ($100 00 for 2) to Great White Shark ($8 000 000 for 60) this is how R* want you to get the in game cash to buy your stuff. The Great White Shark's $8 000 000 may sound like a lot you may be thinking you can buy a lot of stuff in the game with that... wrong! The way the pricing works in the game will make you burn through a lot of that cash on maybe a few super cars and maybe a high end apartment... FOR 60! This price gouging becomes increasingly more obvious with each DLC released. New vehicles are ""drip fed"" with one vehicle sometimes every week (sometimes longer) in an attempt to try and prolong the life of the game and also encourage people to buy shark cards. And if you wanted to try a vehicle out in the single player in order to maybe avoid wasting your multiplayer cash on it guess what? YOU CANNOT! It was decided to make these vehicles multiplayer only so people have no way of testing them in singleplayer prior to purchase to see if they want them.If you do not wish to play in the online open world then you can always do some online modes from racing team deathmatch heists missions and more. However the match making system used in this game is one of the most appalling system I have ever scene in gaming. If you want to find for example a random race you will start searching. If a race is not found you then have a decision to find a DIFFERENT type of mode job (adversary or TDM) or host your own race there is no ""try again"" option no ""return to open world"" option. And here's the reall kicker! If you choose to look for a job in a different mode and fail to find one it then asks ""do you want to join a race in progress?"". I mean what the hell! That should be the first damn option you get not to look for a different type of job! Trying to find a job of the type you want to join can take up to 20 mins and then when you get in you have the risk of disconnecting being kicked or a game bug getting you stuck on a loading screen (can be quite frequent). This combined with an excessive quantity of modes (most of which nobody plays) and low payouts can make finding and playing jobs truly frustrating. It is clear R* and its parent company Take Two Interactive have no interest in fixing current problems in the multiplayer scene they only have an interest in shutting down money making glitches and loop holes which make heists easier all for the sake of milking as much money as they can from you. If you do ever intend to buy GTA 5 for its multiplayer WAIT FOR IT GO ON SALE and do NOT buy shark cards! You are better off farming your own cash or running into a hacker who can gift you cash (not condoning it). Also be aware that the points I have noted are the main points I choose not to recommend this game. There are still many other problems with it...",Grand Theft Auto V

The online mode when I first got the game which was about a year ago had actual things you could do. Now you must grind for hours on end or buy shark cards just to get a single apartment to start hiests.

2017-09-24,1,5,143,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be great. USED TO BE. Up until the last update it had been incredibly fun. I admit the prices for everything in game is ridiculous and Rockstar will not stop trying to force feed you shark cards but it was still fun. However as of today I have been banned for a month and all of my characters have been reset because I bought a hanger..? Apparently I have been cheating which is a bit bizarre as I have been playing fairly on this game since the days of PS3. I never thought I'd write a bad review about a Rockstar game let alone GTA V but as it has clearly been shown Rockstar do not care about any of their loyal players and get salty everytime someone earns their money instead of buying Shark cards. A word of advice for new players if you can't resist avoiding this game remember you must go by Rockstar's rules as everything else is strictly prohibited. Kind of like a concentration camp.If you want the game for the storyline I can understand that as it s pretty good to play through character development is great and the interaction the player has between three characters is a cool idea. But for me I can never bring myself to play it again in my mind the replayability is rubbish. But each to their own.In conclusion I recommend this game for the single player experience but if you re looking for a game for strictly multiplayer then there are a lot of better games out there that offer fun and freedom instead of a restrictive experience ran under a dictatorship.,Grand Theft Auto V

Buying on sale for the single player even if you never go online.... worth it.GTA V Online.Well where do I start. The online part of the game leaves you rattling round in public lobbies trying to grind away the cash to buy anything fun then more stuff comes out that looks fun and you spend more time grinding for that. Commonly griefed while doing it often hassled by modders and frequently stuck in the clouds. Of course there is stuff like the pvp arenas all the racing types and heists that can be done without joining a crew as well.But find a good crew..... and all that changes. With a good crew you can help each other make money kick the griefers out of sessions roleplay a motorcycle gang riding around in leather and the game becomes a lot better. Like most online games finding decent people to play online with makes all the difference.Rockstar SupportNo review of GTA would be complete without a quick look at R* support. Yes the online game has a modder problem so yes a fairly aggressive anti cheat is welcome...... regrettably it sometimes functions like a rabid dog and bites whoever it sees.... and from late on 24th to 26th March 2018 it bit a lot. 24th A bit of code is updated thousands of people start getting banned for 30 and accounts wiped.25th The bans continue thousands and thousands of bans and accounts wiped thousands of hours of gameplay gone. No word from R* about it support tickets relating to bans autoclosed with a polite ""f**k off reply""26th Bit of code changed on 24th changed back no word from R* media gets hold of it steam reviews tanked. No new bans28th People still banned no word from R* support tickets relating to bans no longer autoclosed.

I was lucky I got told what was happening so I didn't log in.Now a lot of people say ""cheaters always whine about getting banned hahahahaha"" but these are people I play with every day in a crew specifically focused on avoiding cheaters people I trust in a crew I trust.GTA is a genuinely great game at times frustrating at others and a miserable piece of when you have to try dealing with R* themselves.Single player 10/10Online 5/10 rising to 8/10 with a decent crew.Support and respect for their customers 0/10 nothing nada f**k all.",Grand Theft Auto V

It's been 3 weeks now and R* refuses to acknowledge their error so I stopped playing and caring. There's no point in playing online if R* can steal your legitimate money away at any time.

2018-04-21,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,"The indisputably good part of this game is that the single player mode has an entertaining story and it's fun to mess around in. There's fun characters the game parodies modern American culture as did previous installments and cranks that up to 11 and the action is alright. There's not much else to say about that and most people don't play this game primarily for it anyway.Now with the good part of the way we'll talk about the disaster that is GTA V Online. Online well it does have its entertaining moments and potential particularly if you're playing with friends but for a company that's made over a BILLION dollar in profits from this game alone it's apparent that Rockstar is more or less leaving this game as a structural trainwreck. Most lobbies have blatant hackers so you'll have to server hop if you want to find an empty or nearly empty lobby. These hackers not only are a huge nuisance in game but are partially responsible for getting other people suspended as well doing things such as spawning cash on people and making other people get kills so other people think they are cheating when they are really not. I've had a friend banned who was perfectly legit bought shark cards for money instead of cheating it in like many players do and they still got banned/account reset for no given reason. This curbs not only the victims' enjoyment of the game but people who play together with them. Online is incredibly grindy as it is which of course is one more incentive for cheaters to cheat. Normally I would not complain about games being grindy but when it's full of arbitrary bannings it's very discouraging to play this game. Not only is cheating widespread in GTA as mentioned before Rockstar has absolutely no clue what they're doing when it comes to anti cheats. Also good luck trying to report a cheater that has left the lobby you can only do it in the online lobby. If you try to send ticket about a cheater you get an automated response from Rockstar telling you to do it ingame. You can't even appeal their bannings so you don't know what you may have done wrong. With the kind of money they've earned you'd think they'd invest even a fraction of it in making the game better. All they really do is have occasionaly double RP/Cash events as well as some handouts. That's about it. They don't do anything to improve the state of the game and their efforts just make things worse. Hackers are as blatant and common as they were when this game first came out. It makes the game borderline unplayable at times. I've heard the term ""lawsuit"" thrown around a lot because of their terrible management of the game though Rockstar would rather hire some very expensive lawyers with the money they've earned instead of actually improve the game.It's sad online certainly does have potential with heists properties and game modes but even if you somehow manage to ignore all of what I just said the final product still feels quite barebones. In freeroam it doesn't feel as if you're supposed to do much else besides roam around the city either mindlessly killing people which is ok but gets old after a while or gets interrupted by cheaters or doing missions for your crew or company. While not bad as a design the long long grind is definitely there.TL DR If you really want to play this game get it on sale stick to single player.

2015-04-15,20,149,287,False,Recommended,YESThis is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of RP Roleplaying and the perfected multiplayer that is in GTA V. Personally in these games I go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and I enjoy playing. GTA before so GTA IV hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic. I think in these kind of reviews it's important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come. GTA IV was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that RP aspect as I saw it.Pros Alot more to do in the terms of Role Playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why Skyrim and such are still so played The multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in Roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in Skyrim. There is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and I LOVE IT The asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots Friends if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don't do The game literally is just for and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play The story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren't heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse Online and Singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc. The ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this PC Master Race&gt Console Beta TestingCons Public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non stop get killed and robbed etc. and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server When you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking. The damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it in about like 100 levels which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb Killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head Cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you. This drags away from the initial feel of GTA in my opinion The GODDAMN LOADING there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation The game is the most demanding game I've played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez (i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points) Game invites there are so many of them and that little DING that you get when you are playing sucks cause its so damn frequent and sucks i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can't from my experience when playing with friendsWith all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won't most of the time. This all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends mods and gameplay enjoyment. With so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect. This is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-05,2,23,177,False,Recommended,Very fun game with a great an amazing gameplay pretty decent missions and length graphics stepped up and the story was great and enjoyable but in my opinion it could have been improved.The charactes are well made and the story of each of them is well written . Small things are important and gta 5 has a lot of them and you are not getting bored that fast a lot of mini games and missions to play alone or also with friends. One of the better things are the heists you need to cooperate with your mates to succeed. Gta 5 has also a beautiful expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn't that small at all a lot of things to do and areas to explore. One of the things that annoys you in Gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that .PROS + Fun enjoyable and well written story. A lot of missions to play either with friends or alone. Beautiful graphics. Gorgeous open world. Heists. Good customization for cars. Characters are awesome. Impressive degree of freedom. First person camera.CONS Not that great MM. Large number of hackers. Character customization could be better. Not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode.In few words Gta 5 it's an amazing and fun game without doubt it's like a next gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far. You can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day . It begs to be played all over again especially when you have company. It's a must for everyone to try out. Those who didn't play that masterpiece yet they definitely should ! I recommend this game to anyone without remorse .Cheers !!,Grand Theft Auto V

We as the community have to make the difference otherwise the company won't lift a finger.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-23,0,0,508,False,Not Recommended,GTA V isn't a BAD game. But it's by no means a great game.I'm not going to be talking about the story mode as I never really got into it and didn't enjoy it much. Yes it's more GTA and if that doesn't sell you I don't know what will. Let's talk about Online.First of all I don't agree with hacking to harass other players and I certainly dont agree with microtransactions either. This makes Online a bit of an annoyance for people like me. I dont have the time to pour hours into the game in order to get the money required to buy even 1 high end car yet the game seems to demand that I do so if I want any chance of having fun in free roam or misions.Secondly I am banned from Online at the moment.I gave in. I couldn't get enough money for new content which is getting more and more expensive every patch and even while buying Shark Cards which I honestly find both disgustingly overpriced and hilariously plastered all over the game's menus I couldnt afford everything.Paying more than the game is worth for 8 million in game cash quite frankly nothing compared to the price of some of the high end stuff is not worth it in my opinion and honestly it shouldn't even be there as an option.I had a look around online and tried a few mod menus and time trial hacks for the sole purpose of getting money faster.Did I deserve the ban? Yes.Do I think that the bans are overkill? A little I think that deleting all of the progress I had made including before I had ever hacked is a little too much. The 30 day suspension I 100% agree I deserved.(For those of you that don't know R*'s new ban policy is more brutal than before which was just a 14 day ban for the first offence then a 30 day ban then a permaban. Now the bans are 30 day ban and all progress ever made on the account is wiped and reset to 0. Then perma ban.)What makes this all worse is R* have banned legitimate players for hacking in the same ban wave I was caught in. I deserved it I hacked although the punishment is overkill and makes me want to drop the game altogether. The legit players have had their progress reset back to 0 and R* are refusing to restore any of these people's stuff.Personally I feel that R* have ruined a fun game by awful management of players way too brutal punishments and horribly inflated time or money costs.I feel that in order to have fun you need to cheat in some of the good stuff and that to me is not an enjoyable experience.Online is a mess a fun mess but a mess. New players are way too far behind to even bother trying to catch up to the veterans who played back in the PS3/X360 days who all have tens of millions to spend on new content.This isn't even going into the bugs and glitches that plague the game which R* seem to ignore in order to combat the fun harmless glitches like wearing a mask and a helmet at the same time.Edit Never mind. Single player sucks now. Take Two Interactive.,Grand Theft Auto V

Another issue in the online mode... is... cheating.Twenty days ago some guys built themselves very high level and very much money so that they became able to buy plenty of things such as helicopters jetfighters and tanks used for killing other players including me and made us terrified.After that they got a 15 day ban. We thought r* would give them a fair punish (clear all data) and.... improve the anti cheating....Last week they got dis blocked! Except the cash was set to 20000 they kept almost anything! Cars planes weapons houses! Now I rethink why I didn't take a off game time in exchange for those good things! Ending up like that?Nope. Now guys who cheat use more ways Some people lock their health and attack you.Some people teleport to your position and attack you.Some people use both ways and farm you.Some people eject you out from car while you're driving on a normal high speed.Some people spawn disgusting things in front of you.Some people bomb you as soon as you walk out from house.Some people still kill you even if you're in passive mode.Some people use certain way to shoot you with minigun after dying you'll be surprised to find your ammo are 0 pay $200 000 for ammo!Some people use certain way to shoot you with minigun. They shoot you... money bags! Hard to escape. And you'll get money what'll happen imagine yourself. I believe they will be very glad to see that.When I see new cheat I will update this! After experiencing and found that seems Asian cheaters are more. Please think clearly before purchasing! What I say are not t. Using Trevor's word believe or not! ps It's said getting money spawned by other player won't be banned. I'll be trying this awesome thing!

2017-12-12,0,0,639,False,Not Recommended,Dont buy this game it was fun untill recently however if you want to compete with anyone in this game be prepared to dishout another $150 on shark cards so you can afford to buy the buisness so you can store a special vehicle/plane/etc in addition to that each type of vehicle requires its own storage facility depending on the dlc it was released with.Also they added the ability to blow up players from across the map so now regular players can blow you up along with hackers in the game. Oh yeah hackers are still a big problem too. the older this game gets the harder it is to get started due to the massively overpowered equippment being brought out. At this point there is really no reason to buy sports cars anymore because they get obliterated by the orbital cannon along with you.the more time you invest in this game the harder it gets to keep up and have fun because all of the hard work you put in to get that new car is thrown down the pooper as new dlc and major updates to the game are pouring out while simultaneously depreciating your hard earned rocketcar tank fighter jet helicopter mobile operations center ect.(thats 4 seperate buisness you have to buy in order to be able to purchase these ingame each buisness is in excess of 1 250 000 all the way up to 3 000 000 plus the cost in luxuries and upkeep add on another 1 900 00 for luxuries thats just under 5 000 000 multiply by 4 and you get 20 000 000 in order to get all of the buisness that can store special vehicles. Thats not including the houses for hiests or the clubhouses that make 'money' on the side. if you want to buy all of these buisnesses not including the vehicles themselves you are in the neighborhood of $300 irl because shark cards only come in 8 Mil at a time. AND ONE MORE THINGyou cannot sell a buisness so eventually you will not be able to afford all of your buisnesses due to the passive flow of money they suck from your in game bank account every in game day. you also cannot make money in the game without direct input to the buisness. 'getting supplies' delivering product that means you have to spend an exorbant amount of time keeping your buisnesses fed so you dont go broke. and when you do go broke? Good luck! You have to sell one of your hard earned sports cars in order to start your buisness back up again. You have to work really hard in this game to get anywhere and you have to consistantly work in order to keep up with the playerbase and ammunition costs.That good old GTAV feeling is gone.

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

TakeTwo continues to give no s for their player base and only pursues profits often at the expense of their customers. I play this game for a few days straight every few months when my friends and I decide we wanna screw around if I played more often I would go insane. While TakeTwo cracks down on anything illegitimate involving ingame currency hackers are not uncommon. Last time I played I would run into a hacker atleast once a day. Teleportation is fine invincibility is fine aimbot is fine BUT MONEY HACKS? BAN! It is apparent that TakeTwo cares more about making money than delivering a quality game experience and will implement trends originating from other games *cough* the new battle royale mode *cough* just to further profits.I will not be purchasing any other GTA or RDR title unless TakeTwo does a massive turn around or someone buys the series from them.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-10,0,0,540,False,Recommended,IMPORTANT My positive opinion concerns single play and story only. Online sucks payballs.Well... GTA V is a most interesting big and detailed open world game I've ever played. Just tons of fun dynamic and bad*ss plot different and memorable characters complex and extraordinary story missions tons of really random twisted events/peds animals nature and exploration. World of GTA V is so alive and have a lot of realistic things. It also includes detailed in game social networks and great OST mixed with many many radio songs. Try it and you're not gonna regret.Online part is the worst evil here.There are four options of progress here 1. Paywall2. Grinding3. Cheaters4. Sh*tload of high level friends etc.5. Every ing update ruins all mods for single player.I really like a lot of content cut from single experience and also a character creation but GTA Online is just ing boring. I don't know what's really interesting in heists. At single game they were nice online turned them into tedious mess.Also most of the random players are dumb f*cknuggets.# GTAONLINE,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-27,1,8,153,False,Not Recommended,THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW I USED TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME!Okay I do recommend this game ONLY for the single player. Graphic is awesome they took their time creating the PC version. Story is a bit predictable but the endings can be hard because you'll be given a hard choice (multiple endings you either lost a guy or try to save him).Why I don't recommend this game? Hackers they're literally EVERYWHERE so many that it's hard to find a pure session you're lucky if you can find one. Multiplayer is fun when played with friends (you know you can trust them) multiplayer should be played in private session where nobody can join (just hacker things). Rockstar NEEDS to fix the server issue it's getting worse and worse everytime they need to sort out the hackers....PLUS this is the worst stuff....You cannot mod in this game anymore! Which is suck.... Don't like modding? Not a big deal then but for vast majority of us? It is!Edit Well modding is possible again I'd still give this a thumb down nonetheless too many issues in multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-11,2,8,152,False,Not Recommended,this is the third platform I've bought GTA V for the others being Xbox 360 and Xbox One firstly if you are going to buy this for just the single player that works okay it's slightly crash prone but it's fun and looks pretty good the reason I can't recommend this though is the online multiplayer it's PC you expect the odd player to cheat however it's much much worse thanks to Rockstar's shoddy online relying on a peer to peer model because it seems they can't afford dedicated servers with the crazy amount of money the game makes.in pretty much any populated game you will have people cheating spawning money teleporting players instantly killing anyone in the game races will have players using cars far faster then anyone else indestructable cars at that oh and they will spawn random cars and objects behind them to block the road whatever mode you play there will likely be someone cheating and Rockstar don't seem to care Rockstar still seem happy to charge legit players money to buy in game shark cards so they have a chance of buying stuff in game which with every new update gets more and more expensive and more and more overpowered.if you are going to charge the same as a full price console game then it should work at well as a full price console game problem is it doesn't online is awful on PC (,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-05,7,162,673,False,Recommended,"This is my 600 hour review.I'll break this down between single player and online.Because I have different opinions on both.First is Single Player because its easy.Single Player is a near perfect masterpiece. Probabaly the absolute best single player game of all time. If you are looking into this game for SP then its a no brainer.However next we have ""GTA Online""Its a mixed review.I have a lot of hours into online and I will continue to put a lot of additional hours into online.PROS It gets constant content added several times a year the release ""free"" DLC'sThere really is a lot to do if you wish you can really role play the most corrupt criminal to the fullest extent.CONS I'll just start out with the biggest con.The game has clearly taken a big turn in the last couple years and its intesifying toward micro transactions.Its pretty obvious the keep raising the prices of items you purchase in game compared to the amount of money you earn. Unless you are dedicating your life to this game its pretty hard to obtain the in game items. And if you are starting out as a new player the amount of money you need to catch up is really a huge obstacle. I am not one of those people who are defiantly against micro transactions but these aren't even fair micro transactions.Rockstar keeps raisning the price of the in game items but the amount of money given out on a ""shark card"" has never been adjusted. Here is an example a 8 Million dollar shark card (unless on sale) costs $99 always has.It use to be that most items were under 1 million with the extremely high dollar things around $2 million.So for $99 you could typically buy say 5 15 items for $99. Fast forward to today. Most items are over 1 million closer to 2 million on average) and the most expensive items are 4 million with a yet to be released item that is going to be 6.5 million. Rockstar is really going for a money grab here and they aren't even attempting to hide it. Not to mention that the latest DLC the amount of money you can earn per hour has actually gone down from the previuous ones. So higher prices to buy stuff lower income from doing work. So you are forced to not really play the new DLC but the old ones for cash. Which is a shame because the new missions are actually very fun they just dont pay well.So if you are new and want to ever come close to catching up to current players you have 3 choices. 1.) Buy Shark Cards and ALOT of them. Several hundred dollars worth. 2.) Play an insane amount of hours quit life and play this game every day all day long 3.) Cheat Find mods or a modder and get ""modded money"". Warning you can actually get banned for this. I cant even beleive I am giving this advice out I use to depise money modders but given the greed coming out of Rockstar now days I really understand why new players would do it and I dont frankly care anymore.So you might ask Why do I have this game as recommmened still.When it comes down to the game itself single player and even online. It's fun there is a lot of varitey I can do missions I can race cars I can pvp I can play mini games (and there are dozens of varietys of games) I've played 600 hours and honeslty still to this day havent even played 1/2 the things you can do. There is a massive amount of content. The game is fun.The politics behind the scenes is horrible the comminity is toxic and the micro tranactions are getting out of control. But at the core its still fun and I still enjoy it after all this time. But on the other hand we probabbaly wouldnt get all these updates without the microtransactions so there is that factor too.I rate GTA 5Single Player gameplay 10/10Online Gameplay 8/10 ( 2 for community)Variety of things to do 10/10Game Updates 8/10Microtranactions 0/10",Grand Theft Auto V

However seeing the Total Biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try.Honestly I'm blown away in regards to how good this game actually is.

All i can say is i didn't realise i purchased ""Loading Simulator 2020 HD Edition""Kidding aside to elaborate of my '91hours' on record at this moment its safe to say ive spent 3/4 of it loading! Holy Crap man. On start up Online mode Missions/Heists Starting them inbetween choosing more missions finishing missions/heists(which constantly crash while loading which gets you locked loading with no way out other than to either Alt + F4 or try join someone elses game with Rockstar social club thing if anyone else is on) Though this is a personal niche of mine. Cutscenes (that you cant skip &amp some you can after you have seen it before if one person hasn't seen one before in heists sit back and watch a good 5min odd cutscene each time). Thats just some parts that need loading.I know what your thinking ""well of course you need to wait for loading stupid head!""And your right! good job fellow nublet. See now this wouldn't be an issue at all assuming loading times were minimal and the amount of times to load were minimal but hey that would be too mainstream 5min loading time average assuming you don't time out/Crash and need to load up the whole damn game from the beginning and as mentioned above there's just too much if you want to make people load up 5 mins for 2mins of gameplay thats fine i guess at least make sure it god damn loads up.Now lets get into things that need fixes. like joining friends sometimes you cant join friends from a number of issues like having not done tutorial(even though you have done it before). Also an issue where you may be buying stuff from convenience store dude for snacks and if someone comes around and holds it up while your in it you are stuck there unable to move or get out even after the thing is over. Missing weapons sometimes you lose weapons/lose all weapons and need to buy them all again. idling time out 2min idle time it seems. Which is fair enough but i personally think its too short maybe 5mins.(only a problem since you gotta load in again yay more loading screens. Which funny enough if your stuck in a loading screen you cant idle out which is the only thing i can imagine the idle out being somewhat useful)In fact as I am typing this I am stuck ""Loading"" Launching a mission for the past 10mins with no way out because you cant just press esc to leave the only way out is to alt + F4 and exit the whole game and load it up from the beginning which takes about 5 10mins just to boot up. I just...... no words. Wait Loading simulator 2020 HD Edition.ALL that negitive aside the game runs great when it works. Which is funny because sometimes as your playing the game still crashes. Happens randomly though not too often. Though i wouldn't know having not really played much of the god damn game. Sorry too busy crashing at loading screens and sitting through loading screens to get a really good run. End rant P Seriously though i would recommend this game easy balls if people could actually run it without pulling hair out at every minute of loading.",Grand Theft Auto V

The single player is some of the best out there and mods make this game more entertaining than games coming out today (Even though there was an attempt to take down the modding community but I'm not gonna go into that. The overflow of negative reviews and public outcry took care of that for me). The part I question is the unavailability of content updates in single player. There have been updates in past games and all have been successful and I guarantee you that if the online content was local people would be much happier with this game. I personally believe that the reason this has not happened is purely due to the lack of payment for single player content.Online the multiplayer experience that everyone I knew was excited for. At first online was a roaring success and I personally played for countless hours attmpting to get as far as I could. Then the first signs of greed occurred... I have seen prices go so high up that the clouds are jealous and money being made stay the same if not lower. This essentially ruined the ability of being able to buy anything enjoyable in online without shelling out hundreds of dollars on shark cards.Overall and to keep this review from turning into a ranting wall of text I enjoyed this game. It's worth its price especially if it's on sale... for single player content. If I'm speaking exclusively about online I would not touch this game with a 100 foot pole due to the online community support system and blatant greed being shown by this game's developer/publisher and I have to recommend my review against this game purely in an attempt to encourage others to vote with thier wallets.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-10,2,8,563,False,Not Recommended,GTA5 online I have never had so bad gaming experience. EVER! One of the worst UI I ever seen. Plenty of cheaters and even more griefiers (its a huge and I mean really HUGE!!! problem). This is the first multiplayer game where players do whatever they can to have an empty session (server) without any players. Game is abslolutely unplayabe with random players. Everything from net code to UI to keybinding to sandbox missions are broken in design. I cant find a proper words to express my feelings about oppressor 2 a holly grail of every grieffer. But belive me If I would wrote what I think this review would be banned in no time. Huge potential completely wasted by people who has no idea how the multiplayer game should look a like. The person responsible for the online mode design shouldnt work in gaming industry even as a coffee maker. Im very very disappointed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,715,False,Not Recommended,"Edit edit As of August 26th Rockstar have taken to removing money from peoples' accounts WHETHER THAT MONEY IS LEGITIMATE OR NOT. Due to the way Rockstar consistently treat their customers like crap I cannot recommend this game at all. If you do buy it do yourself a favour and avoid GTA Online like the damn plague because it's only a matter of time before all your legitimate earnings get removed.Edit Since this review was written Take Two have reversed their C&amp D on OpenIV however I will be leaving this as not recommended based off the other points I made in the review.Given the recent events between Take Two deeming that modding GTA 5 is no longer acceptable and their CEO somewhat recently saying that they weren't ""monetising users enough"" I simply cannot recommend this game any more.The premise of Online was great but the implementation was a massive disaster severely lacking with everything you can do locked behind several hours of grind or simply just sitting there and waiting 6 8 hours for coloured bars to fill up. It's all just a lot of repetitive grinding and waiting around for bars to fill.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-06,0,0,393,False,Not Recommended,"As a forenote Rockstar have no customer support and you WILL need to call them sooner or later.If you want to buy that game for the singleplayer it's not worth it's price. If you want it for the multiplayer make sure you don't mind playing with idiots you do not know and have the patience of a buddhist monk when something goes wrong with ... whatever the UI the joining system the friend system the message system the heist system the combat system the cellphone crap system basically everything is a bug that sometimes works as you would want it to.You can't play with exactly whom you want and that's the only reason why cheaters are a problem in this game. And there's no way to report said cheaters unless you are still playing with them which according to other reviewers yields a high chance of you getting banned.*also the game isn't worth it's price in multiplayer It feels like a complete miss I do not exactly how to put it into words but they had a tremendous potential and ressources at their disposal and yet the multiplayer feels wrong. There's a level system okay that's not bad in itself but it's used to unlock IMPORTANT things (which you also have to pay for so it's a dual lock) instead of just being here to tell that you should be held accountable for being a complete failure if you are level 300. The heist leave absolutely no freedom of movement or planning and the missions do not make any sense.Some mission require 4 players (you cannot play without said number or above) yet some (I am thinking about you Pacific Standard van tracking thingy) have 2 useful roles and 2 utterly useless roles.When I say utterly useless I mean it. the goal of this mission is to use your cellphone to track 4 vans 2 players can track them the other two cannot. after tracking them you have to steal a specific van something ONE player can do with no problems whatsoever. And that's it. basically if you joined and are in the useless team (the drivers) you have absolutely nothing to do and that's it.Let me clarify the silliness of the missions for that I'll use the prison break example _ steal a prison bus store it near the prison._ steal a car and a prison schedule and an aircraft the car will be shipped off wherever for the guy you break out of prison._kill things.okay that part makes some sense. now the execution _2 guys go in the prison bus and break out the guy from the prison._1 guy get into the plane and flies it to the airfield near the prison (where you could have stored it beforehand but hey no freedom)_1 guy goes after another empty prison bus kills the driver and must drive it to the airfield to destroy it. then board an helicopter and defend the aircraft against jet fighters.Why in the nine hells do we steal and destroy the empty prison bus ? Even the guards remarks that the 2 guys team only have one prisonner and that's it. the other bus is ing EMPTY and going to the prison. and the 2 guys will have to kill all the prison guards anyway so basically an all out assault would have worked better.The heist appear to have been written by someone completely devoid of any sense.The content creator Good you can make your own missions...wait.Actually you can make your own missions within specific boundaries and again freedom is kind of a null value. you cannot make your own heists (the only thing that would have made perfect sense plan your own heists). The only uses we found for the content creator is to use it to raise your character's stats place 20 angry strippers with no weapons punch and get punched to raise your strength.Economy there's no economy in multiplayer where it would have made a lot of sense.the stock market is unavailable you cannot sell cars for a living you have to wait an hour or so (maybe half an hour I dont know) between every car sold and must sell only standard cars for 1/10 of their value. so far the maximum we know you can sell a car is 9250.Basically to get money you have to do heists over which you have little control or have a biker gang over which again you have little control and have to play with a bunch of .When I call players I have to put that into context you have absolutely no incentive to play nice _You are shown on the map stealth is out of the question unless you pay 500 to disappear for 1 minute which is not enough time to prepare ambushes anyway and is basically the time required to make the call for it._If a player destroys your car he will have to pay the insurrance but he can very well push you in a lake and you'll have to pay it._The players cannot assume a legal role._The risk of getting killed is always higher than risk of off a few players. Shoot first ask later._if you are ""fair play"" you earn 2000 dollars every time so often ... I would say every 2 hours. which means you get pocket change once a year for reference a good horn for your car costs 50000._if you bring a car to a heist if other players destroy it you have to pay the insurrance basically do not bring a car to a heist.But the real pain in the comes from the UI.In order to play with the people you want in multiplayer you have to launch GTA in solo (1) then go into play online closed session that will launch GTA multi (2) then you launch a heist(3) but wait someone has a problem or just quits you will be thrown back into a common session (4) in order to go back into a closed one you will have to relaunch gta solo (5) then repeat (6) and again (7)So basically if all goes well you will have endured 3 loading times.If not you will have endured X * 3 + X loading times assuming you quit with TASKKILL. And that is ing depressing. not only the menus are slow to load they are ING UNWIELDY.and yes my game is on an SSD. And i have 16gb of ram. and a 4.2ghz I5 6600K. and my loading times are SHORT in comparison to some but it still kills me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Modders are the only shining light creating workarounds for these vehicle blocks. When you attempt to spawn a MP vehicle in SP using a mod it will disappear as soon as you enter it.

2015-04-15,0,0,64,False,Recommended,First of all I think this game should have 2 reviews not one. First review for Storyline mode and the second review for the Online mode. Now my experience might be brief with Online but pretty revealing and my singleplayer experience so far has been a dream. Before I begin I must point out kudos to Rockstar for this port on my current machine GTAIV barely could run at minimal now I am running GTAV at medium at it works like a charm. This is how you do a console port.Storyline Mode + Good story &gt it really kept me interested in what was happening I didn't skip phone conversations or dialog since I was actually curious what was being said and I wanted to learn more. Nice use of the phone for this as well to deliver bits and pieces of story that makes you understand more about those around you.+ Great and diverse characters &gt the three main charcters are unique with their own motivations personalities wants and desires. I must say Michael for me got me really invested into the game great character.+ Good graphics &gt everything looks very good in this game and running it at medium I didn't feel at any moment as if this was just a game. Everything looks way to good.+ Overwhelming number of activities &gt so there is literally a ton of things you can do in game excluding story missions. Not to mention activities like meeting strange people who always make you do strange and entertaining things. You won't get bored easily believe me. You can even play and train your freaking dog in this game...+ Optimized for PC &gt I know a lot of people cannot start the game because of problems with Windows User thingy and Rockstar Club but once you get it started the game is surprisingly optimized for PC. GTAIV couldn't run on my laptop previously but GTAV really runs smoothly. I barely have stutter and that is only when everything on the screen gets chaotic due to too many explosions but that is the exception. I can't find anything optimization wise to complain about.+ Customization &gt Alright there are a lot of ways to customize your characters with a very diverse number of clothing options and you can also customize your cars like in a Need For Speed game.I have no cons for the Storyline mode so far. Maybe after I get even deeper into the game but so far I am really satisfied personally. This is the GTA game I have been waiting for.Online Mode + Good graphics &gt what? This applies to Online mode too. Game looks great either way no mater what mode you play.+ Overwhelming number of activities &gt Online mode also has its overwhelming number of activities to perform. However most of these do range from singleplayer types to multiplayer types. Like racing deathmatches heists and a lot more where you and other players can burn away the hours of the day.+ Optimized for PC &gt this one I must add again since really given that the map you play on is populated with other players this should normally lead to frame drops stutter and lag. Well I can't say I have experienced that so far for me playing Online with other people has caused no problem.+ Customization &gt the level of detail you can go into to in order to create your online character is astounding. This is a proper character customization tool upon creating your first character and I must say I am very impressed. Especially with the lineage part.+ Multiplayer ready &gt there are a lot of multiplayer only features designed to fit the game for online play which feel welcomed. Like the ability to deposit your money at an ATM so other players can't steal it from you. Players &gt well surprisingly enough the biggest con of Online mode is the players themselves. This is not like the GTA Sand Andreas roleplay servers where everyone tries to fit in the online world and enjoy. This is just people trying to enjoy the Online world with others and the rest who just wanna troll. Like any open pvp online game ever in existence there is no shortage of trolls and sadly you spend most of your time in Online mode playing the Hunger Games. The enjoyment is kind of drained from this.Overall GTAV is worth its praise it certainly is the best game Rockstar has made to date and if you ever enjoyed any of the GTA games in the past 2 decades then you will certainly enjoy this one too.,Grand Theft Auto V

They hiked up the prices on pretty much everything and it takes weeks of grinding just to get a few cars... Or you could buy a $20 Shark Card and get it now!!!

Don't reward these greedy scumbags for being as awful as possible to their fanbase.Oh I almost forgot they promised a single player DLC but then decided that it wasn't worth it because they get so much money from the Online game.

They obviously have done things not only legally but with the well being of the game in mind in order to expand the experience this game has already 100% provided. So Take Two Interactive please get your heads out of your asses and start improving the game/servers yourself instead of adding another P.O.S update just to get more money out of people that bought this already expensive game.

2017-06-15,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,"Basically Rock Star hates you and only cares about your money. That was obvious from the day it first released and the fact that it still cost a full $60 despite coming over a year later than the console versions. The screwing over didn't stop there though. They started charging ridiculous amounts of money for in game currency. Instead of discounting their game during Steam sales they would only sell ""discounted"" bundles that included this in game currency... but which still cost at least $60. When this currency apparently wasn't selling well enough they started adding a constant stream of crazily over priced in game items. It used to be that there were only a couple things you could get for over a million but now they're a dime a dozen.And all of these complaints are only valid when the game actually works. GTA V decided to buck the trend of other AAA games instead of improving over time it actually gets worse! Now It can take me up to thirty minutes just to get into an online game and stay in it. And recently hackers managed to somehow take all of my ammo rebuying it would cost over a hundred thousand in game dollars which would conservatively take about an hour to earn back.Finally they're recently started screwing over creators of single player mods which is hard to believe is anything other than an attempt to make even more money with some other upcoming monetization scheme.",Grand Theft Auto V

They dont create games for the educated consumer but they pray on the young (children) where mommy and daddy will had over the credit card to shut their kid up.

2017-09-10,0,0,522,False,Not Recommended,Oh god I could rant about this game forever but to keep from boring you too much I'll just give you something I posted to reddit about the current state of the game. Singleplayer is fine by the way online is the screwed up part. Okay basically how the cycle works is that players buy shark cards to buy in game items because they are too expensive (part of the reason mass hacking is also a problem) and would take forever to work towards. Rockstar uses the shark card money to release free DLC. The thing that angers me is that the DLC that Rockstar releases is benefitting the players who are loaded and have lots of money because of their shark cards (or hacking). They never make DLC adding varieties of way for the rest of the players to make more money. So while I m grinding for a yacht 12 more 6 million dollar cars get released and it s impossible to keep up with. So what we have here is Rockstar is essentially just helping people who purchase shark cards. On top of that they are literally giving hackers (that they always complain about but never fix) more power because they have money just like the people with the shark cards. Oh and also all the DLC they release is essentially the same thing except branded differently. So in conclusion the online aspect has dug itself into so many holes it's honestly a point of no return.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-25,1,3,1159,False,Recommended,When you read most of the reviews for GTA V Most will say they got banned and such. Well from my recent experiences it's quite true. Rockstar have been really strict with their rules lately and last christmas there was a huge ban wave which made most players that got banned confused and obviously. For me on the other hand as long as you play safe and just stay away from all the things that can you get banned E.G Getting dropped money Helped by a modder/hacker during heist or mission or whatever really. And you should be fine. GTA V is obviously what you would expect just an open world game where there are tons of games missions and such. If you want to buy this game you have to get some friends honestly if you don't this game will get boring quite fast. For now i'm not sure if rockstar will expand Online more since i think they have to deal with Red Dead 2 soon and the recent DLC Import and Export was quite huge so i'm not so sure if they will add more content to Online. Overall this game is pretty fun with friends and such just stay away from hackers and you'll be fine.,Grand Theft Auto V

It was known not to put mods and use them for the GTA online portion of the game for the sake of cheaters the like... makes sense so far. The crux is Open IV had strict tennants on their mods (to name one specifically they can only be created and designed for the single player portion) so they were creating mods within the terms of service. They bent over backwards to ensure this and that all mod creators were also working within the legalaties to ensure no terms of service were breached. This went on for YEARS in which Rockstar Games not only publicly stated they had no issue with this form of modding on their games and actively promoted some of the mods available on Open IV on their own official blog!

2018-07-29,1,3,727,False,Not Recommended,This game is absolutely infuriating. The game is tilted towards people who have more real life money because just a little bit of cash can get what tons of people actually have to work for in game. The mechanics of the game are centered around other people which is absolutely horrible if you want to play publicly. If you're doing a bank job and some level 13 on your team dies at the last second you have to start all over and if just 1 person leaves the whole group gets kicked from the mission. That is if you can actually get 3 other people for a bank job. The other activities aren't much less team centered. If you want to do an import/export job then you need people to cover you if you're getting fired at. You aren't able to get that if you don't have in game friends. And the problem isn't that I don't have any friends I have 160 of them. It's just that if you do find someone who's actually online who wants to do missions you still need 2 other people not to mention Rockstar is lazy as when it comes to fixing issues. Take for instance the 1.40 update. This update made it so people couldn't change genders because of an exploit. I'm surprised their best fix for a bug was to just get rid of the that made it possible instead of I don't know FIXING THE ING EXPLOIT ITSELF!?!??!?!? Another instant of Rockstar not giving a damn is when they decide not to fix the social club. The social club does not link to steam in friend terms and if you want to add a team to your friends list then you have to painstakingly go onto the social club layout memorize their names type them individually into the search bar and if there are multiple people with that name oh well. You can't use the steam overlay's player section either. I will change the review when Rockstar somehow fixes any of these problems.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-07,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,"A Great Game But Bug Filled and Poor Customer ServiceOhhhhhh GTA Five... What a game. A game filled with almost neverending fun with its freemode singler player and a story thats Okay at best. Ya got three trademark characters that I honestly enjoy as their personalities bring a nice color of taste to the GTA 5 storyline and the world of GTA 5 in general. Sadly though the storyline is just a bit too vague or bland in my opinion. The only time I could recall to myself saying ""Oh my god this is awesome"" was at the second to last mission. Thats it. No other times did I have a sense of awe or amazement.The gameplay though makes up for that in my opinion. Ya got freemode to just run around on if you dont like the Story. I spent most of my time on GTA Singleplayer just ramming into other cars to see the awesome damage to be honest. But you can drive around play some minigames or just look at the views.But Im sure all who has read my fairly poor written review thus far is wonder why havent I talked about the Multiplayer online feature and that that should sell the game in itself. Well I'll tell ya Jimmy its because Rockstar released a game with an Online feature that isnt finished yet has terrible customer support and is overall lazy in their Online feature.The day I bought the game about two days after once I got a bit used to the controls of everything I hopped into the online mode and was having fun. Even bought a Great White Shark Card in preperation for it. Only to go about two and a half hours in to be banned for reasons Rockstar refueses to tell me and for reasons I say unjust. Funny too their support ticket system for ban appeals is met with bots almost everytime and I am safe to assume only bots see it as when I called Rockstar support the representitve refused to answer my question of ""Do tech representitves see support tickets that bots respond to or does it auto close for no real human being to see?"" So I requested a refund.. Apparently they wouldnt allow a refund no matter what with what the tech guy told me (This was back then when I had 18 or so hours of gameplay two of them being online). So I just decided to wait it out and play the singlerplayer the entire time I was banned which was on the 6th of September. So the 6th rolled around and I got on GTA Online again only to be banned once again in two hours again for reasons Rockstar will not say. I even recorded my entire session up until I was banned and with all the replies I got from Tech reps on the phone and the bots Rockstar basically said that they won't look at the video but if they do then its a miracle for me. So now Im waiting a month to be free can't get a refund probably won't have the ban over turned writing this review.So a little more back to the game itself. After doing some research with a friend apparently if you own a MSi computer that alone can trigger the autoban to ban you. MSi has some programs and software that helps with game performance built right into the computer. I have an MSi so this could be one of the reasons. Not only that though XSplit recording software SteamFPS Overlay MSi Afterburner Overlay RIVIAGametuner all can get you automatically banned as the Cheat detection system Rockstar has implemented is completely broken. I'm assuming that if the Cheat system detects anything that connects with GTA 5 it automatically bans you. Optimizing your games having an FPS overlay recording your game that captures striaght from it and has an overlay things like that. Please beware of this should you think of getting this game. Its a great game but only lasts so long on Singler player and the multiplayer if you can play it is a blast but sadly if you are like me you will be stuck without Multiplayer without a refund and without friendly customer support that actually tries to solve a problem.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,Looking to buy GTA 5? Don't do it.Take Two interactive has made one thing clear to the fans of GTA Online and Rockstar they just want our money.This game has now taken an EA stance it is now a OWOOP (over work or over pay) game meaning that you can't do anything in the game without having to put countless hours of your life into the game or by paying large amounts of real life money for the items in the game. As of right now I cannot recommend this game in any way unless you love wasting your time on a singleplayer story that only lasts you 30 45 minutes which is a weird thing to love considering that all of the development has been circulating around GTA Online.Parents please do not buy this for your child or children unless you're ready to empty your wallet or wait for your kids to empty their wallets.To everybody else do not buy this for the online multiplayer. It is a money scam and while you think the game is 60 bucks now you'll either end up wasting your life on this game or spending your life savings on a yacht or a fancy car. Heed my advice and do not buy into this microtransaction horse crap.There are many reasons as to why people are mad right now but a lot of people are pointing at OpenIV a modding tool centered around the Grand Theft Auto universe and the team behind it getting a cease and desist from Take Two Interactive (publisher of the GTA 5 game) to cease their modding development. This has sparked outrage for two reasons one it had many more uses than to hack and troll in GTA 5 online and two because it's impossible to play GTA Online without paying lots of money or spending enormous amounts of time on the game. This problem has been around for years and now Take Two is taking it up a notch ruining the experience of the players by allowing a microtransaction system that is flawed unbalanced and unfair along with keeping the gameplay monotonous and tiring. It's truly sad to see a game with such great potential be ruined by the greed of Rockstar and Take Two.If you don't understand it clearly enough I'll tell you my story and I'll clear some other stuff up I started out playing legitimately. I have over 200 hours on this steam account after buying the game in late 2015 for PC and near the time the game came out for PS3 in 2015 as well. I completed the story 3 times and then I started playing GTA Online on my PS3. It was fun but for the 3 months I palyed it I only got to level 17 and had less than 100 000 dollars with only a tiny garage to my name (100 000 dollars is a small amount in this game by the way). I then switched over to PC and from there I started grinding extrmely hard for the money. The most I ever had when I was playing legitimately was less than 2 million dollars but the anti cheat at the time was horrible and was banning people for no reason and it happened to me I got banned because a hacker dropped 40 000 dollars on me and when I came back all of my stuff was gone and when I tried to contact Rockstar Support they basically gave me the cold shoulder. From then on I said screw it and started hacking. Of course I got banned again but I was never going to be able to get what I got from hacking if I played legitimately and by the way I spent about 40 dollars on cash before I got banned on this account permanently. I deserved it of course but to be fair there was no other way to get a lot of money without hacking for it paying for it or wasting your time on menotonous work.Yes hacking is bad and yes anybody who hacks on GTA Online deserves to be banned but trying to play it legitimately is either tiring or costly and it just plays into the greed of Rockstar and Take Two.This is the extent of it You want to buy a fully maxed out yacht IN A VIDEO GAME that serves very little purpose in the game? Pay over 100 dollars to Take Two Interactive for it. You want to fully max out your weaponized Tampa? Great! Just wait for hours for your research to be completed or waste money speeding up the process much like Clash of Clans or any other fremium mobile games. Oh and when you run out of supplies go on super long and repetetive missions just to get supplies back to your bunker while risking the event of getting your supplies destroyed by other players who have severely progressed in the game You want to make money? Okay then get some business! You have to pay for the businesses though and a motorcycle club to host those businesses and supplies unless you want to do some hard dirty work by yourself and after all of that you can sell all of the product!...unless of course it's document forgeries or if your businesses haven't been upgraded with the very expensive upgrades available for purchase. You want to make money some other way? Become a CEO for the low price of an entire building that costs 1 million dollars or more buy a vehicle garage or cargo hold for lots of money and then sell the vehicles and cargo you get from extremely repetetive and hard vehicle and cargo missions for prices nowhere near 500 000 dollars which can't even buy you any of the luxury cars dating back to updates from 2016. Are there other ways to make money? Yes! Play long repetetive races and boring adversary modes that can give you anywhere from 10 000 to 40 000 dollars which might be enough to get you a small Panto but that's only if you win the game you're playing. Or you can do heists but only if you're level 12 have a heist room or play with other people who may or may not fail your heist over and over again. By the way only one heist gives you 1 million dollars the rest give you much less and you can only get that money if you're leading the heist. If you're not leading the heist you get very low cuts. Here's another idea do long boring time trials that give you little RP and a good bit of money but take forever to do. Or pay for the money. See that's what Rockstar and Take Two want you to do but they don't want you to have TOO much. You want 1.25 million which isn't enough to get you one of the newer luxury cars? Fork over 20 dollars. Want a useless yacht for 8 million? Fork over 100 dollars which for it's young playerbase is a lot of money. You want a bunker or a nice house or a nice apartment or a CEO office or anything that comes with them? Better fork over that 50 dollars in your wallet.As you can see it's either overwork yourself for money or spend your life savings on virtual cash. It's menotonous it's scummy and overall it's indicitive of what this game will become.Shame on your Rockstar. Shame on you Take Two. This is supposed to be a fun game not a money laundering scheme. You want to enhance the experience? Stop trying to get money from people and realize that they're not going to be happy when you make the game impossible to play without putting your heart soul and cash into it.You disgust me and you certainly deserve this review.I rest my case.

2016-11-04,0,0,379,False,Not Recommended,"This review ended up in three parts early impression after 2 3 days of playing (roughly 10 hours of gameplay) impression after 30+ hours ingame and then one after 70+ hours ingame. The reason for that is that I could clearly notice myself how my impression of the game slowly changed over time. This game is clearly made for consoles. I rate it 3/10 for PC. I have never felt like I've wasted money when buying a game no matter how is was but this game really hit the dirt.Graphics are awesome it's a beautiful world and they have put a lot of time on cars etc. so it really live up to the name ""Grand Theft AUTO "".Controlls are worse than useless. Extremely confusing the default setup doesn't make any sense. Everything feel extremely sluggish and unless you feel like raging at the controlls every hour or so you should spend a considerable time going through EVERY settings you can for controlls. What bugged me the most is that I enjoy flying vehicles but in this game aircrafts share control settings meaning that since I want seperate roll buttons for plane/chopper I'm screwed since I have to adjust every time I change aircraft type and in Online mode it doesn't pause. This made the flightschool a living hell since it didn't give time to adjust inbetween unless you left the school.The menu itself is horrible. I strongly recommend using keyboard since it's confusing as hell to use a mouse when clicking around.Overall this game is 100% made for using a controller. Otherwise be ready to sit and go through keybinds and adjust it.Personally I regret buying it. It has huge potential but it's crap for PC if you're used to PC games.I'm really trying hard to find something I can enjoy in it though we'll see soon enough. I still have some hope it can redeem itself. Addition after more time (around 30 hours ingame) after giving it more time I've actually managed to have some fun in the game despite my struggle with the menues and controls.. But so far I'd say it's more because of the people I've played with than the game itself. It does show that the game still have some potential though. 70+ hours into the game final verdict The game is actually pretty good. But still has plenty of drawbacks. I'd probably rate it 5/10 however overall. There are stuff I enjoy and stuff I utterly hate. so many things could have been done differently to make it so much better. Great potential but I would only recommend giving it a try if you already know someone who plays it and can help you get into it and to have fun with. It definitely boost the experience a lot.The first impression is there is so much to figure out and understand how it works which is very daunting and I personally couldn't see myself find any way to enjoy the game.But now after having spent a lot more time in it I still really utterly hate the controlls and menues.... but the game itself can actually be pretty fun. Especially with a couple of friends.I don't like how they force you to play in public games to be able to use all functions in the game however since I prefer to enjoy games of this type with just friends. I'm not a fan of random people just trying to you off nothing more. The public game mode encourage a lot of pvp but it's not even about that.

Closed friend sessions all the way.The game itself is open to be enjoyed in so many ways that everyone should be able to find a way to enjoy it if they look around enough for it. Flying driving robbing killing exploring etc etc...But it's still horribly converted from consoles into PC and it really shows with the mechanics around controlls in general. just moving around feel sluggish and somewhat awkward at times.Warning if you play this in first person view I recommend to never get into a fist fight.

I've played the game since it came out on the PS3 and I've spent many hundred hours playing online. When it was published for PC I bought only for the reason that I can transfer my online account and continue playing with it online. It worked well and I couldn't complain. However when I wanted to play again after a while Social Club somehow did not manage to let me log into my account. Apparently it was deleted for no reason without even messaging me. On PS3 and PS4 my account still exists and I can play perfectly fine. Nevertheless it is impossible to access my account on PC. There's no way I could ever reestablish what I achieved. Therefore I'd never play or can't play GTA V on PC. Thanks for that Social Club.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-15,0,0,620,False,Recommended,"If you've played Grand Theft Auto V on consoles then you'll be pleasantly surprised to see that this is indeed the definitive version of the title. Rockstar have done a wonderful job of developing the game for PC. I say ""developed"" as it was built from the ground up and there's almost no sign of a port in sight (maybe only from a gameplay or an on foot perspective). A good example of why a delay or two can be a positive.From a single player perspective Rockstar pulled off something we hadn't really seen done effectively before in that of multiple characters which can be more often than not switched on the fly. It allows for an overlapping narrative between each of the three characters. I personally loved the dark nature of Grand Theft Auto IV's story but V's was a nice return to form and on a second play through it grew on me. Taking a step back the world is a living and breathing metropolis and the landscape is just the most beautiful I've ever seen (especially up north).As you would imagine the writing and voice acting is second to none. It's important with three characters especially when two of those characters share a history. There's some nice beats too.With a mass of graphical options you can tweak the game almost exactly to your liking whether for preference or limitations and the game performs brilliantly. At any resolution or video setting GTA V still manages to put itself at the top (in terms of graphically quality). Native 4K support won't be useful for the majority of people right now but it does future proof the game. The addition of the Rockstar Editor is great for budding filmmakers or those who just want to muck around.Grand Theft Auto Online has been improving ever since its release with Rockstar continually updating it with new content and all important bug fixes. It wouldn't be unreasonable to say GTA Online launched as a beta on consoles but with the amount of content that has been added it's hard to make that argument any more. Sure there are still issues (lag hacking and general gameplay issues) but Rockstar are taking the mode very seriously. It would be easy for them to take your money and run but that's not the case with Grand Theft Auto Online. It's also worth noting that every update and every piece of DLC has been free. No strings attached. Shark Cards might be a thing and considered microtransactions but they're really only for people who don't have time to commit the hours to earn money online or for those who simply can't be bothered grinding. All it gets you is money which can be made in game through almost every activity. It can be a tad tedious but there's fun in that. Story mode DLC would be welcomed but at least a section of the game is receiving continual updates.Lastly the heists are wonderful. They spent a while in development but I believe the proof (of quality) is in the pudding. The only issues issues are poor connections as well as random players coming across as incompetent. A crew of four (two for the first heist) acquaintances is definitely recommended.It is one of the finest games of this generation and one of the very best ever made.",Grand Theft Auto V

Considering every new update they release a lot of cool things for their playerbase to use they also come with an extravagant extremely ridiculous prices. One can argue that you can easily grind for this money. You actually can't without wasting half of your life on this game. Every mission (including the heists) give a garbage amount of money to you after completing it. Why is that bad? Can't you speedrun it? No you cant. Why? What if you don't have friends to play with? You can get stuck with randoms who either just randomly leave or the typical trolls who love to kill the poeple in middle of the mission/heist making you fail and causing you to wait even LONGER to get your ""hard earned money"" that is as significant as losing a single dollar bill is to a billionaire. This then leads to the overwhelming increase in hackers and other major eploits to get you money and considering lots of the playerbase is so desperate to get money they will go to these extremes. Rockstar will then do everything in their power to rid of these things while affecting millions of other innocent players who just want to play the game and have actually earned their money the hard way. This new update is an absolute joke this game has easily turned from of my favorites into a pile of putrid infamous garbage.

I love this game infact it's one of my favorite games of all time but it's getting hurt by the stupid greed this game definitely is worth the full buck for the singleplayer story but in this state it's hard to suggest online and while it has lots of potential and can definitely be fun (especially with friends) it has evolved to be based around microtransactions and grinding the latter one can be interfered by players with their multimillion war machines to ruin all your progress with little effort.,Grand Theft Auto V

Lets just say im glad i got it on sale at $29.99 as i have grown to hate Take Two and Rockstar recently with the focus of GTA Online and shark cards and such. Not to mention that brief incident with OpenIV. To be completely honest i got this game only to play a modifcation. LSPDFR is the only reason i even purchased the game and I'm glad i did because there is never ending content and the modification community works harder than any Developer at these studios do.

2017-11-24,0,0,252,False,Recommended,"Let me start by saying that singleplayer mode is a masterpiece the best open world I've ever been in the characters are are amazing the story is interesting the detail Rockstar put into the game really shows as it's one of the liveliest open worlds ever even if you 100% it which will take a while as the game has a lot of content. Overall it's worth it full price for singleplayer alone.My gripe with the reviewers here is that all the negative ones are solely about GTA Online. I dont think it's right to judge a singleplayer open world game by its free multiplayer addon which was not the original focus of the game. I would say GTA Online is great fun for after you beat singleplayer especially with friends. A nice added bonus to the already amazing game.I will now prove that all negative reviewers' points are BS ""I got banned for nothing! Wawawa!""Rockstar does not ban people for nothing. You used mods/hacks online. Even if you were wrongly banned which you weren't there is still singleplayer and you probably got your money's worth already.""The game is a grind!""Doing the same missions over and over is boring go figure. People who complain about ""the grind"" are obviously just playing the exact same missions which they think give most money. The game is what you make it. You can make money via jobs races heists bunker work smuggling parachuting running a biker gang a CEO business multiple illegal factories countless adversary modes survival mode as well as a map editor so the community can make infinite maps and the list goes on. You are not short on ways to earn money.""It's pay to win!""Sure things in this game cost virtual money which can be bought with real life money but it isnt simply p2w because of that. There are ways to obviously make yourself stronger than others such as buying new weapons and armored and weaponised vehicles but most of this stuff has a required level to unlock so someone cant just join the game and instantly use real money to become better than someone higher level. Considering it's an open world sandbox you dont really do anything with your money useful there is no way to ""win"" you just make money and buy cool cars and clothes and stuff. Besides GTA Online is free and has been getting free updates for years they have to make money somehow.In conclusion get it.

2015-04-15,0,0,1110,False,Recommended,GTA V is an interesting one.The single player is good and enjoyable for most people who enjoyed the previous stories in the series.However GTA online itself is pretty flawed when played publically and cheaters are very much present due to the game being peer to peer rather than having dedicated and protected servers. This is horrible if you're trying to play the game in a legitimate manner since a cheater with scripts can come up to you and drop cash on you ruining any sense of accomplishment that you could otherwise have.However since day 1 i've stuck to playing with friends in friends only lobbies and using IP whitelisting to make private public sessions to enjoy the game and it's honestly not as grindy as people say it is. (This is probably because people blowing you up constantly can make even simple tasks an absolute pain.)For anybody who's interested in pure co operative gameplay this is a good title to pick up if you have trusted friends who are in a 250ms ping range. There's plenty of ways to setup a public private server if you do a quick google search.(The reason I say most of this is because about 50% of onlines content is restricted specifically to people playing in public lobbies such as cargo and businesses I believe this is rockstars way of making player griefing more dominant however I find it strange this is the case since most of these missions spawn NPCs instead if the lobby is empty of opposition.)The game can be difficult in PvE sometimes but it can become easy enough once you learn to communicate with team mates and have the mindset of the fact that you can die in one to three shots making cover usage very important.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-01,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,I want to like this game. I really do. However the money hungry developer (2k/Rockstar) and horrible community within the game make the game almost unenjoyable. I've played almost 200 hours on my ps4 version and just recently picked the game up on pc. Whenever you are online there are consistantly players trying to kill you when you are just minding your own business even when I am not doing online missions. It takes hours to grind to get the top cars/tanks/airplanes in the games and it is almost impossible to do unless you spend money. Because of the microtransaction craze that Rockstar has with their games I'm giving this a thumbs down. As for the single player experience this deserves a half thumbs up. I enjoyed the gameplay and the storytelling seemed almost movie like imo. However the campaign is short lived and I hope the upcoming rdr2 contains more singleplayer than what Rockstar provides us with GTA 5. As for the graphics they are still great even for today's standards. Bottom line is this if you don't miond spending money oin microtransactions then sure buy the game.

2017-11-26,0,0,944,False,Not Recommended,Great game all round single player and multi player. Game devs are constantly adding new modes or lots more of different types of racing content. New cars / some armored some not weaponzing of some cars etc. Single player storyline you switch from character to character for different parts of the missions some being the characters special abilities weather your playing as one of the three main charters stories lines. Michal has the ability to slow down time. ( great for out side shooting weather it be running or riding a bike helpful for the earlier on running of the marathons with the bikes. Franklin which you start out playing (after the main game intro play) has the ability in cars to slow down time. Great for the car racing missions. The first race mission might be a little tricky with his special skill being lower but after you develop it by using it more. ( it dose regenerate over time so use it as much as you can starting out to help you much faster along with game play since you switch from time to time and missions to missions.) Trevor the third character you run into for playing has the ability to take damage (when in this mode getting head shoots or more killing damage helps to regenerate the bar much faster.) Multiplayer the game has lots of great things to offer with it's share of plenty of not so fun times or bad experiences some can be a mix all depends on the community your playing with weather it be a solo session friends only clan invite only and open world. Everyone will or can have difference experiences in any of the different online open world multiplayer world. All maps are pretty much the same but you can find some differences in the single player and multiplayer modes. Weather it be cars / locations of some. or some buildings you can get into and some single player you can / can't same for the multi player version of the world map. Easter eggs can be found some in single player and multiplayers some it can only de done one or the other same for pc vs consoles some work on one but not the other and some work on both. (YouTube can be great finding some if they have glitches or exploits chances are they have been patched hopefully by now. so most of them shouldn't work.) Modding I personally never tried any on this game only gave that i have where legal mods for left 4 dead 2. Game dev's eliminated modding in the game. I seen some awesome game mods / modes for the game via YouTube livestreams etc. Game never ran correctly for me or high enough fps (frames per second) for me to even bother. Yet you still see even though devs have said to eliminated all modding you still see players on multiplayer seasons dropping in game money modded cars etc. players that should of been banded a long time ago yet for some reason Rockstar still seams to let theses people play on their game servers wrecking it for others some modders in games aren't always bad people so don't take that the wrong way but more of the time than not they end up wrecking a game mode event world or race by adding things that weren't meant to be on the map and they stay there till you restart the game after closing it out completely some of the mods even carried over to your single player world unintended if you didn't notice till you try to play it on the same night / day with out restarting your game. (still happens even after said they eliminated of all game mods/ modders....lies.) Sure they can fix or patch some thing but also a lop hole some where in coding flaws. Take 2 interactive which is part of the Rockstar. CEO plans to add to every new game they plan to release from this point forward in time to add micro transactions into every game. The companies way of saying your paying $60 for a game but where going to add lets say as easement for each game $0.99 to 150.00 extra real life money you have to spend in the game after you actually bought it at full price or sale of most new game average of $60.00 per new game maybe 1/2 of that on sale for a new full game lease / license. To the companies Their like yes we can **** even more people once they have bought our game They don't seam to care their all about just profits. Yes some of the in game transactions can be helpfully to players that don't want to waite or grind levels etc. so some can be beneficial to people from that stand point of view. However any thing like that you can buy with real money should be released as some thing you can or should be able to get with the same in game currency with little or no effort however that doesn't seem to be the case for most companies. If you treat your costumers correctly weather it being by making a great game you don't have to worry as much but if it's a half *** game with micro transactions then it's even worse. Without happy people or costumers game makes and companies eventually will go under or sink. For the developed game makes publishers devs etc most not all but more than it should be don't care as much after you buy their games so still do luckly. For RS (Rockstar) and 2k (take 2 interactive) I would say are more on the developed side of the spectrum. Yes they add more content to most of their games credit for that however the micro transactions not so much. Personally they could careless about their actually costumers after they buy the game. First hand experience with the company. Enjoy the new content updates for multiplayer open world and 2x rp adversity modes. Luckly they rotate some of them from shooting to driving modes etc. Might not always like every new update they offer but many like the verity to the game from time to time and sales on different random items or vehicles or mod upgrades weather it be built proof vest or car turbo upgrades or paint resprays for cars or ammunitions for your weapons or charges etc. upgrades for your apartments or upgrades for the biker club or other in game organizations. Little simple things that can help make the game a little easier or more fun some times or to help you out after struggling to get that next big upgrade of your dream lives your running in the game or organizations. For the main reason for the not recommending this game is as follows. Great game Yes single player and multiplayer yes and noLast time I voted two awards for this game in The Steam Awards and once for it in the current Steam awards. (it is a good game) However from my experiences with the company and someone who bought the game / licenses for pc and on console. Even gifted games from this company 2k and RS multi copys some for pc and console and many other games from the game devs and their makers. Had a problem with the game since i got it on pc for over two years. I had recently contacted the RS by phone to help trouble shoot to fix the problems.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-07,0,0,514,False,Not Recommended,"It's Grand Theft Auto V Grand Hack Auto Online there's not much sense in explaining what it is or discuss whether you'll like it as you most probably will love hate it. Review updated see comments. Hacking situation gets only worse Rockstar seems completely indifferent. I really cannot ""Not Recommend"" this game enough at the moment. However while it has generally been a pleasure to play GTA Online it is currently riddled with hackers and untill that is resolved I really can't recommend the game. Why not?Well the hacks in question are super obvious we're talking players teleporting players teleporting other players players spawning objects (usually money) and so on. Naively you'd think that it's a simple matter of detecting such things as players positions changing abnormly and spawning money and simply deal with it automatically. Reality is that hackers are absolutely free to roam as they please even dead obvious flags like a player being level 8000 (most players are between 0 400 in level) would called for a player review. So what happens instead then? Well you play the game. You do missions which then no matter how careful you are fail because a hacker teleports directly into your path and blows you sky high. That's on a good day. On a bad day the hacker spawns money *on* you. Rockstar is able to detect that you've gotten ill gained money and they have demonstrated in the past that they are perfectly happy banning players for this. So should you be so unlucky that a hacker spawns money on you so that you pick it up you then have to make reports about the incident to Rockstar and hope that you don't get temporarely or permanently banned. Because of a situation caused by insufficient policing or detection by Rockstar. To show the extend of the issue the last week or more of playing every time I've launched the game I've met atleast one hacker. Usually it more per day. Today was the record so far with 4 5 hackers in a 20 player session that we switched to because of hackers in the original session. I'll have a break from GTA untill this issue is resolved. If it is resolved I'll also update the review to recommend because the game is tonnes of fun to play with friends.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,117,False,Not Recommended,No OpenIV? This game is a 100% waste of money if you cannot mod. you Take Two.They fixed modding because the community itself like it rightly should have. I can recommend the single player it is great but the multiplayer is a microtransaction filled mess and a grindfest if you don't pay. It is also filled to the brim with hackers.Also no story DLC to expand the story because they spend too much time and energy on the MP. So don't expect anything after the main campaign is done except for whatever you can get with mods.I've considered making the review positive again since mods have been restored but then I remembered my golden rule. Microtransactions in a full priced game are inexcusable. The cashgrab culture that these developers display is too much for me to handle. Hell they don't even put the DLC MP content into the SP game you have to mod it in. The MP is 200% more grindy than it would have been without multiplayer.So for this review to become positive the following changes need to happen Stop selling shark cards OR at the very least make it so they can only be used to purchase cosmetic items. This pay to win t is unacceptable. Merge the new MP vehicles and so on into single player without mods being needed. Reduce the need for grinding. Money earned and item cost should be on par with single player or at least balanced in such a way that shark cards don't provide any gameplay benefit in the shared world. Get rid of the damned hackers. How is it that other devs can make anti hacking tools that don't mess with the modability of the single player but you are unable?Conclusion The single player is good but only buy this game if it is worth it for only the single player. The multiplayer is a crime against good game design and consumer friendliness.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,It has come to my attention that Take Two has essentially disabled the usage of mods in this game as well as previous GTA titles I believe in singleplayer mode. Whilst I very much enjoy Rockstar's games such a drastic and unforgiving move by Take Two being the publisher of many of Rockstar's games has had an understandably catastrophic effect on the community. So although it may not necessarily be the game itself or even Rockstar that I am opposed to it seems like we might be able to sway the people behind this decision to reconsider for the sake of everyone else out there who has demonstrated that they are willing to make themselves heard over these matters.'Tis a shame to be negatively reviewing this game but perhaps something good will come of all this if Rockstar/Take Two take notice of the recent reviews of this game (although it's more about the modification options really).But alas this IS a fairly good public medium for expressing views and thoughts such as these...Thanks Steam.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,(TL DR at the bottom)I had the ps3 version of gta v back when it came out and I liked it a lot. So I pre order gta v on PC. It gets delayed but that's fine. It comes out I go to play multiplayer and I'm prompted to make an account for social club. I make one to play online. Little did I know that making an account is permanent and I was not able to get my level 50 character from ps3 moved over now. I called rockstar support. The guy on the phone said tough luck. I emailed rockstar support. It took them three weeks to unbind the new account so I could finally play my old character. I load up gta v sign in to my old account and it works. The only thing when you get this game it comes with an activation code. It says I already used my one code. So now I can't play online at all. I submitted another ticket to rockstar support maybe in another three weeks I can play the ******* game.All in all it's just been frustrating. When I was able to play online lemme tell you there was some whack connection problems. Heists would break all the time and get this After you finish a segment of a heist (it's like a mission with missions building up to the end) you get put back in free roam. So your lobby of four people gets split up and it takes forever just to start the next mission.TL DR I can't play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,3,11,195,False,Not Recommended,2015 the year of consumer revolt. First paid mods now banning for mods and going as far as banning people from SINGLEPLAYER for mods. I don't condone cheating in the slightest. I really hate cheaters on CS GO and I certainly didn't like them on GTA O. Do I think they deserve single player bans? Of course not.Do I think anyone using an FOV 'mod' should be banned or an edit to remove intro videos?Absolutely not. Rockstar I have no idea why you think banning people like this as a result of your own shortcomings is a reasonable idea. You delayed the PC port many times and the PC version came out nearly two years later. How and why is this acceptible? Clearly you've made quite a bit of money from sales of GTA V just from the last generation of consoles alone. How is it that a TRIPLE A dev with MILLIONS put into development and marketing of GTA V not have anti cheat? How come using CHEAT ENGINE ONLINE is still a thing? How come you didn't include proper field of view options at LEAST?Oh and the patches regarding 'fixes'. These are the best because one patch the game will be running fine and not drop below 60fps on medium settings on a gtx 770 + i5 2500k. The next patch would introduce stuttering DITHERING ON MANY OBJECTS and framerate drops below 60 all the way to 30 40. The online experience is wonky to say the least. Even on an evo 850 256gb SSD loading online is a joke. Because most of the networking is handled clientside actually trying to join a game of GTA Online is a joke. Same goes for races deathmatches etc. Don't even get me started on those abysmal menus. For whatever reason I also get paired with people across the world. This is a game that had nearly 400 000 people playing on launch day and you're telling me I have to connect to someone with the buttery smooth experience of 300ms net latency? Really?On the topic of mods wow. You literally cannot ban them. I don't know what R* is thinking but because they are geniuses and made a lot of hosting clientside it only means that custom multiplayer servers will come sooner. Great job R*. You tried to stop modding but you only made it EASIER for modders since you aren't using your own servers. That's hilarious.For anyone curious I wouldn't bother with this game until R* fixes it or modders come to save the day to create a TRUE GTA online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

By stopping modding Rockstar can assure a seamless and endless flow of cash from the people throwing money at their screens hoping that their credit cards can give them all of the best toys in the game. Because hard work sure as hell won't.With each new update Rockstar decides to take GTA a little further from what GTA ever should have been by adding such things as owning a business exporting cars creating weapons. But remember no stealing cars for yourself! That's a crime. If you were to for some insane reason try to steal an expensive car you would have to be politely told that Rockstar doesn't have time for your moronic sense of ""fun"" and that you're obligated to buy the nice cars.But first you have to buy money because all of the nice cars would otherwise take about 100 or so hours to actually obtain each unless you want to deal with the endless slew of cancer trying to stop your totally legitamate entrepeneurally endeavors in this game about killing and stealing.Instead of playing the game the way you want such as through modding or having fun with your friends in a sandbox Rockstar would encourage you to become well Rockstar. They pretty much invite cheating with open arms I mean why else would you design such a massive paywall for the most enjoyable content?Oh but don't get caught cheating. You'll be banned for a month your account will be completely reset and you'll only be allowed to play with other people who have been banned.Also don't be caught in the game anywhere around cheaters. This will also get you banned will reset your account and again you'll only be allowed to play with other cheaters.

2017-06-15,0,0,415,False,Not Recommended,I have owned this game for four years. From the PS3 to the PC. I bought a PS3 just to play it because it wasn't on PC. Poured thousands of hours into it on ps3 and hundreds into the PC version. Including the online mode. Only four months ago I decided to try to play mods. Not knowing Rockstar is the Nazi Germany of mods trying to exterminate all of the mods. But I had fun. I didn't touch multiplayer because I knew better. But I played with realism mods LSPDFR and mods that allowed multiplayer vehicles to singleplayer. And I played through the whole story and had tons of fun with the story that has received no DLC. No additional Locations basically completely ignored after a few bug fixes and texture improvement from release date. I have played through the story nearly a dozen times and modding gave me several playthroughs of having some more fun.Well when I was done playing with mods and wanted to try the multiplayer again. I reverted all my files to the original backup I kept and tried to play multiplayer only to find out that I had been banned permanently. After several emails I found out that I was banned on MULTIPLAYER. For playing SINGLEPLAYER with mods. Since then I have yet to touch the game. It has been several months and now I have found out that Nazi Germany. I mean Rockstar (Sony) has been threatening legal action to modders. People who's sole purpose was to make the game better. Or more fun. Or silly. People who loved grand theft auto. Who were dedicated fans who have played through all of them multiple times like myself.Honestly there are so many better games out there that I really think you could have more fun playing something else. And if you're not one of the millions of steam users who own grand theft auto 5 and are considering purchasing it? Please don't. It's not worth it. Buy Grand Theft Auto 4. Add some texture mods and gun mods or anything you want. And enjoy that game. But be careful because on the PC you need to mod the game in order for it to even work because of Games for Windows Live. A failed program that has been a scar on several PC games. Choose wisely. Don't get GTA V developed by Adolf Hitler of Nazi exterminate all the mods.,Grand Theft Auto V

Next thing I heard about Take Two they had banned another mod called 'FiveM' which supposedly allows multiplayer with illegal copies of GTA V. This wasn't true though as it asked for a legitimate CD key to be able to play it. I gave it a shot before it got completely shut down which I managed to get around ten minutes of gameplay out of but it was still very underdeveloped and never had the chance to bloom. It could have been the next big thing with possible full conversion mods and the ability to play them online.Instead of going after the hackers they've come after the more legitimate side of the table the modders. I don't know why.

Five years later following a high resolution PC release it still dominates the multiplayer charts thanks to its extremely varied gameplay and massive amount of addictive activities.The online part of GTA V is not without its issues particularly in the form of a particularly toxic element in its playerbase something the developer Rockstar is either unwilling or unable to address.

2017-06-18,0,0,223,False,Not Recommended,"https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivI'm going to be honest here the game is fantastic and so is multiplayer. In saying that I'm leaving this review negative until Take Two gets their heads out of their behinds. If and when that happens (highly unlikely) I'll change it to a positive review. I believe even though the game is good a negative review is warranted due to horrible developpers who can't make good decisions. I'm sure all of you know the situation where Take Two took down Open IV so I won't go into detail about that but I'll go into detail about why it was a stupid move. The online modders already know the Open IV code this isn't going to stop them. I believe so many people will be off by this that the online hacking community will just grow. The hackers found a way around OpenIV's MANY attempts to stop their users from going online and will continue to create more. The OpenIV team was clearly against their players modding online. Why did Take Two instead of taking the lazy and damaging route not just simply work with and communicate with the OpenIV team? I won't blame Rockstar yet since they're just a subsidiary company and we don't know their role in this other than that they're obviously going to defend their parent company but Take Two that move was honestly stupid. I and many others had passion in modding the game it kept me playing GTA. I had many fond memories of messing around in singleplayer and that was the only thing that made me come back to GTA and sometimes try out online again. The online community is toxic and as I'm sure everyone is aware there's plenty of cheaters. If you really cared about that why not just impletement a system where you report a hacker and you get a reward of in game currency if the case turns out to be real? And then you can work with the OpenIV team to tell them that you aren't ok with certain features and you'd like to see _____ be implemented? This was an ""in the moment"" irrational decision and while that's normal seeing as we're all humans here you decide to double down on your stupid move and try to back it up. This shows that it was done out of corporate greed and other motivations. Maybe you didn't want to shut down singleplayer modding but you sure as hell didn't think this was going to help combat cheaters. I booted up online and I saw modders in every single lobby I went to yesterday this hasn't crippled the hacking community only made it stronger. People will release workarounds and be hailed as heroes and profit off of your mistakes. OpenIV cared about GTA and wished for it to remain a grounds for creativity and passion that people put into their mods. Clearly they cared more about the users than Take Two or Rockstar. Summary This will do nothing to the hackers (infact I personnally believe this will only make hacking more popular) This only hurts people who care about your game and don't hack They could have worked with the OpenIV team They could have pushed a system of reporting a hacker with proof reward for person/people reporting them Instead of fixing this clear mistake they double down on it showing that they truly don't care about real fans creativity or passion and just want more money This shows a clear disconnect from the GTA community and the creators This shows that the creators truly are incompetent and balancing public/corporate interests I loved this game but I won't be purchasing anything from either Take Two or Rockstar until you deal with this crap properly and I suggest anyone reading this do the same https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv Sign this petition.

2017-06-16,0,0,880,False,Not Recommended,"This review applies to online mostly as I haven't played much of the story. The game is lots of fun when it works but there's too many issues for me to recommend as ""good"". The experience inevitably gets frustrating after not very much play.Pros+Free DLC with lots of content+Some extremely fun and unique game modes.+Something for everyone. There's a million different ways to play.+Tons of vehicles. Collecting personalizing and driving around cars is how I have the most fun+Benny's cars have a ton of personalization options. (I wish every car had that level of customization)Cons You can't get a world record on any race all the times are hacked to a few seconds. Long loading times. Wouldn't be such a big deal on its own but generally annoying. You can't try out different color combinations on vehicles before paying. If you try one color combo switch to see another and switch back you'll end paying three times for each color change. This applies to all vehicle upgrades (spoilers performance upgrades etc) This bothers me because the MKII weapons added in the Gunrunning update have upgrades and color options as well but once you buy a paint scheme or a scope you own it forever. You can switch between any purchased upgrades for free. Cars should work this way as well. Just makes me feel like the game is nickel and diming me. Any time the game fails to join session it boots you right into singleplayer automatically. It wastes my time because I'm typically not in the mood to play singleplayer if I'm online. Give me the option to retry joining online instead of forcing me to load singleplayer than join multiplayer again. This makes zero sense from a user experience perspective. Also it usually fails to join session because I alt tab to do something else because the wait times are so long. The game doesnt like losing focus even in Borderless windowed mode. In some competetive game modes (gta races deathmatches) where you can use your owned weapons instead of a predetermined set there is a 'Buy all ammo' button which is supposed to fill all your owned weapons. It always takes my money but rarely actually fills all my ammo. Also most of the time when I buy ammo for MKII weapons it disappears from my inventory next time I log in. I've filed support tickets for both of these issues but the outsourced support department just runs me through a script of basic troubleshooting items (verifying game cache etc) before just offering to compensate me for the lost money without addressing the root of the problem. Daily objectives would be a great way to make money but many are nearly impossible to complete without friends. There's just so many gamemodes and half of them have no one playing. I appreciate that we have a lot to do but oversaturation has divided the playerbase. For example 'Complete a Capture Contend'. Barely anyone plays Captures and the fact that they've divided into 4 types doesn't help. A lot of useful game functions like replacing a destroyed vehicle going off the radar summoning a vehicle from your garage are handled through the in game phone. The problem is that half the time the phone rings a few time and doesnt pick up (the menu acts like a simulated phone conversation). The whole phone thing is for immersion I guess but I will never understand why I cant just access these options on the first try. Also there's a second in game menu (interaction menu) that also has similar features but works differently. The two need to be merged. You also can't climb or shoot while using the phone which is frustrating",Grand Theft Auto V

There are a ton of things to spend your money on but the most profitable thing you can do is a heist that pays out like $600 000... you have to grind super hard to pay for your 30 million dollar yachts and stuff or you can just pay real life money.Its an extremely steep process if you actually want to get all the online gear without paying CASH $$$. In my opinion thats basically pay to win people flying around in this insane military vehicles that you couldnt afford unless you hacked or pay cash or spent your whole life repeating the same heist over and over and over.Im gonna give it a thumbs down but I dont like that system. Id say its a 8/10 for SP 3/10 for MP. The map itself is awesome in a MP server but theres really nothing to do that makes u feel ur time is spent productively.

Here is a quote from the CEO of Take Two Interactive ""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view UNDERMONETIZING on a per user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more ... ""Following this statement they shut down the most popular tool for creating singleplayer mods.

2015-05-11,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is THE ing around simulator of 2013. There's a lot of ing around simulators set in sandboxes but there's none quite with the same hallowed recognition and flair that Grand Theft Auto possesses. It's unevenly designed (see the ing UI re it being garbage beyond figuring out waypoints) padded as to fill out a 40 hour game time (that's only if you do the main missions and little else in between) and the game itself feels well detailed and alive and somehow at the same time feeling like computer people existing in a computer environment. Now that it's 2015 it's finally out on the PC and it has new content for its multiplayer platform! Unfortunately for Rockstar I don't give a about Grand Theft Auto's multiplayer mode. If I wanted to play a multiplayer Grand Theft Auto I'd just buy a box of surplus grenades from my local Neo Nazi and huck them at passing cars during rush hour.Despite the tongue lashing I gave the game I like Grand Theft Auto 5. I like it a of a lot more than I liked Grand Theft Auto 4 which managed to tap me out through a combination of awful writing ancillary t and not being able to shoot Roman in the face when he begs me to take him bowling. Oh don't worry there is so much ing around you can do here from golf to taxi driving to underwater deep sea diving to fighting with other s on the Steam Discussion forums on whether Claude Speed is still canon in GTA or not. But if you want to just dig deep into the miserable lives of three s looking for scratch so you can get into all the awesome multi stage heists to pull off for sweet dollars and sweeter gamer cred you can do that too and ignore everything else.Now that I've validated your opinion on this video game I am going to say mean things about the writing. If you don't care about the writing of Grand Theft Auto please do not reveal the spoiler tag. Pretend I'm talking about cheeseburgers or something.I think the writing of GTA 5 is highly uneven. Sure Rockstar are taking bold leaps forward by having three main characters with wildly different lifestyles and circles of friends and that is something to applaud. I want to see Rockstar do some Wire type with many main characters but they have to overcome their hurdles first.I think largely I was tired of GTA 5's satirization because I know what they're getting at I just don't find it funny anymore and it think it has more to do with 'haha lol political satire rofl topical humor s and rofl' than it has to do with the lack of attempt of actual satirization. The game is kind of really misogynist and I don't know whether that's an intentional choice or whether it escaped the glaucoma ridden panopticon of SATIRE that the writers tried to create. (I'm betting on the latter). The torture mission sucked and I told the game to go itself when it was over. The main characters are fun and occasionally have actual human emotional moments but their characters kind of fall apart towards the middle part of the game and are driven by the overwritten 80's action movie plot that you can either wrap up neatly or not. It's all shoddy writing masked by excellent world detail and voice acting performances and I hope Rockstar ups their writing game for the next time around.Anyway Bacon Cheddar Burgers are delicious you should go buy one!,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is good mechanically sound and lots of potential with mods.The online in stark contrast is everything wrong with multiplayers that contain an ability to purchase money in game. Shark cards are pushed so hard that the entire online experience is just a redicilous grind unless you fork over money. Or cheat if so inclined.There is no mixed standing to say that the singleplayer is great and multiplayer is it's either i say good or bad. And for me I just can't stand how greedy the online is to the point that they don't even put the online content into singleplayer anymore like they used to.

2017-03-05,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,"ONLINE REVIEW 3/10SINGEPLAYER REVIEW 8/10Do not under any circumstances buy this game. I am one of the few people that isn't banned and isn't venting in steam reviews.I haven't been banned. I don't use any mods/hacks. This game used to be the hub for all my friends. Great game hours and hours of play on the ps3 and then another 161 clocked in less than two weeks after I bought it. So why the not recommended? Listed from least bad to most bad 4. P2P networking Watch your data usage during play online. The upload speed is phenomemal and as such I cannot play with my friends as my character will update it's position on their screen once every 10 60 seconds. I don't have an amazing upload speed in fact its pretty poor. But why would that cause a game to be unplayable online? I'm an avid gamer online and this $75 game I can't play online with my landline connection. So I have to use my mobile hotspot to play it. How sad is that? This game will eat like 1 GB per hour of play. Oh and if your networks misses to many you'll just be kicked back to singleplayer and enjoy ""loading simulator"" trying to get back into the lobby with your friends.3. The grind for money Money works more like EXP than the leveling system does. Even when the game works you have most things locked because you're to low level then you need to have enough money to get everything. Granted you gain levels quickly early of course. Now money is how the entire online thing works and it is supposed to and it's done quite well. You are always trying to get more money even if you already have to much. The problem is when everything costs so much you have no freedom in Grand Theft Auto. It will take 100's of hours to get yourself into a position where you can just ""do whatever you want"" in online lobby's and that is when it is the most fun and THAT is how R* is making so much money off the sharkcards. I won't spend more time explaining it but I'll just say it'll take like 10 hours to save enough to buy a 2 000 000 dollar car and then you still have to get all the things that go on the car.2. Sharkcards One of the last points I made in the last paragraph leads onto this Pay to Have Fun. The sharkcards aren't ""needed"" to play but if you have a full time job a family and other things to look after you are never going to get a plane/helicopter/boat worth having. DO NOT buy the sharkcards. They are work 40% what they are asking for them as you're basically paying more money on top of an already overpriced game (How the is this game not $60 on steam yet?) so that you can skip play time and get to the part where you can get the things you want.1. Hacking/Modders and the banning You knew this would come up. Even if you spend $1 000 getting a tonne of sharkcards and you getting literally everything in the game others have suggested you can get banend for no reason. I have not seen a case of a false postive personally but I'm sure there heaps I mean every person that it happens to is going to be loud about it. HOWEVER one of my friends decided he dgaf about GTA O anymore and set up some modding software for online. Took about 5 minutes for him to get banned for a month. So it does work... That being said it to easy to do it. They are literally in EVERY SECOND LOBBY if not more often. So even if you spend $500 or 500 hours getting everything you want your lobbies are plagued with modders. Not like one dude cheating 100's of millions. That would be fine. Nah you have buses flying around faster than jets with 14 people in them and the bus is invincible. That kind of cheating. This is what drove me away from this game.TL DR If you want the singleplayer experience go pirate it. R* does not deserve any more money for this game. Do not buy it. Don't even buy it when it's on sale. The bar has been set very low for red dead redemption 2.",Grand Theft Auto V

The more you look at it the more you think about it and the more you compare it it is a downgrade within the franchise and a shallow expirience. Singleplayer This suffers due to three things in my mind. 1 a development focus on money making multiplayer which leaves the singleplayer seeming old in concept. 2 multiple protagonists fail to be good individual characters. yes they may work together well as character types but within the storyline there are extreme inconsistencies and a total lack of Franklins reason to exist as a playable character except for the San Andreas callback. 3 the singleplayer is stuck between being a Ubisoft game and being a story driven title. GTA 3 and its branching titles were all very much sandbox games with a distictly separate story mission set. GTA was all narrative driven and reasoned for within the character and world. GTA tries to be both these things and just comes off confused and not confident. Online Where to begin. This has an incredibly toxic community. This has a series of added content that simply makes griefing more accessible harder to counter and encouraged in some scenarios. I understand the idea R* was going for with this and it interested me at first but the more I played it the more I understood that they were creating a milk machine of investment. The more you play the more you compete. In order to compete you need to get the good gear. To get the good gear you need to research it. To research its means you need money and a business. To get a business you need money. To get money you need to do missions. To do missions you need to invest your time. How does one invest their time? Play. Its a money microtransaction scheme of rage at this point with stupid omissions and a failure to keep prices reasonable. I will give it that they throw in some excellent lines of dialogue and the voice acting is superb despite the flaws in the writing. Also the graphics are an improvement over 4 and are still goodby modern standards short a few bad texture here and there. Also it has the best shooting system of the franchise. Its not the best third person cover available shooter but its still decent.If you like sinking time in to an ever rage inducing and increasingly worthless example of the phrase ""Familiarity breeds contempt"" then you may like this game.

2017-06-15,0,0,949,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. I recieved a copy of GTA 5 for my birthday last year. When I first recieved it I had alot of fun playing through the Story mode for the first time. Micheal Trevor and Franklin are all very unique and interesting characters each one fitting a type of player. Micheal being for those who enjoy story Franklin for those who enjoy progression and Trevor for those who enjoy Gameplay and Carnage. The Campaign is surprisingly long with a large amount of heists tied into the storyline plenty of collectibles and side missions for after the storyline. I've even reset my storyline progress a few times the story is just that fun to play. So whats with the Negative review you ask? GTA Online.The Online scene had been rampant with hackers for the longest time. Players who would use menus to generally mess around with other people in their online experience Such as littering the map with UFOs or Spawn in an invincible Rhino Tank and blow up everything and anyone in sight. Or teleport everyone out to the ocean and instantly kill them.Some of these modders would try to be nice to other players and give them large sums of in game money. Let them be able to buy the better things the game has to offer. Rockstar was loosing the opportunity to sell shark cards their form of currency boosts. They began to crack down on these modders. For the longest time they were loosing. And all the while they continued to pump out content that slowly grew more and more expensive.Rockstar had started some shady business practices as well. With certain things like CEO Bikers and Lowriders they will often hide paywalls behind paywalls. For example the Bikers Update added illegal business such as Weed Coke and Meth. To get into the Biker content you'll first have to buy a Clubhouse. The cheapest is 200K so its not a big deal. From there you'll have to shell out even more of your cash to purchase a property of your choice. Once you pick and buy the shady business that you want you'll have to upgrade it even more to get more efficeny out of it. you can restock you business with long and repetitive restocking missions that don't give any cash and a small amount of RP or just pay money to restock the business. You have to pay money to pay more money to only then begin to make money.Then came the Gunrunning Update. The Pay to Win Update I could rename it.You're given the chance to buy a Bunker and sell firearms throughout Los Santos getting some weapon upgrades of your own and some really cool vehichles along the way. Sounds great and fun on Paper but its completely tarnished by Rockstars greed. Paywalls on Paywalls once again except these are a minimum of 1 Million each this time. First you'll have to buy the bunker to get access to the Gunrunning aspects of this update which is really just a really expensive Biker business. After that you can either make firearms to sell or develop more advanced weaponry and munitions. some of these being very powerfull modifications that can dramatically shift the balance of a fight.There is also a Mobile Operations Center that you can purchase from Warstock acting as well a Mobile base of Operations. Problem is you can't buy one unless you own a Bunker. So theres at elast 1.1 million out of your pocket there. The Truck itself is 1.2 Million but unless you add nearly another million to the price tag to add the ACTUAL MOBILE OPERATIONS to the Mobile Operations Center its really just an oversized overpriced trailer. Its a minimum of 4 5 Million to access just the basics of the update let alone upgrading the business firearms vehichles and purchasing all the really overpowered veichles of the update (That Surprising nobody require even more money to upgrade after buying them. ""Guns Sold Seperately"" in a sence.)Now here's the crowning moment of this Microtransaction hell The Cease and Desist of OpenIV effectively making modding of GTA illegal. The number one way to mod the Singleplayer experience of GTA 5 now can revoke your $60 purchase. You see Rockstar on purposely makes most of their content locked to GTA Online so they can force microtransactions on everyone who plays their game. With the end of OpenIV and mods for singleplayer anyone who just wanted to try the content of Rockstars game have to play the Chaotic Online multiplayer or pay money to use their content and now that theres no modders able to drop money for other players Rockstar can charge whatever they want for in game content.If you don't own this game good. Don't buy it. Don't get sucked into the Microtransaction filled 30 player PvP cluster that is GTA Online that I've wasted 500+ hours of my life in. If you do own this game get out of Online now. Either stick with the well made Story or just stop playing it completely find a better game one that wont make you pay money to just be able to pay for more money.You ed up hard Rockstar. Stop milking your games success and start making it fun again.EDIT Alright I need to make some changes to what I've said. Rockstar isn't the culprit with this latest attack on Modding and GTA Online microtransaction hell this was Take Two Interactive. Rockstar not only encouraged mods they had also made blogs about some of the best mods they had seen for their games. OpenIV was very careful with its modding making sure it didn't encroach on the Online scene but yet Take Two have shut it down because they saw singleplayer mods as ""a Breach of Security.""What they really meant was that it was a way for players to have more fun from their game or simply use their overpriced content for free in the Singleplayer story mode without having to pay money to basically unlock extra content. Take Two interactive believes that they ""undermonetize"" their players and that they should be making more from each individual user so they're now trying to shut down any form of fun that doesn't require shoveling massive amounts of money into their Online Cluster Grindfest. You're not a player to them you're just another souce of money that they'll try their damndest to suck dry.Oh and hackers are still in the game. They shut down singleplayer modding with the C&amp D on OpenIV third party mod menus and hacks are still abundant. You shot what kept your nearly 5 year old game relevant in the head and ignored the second biggest issue your game has beside your corporate greed.Maybe just maybe you wouldn't have a modder or hacker in every lobby of your Online how if you didn't make getting the fun stuff locked behind multiple expensive Paywalls and nearly mandatory Microtransactions.",Grand Theft Auto V

Will NOT be buying Red Dead 2 or ANY other Rockstar/Take Two game unless the Cease and Desist letter is revoked and an honest public apology is made for violating OpenIV's fair use rights as stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Act.Fix this or go down the same path other AAA developers are headed.

2016-03-23,0,0,437,False,Not Recommended,"I pulled my original review giving it a B a while back as well as my revised review giving it a solid D and I think it's about time I revised it a second time. The Good Attention to detail. Trees shake with the wind rain forms puddles. Snow on the ground affects traction. Temperature gauges inside vehicles start on the lower end of the dial and slowly rise as the engine warms up post start. There's wildlife in singleplayer too. Large map almost TOO large. If you get tired of the urban jungle take a ride up the 1. Soon the grassy but otherwise barren mountainside will give way to swamps lush mountains hilly countryside beautiful rivers small farming towns and a desert. It's even more diverse than San Andreas and San Andreas was already pretty diverse. Weapons You can hold more than just one weapon of each type. In earlier GTA titles if you picked up a Desert Eagle you would not be able to also carry a standard handgun. In GTA 5 you can carry both plus the rest of the handguns. Same for all weaponry types handgun MG assault rifle sniper rifle melee shotguns heavy weapons and thrown weapons can all carry different weapons in the same slot. (Access them by holding the weapon wheel key and using the scroll wheel or triggers to choose.) This comes with the caveat that you cannot drop them in single player so if you buy six different handguns you'll have to scroll through them to get to the one you want. This is a double edged sword in Online however if you purchase a weapon you cannot permanently remove it.The BadThis is what I felt was disappointing enough to complain about at least. Keyboard flight controls are rubbish. By default W and S are throttle not pitch. My suggestion rebind them to Saints' Row controls (WASD for movement with throttle on Shift and Ctrl) You cannot change the 3 main player characters' personal vehicles. Don't like Michael's Tailgater? Sorry you're outta luck. Physics and combat engines feel like they've had a downgrade in realism from GTA4. Driving physics feel less realistic and more arcade like compared to GTA4 pedestrians don't really react to being shot/run over/hit from GTA4 your character doesn't react as well to the environment as in GTA4 and specific example hovering a heli low over water doesn't cause the water to get a dip in it anymore it just kicks up what could barely be called mist. The combat system also got a downgrade where you can't shoot guns out of someone's hand like you could in GTA4. If you want more examples here https //www.youtube.com/watch?v GWVtZJo HqIThe UglyHere's what I felt needed a total re work. I'll divide it into two subsections THE UGLY DEVELOPER PRACTICES The game is centred around Online. There are no DLC which specifically targets singleplayer. Also recent DLC patches haven't even MADE it to singleplayer AND if you somehow manage to get a vehicle from said recent patches in a singleplayer garage it'll despawn as soon as you attempt to drive it out. Online is centred around microtransactions. First things first the cost of DLC items and vehicles is insanely high. Example A flashlight A FLASHLIGHT was in the 4 digit cost range in game. In order to get something that isn't the lowest end thing available you need to grind and grind and grind and grind... or buy some virtual dosh with real dosh. You can argue pedantics with me all you like but the truth is this At a perfect 25% split without any bonuses PacStan pays out 312 500 maximum. That can be repeated by the host every 48 minutes or so. Not assuming setup time or anything else just assuming that every 48 minutes you get GTA$312 500 in order to buy a 10 car garage you would need to do that once. In order to buy say a Zentorno (formerly one of the go to supercars) you would need to grind the mission thrice assuming you had no cash on hand at the start and that's just to purchase not upgrade. Now say you want to purchase a yacht in GTA Online with no cash on hand. The cheapest yacht costs $6M so you would have to grind it TWENTY times just to be able to afford that. Developers are strongly against modding. Let's be honest you probably are looking at buying this to mod the hell out of it. Good luck. TakeTwo Interactive the publisher of GTA 5 literally sent private investigators to modders' homes with cease and desist letters after the modders announced they were working on an alternative multiplayer project. Not only that they literally just declared modding Grand Theft Auto 5 to be illegal and in doing so they shut down the main tool for modifying ingame assets such as cars gtaforums.com (which is why this review was pulled this appended and the review reposted). THE UGLY EVERYTHING ELSE Keybind conflicts. As in the keyboard and controller directly conflict with each other for some silly reason. Unlike in GTA4 where you could say accelerate with the triggers and shoot with the right mouse button (how you'd do that I have no idea) here if you're using the keyboard at all the controller behaves oddly. For example if you use a push to talk key in Online while running or jumping using the controller you'll activate the recording functions. If you're backing up a car with controller and just ever so slightly nudge the mouse your character will aim their weapon where the camera's pointed usually shattering the window in the process. It's a rather difficult thing to explain you'd have to experience it yourself to know what I mean. Does not affect those using keyboard only. Unmodified first person FOV is so narrow it's disorienting. Even with the slider set to maximum it's still hilariously low by today's standards. I don't have a source to go along with this but the max end of the slider in the menus is around 60 degrees horizontal (referred to hereafter as H) which can cause motion sickness if you are used to a much higher value. Going past 60 H requires external modifications. (For comparison Team Fortress 2 a first person shooter which was released for PC and consoles at the same time has its default set to 75 H which is still low by today's standards.) (Online only) Simeon ing Yetarian. The guy that wants every car off the street. Want to get somewhere fast? Accidentally jack a car off the street he wants? Boom two wanted stars. Kill the owner and jack the car five miles from the nearest person? LSPD instantly knows. Simeon can honestly go to hell and I'm glad that in a SP strangers and freaks mission you have the option to kill him.The verdictEven if I have spent a lot of time in the game it's still a rather disappointing change from GTA4. Yeah it's more optimised yeah it's a new story but that and what's up there in the ""good"" really is all it has going for it. I've gotta mark this down from a D to a straight up F given the crap developer's practices.

2015-11-22,0,0,231,False,Not Recommended,"TakeTwo's and Rockstars game approach ""Why should the players have fun when we can get money AND put in as little effort as possible?""Generally speaking gameplay wise the game is definitely good. But other than that it's just... no.Let's start with the singleplayer component of the game. You're through the story in perhaps a few hours if you do all the side missions and collectibles it's perhaps 20 hours at best and after that there's literally nothing left to do except doing it all over again. There has not been a single update concerned with the singleplayer since it's release in 2013. No singleplayer DLC no smaller updates nothing that concerns itself with singleplayer. Worst of all is that you can't even test out the new things that get released for online in singleplayer because why should you? It'd just make TakeTwo lose money because you can just get all the cool stuff in singleplayer and not buy shark cards to get it.Now online. The community is toxic the support is t and hackers are literally everywhere and neither Rockstar nor TakeTwo give enough of a to fix anything about it they just let it happen banning the people that get hacked rather than the hackers and just pushing out completely overpriced DLCs while nerfing the missions into total uselessness to force people into buying their Shark Cards so they can get even more money from this game.And now they even tried taking away singleplayer modding. The only thing that made this game actually fun. The game was in a downward spiral ever since it got released but this was a new low. And to have the audacity and try to choke down the news that they have put a C&amp D onto OpenIV by doing it simultaneously to releasing their Gunrunning DLC is just the worst I have seen so far even Ubisoft and EA can do better than that. I'm just gonna say shame on TakeTwo for ruining such a game and shame on Rockstar for letting such people ruin their game. Don't buy the game don't buy Shark Cards don't give those people more money than they already have. That's all I have to say to this peace.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,This game is a masterpiece. One of the best games ever made developed written and published. However being a masterpiece does not excuse a product by any means to target and discriminate against your audience. Three times you charged for this game on last gen consoles next gen consoles and finally on PC. Three times we bought it. We gave you our money willingly 3 times. Your recent attack on the modding community of your PC port is unacceptable. Many people would not have bought this game if not for the fantastic modding community provided by the OpenIV team. The single player world you crafted was only enhanced by these mods never took away from. Yet you continue to prioritize your multiplayer which by the way is really really bad. I have never seen something that took so much grinding. It's so impossible to progress quickly in it it is actually more economical to go out and get a job irl and pay for in game money with real world money through the Shark Cards. Yet you deliberately attack the single player and make it less fun by destroying the mod community in order to bring more people over to multiplayer so more people will spend money on your scummy microtransactions. To Take Two Interactive and Rockstar studios I am really sorry that you have *only* the fourth best selling game of all time behind Tetris Minecraft and Wii Sports. I'm sorry you feel the need to punish your loyal fanbase for your greed but enough is enough. I will not have it and your community won't have it. Maybe this one review won't do anything maybe all these negative reviews won't do anything but when the gaming press sees those review scores dropping they'll take it into their own hands. Maybe you should rethink your recent actions and actually reward your playerbase rather than punish it. There's a rumor going around that you actually scrapped plans for single player DLC in order to spend time on your abysmal multiplayer. After yesterday and today I believe it full heartedly. Get your act together you *were* one of the most respected publishers and developers in the world you *were* many people's favorite company and Grand Theft Auto 5 *was* one of the best games of all time. This game is a master piece and I am truly sorry that I have to turn my back on it. Sincerely A very dissapointed customer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-27,1,3,231,False,Not Recommended,The game itself great sure. (At least in single player)However I could never recommend than anybody gave Rockstar or TakeTwo money they are some of the greediest seemingly self obsessed developers/publishers in the entire video game space. They have repeatedly decreased cash rewards in GTA online for everything and inflated the prices too meaning that it ends up costing 100K to refill your ammo which is the equivalent to a heist mission and that is if you can get in a lobby without somebody leaving in the first 12 seconds.Micro transactions are full stop. Nevertheless Rockstar comes along and still manages to beat all of the competition except maybe EA in how they make them. The most expensive shark card costs NZ$125 for 8 million in game dollars this might seem like a lot but once you get in game you realise it really is not. Having to spend more money on top of the NZ$99 that I spent on the game in order to afford cars or whatnot (since you cannot steal them) is simply a cash grab and it makes me wonder why anybody feeds this with their wallets.In short do not buy this game please. As much as I hate to encourage piracy if you must play the single player then pirate it but please do not feed Rockstar and TakeTwo any more or things will never improve.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,159,False,Not Recommended,The game is pretty fun and the port is well done but it's a 4 year old game with heavy microtransactions being sold at full price. 3 singleplayer expansions were cancelled in order to focus on the lucrative multiplayer where new more expansive items are always being added. If you want to obtain money in game you can work like hell to grind missions over and over for as many hours as you can stand and hope the cars and ammo you lose are more than the money you are getting. Or you can hand them a lot of real money and start actually getting the new modes missions weapons cars and cosmetics. This game is meant to entice whales and constantly annoy everyone else with what they can't have.The publisher also just crushed the modding community devoted to mods that literally only function in the singleplayer mode because they felt the mods compete with the multiplayer mode.

Buy the game if you're interested in the story it was alright but don't buy the game for online. Paywalls timewalls grinding AGL's all the things i thought i would never ever see in a R* game but here they are to ruin and slow down your fun. There is no feeling of rewarding progression in the game like when online first came out when prices weren't so blown out of proportion. You end up playing the same boring missions all the time to afford the cool stuff but it feels like you never get anywhere. You can't even enjoy the new heist missions after seeing what the new vehicles cost and how little you get after the missions and you can't enjoy the heist story because you only really care how much money it will get you. Online was amazing when it first came out and you might wanna buy the game because it looks cool or because you've heard great things but it is very very different now. They even created a starter pack for online that costs more than the original game that gives you money and properties to give you a headstart because they now that online is fcked and that players would lose interest immediately if they bought the standard game and had to grind from the very start. 135 euro bundles and 90 euro bundles are you serious R*!? It does not cost that much much to make a dlc what the actual fock. That's things EA would do and you have now stooped down to their level. This just goes to show that at the end they are all just companies trying to squeeze every last bit of money out of you. When hackers feel like angels sent from heaven then you now the game is fcked.

Instead of giving the player what he/she wants and releasing some DLC or letting players introduce some fun and new content for the game they come in and take it all away just because of a few bad players.

This is ridiculous and anti consumer. Please if you do not own this game do not buy it on PC. If you buy it for console make sure you buy it used.

I know of people who used hacked accounts that have billions of dollars and Rockstar rewards them giving them kickbacks.

Twitter support is nonexistent and any ticket with the word ""ban"" is automatically closed and there are no replies whatsoever.

2015-04-18,1,11,444,False,Recommended,"A Masterpiece thats worth the waitIn a world filled with money grabbing devs useless DLCs and notorious but popular locked contents that were supposed to be part of the game was stripped away and made into season passes. These practices angered a lot of avid gamers such as myself and needless to say it is revolting to see that games are being treated untruthful to the genre's original roots.2015 has not been a great year for games with promising titles such as Evolve Dying Light and for the ps4 Order 1866 failing to deliver leading to disappointments for many. Doubts started to creep in and some suspect that even the best upcoming titles such as MGS PP and even Witcher 3 might suck.Amidst the chaos one star shines above all its gleaming bright and pure radiance covered the sky full of light hope and dreams. This star is known as Rockstar.GTA V was originally released as a console exclusive and has received praise across the board with 10/10 ratings. I did not buy into the hype as I had little memory of playing GTA IV 5 6 years ago and so I hesitated and waited.Suddenly Rockstar decided to port it over to the PC and when I say 'Port' I didn't mean Crapcom's lazy port with missing features and bad optimizations. I mean a whole new experience build from the ground up adding exclusive features implementing bug free experience detailed PC settings that are both well optimized and greatly refined. The PC version is hands down the superior and most definitive way to play GTA V.The StoryThe story revolves around 3 characters allowing you to switch freely in between. The characters introduced are Franklin Michael and Trevor. Each individual has an interesting back story and personality with Franklin growing up in the rough Compton like neighbourhood but is fed up with all the gangbanging and killing and instead wants to turn and make honest or perhaps fast dollars.Leading him into the shady world of doing vehicle repossessions and eventually meet Michael who is an ex bank robber now retired living off of the money from his final heist. Wanting a peaceful life seems to be too much to ask for and as trouble always come looking for him. With family on the line Michael is now back in the game.Trevor on the other hand is Michael's brother in crime and from many years of doing 'Professional business' the two formed unshakable bonds. In everyday life Trevor is one violent who runs 'Trevor Enterprise' a meth cooking laboratory. Nobody wants to mess with this psycho maniac as he will do anything to keep his business running smooth.The worldThe state of Lost Santos is a recreation of modern day Los Angeles and it is amazingly detailed graphically beautiful and vibrant. Popular landmarks were represented accurately and are a wonder to look at. The world and its people live and breath the same air as you do and will react to everything that has happened locally or globally which is reflected in news and radio channels. The size of the world is also incredibly huge containing varies geographical locations such as downtown area desert countryside narrow mountain roads and luxurious Beverly hills. Talking about radio channels there are hundreds of tracks available and I rarely hear repeated songs. The tracks were well selected with West Coast classics being my favorite channel constantly play tunes from rap icons from Tupac N.W.A to Snoop Dogg and many others instantly recognizable.Music genres have rich varieties and there is something for everyone. In addition you can import your own soundtracks into the built in radio to create the self radio and it can be shared and heard by friends on the passenger seats.Voice Acting/AnimationThe voice acting were spot on the moment you hear Franklin talking with Lamar each character feels realistic and packed with emotions that can be related to. Even the pedestrians will often talk to their loved ones or friends on the phone.The animation and facial expression were on par with LA noir creating the perfect balance between gameplay and storytelling.GTA V excels at the fact that it doesn't take itself too serious showing constant humor racial slurs and stereotypical aspects of different cultures and races. It is well executed in GTA V as it makes the player feel integral to the community whether you are rich or poor or the areas you live in.VehiclesGTA V offers a huge selection of vehicles with really well designed handling and overall great driving mechanics.Cars were also smartly placed with richer areas containing more high end sports and luxury cars and other areas containing more standard commuting cars and trucks on the countryside.By simply driving around you will instantly recognize Audi R8 Bugatti Veyron Porsche GT Lamborghinis and Ferraris.The intricacies of the mechanics expand deeper when reaching out into the air as aircraft has totally different controls with some degree of learning curve and practices getting used to.MultiplayerGTA V is not complete without its popular online multiplayer. With Rockstar well prepared launch every single thing were fully functional since day one and I have not crashed once in my 50 or so hours of gameplay.Character creation has you choose the heritage and inheritance based on your parents to give a general outlook and an accurate template of the character. Which can then be customized further to become a unique representation of your online avatar. But choose wisely as other characters do not share levels stats and money stored in the bank.As you level up and progress the character stats you will encounter countless of activities all over the map whether you are into shootout robbery or racing there's something for everyone.There are also plenty of competitive multiplayer modes to choose from standard team death match to car death match it has literally too many features and modes for me to list all here and you definitely need to play everything for yourself.Finally online mode introduces heist once you reach level 12. If you think Payday has great heist you might need to think again because GTA V's heist is definitely on another level. Heist has you assemble your own team and carefully selecting who's job is what and how it will be executed is the key to success.Each heist contains many smaller missions and these missions serve as preparation jobs. Once all the preparation jobs are completed you will unlock the finale of the heist. A longer intense action packed and adrenaline rushing action set pieces perfectly created by Rockstar. It really goes to show the high production value because it is mind blowing fun. After 10 failures and 1 success it makes me think I deserve that huge paycheck.For hardcore players and the perfectionist heists can be replayed to allow perfect plan execution for the mastermind. Completing extra challenges will reward you handsomely.With 80% of my play time sucked in multiplayer I have only just scratched the surface. There are still tons of content I have yet to experience and tons of missions I have not played. For the asking price of 39.99 it is absolutely a must buy as online alone will contain hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay and in the future more may be added.If you ask me ""Should I buy GTA V"" I say ""Hell ing yeah""The only aspect of the game I didn't like is the long loading time when transitioning from online to story mode and between screens when selecting missions but then again it is understandable considering the size of the game.Rockstar pays attention to details in a sandbox game with unparalleled gameplay and extremely rich content packed with a fully realized world to experience in first person mode. GTA V sets the standard for what an AAA game should be and likewise Rockstar sets the standard to how an AAA developer should make a game.10/10",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-28,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,This one is a far departure from the prior GTA games.Single player is alright while the online multiplayer (clearly the core component of the game considering the attention Rockstar spends on it) is a lengthy grind fest to acquire almost purely aesthetic content. While the attention to graphical detail is great the gameplay is shallow and repetitive.For the longest time in this game's development I had hoped and was very excited for it to be somewhat of a remastered GTA San Andreas. Boy was I wrong. The more I play and try to give it a chance the more I'm disappointed.It's very clear that their passion for making money has overshadowed their prior passion for making outstanding games. It really does pain me to say this as I've been a big fan of most all of Rockstar's prior games but my faith in them is absolutely null and void at this point in time.RIP Rockstar Games,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-29,0,0,458,False,Not Recommended,Now before you jump on me for not recommending this game I just wanna say that I do not recommend buying this game AT THE MOMENT. The things that makes Gta 5 one of the best games in the universe. Gta 5 is a flawless sandbox game where you can go around and do almost whatever you like in an enormous map. It's like they put you in another life where you can do whatever you like without being punished for it. You can just run down the street and punch someone in the face steal someone's car steal a chopper steal a jet go on a npc killing spree. There's almost no limit of what you can do.The online mode is what makes this game so extremely good (in my opinion). Just think of it doing this stuff i mentioned before but with friends! When you're playing gta online you get to create your own character and when you've done that you'll just have to clear the tutorial and after that you're free to join a server and do whatever you like! You can contact your friends and start a job to earn money and xp. If you got 4 friends one of them or you can start a little more difficult but well payed job called heists. The more you level up on gta the more jobs heists vehicles and weapons you unlock. Some annoying things in Gta but doesn't affect the game alot I know that this isn't something that can be helped but the loading in gta can be a real b!tch and the online might not be so fun without friends. The cloud servers are right now a little weird because they're sometimes preventing you or others from joining online. THE REASON WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING IT RIGHT NOW Rockstar had a problem where people who installed mods into gta got permanently banned even if they used the mods offline. In the latest patch rockstar tried to fix this issue (possibly) but the patch only made it worse.It's not why you couldn't install any mods in gta why I don't recommend this game now it's because of cheaters.There are ALOT of cheaters that have overflowed the gta online servers. These cheaters are ruining the gta online economy by spawning tons of money to other players on the server and they are also ruining the fun for alot of players by constantly killing them even if they're in passive mode (passive mode is a mode where you can't be killed by players) or not. It's almost impossible to report them aswell because they can hide themselves or their name and they can use other players name.Becuase of the cheaters all of the good things I meantioned above about jobs heists and fun gets thrown out the window because why would you wanna play a heist or a job now when you have a funk ton of money? You can buy every vehicle in the game when you're at a low level. You'll feel that you won't gain anything from doing heists and jobs because you already have everything you've wished for the jobs and heists will be completely pointless. Sure it may feel good at first but that happiness will not last long you'll get bored of the game almost right after you bought it. And that's why I don't recommend buying this game right now. Until rockstar has fixed this issue then I highly recommend this game!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-26,1,3,402,False,Recommended,Single player is GREAT multiplayer is also extremely fun but has a few issues. You'll find that most negative reviews are due to players experiencing hackers in the online game. This is what lead to the developers taking aggressive banning action and some players were falsely banned (even though they were not allegedly cheating).Despite these mistakes the devs are clearly making an active effort to improve the game state. However for multiplayer to work effectively there are many client side actions which are performed which makes cheating incredibly hard to spot with an automated system (hopefully not impossbile though). Despite what some say most online sessions you will join at least in EU will not contain a blatant hacker. This is not to say that hackers are a particularly rare occurence but it's not hard to quickly join a new session.The main reason I am writing this review is because of how positively astounded I was by the new FREE DLC. I first saw it advertised in the cinema and just couldn't believe it was available free. The new heists are challenging yet rewarding and the new vehicles are great fun. I highly encoruage you to grab a few mates and play through all three new heists together it's a great laugh.Overall then this game is a steal for the current sale price and I have no doubts that the developers will continue to support the game for free until a newer GTA comes out.,Grand Theft Auto V

Michael's temper drives the story forward and his relationship with his family is intriguing. The heists are fun and the game having multiple protagonists makes it feel like as if all of the responsibility isn't being shifted onto one character for heists setups and other missions.Online is good however it is a bit of a grind early on. I recommend you do Heists with a group of friends early on as it is very fun and gives you some good money. Once you develop a good way of making money freemode becomes fun as long as you don't get harassed much. The main problems I have with Online are just related to the grinding early in the game the hackers that you may encounter every so often (if you're in a full game you probably will have at least one however whether they use their hacks to annoy you or not depends) and the amount of trolls who just want to see you suffer and you need to use exploits to create a solo lobby so that you can enjoy freemode and make your money.I've noticed that a of of reviews ignore the singleplayer which is like the core of the game even if it isn't getting major updates anymore. Singleplayer totally makes up for the price if you have a bad Online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,368,False,Not Recommended,"Though I highly enjoyed it the Multiplayer is entirely too lackluster for me to enjoy anymore. I was going to see about modding single player to enjoy some of the more out there mods buuuuuuuut seeing as Take Two decided mods are bad I went ahead and uninstalled this dumpster fire.Edit Right so I figure I'd do a proper edit from my own experiences with this game.Pros GTA5 Single Player is a pretty great experience. It can be a bit jarring being switched between characters sometimes but overall the story is pretty solid. Though I vastly prefer GTA4's storyline and characters 5 does a nice job of a HEAT esque bank robbery story.Pretty stellar graphics and animations physics etc.Cons Pretty much everything about Online. All items are stupidly overpriced from your lowest jeans to the most expensive vehicles and buildings. It's like Rockstar is forcing you to buy their stupid shark cards so you don't have to suffer the grind and the grind is real.I don't know when GTA Online turned into Grand Saints Theft Row Auto 5 or whatever but a lot of the vehicles and ""events"" in the online portion of the game are hot garbage not to mention stupidly overpowered against people who don't have tens of millions of dollars or the time to grind out these absurd vehicles. Leave out all the flying DeLoreans and flying motorbikes and all of the rail guns etc and you'd have a solid Online experience if you don't mind grinding half your life away to make money to buy things.I personally find Free Roam vastly superior to any of the separate lobbies you need to be forced in to play missions i.e. Heists etc. Sure the nuance of ""specific mission sets"" is lost in Free Roam but when I spent most of my time playing GTA 4 you created your own fun and that was well the most fun I've had in an online GTA experience.To close I still don't recommend this game based upon the sheer amount of grinding time you need to dedicate toward making money along with the ridiculous and plain stupid vehicles you are able to purchase and the events you can partake in. If I wanted to play Saints Row I'd reinstall 3 and 4 and go nuts. GTA Online isn't the place for all of this stupidity. The Single Player is a good experience and I'd highly recommend checking it out but I'd avoid the Online unless you're a masochist and just enjoy the stupidity in which case this game is exactly for you.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-19,0,0,1653,False,Not Recommended,If you really REALLY wanna play GTA Online and waste your time grinding for virtual cars that can cost up to $100 with real money while getting paid worse than a McDonald's employee then buy the game on XBONE/PS4.Because every single session on PC is filled with modders (the griefing kind for the most part as well) and most of them don't ever get banned at all (cheaters are much less common on consoles). Actually you probably have more chance to get banned by running a third party program like Discord on overlay than any modder in this game.On top of that you CANNOT appeal your ban if that ever happens to you since Rockstar's customer services is worse than an Indian scamming anti virus software services.Luckilly I haven't gotten banned (yet) but I wouldn't even be surprised if my character ends up disappearing for no reason and wasting the ridiculous amount of time I spent on this trash.Update Now hackers can ERASE ALL YOUR MONEY without you knowing who did it and as usual Rockstar's support is so bad they won't give all the money you've grinded back. So there's literally no point in playing if all the time you spent grinding is just wasted by some random that you don't even know.Update 2 Not only did they took down a SINGLE PLAYER modding tool for absolutly no reason but they also suspended my account for a whole month because go figure. Well actually thank you very much for that now I'm free from this crap and I can finally spend my time on better games.Update 3 They actually lifted my ban probably because of a few kids who mass reported me because I said something snarky about them in chat or something.

GTA 5 was realeased 3 times on previous gen this gen and PC and is the fourth best selling game of all time and only 2 million copies away from being in the top 3 best selling games of all time. A very large amount of people purchased this game on PC due to the ability of being able to mod and then you spit in peoples faces and remove a crucial tool to modding SINGLE PLAYER and then back track and say it was being used to mod online. Not only is this killing your games life span tremendously its also killing a whole dedicated community who worked to improve your game. There are thousands and thousands of mods for GTA 5 car mods scripts guns characters hell there is even a dedicated community of RPers in FiveM and then you go and give everyone the middle finger so you can milk online some more.

2017-02-13,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,"Game is fun and the story mode is incredible and well worth the money but this multiplayer is a disaster. Any modifications to the game result in a ban. I'm not entirely up to date on penalty but your first strike used to be a week. At this point it might be a character reset. By modifications I mean things such as FOV sliders or custom UIs that add a bit of flavor to the game. Hackers can give you money but if you are caught recieving the money (even if they force it onto you) you are at risk of ban. Rockstar has no appeal system so if you are wrongly banned it is over for you. One thing the multiplayer does correct is have no DLC that is necessary. Only money packs. Everything you see you can get easily by leveling up. An issue with this is balance though. All DLC weapons (which are free again) do not have a level requirement meaning level 1 players can have lock on rocket launchers and other explosives or assault rifles. In some situations the DLC stuff is better than actual weapons meaning level 1 players are only at the disadvantage of inexperience. Balance in vehicles is poor too and a huge issue. Destroying another players car means you have to pay their insurance which is sometimes very expensive. A large portion of players you encounter will fight you FROM their car. This puts you at risk of destroying the car and having to pay a large sum of money for destroying the car and it could also put you in the bad behavior pool of players or risk you losing your good sport money bonus. Another issue is how fragile heists are. They require a lot of setup and are actually very fun but it is too hard to be able to rely on randoms or even friends. Usually you get one life so one teammate can die but if you play on hard if a single teammate dies the heist mission is over. Also random disconnects from the very poor servers can end a heist and send you back to square one on your mission. Heists are though once you get past the mechanics. Servers are terrible too. Randomly when playing it will say every player has disconnected or something alone those lines. You will then have to find a new server or try to find remember someones name to rejoin the same session. Playing with friends is very hard as servers are usually ""full"" (even though they are usually 8 or so under the limit) because people loading in that take awhile take up a slot and will usually end up not even getting into the game! Buy Grand Theft Auto V if you are looking for a great story game but if you want a free roam multiplayer experience this game is not designed well enough to function and not have you pulling your hair out.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-21,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,I would absoluteley recommend this game if it wasn't for one thing hackers. Since day one this game was infested with hackers on an unimaginable scale. The punishment for first offenders was a time ban and that's it. You wouldn't even lose all your cars or the stuff you bought with the cheated money if it has been your first offense. But afer they changed that some hacker sstarted giving money to everyone hoping this would mask their own second accounts but what hell broke loose... If you happen to get money from them and it's your first time time ban. But guess what happens afer you get into the second hackerlobby. If you're lucky its another time ban for 30 days. Some of my friends weren't so lucky. They got perma banned for being subjected to hackers. So rockstar a once great great game studio I loved can't manage the amount of loopholes and hackers so it punishes everyone and won't even listen to complaints which propably means there are barely no logs whatsoever so they can't even look up who cheated or how it happened. Only that some person got money for no reason and ban them for it. Rockstar srsly? Please go back to your old ways lead yourself out of this darkness and become great once again.

2017-06-14,0,0,2750,False,Not Recommended,"To make things clear I like gta V. Hell I nearly have 2000 hours on it making my total playtime over 2 and 1/2 months. My ""beef"" is the multiplayer and the practices of the company who made it. Online mode started out fine it added content with DLC that was managable. Anyone could get the things in it. Then the first time they said ""F**k you!"" to the fans. That was when they added the gold helicoptor for 5000000 and the gold plane for 10000000. Nobody could get that unless they hacked or paid for ingame money which is the reason they do this. For the last year and more all DLCs did was add some clothes for regular people then things that costs so much money that it's nearly impossible to get it without hacking or buying ingame money.Now with singleplayer I play singleplayer almost exclusively now due to the reasons listed above and it gets more and more obvious that Rockstar doesn't care about singleplayer. At first when DLCs came a lot of the content was added to singleplayer as well that would be the vehicles the guns and some more. For over a year now they have not added anything to singleplayer.And the lies Rockstar said before the game came out on any platform that their would be singleplayer expansions. They said it after it was released as well and they said it again after that and they keep saying it. They said that it would already be out far before now. But nothing. No singleplayer DLC because Rockstar thinks it can milk more money out of little kids stealing daddys credit card to buy ingame money then to actualy bring an expansion that the fans would pay for to play new missions of GTA V's amazing singleplayer.TLDR Unless you only want it for singleplayer or are a hacker who knows how you wont get banned or are extremely rich and you are willing to sink a f**kton of money into anything then DON'T BUY THIS GAME.If they add a good singleplayer DLC or addon then I will happily change my review.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,1,3,130,False,Not Recommended,Removing mods was a mistake. Take Two ed up big time and the overwhelmingly negative on the recent reviews is proof that they messed up. The singleplayer mode when the campaign is over (and sometimes even while the campaign is in progress) is pointless and gets boring really fast. I wasn't a big fan on online mode since I saw it as nothing but a pointless grind sure the heist update was fun but that was probably one of the best updates for online if not the best update for online. And that was over 2 years ago. There was no reason to remove mods Take Two.

2015-05-12,1,3,474,False,Recommended,"Two years of waiting since the console release GTA V has arrived on PC and it is spectacular. I wasn't sure what to expect when I hopped onto this game since I haven't touch anything from the series since San Andreas but I have no qualms about the direction the game has taken. The story is amazing three different dudes with a singular interconnected storyline that involves the three of them together as well as smaller subplots to each character. Each character follows a story that involves some major character development along the way. The writing in the characters are solid too each has their unique origins opinions everything! Supporting characters to side quests (labelled as Strangers and Freaks in game) are pretty nicely done too ranging from the bumbling papparazzi photographer Beverly to Cletus the roadkill obsessed redneck to the toking libertarian Barry most have rather unusual requests but entertaining. The addition of random events occuring in the game helps spice up the mood a little you can intercept a robbery help as the escape driver to one escort party goers home etc.Heists are the big game in this title the three main characters storylines usually converge on large scale heists (stealing a nuke from a private military group for one) that involve pre planning and setup missions with both loud or quiet options and additional crew members that affect how the heist goes. Both quiet or loud options have different approaches and crew members required both are quite eventful in terms of action pretty much none of the missions in the last few games can top the kind of action and writing put into these. Each heist pays out a rather large sum of money which can be spent upon completion of the heists this is by far the best way to earn money in the game. Music in the game is fantastic they have a rock and pop channel that just literally gives me the greatest nostalgic feelings the more modern channels also have excellent electronic music rap and a channel for classic rap too!! There's also a channel for country music... if you're into that sort of thing. The graphics on this game are simply amazing the way the characters and objects move the physics of moving vehicles textures on objects not to mention the optimization is pretty well tuned. As of writing this review I'm using an Nvidia GTS 450 and the game runs medium graphics at a decent FPS rate of 50 and it doesn't look terrible. The return to and remodelling of Los Santos was one of the things I liked the most about this game you see a lot of features around the place that remind you of GTA SA and I think that's great. You can also trip out on peyote and become a cat that's neat.Customization for guns and cars are pretty much the same from last time though save for the addition of camos for guns and few miscellaneous options for cars maybe a little better but not a radical change from the last game I played. Clothing customizations are pretty neat too each character has access to the common clothes that all three of them can wear and other clothing items that are unique to them. Hairstyles and beards are a little lacking each character has about &lt 5 to pick from at each barber unlike the vast variety of options applicable to CJ ala San Andreas. Earning money is a little scarce outside of heists most missions don't even award you with anything beyond storyline progression (a measly reward occassionally) and opening up other side quests. Options to earn money from activities outside the story are few and far in between and don't dish out a whole lot. GTA Online's integration into the game was a big thing everyone looked forward to. The introduction is pretty cool you begin customizing your character in a lockup get released from prison and fly into Los Santos meet ""YUH BOY L D"" get thrown into a sedan class race and at the conclusion of the race you are allowed to keep whatever car you ended the race in however there are probably other better options available to steal to make your own. You may also purchase high end cars and other expensive cars through the phone's online browser too and there are a wide variety to pick from. The heists in GTA Online require more complicated setups but the finales are more run and guns than the heists in the story something I find a bit disappointing also they all end up loud so the stealth feature/skill is pretty much useless. The payouts for the heists are rather substantial (items in Online are double the price they are in the story however) and unlock a variety of items to use in free roam and other missions. However all this aside unless you are performing activities or heists with friends there isn't much else to do in Online's free roam besides waging war on random players the police or robbing convenience stores. Heists also have little to no other checkpoints beyond a checkpoint right outside the objective location which you will spawn at when you fail and restart. Heists will also fail immediately if a player disconnects/dies at any point of a heist leading to the cancellation of the heist altogether. One of the most frustrating features while on a heist is the fact that teammates can hurt and kill each other leaving griefing a very real option. I think the kicker for this all is that half the time you spend on GTA Online will be staring at a loading screen.TL DRGTA V has an amazing story features music and graphics.You can get high and turn into random animals.Side quests are pretty interesting and unique.GTA Online gets old after a while maybe really quick.Not much else interesting to do on GTA Online besides heists races and some PVP activities.Integration of Rockstar Social Club isn't as annoying as I last remember.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-04-18,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,So after playing the video game (of which i picked up on the steam summer sale but I digress) I have to say in my honest objectionally fact opinion that I don't see the appeal and I'm positive that everyone will agree that I am not in the minority. After extensive research and constant playthroughs I have gathered evidence of why this is a lackluster video game and not the game of which the legacy speaks for itself allegedly. I have conducted numerous points to maintain a simplified review.Story Lacks the ability to maintain a coherent plot. Characters lack any passion and also one of which is of the african american descent. Dialogue is appalling. Most of the missions are filler. Most of the missions aren't fun and not to mention that they have nothing to do with the story. The story is a mess and mostly uses pop culture references to justify rockstars lack of storytelling. Mass fanbase praises the game to cover up the fact that it is in all honesty a Mediocre video game. Rockstar uses the online feature as damage control.Online A buggy and glitchy mess. Unnecessary loading screens. Terrible server security. Mass amounts of hackers with no repercussions. Boring if you're alone. Awful character creation system. A lot of filler. Horrible community. Heists are pointless. Microtransactions which basically makes earning money (from illegal or legal activities) obsolete. Missions/Jobs are even more pointless than story mode. Just an appalling experience overall even with friends. Most of the time playing is wasted and doesn't impact you in any way. (compared to a game with a compelling story) Would not recommend.As for pros go I honestly couldn't put any together in my unbiased research. Lets face the facts and agree to a degree that this is a mediocre video game and that is just putting it modestly.0/10 would not recommend. (from a video game enthusiast),Grand Theft Auto V

You are probably better off just watching a playthrough of it on youtube.If you are buying it for the multiplayer experience you are probably going to be severely disappointed.The concept of multiplayer is that you grind as much money as you can by doing jobs PvP races or just by messing around. Unfortunately these tasks do not award a lot of money. You are going to have to rely on a friend to carry you through some of the activities in the game otherwise you will never reach a point where you can stand on your own within a sane amount of time. Unless of course you buy a Shark Card. Shark Cards are basically ""boosters"" that give you a bit of in game cash. They are pretty expensive but you don't *need* them to progress in the game but unfortunately Rockstar uses every excuse to force the Shark Card business model into the game and down your throat. The cash you get from jobs heists activities races and free roam just isn't enough for a new player to get started. You're going to need things like Facilities Motorcycle Clubs or Warehouses to make any real money in the game and unfortunately the game is set up in a way that if you start these CEO activities other players can join in and try to steal it from you and you can easily lose half a million dollars and you can't do these activities unless you are in a PUBLIC lobby (but you can do it if you're alone in one).Speaking of lobbies it's nearly impossible to find a session without tryhard cuᥒts. And if it's not the tryhards thats ruining it it's the modders who will get you banned for playing the game legitimately by forcing you to pick up trillions of dollars and other things.Speaking of bans Rockstar falsely banned literally thousands on march 23th including me and someone I played with because of a flaw in their anti cheat. As of march 31th they have made no statements no apologies and no attempts at rectifying their mistakes. Some people were unbanned but many of them were then later re banned and still are. They give you NO option to appeal your bans all bans are permanent and final even if you are innocent and Rockstar can get away with this because everyone agreed to their EULA that states that they can ""suspend anyone for any reason or for no reason at all"" if they so choose.tl dr Singleplayer is ok Shark Cards are being shoved down your throat you can't be safe in public games because of hackers the community is full of tryhard ғucks who fly around in their jets and kill everyone they see the grind is unbearable without friends and you'll get banned for no reason with no chance to appeal because lmao bans are final.

2015-05-09,0,0,376,False,Recommended,This game...I've played it a ton and I've had fun I've met nice people as well.This would be an absolute favorite if only it wasn't for the community. It seems like every session has those pesky hackers/modders or whatever and nearly everyone in freeroam is just hostile for no apparent reason. I'm fine with fights in the game as long as it's for a valid reason but I just can't understand people who shoot everything they see.Getting money in online is a problem as well it's just grindy. You know unless some modder decides to drop everyone money which has a chance to ban people anyway. About the bans as well I haven't experienced it myself but I've heard that a lot of people are getting banned for no reason at all and Rockstar won't even give them a reason for it. Their support won't even help with removing a ban because their system is just great and never makes mistakes and whatnot. Yeah right.Then what's actually good about the game. Well for starters the graphics are amazing and the storyline is quite enjoyable. The game also has a wide selection of vehicles including a ton of cars and customization for them helicopters boats planes and some military vehicles like tanks and jet fighters which we'll probably be getting more of in an upcoming DLC (the DLC itself is free to download). You can also buy a yacht in online for the low low price of 6 million dollars and up but it can't be controlled other than paying to move it to a preset location.Overall I like the game. I've played it for hundreds of hours which should prove that I've enjoyed playing it. The only real flaw is yet again the community. I just can't bring myself to give the game a positive rating with the modder situation there are so many of them and they'll never completely disappear but at the moment the situation is very bad. I'll probably keep playing though so don't be too surprised if you see that I've played it lately.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,335,False,Not Recommended,"Having played on Xbox 360 and now on PC I enjoy the game especially the singleplayer story. Modding the singleplayer can make it even better. But in order to continue selling their Shark Cards they focus on Online and don't release DLC or other content for their great singleplayer which a lot of us would love.The multiplayer is fun if you have a few friends to play with all the time but if you have to play with randoms I wouldn't bother the public sessions are filled with cheaters that they can't seem to put in protections to prevent without tons of DRM stuff that also hurts and slows down legitimate players. And while I'm talking about online the price of buying almost anything is insane you earn next to nothing for missions and have to grind for hours to legitimately buy most interesting things I understand they want to sell their ""micro"" transaction Shark cards but it's quite ridiculous considering even the highest one will only buy you 2 or 3 of the most recent things for it's insane price. If they were to add an option to host a personal/private or LAN server where we could enable mods and enjoy the game with friends it would be much better even with the insane economy because again we could mod it to reasonable levels.And now let's come back around to the modding recently Take Two shutdown OpenIV a popular editor and manager for GTA mods. Sending the developers a Cease and Desist letter stating that OpenIV ""allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take Two's rights"". Ignoring the fact that mods are typically made for singleplayer and serve almost no purpose online trainers should be their issue if anything not our singleplayer mods. And they should be able to patch their game to prevent some of the very easy to do hacks.While I may play with friends still occasionally and may finally complete the story again I will not be buying anymore Rockstar or Take Two games for the forseeable future.So long and thanks for all the long hours of grinding in order to get the fish Take Two and Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-06,0,0,128,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. EDIT It's truly depressing to see how far Rockstar and Take Two have fallen. The business practices used in recent years culminating in the alienation of the modding community are simply despicable. Until both companies get back in touch with their fan base I will no longer be supporting them.Did you want a game with a story as great as the story of Grand Theft Auto IV?Did you want an open world as fun as the world of all previous Grand Theft Auto games?Did you expect Rockstar to release a game that blew everyone away with the quality it displayed?Well don't look here. While not a bad game by any means Grand Theft Auto V falls short of my expectations. As someone who grew up with San Andreas and IV I hoped for a game that I could sink thousands of hours into like I did with the mentioned titles. Unfortunately this was not the game that I wanted.The story while creative with three different protagonists fell short for me. While previous games had upwards of 90 missions in them V only has 69. This would be fine if they were all of a higher quality however to me they are not. For a story based on heists of various kinds there are only a handful of them. One of these heists boasts a staggering payout of $0. Yes $0. Maybe my playthroughs were bugged but I didn't get paid at all for the majority of the missions.Overall the gameplay feels like a downgrade. While I like the highly improved driving the gunplay feels terrible compared to games like Grand Theft Auto IV and Max Payne 3. The ragdolls also seem worse than the aforementioned titles. I seem to be a minority with this opinion so your mileage may vary.Grand Theft Auto V isn't so much the focus of Rockstar Games so much as Grand Theft Auto Online is. If you like spending all of your free time for weeks to buy one car then this is the game for you. This is assuming that you don't quit before the loading screen decides to end. Where does the developer ruin it here you ask? Well once you get into the game you had better pray to whatever deity you do or don't believe in because one of two things is about to happen. If you're lucky you will run into a friendly hacker who just does his own thing or a hacker who just likes killing you sometimes in surprisingly creative ways. If fortune hates you you will run into a hacker who wants to give you money. This is bad. If you pick it up you can probably expect to be banned. Yes you not the hacker. Why? Who knows.Openly state you're a hacker with your 1337 Hacker crew name logo and members? Cool.Pick up a hacked $5? Banned.In conclusion a game with a great open world great graphics and a great premise is brought down by some strange decisions. Exercise caution both with your gameplay and your wallet.6/10,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are solid and the mechanics are realistic. If you're buying for the story mode then go ahead and buy this game.The online is really horrible and downright disgusting.1) R* doesn't have its own servers. So one person effectively becomes a server which is not ideal. The loading times are too damn long. Be prepared to spend 5 7 minutes/hour watching the game load which is too long. If not for reddit I wouldn't have ever played online.2) This is the main point of GTA Online's review. The objective is not to have fun among the community. There are tons of fun game modes which are incredible to play but nobody plays them. The community is busy ""Grinding"" away hours doing mundane tasks to earn money to buy stuff like flying cars and tanks which they won't have the time to use because they will be grinding for the next thing. R* is encouraging this by introducing the Shark Card system where people can pay to avoid grinding to get their fancy stuff. This has also created a huge market for modders who hack the system to make millions in game making the game really unfair to the honest. Why should we pay money for a pay to win game ? What's the point of a pay to win game ? What's the point of playing video games if you are not having fun ?GTA Online is not fun and not worth playing.

You might be able to get a few of the vehicles or the special facilities that they seem to keep locking content behind. To put things into perspective 8 million in game currency isn't even enough to buy the most expensive yacht in the game and the yachts don't really even do that much for you.

Forgot to mention that you have to spend a lot of time looking at the loading screen while playing GTA online.I would rate this 9/10 but getting me a perma ban without actually doing anything and their feedback are bots that respond with the same answer everytime I will rate this 1/10 due to their support. Rockstar I hope everyone will understand someday how greedy and disrespectful you are.(Sorry for my english),Grand Theft Auto V

Adding free DLC is nice but not fixing the base issues with the game has resulted in an awful experience. Huge loading times tons of lag memory leaks unstable GPU performance every race having global records set by hackers and now it's all but impossible to find a public lobby without hackers in it. Especially infuriating is that every 3rd mission online for me fails to reconnect afterwards leading to a long exit load then a single player load then online load again taking several minutes just in loading screens.Given how these problems persist and in some cases are actually getting worse I'm doubtful R* is even going to bother fixing them and instead focus on their next title.

2015-08-15,0,0,670,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto 5 3rd/1st person game with huge open sandbox world where you drive shoot and cause havoc among other things.To start it off I will say that this time around map size has increased by A LOT compared to previous games. Game world feels more alive (at least in Story mode) with pedestrians people in traffic airplanes helicopters etc. going through their daily routes and assigned tasks. Every location you visit is populated by set number of active NPC's that talk to each other interact with environment or even with you when you pass them by. Be it simple sidewalk with random pedestrians lifeguard station near the beach or sawmill by the forest far away from the city. Basically game has everything from it's predecessors and much more added on top. Like always there are many different kind of ground water and air vehicles in the game that you can either steal or buy from ""internet"" in game. Clothing stores where you can buy outfits for your characters either in Story or Online. Same goes for barber that can change your hairstyle and some face features.Story follows three main characters who will interact with one another more as game goes on with their own set of problems their own unique personalities background and skills. You can freely switch between them play through their specific story or side missions take part in activities change their clothing visit barber browse in game ""internet"" and more. Each of them have their own safe house vehicle amount of money number of friends and/or enemies one even has a dog who likes to leave big piles of dung everywhere.In GTA5 you are back in Los Santos an ""island"" if you will. But this time around you have more than a city to play in. Game has different regions you can visit from busy city streets and suburbs airport ship port army base to desert country land with farms mountain areas with forests lakes rivers and much more. You can also explore the underwater around the island and lakes in submarine or ""on foot"" meet some hikers while on bike ride in mountains walk down the beach and take a ride on a jetski or take awkward yoga classes with your wife watch movie in theatre play tennis darts or golf game etc. Those are only few of the things you can do in game.Once in a while you will stumble on events like person being mugged for money someone stealing a vehicle police chasing some criminals couple drunk guys needing a lift crashed car on the freeway with people in need of help etc. And you can choose to help them drive past or watch to see what will happen. Small things like that really bring life to the game.Environments are filled with a lot of interactable objects miscellaneous props and going through a back alley in a car chased by police feels mighty satisfying when you go through pile of trash cans fences and such. World is filled not only with people but also some variety of wildlife and domestic animals be it simple dogs cats or rats on the street to deer's mountain lions birds cows chickens pigs whales dolphins sharks etc. You can even hunt wildlife and get paid for it. Sadly animals are somewhat limited to Story mode and not that easy to come by in Online.Game looks good up close with good texture quality and rich environment detail. But lacks detail past few dozen meters objects look blurred distant detail is very poor even on highest settings. Character model quality is good only on main story characters and isn't that good on random pedestrians and 2nd grade characters. Facial animation is strong in cut scenes and somewhat weak outside of them. Detail on vehicles and vehicle damage is great though sometimes you wonder how it can still drive after you ""shaved the train"" couple dozen times and you barely can tell what car looked like brand new.Apart from Story mode you can play Online mode in either private / friend or public lobby. You start off by creating your character join crew do missions versus PVP games races in land air or water vehicles activities like darts golf tennis and much more similar to Story mode but hand crafted for Online and up to 30 people. Everything you do will grant you experience cash and increase your skills depending on what you do. Higher your level the more stuff you unlock the more jobs and missions become available to you. You earn money you buy and modify cars you purchase living quarters or garage when you get bored from driving you can buy airplanes or choppers to rain havoc from air or simply take a break from madness on the ground high above the skies but remember you're never safe from a guided missile even if it's from a friend. Main attraction in Online mode is Heists where you do series of setup jobs in 4 player team that leads to a finale mission that will reward everyone with decent amount of cash. Currently there are five available Heists with each following different kind of crime with different set of characters and increasing amount of paycheck.Personally I had a lot of fun in Online mode some enjoyable moments in Story mode and around 200 hours of playtime so far. And I'm still not completely done with it though I'm struggling because you will get bored eventually. Apart from some personal issues with how game looks in distance and other minor complaints this game is very well optimized runs great on PC with recommended system requirements looks good and is fun to play. Enjoy.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-27,3,3,109,False,Not Recommended,"I'm not covering the story mode in this review because majority of us bought this for the online anyway.PC version itself runs smooth I can get a solid 60FPS for the most part and the occasional drop to 40 50FPS. I have only had three issues with it so far which is the random crashes the game randomly alt+tabbing to the desktop and the game randomly going into windowed mode.The community in this game is a joke its full of mic spamming children telling us about there minecraft tutorials Hackers that spawn in all sort of vehicles into different game modes and griefers who come in and ruin heists or leave in the middle of one. Speaking of heists if you up once that's it... call it gg because either someone is going to leave or the rest of crew won't take you seriously the host will try to give you like 10% cut of the final heist cut which is pretty cancer.The hacking situation is pretty bad at the moment the only way I can explain it is this... DayZ Mod the very first few months before the introduction of private hives a hacker on every server. Barely anything is being done about them either which is pretty weird of Rockstar because in Max Payne 3 Multiplayer you didn't get banned you got paired up with other cheaters. Why can't this system be put in place here as well but instead its a slap in the wrist and only a temp ban of a few weeks. Its quite funny &amp sad to see people announcing how badass they are because they can spawn all this in or my personal favorite is when they ""Take over Los Santos customs.""One other thing that ticks me off is these money cards nonsense I mean why pay that amount of money for a game and say ""nah you no wat m8 fu*k it my buying loads of in game money"" get a grip of yourself'sNice try Rockstar with the summer sale scandal keep that sh!t up and you will end up with an EA reputationOverall I feel like I'm forcing my way to play this just so i can get my moneys worth I do enjoy the heists when you have a good crew and survival/races is enjoyable to but theirs more than enough room for improvement.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-17,0,0,1037,False,Recommended,A great game we like to hateI really enjoy playing GTA V I have been playing it since 2013 on my Xbox 360 and have more than 1000 hours on the PC version alone. Back in 2013 GTA V did nothing wrong it was the perfect game. But since then many people began to see its flaws and eventually the downfall of GTA Online.Story ModeThe story mode in GTA V is quite enjoyable I liked the 3 characters but I know many others didn't. Being able to switch between characters is a cool idea and in this case well executed. It added a lot of depth and made the world seem more alive than ever. While driving all sorts of different cars you would see airplanes flying citizens walking around and talking to each other random events triggering and a lot more.But it's not all good and fun almost all of the story missions are heavily scripted making it much less enjoyable on your second playthrough but also eliminating frustrating moments like that damned train in GTA San Andreas Exchange from GTA III or the final mission of GTA Vice City. All these scripted moments look incredibly cool but once you notice they are all scripted and realize that Rockstar is holding your hand through the entire game it will become boring and stale really fast.The story is kind of all over the place and full with lucky coincidences and it doesn't have the rags to riches feel. The main characters are all well done in my opinion as always is the voice acting is done well. The map is not as big as in GTA San Andreas but it is more detailed and filled.OnlineGTA Online was and still kind of is a great addition. It makes it possible to play GTA V with up to 32 players. Unlike GTA IV there is a money system. Almost everything costs money I thought it was a great idea. Keep people playing for more cars planes houses etc but since 2015 the prices began to rise.Everything became expensive to make people buy microtransactions to buy money with money (Shark Cards). People started grinding heists to earn as much money as possible. Hackers started invading online lobbies making it hard to find friendly people. If you were AFK for 10 minutes or something a hacker would come by and give you loads of money and the next day you would get banned for getting too much money in a certain amount of time...Now we're at a point where the most expensive car is almost 3 million GTA$ and yachts that can cost 10 million GTA$ (More than 80 euro's in Shark Cards). People flying with bikes and cars randomly killing players. An orbital cannon that can instakill someone if you're willing to pay a hefty price.Rockstar still adds random vehicles new game modes and clothing items to the game. It's still a lot of fun to mess around in GTA Online but try to stay out of public lobbies.,Grand Theft Auto V

More than 2 years ago. got the midnight release of the game on the PS3 and when i launched it for the first time seeing the amazing epilouge i thought NOTHING could possibly outclass this game many games were released after non lived up to this game and gaming for me turned into gta. either i am playing gta v or not gaming at all. Year after Came the Release of then next gen came.. that trailer and adding first person view! rockstar is outclassing themselves because apparently no one can so i got it on the PS4 and now was certain that gta v REMASTERED won't be outclassed.and funny enough about 6 months later! the PC version came out. ( i got it in the last sale to be fair) but with the MODS and the 60 FPS and the beautiful Editor.. i think now NOTHING can outclass gtav. (prove me wrong please rockstar) The Pro You have not one not two BUT three main characters each with his own unique personality family and basically LIFE.everchanging world with extreme depth to it from wildrness to urban to the desert life to the ClassyCity. you can do literally anything in this city! wanna get all the cops on you while an epic shootout with your BFF driving your car and other friend with an plane covering you all? or you just want to drive a tank? break in into the most secured place in history of gta. alone with IRL friends or ingame buddies. you are in for a treator you wanna do some Deathmatches or try your new purchased Car in some illegel street racingahhh it's midnight and you need to rest. go into your own house mansion apartment and chill with either a friend a dog or preferably a stripper...i mean a lady friend.and there is MODS. basically..if you can think it it's there. Cons On all 3 versions of the game. ROCKSTAR SERVERS. just..UGH.specifically on the PC version the always online Kinda DRM is killing me alive. please rockstar from a really really loyal fan do something about this. tho their support on forums or emails are amazing.rating GtaV 10. it has it's own class like i said,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-11,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,Buy this game if youLike Crime Spending hundreds of hours of your life grinding for enough cash to purchase cars which you think look remotely cool (because the prices are inflated as and the only other way is to shell out another $100 for Shark Cards) only for you to realize that they don't really mean anything and are only a little bit faster than other cars. Getting banned right after you acquire that spanking new car for no apparent reason. Getting stonewalled by Rockstar's support system which stinks more than a pile of created by 600 cows with hemorrhoids. Every ticket is replied to by a bot with the same copy and paste answer. The answer doesn't tell you why you get banned but it does list every single reason why you COULD get banned. Calling customer support who are very friendly and helpful until you tell them that you got banned for no reason to which they instantly start reading the same copy and paste message which they must have memorized.Honestly I enjoyed the game while I could play. Even the grinding was enjoyable (if you do vehicle warehouse) but all of that gets on by Rockstar's crappy policies. As you can see with all the other negative reviews Rockstar's flagging system is and false positives are very possible if not common. This wouldn't be that big of a problem if they didn't insist that all these bans cannot be repealed and erase your character data at the end of the ban AND if they had a competant customer support system that actually took the time to check if their bans were legitimate.Edit Bought a $7 key off of some dude on Ebay do that instead of giving Rockstar anymore money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-18,0,0,580,False,Not Recommended,I like this game a lot played the online for hours and hours with my friends. Didn't play much of the single player though. But the reason that I'm writing a review today (I don't usually write reviews) it's because I received an email from rockstar telling me that I got suspended and all my progression was reset. This suspension has no foundation. I don't use mods and I don't really interact with people online I play with my friends that's about it.So rockstar what's the deal here? I'm not the only one in that situation. Everything is overpriced in your game. It takes so much time to get the money to buy anything. I got over 260 hours of play time I cannot get that time back! So what do you want me to do? Buy my way back with shark cards is that the deal here? Not gonna happen! I paid this game full release price which is something I do very very rarely. So today I'm giving you a thumb down or rather millions like the price of almost every items in your game.To everyone who's cosidering buying GTA 5 please consider the experiences of other players in the reviews if you're not willing to potentially lose all of your progress.

2017-06-21,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,This game would very easily be in the positives on steam if the issues it had weren't so glaring modders are quite rampant with a 50/50 chance of getting atleast one in each session. Many of these modders are quite obvious leaving you to wonder how they haven't been banned for example you will often run into people over level 500 which might be plausible if you've played since day one on console but frequently you will see levels surely not reached in a legitamate manner. Meanwhile if you are banned at all Rockstar rather than properly fixing the damage will completely reset your character while this may be apt for malicious modders considering they can get innocent people banned it's quite bad. In addition to that rockstar also refuses to dispute any bans and will instantly close support tickets with copy paste replies(which is pretty much most of their support).Lack of dedicated servers also allows for most of the mayhem commited by modders and even some bad actors being able to grab your IP(if they're the host) and either attempt to scare or DDoS you.Once you get past all of this including maybe the tryhard who will shoot himself before he lets you kill him or the oppressor repeatedly throwing missiles in your direction unless you have friends to play with you experience is much more difficult. Certain aspects force having other people such as selling stock from a buissness(if you want the most cash) or completing any heist.There is genuinely good content released in the updates but more and more it feels superficial to extend playtimes or purchase currency with extremely expensive operations or vehicles being sold with added modifications that can easily rack up millions of dollars extra.Compared to the first updates things have definitely risen greatly in price and time investment.The in game advertisement is also extremely annoying adding to the feeling above you will have characters calling you or messaging you regularly telling to invest in the latest update's additions with little option to disable it other to turn your ringer on silent but still have the phone GUI pop up on your screen.The only other thing I can think of is the world feels quite dull after a while its grand and very detailed but there's a lack of actual interaction. Every NPC you see almost always has the same reaction of fear disdain and eventually running away. Almost none of the buildings you see are enterable other than things like gun convenience and clothing stores. Rockstar has the interiors for some buildings that can be seen in the story and cutscenes but has never actually sewn them into online.The game is still enjoyable singleplayer is definitely worth it especially when the game sales to 15$ the game is always an excellent piece of social commentary and the work put into it can't simply be denied it just certainly feels like the direction is changed especially with RDR2 online looking to be a very cash focused outlet I would expect this to be the last good Rockstar online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-20,1,3,291,False,Not Recommended,"GTA five is an excellent game not the best but still rather good.The story is engaging and lasts for quite some time.However that isnt why this is a negative review it is a negative review because of the god awful multiplayer.Sure it is great fun to just muck about with your mates for a few hours but if you want to do anything that you see in the trailers (The DeLorean Import Export cars ect.) you'll need money thats expected but with the introcuction of ""Shark Cards"" a few months if not a year or two back everything is alot more expensive so unless you are willing to grind for hours on end (I've personally done nearly 40 hours of grinding) the only option is to buy ingame money with real money this is something normally seen in free to play mobile games where it is understandable because the game was free.This is a full price game that is almost 5 years old ill say that again. This game was released in 2013 and still costs $60.(This is the second time ive bought the game it bought it on the 360 when it came out but my xbox acc broke so no multiplayer)This brings me neatly onto the state of GTA Online servers you cannot connect to the online 3/4 of the time for example today I tried for 2 hours to connect to GTA online all to no avail it takes 6 minutes when it does work and when it doesn't with no retry connection option at the end.The DRM (Social Club) is AIDS you have to sign in twice (once when you start the game and again when you are loading the game. This is why Piracy is still a thing not for the cost but to avoid the often broken DRM. Sure its illegal but the odds of you getting caught are far outweighed by the convenience of not having the stupid broken as all hell DRM.If you want to play a multiplayer GTA game try GTASAMP its a mod for the best GTA game that adds in multiplayer that is free to play with more than one server and hundreds of different gamemodes.

2017-06-15,0,0,126,False,Not Recommended,If you're getting this game just for the singleplayer great go for it it's a lot of fun. Just make sure you get it on sale. There's no way a game released in 2013 should cost you $60.Multiplayer however is a mixed bag with the biggest issue being matchmaking. There is no server list or a proper menu from which you select immidiatelly what you want to play. Instead you have to start the game wait for it to load the city to put you in a random lobby and only then from your in game phone you can browse for games (which is a cumbersome proccess of its own).Now just hope that the lobby you joined isn't empty doesn't have players who aren't trying to kill you or hackers who can get your account falsely banned because you were both in the same session.As for the actual multiplayer gameplay I'll start off by saying that if you don't have a buddy (or three) to play with you won't have a good time. Most co op missions require a minimum of 4 players and by the time you finally find 3 random people to play a mission with and one of them leaves that's it the mission fails. That's one of the most flawed game mechanics I have ever seen sometimes it's just a momentarliy bad connection and not the player's fault. Combine that with atrocious loading times (up to 2 minutes per loading screen and there's a lot of them) and you got yourself a disaster not a fun co op experience.Surprisingly the PvP game modes are where most of the fun is at but honestly when the game is 10% fun 40% loading screens and 50% frustration I don't see why even bother.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-15,0,0,239,False,Not Recommended,"I both love this game and hate it beyond recognition.Things good about this game Single player is MASSIVE the game has hundreds of hours of content to explore collect and participate with an impressive story. The world is massive with a giant city and wilderness to explore. Graphics are pretty darn good For a game thats 2.5 years old the graphics aren't that bad. Rain makes everything look wet wind blows trash around and the lighting is pretty spot on. Vehicle customization is ADDICTING The customizable vehicles is mindblowing you can change almost anything from the rims to the blower (big chrome thing on hood that sucks in air). Weapon customization is pretty cool You can add attachments to your weapons to improve them over time or add new paint jobs to better suits your style. NPCs act and behive fairly well... most of the time Pedestrian behavior is awesome as all NPCs act differently some will run from danger some will fight back and some will do something unpredictable (like get in their car and run you over....). The mission editor is really good 3D editors are extremely useful over 2D editors as your able to edit and visualize how your game / mission looks and turns out. You can create a variety of missions from racing challanges to team death matches. I made a race track that had muscle cars race down the highway all around los santos with some oncoming traffic and cops. WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME! THE MULTYPLAYER The multiplayer is absolutly horrible! Imagine the way you play GTA now clone yourself 50 times and put all of them in the same GTA online map..... yup it's exactly how you think it'll turn out. Red players (players who kill and go psycho a lot) hunt and kill everyone else who are trying to do other things. The only way to combat this is to turn on ""Passive Mode"" which make you invulnerable to player attacks which also means you can't attack as well this means you can't participate in gang hideouts vip target missions armored van missions with your weapons (unless you turn off passive mode). HACKERS!!!! GTA online is plagued with hackers (if you thought CS GO was bad ooooh by you ain't seen the full power of the dark side.) most large population servers have hackers on them either breaking the economy by spawning money or ruining everyones' day by killing everyone every 30 seconds. The only way to combat hackers is to host private servers (if you have friends...) use passive mode and reporting (and pray to our dread god Nyarlathotep that Rockstar actually gets around to banning these guys.). SOME CONTENT IS LOCKED!!! The exclusive content promised to gives players special vehicles new missions and new weapons. the problem it's only available to those who played the game on the xbox 360 or ps3 FIRST. I tried using the content unlocker mod but Rockstar patched that (seriously rockstar unlock the content!!). The only way to get the content is to get a 360 or PS3 and play the game on that for 5 minutes. There's not enough content to keep you in multiplayer As of the time stamp of this review The only content in multiplayer worth playing are the heists and the Lamar Lowrider Missions (LLM). Everyting else in the game is used as a grinding mechanic to make ingame cash once you finish the heists and LLMs missions you'll regrind them just to make some more ingame cash to buy more stuff. You will eventually use Shark Cash Cards (micro transactions) inorder to buy that house / car / weapon / outfit / etc. Random server drops From my experience with multiplayer you will experience a lot of connection issues where you'll be dropped from a server for no reason. Just keep calm and reconnect. The game is still 60 dollars after 2.5 years the game is still 60 dollars. I don't remember the last time this game was on sale but even if it were 50% off it would've been over priced. I would recommend getting this game when it's no less than 60% off. Like CS GO the community is completely toxic It doesn't matter if it's on Rockstar forums or ingame the community is toxic so toxic it became radioactive decay and causes cancer. CONCLUSION Wait for the game to get marked down 60% Wait for more content for the multiplayer (or stick to just single player.) If your playing multiplayer expect hackers red players and lack of content.",Grand Theft Auto V

So GTA V I love it as you can tell I don't get bored of it. My only complaint about this game is there are somewhat alot of hackers I don't run into many and if i do some of them are funny for example I asked one to spawn nissan skylines he said ''How about a in your ear'' I said that'll be funny i get out of the car and I have a IN MY EAR!!!! LMAOAlso there's alot of chinese people not sure if i have my seetings set to china only servers or if thats where most people that play pc live?

2017-06-18,0,0,206,False,Not Recommended,Take2's attitude towards modders and the modding communinity gives me no choice but to give Grand Theft Auto V a negative review. In no way am I saying that it is overall a bad game it's one of my favourites but i can't recommend Grand Theft Auto V if you are looking into modding your game modding being a useful and different way to play your game that you likely paid full price for. Furthermore Take2's reasoning behind the mod ban frustrates me they say that it is to protect players who are playing GTA Online yet the OpenIV mod only effects Story Mode the mode that I and many others primarily play. It's as if Take2 assume that everyone is only playing the online mode. In many ways i cannot stand GTA Online it is riddled with micro transactions and loadtimes and is likely the reason we do not have a Single Player expansion pack (DLC). If you are not concerned in modding your game or supporting modders then i would recommend you buy GTA V it's fantastic,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,0,0,933,False,Recommended,Almost 900 hours in and still going strong. Can't say enough about the game. They keep adding more free online DLC that gets better than the previous one. No shortage of stuff to do. Haven't gotten far in the story mode because I'm just enjoying the online portion too much.Bear in mind that online is still frustrating at times due to scripters so it takes a while to find a good lobby sometimes. If you have friends to play with it just makes the game even better. I've found a great community of folks to play with and it makes dealing with scripters practically non existent. It's more fun now than it ever was and the new Gunrunning DLC is quite enjoyable so far.,Grand Theft Auto V

We shall have to wait and see.Hopefully Rockstar Games will be able to stop Take 2 Interactive from destroying GTA V's modding community the way they have and undo at least some of the harm they've done to their image by doing so... But as it is there's no excuse for shutting down OpenIV the modding core of GTA V and even of GTA IV the way they have.Yes it's technically LEGALLY Take 2's right to send a cease and desist letter to the OpenIV team. Legally it's their property to attempt to protect from what they decide to see as harmful to their business practices. But morally and ethically?

Honestly this game should get an 7/10 for gameplay. 10/10 for story looks and sound design. but dies when it comes to support server stability pc compatibility and a rediculous psuedo pay to win model which forces players to HEAVILY grind content inorder to afford even the basic amenities of the game. Leaving you envious of the (mostly harckers/moders/scripters) who have the full and glorious yet seemingly unobtainable suite of vehicles at their disposal yet often choose to troll the whole server by blowing eveyone up or freezing everyone in place changing their model to a toilet and then blowing everyone up. Why these people dont get banned but my friend who just bought the game and never did anything was?? idk lol. The devs keep adding cars and cosmetics to the game but fail to fix crashes bugs server stability and rampant abuse by people who mod the game. Why not have open servers and closed servers? so people who like to be invulnerable and cheat can do that in their own space and let people who want to play the game with their friends who get banned for nothing and then refund the game to never buy it again because the sysatem is broken have normal servers where we can tirelessly grind out our overpriced virtual money for cool toys and houses without the fear of being banned for nothing. ill never reccomend this game to friend again. not because i dont want to play with my friends but because i wouldnt want to put another friend in the same position as the last one i got to buy the game. and that goes for anyone else who is buying this game to play online. if you want the singleplayer experience its great. dont expect any singple player updates without paid dlc though.,Grand Theft Auto V

I can even look past the insane loading screens. I look past that because at least I can play single player in peace with graphical mods and trainers to truly enjoy the SANDBOX you have built. With no additional Single Player content since launch I've resorted to excellent mods that ENHANCE this experience and keep me coming back. In fact the only reason I bought the PC version was to take advantage of mods. BUT NOPE. Buying the copy 3x wasn't enough Take Two wants more from me.

Mission vareity is more then enough covering CEO BUNKER CAR THINGS HANGERS. Big enough map for everyone to roam in.The bad part the modders... the modders man ruin this game... they can blow you up at any time and make you catch on fire and roll around on the ground. They can even make themselfs immortal so you cannot murder them. they can kick you out of your own personal vehicle and teleport in your car for a job and they steal it and they get it... its not good.They can EVEN KICK YOU OUT OF ONLINE and put you in singleplayer which is ridiculous. But rockstar hasn't added any easy anti cheat or anything. I feel the only reason that modders roam free is so rockstar can have some pre hype for updates with the modders getting a free look at vehicles.The singleplayer is amazing in everyway tons of missions very good story telling and amazing characters.

2017-10-08,0,0,963,False,Not Recommended,"Disclaimer I never got banned in GTA online and rockstar never took money or anythng from my account the following review is NOT based in any of this situations.So Is it worth it?Well for the most part not very much. The story of this game is already well known by those who know the game. Rockstar never aded more content of any kind to it and it's nowhere near to the quality of GTA San Andeas' or even GTA IV story it doesn't tell any more than just ""shoot the hell out of evrerything you can"" (talking about the story itself not the game content). As for the Online feature (and probably the main reason for people to want this game) It's probably not what you think it is. First of all and currently the main problem the cheaters kids who want to break the game's fun because they are to bad to play properly the lost the sense of life or their dadys' don't love them. More often than the other issues you will find below Suddenly you will find yourself with no weapons with explosives or clones of your character raining on your head appearing in a cage on the other side of the map or with a forecast of heavy bags of money falling from the sky(ironically the least probable). This people wasted money in a game they don't want to play and are wasting other people's money because they ruin the fun for every one. And the worst part of this Rockstar (Rs) doesn't do shtt to stop them (exept maybe when they give money as it is what hurts them most but generally they also ban you for ""accepting the money"" that fell on your head). Then there are server issues . So if you where lucky to not find any cheaters in a session you will end up loosing the one you are in for any of theese reasons 1 ""there was a problem in gta online please return to gta v"" 2 fulano left mengano left sultano left pirulo left xplayerx010230 left falconlover left 124937618946 left YourFriend1 left YourOtherFriend left edgyName left and suddenly you are the only player in the session no reason given(see Rs support reference). 3 you end up ragequitting the game because you sold all the cocaine and for a ""connection issue"" you didn't recive a penny even though you had no issues 4 And also very typical The Clouds Simulator 2018 an endless loading screen. The third reason is the Balance mess Rs did . So first there was the Hydra a Plane with VTOL that shoots a death laser of explosions and can dodge every missile you shoot them the pain of the skies. Then they added an explosive bullet type and the problem faded a bit. However because Rs doesn't like balanced things they also aded (pay attention) A FLYING BIKE IMPOSIBLE TO HIT THAT SHOOTS ROCKETS THAT CAN TURN 360 DEGREES IN A 2 FOOT RADIUS (making them imposible to dodge) AND YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT BESIDE YOU AT ANY TIME! This is one of many like the tank which can't take more explosions than an armored car. And last but not least the Rockstar Support issue . Did you Loose al your money because an ""unknown network problem""? did you loose al your bunker weapons because some cheater took your weapons and you had to fight a Valkyria helicopter with your bare hands? Did you get banned because some cheater spawned some dollars on your head?(see disclaimer). Well Don't think it's over! Because now comes the part where you get a generic bot response from Rs Support or a ""sorry there is nothing we can do go 8 D O yourself"" answer. And for the modic prize of 3 Shark cards wi'll make it so the wall you ar talking to is made out of bricks instead of concret so you have a pretty wall to talk to. Rockstar giver no support unless the following things 1 You have a video proof certified by a lawyer as trusted evidence. 2 it's a problem that impairs them and benefits you 3 it's a problem than can end in a legal action from the client against Rs But seriously i've seen GTA SA Multiplayer Servers with better support than GTA V.So at this point you might be asking ""why did you say ""for the most part not""?"" Well there's not all bad things with the game. In terms of what you can do in it it feels like you can accomplish everything you can imagine within the limits of realism. Basicly if non of the listed issues exist it would be the perfect game. There's so much potential wasted by the negligence of Rs there are many options to minimize or kill the problems the game has (Battle eye a support team that actually cares etc) And if you have either A) a lot of patience against game malfunctions or B) a crew only server that ensures there are no cheaters in it. You can have a Great time with this. And probably A is the reason for me to keep playing the game hoping that one day Rs will change his attitude.I will be happy to modify this review as the game changes (if it does) and to clear any questions people may have.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,5,False,Not Recommended,The online component is just a micro transaction filled grind fest straight out of mobile gaming. The game play itself is fun but it's ruined by the ever present push towards buying in game currency and poor support ( customer service/response times refusal to respond limiting migration of characters across platforms despite it being the same Rock Star account what seems to be a complete lack of trying to stop cheaters and then you get banned for being in a lobby with cheaters or when cheaters give you money... which is even worse in games where you've dumped a ton of micro transactions into a character. The single player is the saving grace of this hot mess but don't worry they've ed that up too. No single player DLC because they'd rather use exploitative psychologically manipulative micro transaction schemes to rake in easier money. They've also killed the modding community (which the developers had embraced in the past) with legal action in the hopes that modders don't have the time and money to push back against their t (and they're right modders don't have the money to stand up to them).The publisher claims it's to fight cheaters but these single player modding tools aren't part of the cheater MO. What it probably is is that they don't want you enjoying the game in ways that don't make them more money despite the still full retail price. Instead of spending your time playing the game with mods they want to gimp the single player back to the vanilla you've completed in hopes it will push you into the online portion of the game.The game was fun but at this point it's a dumpster fire.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-25,0,0,187,False,Recommended,"""VILLIAN MOST IN NEED OF A HUG"" award definitely should go to Trevor Philips. Guy is a complete train wreck and could certainly use a hug.PROS This game could have no storyline at all and I'd still have 100+ hours into it. One of the most replayable games ever made. Great selection of weapons and vehicles. Convertible vehicles that actually have functioning soft and hard tops that go up and down. So many little ""attention to detail"" things like the ""tinking"" sound a cooling motor makes when shutting a car off etc. Vehicle customization is pretty badass. Huge open world. Switching between characters on the fly. Graphics and physics are great. Not super real like The Witcher 3 or anything but still very visually appealing. Like all GTA games of recent the ability to load a custom soundtrack and bump it while doing 100 MPH down a sidewalk. A game you can play for 10 minutes or 10 hours and accomplish something in game either way. Great way to unwind after putting up with BS all day at work... Humorous NPC conversations cutscenes and random fights because they always each other off. Gun fights between the police and random NPC criminals or even innocent NPC's that run over a cop because i pushed their car into them. Very few frustrating missions so you never really get stuck or frustrated enough to rage quit or rage uninstall. In fact I will probably not uninstall this game until GTA VI comes out should they make it. (This is why I have 5 SSD's not a fan of uninstalling favorite games...) Could make this list much longer.CONS Could use a more convenient fast travel. (Can use a taxi but for those that are impatient the 30 second wait for a taxi feels like forever.) Wish some of the killer online vehicles were available in single player. (Such as the Armored Karin Kuruma aka Armored Mitsubishi Lancer Evo) The occassional mission where you have a long drive and the passenger is whining or being extremely annoying the entire ride. Then you either drive them off a cliff and jump out or just shoot them in the face so they shut up and you have to do the mission all over again...

2017-11-12,0,0,1194,False,Recommended,I've always been a huge fan of GTA V ever since it first came out for the Xbox 360 Xbox One PS3 and for the PS4 too. The Story Mode for GTA V is amazing every time I beat the game I just have to play it over and over again just for the thrill of it lol. GTA Online though it's is kind of a different story for me. Yeah It's fun to pay with your friends online and have a general mess around and have a laugh as well and that But the amount of griefers that are in the same online session with you and your friends can be really frustrating and annoyimg also the loading time for consoles takes way too long to get in an online session and i've heard that the PC version can take even longer Yikes!!! And it's mostly full of griefers and people who like to kill everyone just for the fun of it anyways so I'll just be staying away from online mode for the PC. When I also heard that Take2 had decided to ban mods for GTA Story Mode I was feeling really devastated because I've wanted to get into making machinima videos for a long time now. Long story short.... Now that i've finally bought this game for my PC I'm not gonna be heading into any online sessions at all ... well.... unless ifr some stuff becomes unlockable for my online character of course hahaha P But other than that I'm still going to be focusing on my Machinima videos.

2017-08-29,0,0,564,False,Not Recommended,"I've had this game for a while and with that I can tell you exactly how this game went (online). (Long Review. TL DR at bottom)When I got this game it was good it was fun things weren't exuberant in price you could get a good car within a day and a good place within a few more days grinding for money was a thing but you could play the game without focusing on gaining the money. CEO is kinda cool. But that's how the game for me started. I played for a while and then Motorcycle club stuff came out yet again this for me was pretty nice the abillity to gain money over time without physically spending the majority of your time getting the loot for your club to manufacture into better worthwhile stock. Allows you to mess around with your friends without penalizing you for not actively gaining money.Later on CEO got a new update Import/Export Vehicle Warehouse. You could steal vehicles and sell the vehicles for money in the way how special cargo worked. (You collect small bits and sell bulk.) Vehical Cargo was similar but you gain little stock and sell little stock. for big money. (As of currently one of the best ways of gaining money in GTA Online). With this update we saw the release of ""Special Vehicles"" these vehicles was fun but was the start of power creep. These were costly (The Nightrider car is $5mil.)Now Gunrunning released. Major powercreep here. Explosive Heavy Sniper Rifle makes planes pretty weak within combat. You had vehicles which you could upgrade to be more resilient to damage and protective of your fleshy body. These vehicles aren't cheap either. The upgrades were locked behind research researched can use stock you can steal to do overtime or you can fast track the research which for the first is $100k then $225k for the rest. (Fast Tracking can reduce all the research into a 3hr time period). These items can dominate a game if used by a group of competent people. Now the new update as of writing this Smuggler's Run. Oh boy what do I have to say? Except it's of subpar quallity to previous updates. Yes the previous update had problems but even that update was better. The planes aren't worth the money even when upgraded. Balance is another problem with this update the planes are fairly low damage unless you're a fan of homing missles on the planes. A Hydra is a straight upgrade to them and that already exists in the game and is considerably cheaper since you don't have to buy a hangar to store it. The hanger's money making system is the same as Special Cargo. Build up supplies by grabbing bits and sell bulk. Except unlike special cargo you can only get 1 crate of goods at a time which is worth $10k. Special Cargo is worth twice the money (If you go use the Large Special Cargo Warehouse). And you can gather up to 3 at once. Also the update is buggy but that's to be expected. The update on a whole appears to be rushed. Compared to Import/Export and Gunrunning this DLC doesn't have missions to reduce price of the vehicles that's an unlock of just doing supply runs. That is a downgrade as the missions were actually fun the supply runs not that fun in this update actually really fustrating. You shoot down the enemy and more enemies spawn constantly throughout the mission. It's tedious at best. It's also worth considering that this update's stuff at the best options costs $30 million in total. If you bought the cash cards that's 240 worth of cash cards to get this stuff... O.oIf anything I hate to say that Rockstar has made a hash of the current update. As this update is more buggy than Gunrunning was on release. The supply missions are tedious at best. On the whole this update isn't fun. GTA Online as the entire thing is a boring grind fest. You need money if you want to have fun with things like the Half Track. And I'd dare say that modders that actually drop money for others make the game a more of a balanced experience. Not everyone has the time and/or funds to unlock the expensive content. TL DR GTA Online is a grind fest to get the good things. Unbalanced and possibly contains Pay 2 Win elements.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-17,0,0,281,False,Not Recommended,"Okay so where to begin with this game. Overall I've said i would NOT recommend it but i think its more fair to say it depends what you like to play. My recommendation is based on how me and my core friend group like to play games.So the single player i have admittedly not completed but it seems like a lot of fun like any other GTA Game except with the added bonus that the heist setups and heists in game seem to add something even though theyre basically just missions. In general i do find it a pain that i have to swap between characters to complete missions and i think thats the reason i stopped. If i don't like a player character it tends to put me off the game this happened with GTA IV and TLAD expansion i just gave up on it. Otherwise id highly recommend this as a single player game to people who like WYSIWYG games. If you like modding or cheats like i do once ive completed a game then id be guarded about buying this unless you intend to outright disregard the multiplayer or are a capable hacker as there is the possibility you may get banned.Which then neatly brings me to GTA Online and the online version of the game. So for the most part its pretty good. Grab a team of 3 friends train and do the heists and its a lot of fun. Thanks to the continuous addition of expansions you can now own a fair amount of property and a lot of cool stuff (if you can get the money in). I also feel to some extent that its a credit to rockstar that they have actually bothered to continue adding content to this game as long as they have where other developers have offered to do this and then given up after a year of limited additions. Of course this does come at a price in GTA Online. With the exception of Heists nearly everything expansion wise is disabled in anything other than public matches probably so you cant farm them with your crew without others being able to challenge you. But as someone who enjoys playing Solo or with a group of friends this is nearly damming since it only takes one hacker or griefer to ruin a server yes this is how GTA has always worked but its also why ive never wanted to get involved in that part of it. If you have no friends youre pretty much limited to the low paying jobs (20k at best) unless youre lucky enough to stick with a team throughout a whole heist that you can get along with. All the other high paying jobs are pretty much locked away in public multiplayer. Items from the latest expansions are often 5 to 20m credits (depending on whether its a new car boat or core feature of the expansion) but put this into perspective. If you are the average person you wont know how to cheat you probably wont have a huge gang of friends to play with and youre probably not going to be top of the leader boards. So if you want anything remotely quickly they expect you to buy shark cards 3.5m credits are around 30. If you want to play this casually and build up slowly or youre happy to sink money into this then id argue its a great game. Same if youre okay fighting off griefers swapping server whenever theres a hacker or otherwise generally just want to mess around with people who want to do the same to you. As for graphics i honestly would still consider them pretty awesome. When a year and a half ago i bought 2 980Ti to SLI i was amazed to see that at upper graphics you can get building reflections on the inside of your cockpit or star reflections. all things i had never seen with my 780. Now whether theyve further improved it as part of patches for the 1080 i have no idea but this at least impressed me.My concern with the latest negative reviews at the time of writing this review is while to be best of my knowledge i havnt had any money taken away from me if they ARE modifying peoples wallets based on potential hacking then while some may be saying ""well dont cheat"" i dont think some people consider just how hackers may decide to grief players. and if theyre offering in game money for real money then they need to be VERY careful how they apply this rule to players who have paid additional money into the multiplayer. In conclusion Detach SP from MP so that cheaters can cheat offline if they want. Mods in single player should never be a problem no matter the attitude of the developers over IP most of the developers i know now started life modding games. Stop forcing me back into public multiplayer if i drop out of a private MP match (it takes longer to load and party find for something im going to quit anyway).And if you like GTA and havnt at least tried the single player then by all means buy this game preferably on sale because it feels near criminal that the price has barely dropped since launch yet they have a perfectly good micro transactions system. And the multiplayer is worth at least taking a look at to decide whether or not its for you.",Grand Theft Auto V

It's really frustrating and hopeless to find your way out of the ban since Rockstar is no longer accepting ban appeals and don't expect to know the reason of your banned too because their EULAs said so. Another thing that annoys me is some of the modders until this date are not banned. Yeah i've been digging into communities asking peoples and they still have mods opening in Online and still not banned.I literally don't understand what Rockstar is and has been doing. I mean after almost 3 years since the Online mode came out they should have an Anti cheat system that prevents people from spawning stuffs being immortal like they're the host of the server not banning players mistakenly and hopefully will get some cheaters out.I only got banned for 30 days but after 30 days i definitely will not play this game again until they implemented some system that guarantees to wipe off the cheaters instead of normal players.,Grand Theft Auto V

It suffers from Openworld issues making it feel empty and hiest is impossible with random people since they always die. So only thing I can really do is race or do some type of team death mate gamemode. Kinda boring. I also don't recommend this gta because they banned OpenIV a modding tool that was used for years to bring amazing mods to pc and people put a lot of effort into the game and I don't support their choice to do this. Every gta game has modding be a major part of the game and instead of them trying to stop it they should support it. It'd be much better such as like fallout 4/3/nv and skyrim are. Only reason they probably force OpenIV to close down was because people can't play online so rockstar/take two can't make money of their shark cards because people don't have a reason to buy them when they are offline.Update Rockstar made take two change their minds on the modding tool.

The fact that GTA 5 can be seen as the best / second best selling full price game and the publichers behind it STILL wants to rob you of your own money is almost incredible.It's sad that one of if not the greatest game of all time is being controlled by a money hungering and right out disgusting company like 2k.

Neither does TakeTwo/Rockstar.""There are many facets of cheating in online games which make the creation of a system to stop cheating very difficult however game developers and third party software developers have created or are developing 10 11 technologies that attempt to prevent cheating. Such countermeasures are commonly used in video games with notable anti cheat software being GameGuard PunkBuster Valve Anti Cheat (specifically used on games on the Steam platform) and EasyAntiCheat. 12 Exploits of bugs are usually resolved/removed via a patch to the game however not all companies force the patches/updates on users leaving the actual resolution to individual users.""They seem to take the ""leaving the actual resolution to individual users."" part way too literally.The only unbearable problem with the game is modders/glitchers in my opinion but nothing really gets done about it.Most games will do a small patch every few days when they've found an exploit that can be abused in order to prevent cheating but with TakeTwo/Rockstar you can expect a patch every... 4 6 months. After the patch there's usually a ban wave which will give you a splendid week of modder free playing time. The other 16 23 weeks though? lol good luck.To give an example of how bad the modding is I have played in approximately 30 sessions over the last 4 days. I left 5 of those sessions because I was content and felt it was a reasonable time to get off the game. The other 25? Well either server crash from modder trying to spawn too much money at once or the entire lobby was just blowing up repeatedly and getting teleported around and having their weapons taken away. Oh and vehicles don't save you they'll just force eject you from them. You can also be frozen so you can't move your character or modders can spawn 1000+ planes on you at once crashing your game. Switching lobbies doesn't save you because there's another malicious modder in the one you're loading into already.To reiterate it's a really fun game. One of the best I've played actually.

May I add that they are banning innocent players and resetting their accounts for a. Having mods b. you this situation is a big terrible show now. Story mode is still good if you can complete it in under two hours so you can still refund the game.

2018-12-17,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,Great story but boring gameplay. Pick it up for the story alone for 10 bucks when on sale.Pros The story. And flying a helicopter is so hard you could probably test for your flight papers after playing this game.Cons Console Port. Repetitive gameplay lack of engaging open world activities. Few ways to make money in storymode the game keeps you poor. Few things worth spending money on. First person mode will make you want to hurl. GTA online is set up simply to take your money.In storymode for 40 hours I roamed the world tying to find something interesting to do. The hype around this game kept telling me excitment would eventually come to me.... There are occaisonally random encounters scripted in same locations (robbers you can rob armored vehicles to rob etc) but they are rare random and the pay is small. If you are lucky enough to catch an armored vehicle you get 2000 5000 cash if you can outrun the cops. But that is literally it. Even 50% of the way through the story this was the only way to really make any money. Doing the same thing again and again. Even the heists and activities for the story do not pay out except for 2 or 3 of the big ones. At which point you are nearly done the game and bored. The 3 characters rarely are paid for anything which is incredibly frustrating (and likely a ploy to make you want to quit and play GTA online where microtransactions will give you money). Worse by the time you have enough money from following the story and to buy some businesses and do missions for them you no longer need that small amount of cash flow. Why? Because there is nothing worth spending money on. What? For example if you buy cars and upgrade them they will disappear on you and you will never see them again (not in your gararge and not in the impound where they are supposed to show up). Money wasted. There isn't even any point buying guns or ammo as the story missions give you access to new ones and all the ammo you will ever need by looting bodies. Lame. But what can you expect from a console game? On top of that the cars given to the 3 characters (that always spawn for them to use) are boring. A sedan a slow bike truck and a whale of a sports car with no handling is what you are given. Hilariously they are the only vehicles that can be counted on to spawn or not be lost. Even after being fully upgraded they are boring and slow. What the hell? Why am I so poor? Why are the activites around the world so mind numblingly boring? Why wasn't there some early side missions allowing us to jack specific vehicles and have to outrun the cops and then get paid by selling them on the black market? How does being able to run over or fight random people and shoot cops and snoozefest minigames count as an open world game? Because you aren't supposed to enjoy storymode fool you are supposed to play GTA online for anything exciting.Pick any bad open world game and it will have more to do in it than this game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,194,False,Not Recommended,"Let me just say first that I've never posted a review of any game as I normally don't induldge in games enough to be able to post a thourough enough review. I purchased this game originally just to get the game. Like a majority of people. Didn't care much for online as I just wanted to get the experience of playing GTA V on PC since it was a different feel and a brand new experience overall. I have not yet completed the single player campaign on PC as I went through it completely on next gen before the PC release. Have tried a time or two but repeating a campaign isn't something I find interest in on any game. With that said I did spend a lot of time exploring the open world and just doing what I wanted to do as I felt. That too becomes very old as would be expected when becoming so adjusted to an open world map. When I felt single player wasn't cutting it anymore I attempted to invest time in online. Rockstar does a tremendous job at adding content to this game with all of the game mode additions vehicle additions weapons and so on so I am not cutting them short in that respect. Put simply online also gets boring as time goes on. Heists become very frustrating if you don't have a large group of friends to play them on. Races are a cluster most of the time. Death match game modes are very fun for the first couple of times you play them but become very repetitive as time goes on. Don't even get me started on the open world aspect of online. When you do everything in GTA V it becomes very uninteresting. It is hard to bring yourself to press ""Play"" when you know you'll be running through the same frustrations the last time you tried. With that said there was one thing that extended my interest in GTA V. Mods. Mods kept me playing this game when I ran out of interest. Mods take up about 40% of the hrs on record that you see posted. Mods are in large part why there is any real interest in this game this late into its life. The single player campaign is fantastic. The online is.. meh. Both run out on you and mods keep a constant interest. Now that's gone and so is what interest I had left in this game. Going to help clear out some hard drive space I must say. )",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,352,False,Not Recommended,GTA V single player is one of the most brilliant most ambitious games I have ever played. And the sad thing is it is willfully neglected in favor of its lesser GTA Online multiplayer counterpart.Microtransactions are rampant (and the only legitimate way to ever hope to keep up with all of the ludicrously expensive in game content) and practically forced down your throat if you want to stay current and complaints from the community on this have been largely ignored.Hackers run rampant and honest players realistically must fear being banned for picking up hacked cash on accident. Gameplay is tailored to favor the rich and smother the poor and while I may be guilty of buying a shark card or two the entire grind for in game currency almost legitimizes some players' modding for cash.And to top it all off Rockstar has recently 'addressed' Take Two's abhorrent attack on the modding community brushing the action off as if they held no responsibility to the matter. Shame on Rockstar for giving lip service to such a blatant attempt to force the player base to the microtransaction hell that is GTA Online.This game had the potential to be legendary and in many respects it has achieved that status. But it's clear that Rockstar and Take Two care little for the gamers the modding community and gaming's culture and values as a whole. Don't buy this game. If I could I would return it for a refund.

2017-09-11,0,0,489,False,Not Recommended,The single player for this game is the best I've seen/played in the GTA series. The multiplayer on the other hand has some real issues at the moment.GTA Online was a ton of fun at first and where I have spent most of my time playing this game. The SP was a lot of fun but the idea of having my own character and assets like garages full of pimped out customized cars pulled me in and I put in a couple hundred hours before touching the singplayer again and I only did the prologue missions before jumping head first into GTA Online.The heists are top notch and what I prefer to play but there are only 4 heists not counting the boring first heist that can only be played with 2 players. The jobs and heists are fun but after a hundred hours in GTAO you get bored with them because there isn't enough of them you start repeating the same stuff over and over again.The new content they are releasing is all the same thing re skinned. It's all about CEOs now you buy a property for 1 million or so and then you can access the new content so right off the bat you have to either buy a shark card or grind to get access to the latest updates then you will find that they are all the same thing. Be a boss get a crew and then do mission where everyone else on the map in session can intervene and mess up your plans. There are 4 or 5 modes now like this that are just slightly different but pretty much the same thing. I suppose Rockstar is content with dividing the community as long as they are getting enough shark cards bought.When this was released it was my favorite game and me and mine played weakly doing heists and jobs. Looking back the future of GTAO looked so promising it's sad to see it in the state it is currently. We vote with our wallets so if you don't like the new content please don't buy shark cards and maybe RS will realize they need to give GTAO some serious attention instead of these repeats of content being added over and over again.We need new heists which RS has stated they will not do and the promise of SP DLC has been completely glossed over due to the success of GTAO. I hope that the game losses population and RS realizes their business model isn't going to last and if GTAO is going to survive or have a profitable sequel they need to do things differently. It seems they put so much into the base game and the new content doesn't mesh well with that base.TL/DRIf you want it for SP then get it right away if you want it for GTAO (The only thing RS is actively supporting) then I would say you are going to have a lot of fun at first untill you hit that content ceiling and start having to do the same things over and over again and if the trend continues you'll be sadly dissapointed by the content updates that are all essentially the same thing.I'm not recommending this game only because I want RS to fix some serious issues with the game. 6 months after release I could not have recommended this game more but now I have a hard time recommending it with the current shortcomings of GTAO.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-03-26,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,plus side the Story mode Is Great there's no other way to put it. I have a big issue with GTA online though For some unknown reason I've been banned from GTA Online. I only played GTA V Online once a few months ago for a few hours done some races and roamed around. So I have like at most a few hours on Gta Online. I wanted to start playing GTA online again even watched some youtube videos on how to make money and so on. So I went to go to GTA Online and says Ive been banned for 1 month how????!!!!I've never abused or cheated on GTA online I dont even have 1 bad sport report ot whatever it is. Then I find out that I cant even appeal against this ban I've recieved. This really disappointed me so I have to not recommend because. This game Is clearly punishing players that have done nothing wrong and its very unfair.So after I wrote this post I contacted Rockstar threw there online chat. I would say it wasn't much help but its better than nothing. Also Its got to the point you properly need to record yourselfs while playing gta 5 online to prove to them you're innocent when they do there routine sweeps of cheaters and hackers. So that when they mess up and take soem of us the INNOCENTS with the bad guys we have the evidence to prove to rockstar that we're not the cheaters. Unfortunately guys the low life hackers and cheaters have created this problem for us and Its not fair at all. I copy and pasted my conversation with rockstar it's just down below. ME Hi If its possible could I be given a explanation as to why I got banned on GTA Online. I've only played GTA online once and just done a couple races like a few months back. Then 3 days ago I go to GTA Online and I'm Banned. I've never ever abused the GTA online or ever cheated and I never intend too.ROCKSTAR Hello thank you for contacting Rockstar Support my name is Rene. I understand that you are banned from playing GTA Online is this correct?ME yesME I've never used cheats on GTA OnlineME I only played online a few hours like a few months backROCKSTAR I understand your concern we will look into your account and we will get back to you after looking into it.ME Ok thank youROCKSTAR Thank you for your understanding. Is there anything else I can assist you with?ME Yes can you unban me please I've been banned for no reason.ROCKSTAR I can understand we will look into your account now and we will get back to you once we have looked into other than ban do you have any questions or concerns?ME Yeah there is One more thing. Ive been watching alot of videos of gta online. I watched a video saying dont go on gta 5 online its unsafe because of cheaters and hackers. What steps is rockstar games doing to prevent these poeple from ruining my game experience and others?ROCKSTAR I understand we are currently working to play the game fairly and remove modders and cheaters in game. To keep the game play environment as fair as possible we routinely do sweeps to separate cheaters from legitimate players. In addition to in game automated detection we also review evidence submitted by the GTA Online community.ROCKSTAR You can also report players through GTA Online if you see cheaters or modders in game. The best and most effective way to report cheaters in GTA Online is through the in game menu. When reports are sent to us via the in game tools we are able to study much more data to help identify and act on the user and the activity in question. You can visit the below article to report the players in game https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/en us/articles/200704406ME do you guys allow recorded evidence? as im thinking of recording my gta online gameplay to prove I havent done anything wrong and that this ban issue doesnt ahppen againand im guessing these routinne sweeps also sweeps up some of the innocent as well? sorry to sound bluntROCKSTAR I understand it is better to record your game play for future issues to be resolved as I have already stated we are looking into your account we will update the status after looking into it.ME so will you inform me in this chat or send me a notificationROCKSTAR You'll receive a notification once we look into your account.ME do you know how long that can atek upto?ROCKSTAR Unfortunately we do not have any time frame regarding this we notify you once this is resolved.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-06,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,"tl dr GTA Online is a gem but Rockstar decides to slather rancid on anything that shines. Only fun with friends. Im still going to buy red dead 2.This game was a favourite of mine during the early years when it came out on the 360. And after playing hundreds of missions I bought a Cheetah and a suite at the Eclipse Hotel. However Rockstar removed my ownership of both of those and left me with no car and no apartment thus slapping me in the face for playing their game.After buying GTA on PC I signed in with a new account unaware i could link my 360 account and after numerous back and forth emails with Rockstars customer support I was told I had to buy the game yet again because Social Club binds with my steam account. Ofcourse my old account was stripped of its possesions but I still worked up for a cheap apartment and a Turismo along with almost 100 in levels.When I played this on the 360 it was perfect in performance now on PC however I experience constant frame drops almost completely freezing my game and at one point requiring me to ""end task"" from Task Manager.Running on an i5 6500 GTX 1070 and 8GB RAM I am well over the recommended requirments. I don't know if this is just myself as my friends haven't had such a frequent issue and I can assure you my drivers are up to date. Additionaly GTA is the only game in which i experience massive frame drops (or any frame drops). Obviously running most settings on ultra high should not be a problem.The loading times in this game are unbearably long. Simply just starting up online mode takes atleast a couple minutes usually ranging at the 5 minute mark. Joining other servers take some time aswell but you usually don't have to thanks to Rockstar automatically putting you in the same server as a friend which is the only redeeming mechanic of this game.The prices in this game are insanely high for the low amount jobs pay you. Most jobs only pay a few thousands maybe just up to 15k. Although this sounds reasonable Rockstar removed the ability to replay a mission without first going back into freemode which brings up my point again about long loading times. Not being able to replay a mission severely stunts a quick income. Now I haven't done the research on this but I have noticed it while browsing car listings on IGN with IGN showing a lower price for certain cars than what is shown ingame. Rockstar has seemed to raise the prices of items and also lowered the reward money of many jobs which were once used to farm.Rockstar has shark codes which will give you money for real world purchase which is obviously what they're trying to enforce.",Grand Theft Auto V

At the begin there were not alot hackers. But now there are so many stupid hackers. You'll get banned like me my friends and as so many others just being with one in a lobby. Just look it up if you don't believe me. Rockstar really doesn't care if you're not a hacker. If you have been in a lobby with one The whole lobby will be banned once. The second time you get in to a lobby with a hacker. You will be banned forever (never play again and account deleted. All your content all those hours and all the fun GONE). Rockstar already has your money. So you just waste your money after being banned. All of us have already tried to contact Rockstar Support. But Rockstar tells them all the same ''It's your own fault being a cheater''. We are no cheaters. Unless being in a lobby with a cheaters automatically makes you a cheater.But if you want to try it.

All I have to say to that is look up the penny for your thoughts Calvin and Hobbes comic. But yeah in terms of porting it doesn't have the shi*ty jerky aiming that 4 had it aims very smoothly and responsively and it's very easy to shoot things. Not fond of the way the camera autocenters all the time. It's pretty fuc*en annoying. I can see the road a lot better when the camera is tilted downward rather than straight ahead.I also want to mention that I liked the story and characters of 4 better than this one. It's not bad but I didn't find it nearly as compelling as Niko's and his NOBODY FUC*S WITH MY FAMILY rampages and whatnot. It is a lot more lighthearted and goofy at times though.

2016-08-17,0,0,108,False,Not Recommended,Good game company! I rarely type reviews. This one was warranted to warn others. I did not use any cheats in the online game. In fact I barely even played it. The first time I actually played online was in June. After playing I logged off. I checked my email before going to bed to see I had received a ban. I asked around and a few other gamers I know said it was possible because of a Trainer (which shuts off during online) might have set it off. OK I didn't even contest that I had read that GTA supported mods for offline. So a month later I installed a new SSD drive and thought I will give GTA another shot. Mind you this was a fresh install of Windows 7. It took 2 days to download all of my games back. A group of gamers I know wanted me to jump on. So I did I didn't even really do anything special. I stood in my apartment and watched a helo battle going on. I live in a hotspot across from Maze bank where a CEO office is. So I have to be sneaky leaving cause I always got gunned down trying to leave. So I left my apartment stood outside and watched other players battling it out. I got in my car and drove to ammunation to buy some ammo and new guns. Note I am only a Level 8. The gun owner gets spooked because there is a tank outside blowing up everything in the streets. I have to leave because the owner closed shop. I walk outside and get blasted. I laugh it off and respawn and get a car and drive off. I got into a gun battle with a guy he kills me 5 times to my 3. I was also just trying out a new gamepad I had gotten. It was late so I jumped out of the game. Next morning I see I had received another ban.This was a fresh install with no mods installed! I contacted RockStar support only to get a automated response about my ban. They didn't even bother to look at the evidence. I repeatedly sent responses and reopened the ticket to get the same BS run around. They will not even explain why I got the ban nor will they help me try to solve it so it won't happen again. I requested a refund for the game through Steam. I hope it goes through. I will never buy another RS game ever. I sold so much of my TF2 inventory to get the game. Now all I can hope is I hope for the refund. I don't have a lot of money to be wasting on games where the company doesn't give a crap about it's players.Over all I can't take anything away from the game. I love the game.

2016-07-12,0,0,139,False,Recommended,Singleplayer I've been playing GTA V since launch back in 2013. I've play it on Xbox 360 Xbox One and now PC. It is by far one of my favorite games and one of the best games ever. It has an extremely awesome singleplayer with so much to from side missions to buying your dream setup (cars guns clothes etc) and tons more to do on top of its amazing campaign. It's extremely immersive and you will get lost in all of it's content. Singleplayer 10/10 Multiplayeer I've also been playing GTA Online since it was released and it is extremely fun and there is tons to do. All of the missions are very fun and there are endless missions to choose from. Heists are a lot of fun to play with a group of friends if you play with random players online it is risky but it is very possible to do you just have to trust in others. My problems with GTA O is it has way to many loading screens where there shouldn't be and they back you out of missions to often when you should just be taken back to lobbies for the said missions. Also in GTA O you need lots of money to have a full expierence but it is a hard task to get enough money to achieve everything you want it is very possible to get the money through missions and heists but Rockstar has made it so it can be very pay to win in terms of getting your dream set up. Though the multiplayer has some flaws you will have a blast with everything you can do. I would also recommend having friends to play with as it is a lot better to have people to play missions with.

Massive multiple minute loading times even with an SSD hard drive vehicles and properties all costing insane amounts to try to make you buy the microtranscations an annoying interface that requires multiple sub menus to summon a vehicle or use an item healing items that don't replenish if you die and retry missions that take 10+ minutes and fail instantly if one of your four players leaves or dies etc.It could have been so much more than it is but what it feels like at a moment is a second job.

2017-09-23,0,0,864,False,Not Recommended,Only be prepared to enjoy GTA Online if you're ready to spend hundreds of dollars on their microtransactions. Grinding is impossible since 80% of the playerbase is full of s who only play to screw up other peoples' work so don't bother with that. Even if it was possible there are about three things you could do that actually earn money each one as tedious and anti fun as the last. Ignoring that GTA Online isn't GTA anymore. It's Just Cause with worse physics worse AI worse tools and the best part is that you have to pay real money to use any of those things.The promo images are also extremely misleading. Those are exceedingly hi res compared to what the majority of players will be able to use and the textures have been scaled up. In the actual game many textures (Mostly clothing with some concrete and buildings) are compressed to and look terrible from just about any distance.Single player could be worse. Not realistic in the slightest and characters' motives make no sense but it's a decent amount of fun. Your best bet is to just stick with GTA IV.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have not played story on PC verson but I have on 360 and it's short as heck if you don't do side quests. Great story nice characters kinda repedative but still fun.I see all these reviews saying there are hackers online but I have not found them they're all really nice people.

2015-12-27,0,0,1,False,Recommended,"So first things first If you are here to read about a full on game review then leave and look at another one. In this review I will mainly cover some things that I think should be told to the people that want to buy it in the first place.So what does it not contain? Plot Gameplay and nearly everything in the game will not be part of this review. If you are still here and interested into what I have come up with then go ahead and read.The game is a good game. It is enjoyable to watch as I do tend to watch alot of Vanoss Daithi Mini and the other guys on Youtube. Seeing how much fun they had I thought of looking into the game myself. If I wouldnt be able to play the multiplayer there was still the singleplayer right?So I went and looked at the minimum requirements knowing that my PC is far from being a beast PC. It can handle however quite a few games where others said You cant play this. I looked through the internet made a few tests and it told me everything I needed to know Your PC meets the minimum requirements. Alright then! Bought and installed!And that is where my mood went downhill.The first thing that happened was minor It started in windowed and in the lowest resolution possible. Graphics were still on default though. Turning the resolution up and putting it into fullscreen took me a while as the game kept saying You do not meet the recommended requirements. ""No sherlock! I want it to be fullscreen for it to work better anyways!""After 5 minutes it finally decided to cut it and it crashed the first time. After crashing however what could be a planned restart it went fullscreen and I could play.Actually no I couldnt. I simply wanted to try out multiplayer real quick and it told me I cant. I need to play the prologue first. Ok then. Play it finish it and now go on with it. And so I went into... Nope time out on loading Player Data! But now I can... ""You need a character first"". Oh really? How about putting me into the creation screen before you load me into the server then? But ok. Made my character nice looking asian girl and went on with it. And boy did I have fun. If fun equals a rage session with the biggest amount of lag on the lowest possible settings.I didnt say this but before heading into the game I lowered all settings to the lowest point which is... NORMAL. Normal. ing really? Ok you might not understand this but it has all the graphical settings but only these stages Normal &gt High &gt Highest. No Lowest or Low. Alright no problem or atleast it wouldnt be if the server itself which is focused on germany which is where I am coming from wouldnt lag just as well.And so I raged out of it took a good 30 minutes to calm down from waiting for 7 hours to install and 1 hour of rage and went into the Singleplayer. I am a gamehistory guy so I keep on listening. Boom we steal cars. Ok. Interesting. But the lag hits the fan again. I tried it a few times looking at settings and all but no. It just didnt want to stop. It came to a point of the game crashing on me and I had to wait 6 minutes for the Task Manager to show up. What happened then blew my ing mind.Now for the next part you need to know the following. I am using Firefox. Sometimes Firefox gives me a ton of lag. And that is when it hits 2 million on the process. GTAV hit 1 million and gave me more PC lag than Firefox ever did in 100 sessions.Now what is the point of this review? Well. The game is good. But if you only meet the minimum requirements you cannot play this game. It doesnt matter how good you think your PC is or if they tell you that you are able to run it You cannot play it.",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar outdid themselves with the development of this game and the story was decent enough for me to complete on both consoles but became super predictable once I came around to playing it on PC. GTA Online has always been a major point in this game and it shows with all the content added through updates (thank god it's not DLC you gotta purchase).The multiplayer was pretty fun even before any big updates were released for it but as time passes people have been reporting of hackers/modders that spawn and give money to other players just to ban them and it gets even worse when it comes down to people needing to spend cash to recieve tons of in game money. Players have complained that earning money through missions heists and even the CEO missions is a very slow process. There have even been some cases where people take weeks and even months out of their time to earn enough in game cash to purchase a yacht (which falls around $8 million) just to get banned after they start up the game again.TL DR The story is good enough to try but there are a lot of problems with GTA Online and Rockstar stealing people's money with shark cards.

2015-12-15,0,0,182,False,Recommended,This game... WOW!Ive put 400 hundred hours onto this game on Console but when i transferred to PC i have put around 125 hours as of this review. My world changed for this game. The graphics much deeply improved with mods everywhere including enhancers and texture packs.Although RP isnt much enforced into this game i love doing it with my friends as i see it as a huge part of the game in my opininon. This is because youve got a Huge city with lots of activities and i believe that RP should be included such as having to eat or real life activities such as Fishing or playing basketball. As of this review a casino update is being speculated which i assure my self and many others are looking forward to. I hope this brings in an option allowing you to gamble and play casino games with and against friends!Recently with the New update (The executives and criminals) the features of this DLC are many things that have been daunting my mind and they are now reality. Huge fricking yachts that are just badass in every aspect and my new favourite The Organization. This allows you and your friends to be in a official team that brings a variety of perks as well as a nice even variety of missions and game modes including my favourite Yacht piracy. Heists Always struggling to find that 4th person.. Weve been there. This update was delayed time and time again until it was finally released earlier this year. It brought a HUGE variety of things to the table New guns vehicles clothing equipment and of all The heists them selves. These missions give the oppurtunity of you and your friends teaming up in a group of four and completing a series set up missions for the big finale. Despite some set ups being a pain i can assure the pay outs are very rewarding.This game was released 2 years ago and it is still very popular and well played BUT there have been periods at time where the playerbase has just died.I highly recommend this game as it has SO much to do with a brilliant story hundreds of features and an epic online mode.Sadly im going to end this review on a bad note...Unfortunately hackers and modders are ruining the Online mode of the gane which destroys the thriving players and community of this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Sorry I usually don't like to use this langauge but.... I'm sorry. F*ck Take Two and their greedy schemes. They purposely took down OpenIV to destroy the modding community and to force everyone to GTA Online where they can make money off you. Now to be honest I never really cared for GTA Online. I always found it to be very grindy and somewhat boring when you don't have a lot of players around. The only reason I got GTA V for the PC was for the mods. The mods made me keep coming back to the game. They always added new content and let people do things that you just can't do in normal or online. But now that's gone. Because some greedy company who already has one of the most succesful games and game franchises wants even more money then it already has. How freaking wonderful. And because of this decision that Take Two has made I refuse to buy anything that Take Two and their parent companies make. As gamers espacially as pc gamers we deserve better than this. I suggest you do the same to force these idiots to change their behavior. At the very least hold off your purchase of GTA V for the time being. You may feel like this will solve nothing but actions like this can help a lot. Lets finally show Take Two that we're done with their bull crap practices. Also watch CARS 3 in theaters on June 16.

2017-12-27,0,0,111,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V ReviewTL DR multiplayer isn't very good but the singleplayer is definitely worth it. Maybe wait for a sale though because $75 USD is fairly expensive.I have played this game a lot across three seperate platforms. PS3 Xbox 360 PS4 and now PC. So up top I do not recommend you buy this game if you're just playing multiplayer. I played the multiplayer a lot on console and I can't say it's worth it. I've also read plenty of stories about Rockstar's awful Anti Cheat system that takes money from innocent players so no I don't believe you should get this game for the multiplayer.The singleplayer is a different story. Everything from the writing to gameplay is nearly perfect. The main three characters are funny psychopaths that you somehow end up liking and the gameplay between the three really does feel different. Each one has different skills different houses and different vehicles and they're all great.The story is a lot of fun and can be pretty emotional at times. Most of the famous Heists are really amazing definitely some of the best heists in video game history.I played this game with a Duelshock 4 controller but I did play about an hour with my keyboard and in my opinion the keyboard controls suck. I would recommend playing with a controller.That's all you need to know. Didn't talk about the flaws because there really aren't many of them but even though the game is amazing the price is very steep. Wait for a sale if you don't think it's worth the $75 USD.I would recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-01,0,0,370,False,Not Recommended,"The story mode is pretty enjoyable for a single time lateron replaying it its just predictable and repetitive even if some things change. But it's just little things not big things because everything just ends up to the same ending.The online mode is a nightmare you enjoy it until it gets repetitive and grindy for you. All the money you earn from jobs last only for one purchase or purchases that let you continue (that deplete your bank account so it's pretty pointless to grind jobs etc.) The online mode itself marks you as a 'free 2 play' like in Team Fortress 2 even if you bought the game (or you lucky devil received it for free) until you buy any shark card at least above 500 000 1 000 000$ and make a profit changing purchase like getting a bunker. But it still is repetitive but with higher profits that probably will get you going until you have enough. As a past modder I can confirm that modding money online actually brings you fun in online.For the clarification i did not ""cage"" anyone in public sessions (despite i've been victim of that once) annoyed anyone or killed people with cheats I only cheated money for my own profit and reason to play this bloody game.Why would modding bring you fun you ask.The answer is that it unlocks new possibilities for you to take part of like gunrunning airfreight and other cool things but being enforced to buy shark cards kills the fun you could have if R* wouldnt be a greedy cow despite earning lots of money from first week of original 2013 GTAV release on consoles resulting the company gain 2.1B $ within few days of release!I'd extremely recommend waiting for a GTAV sale before you buy it it's not worth buying it full price if the developers dont accept it enough. (if you're getting it for online mode of course)If you're getting GTAV for the story then buying it full price could be worth it. Story mode has a lot of mods to offer and it's way more fun than GTAO.Conclusion Fun game for first several hours then gets repetitive and makes you less likely to play it.Not worth full price.Pay2win.

They made griefing other players in the overworld super easy so it's pratically mandatory that you walk around in ""passive mode"" so other plays don't kill you repeatedly with the tank or fighter jets that they paid $50 in real world money to get.

For sure the graphics are stunning and this game have a better gameplay than the previous ones but it's not so addictive. I'm a ""old"" classic player so what I really enjoy is the offline version and not the online. So I will only comment about Story Mode because I don't have experience in the online version.So what I don't like in this game? The story behind the game is just a total disaster. Basically you can play with three different guys one young and cool and two boring middle aged criminals (i'm not young btw).The first problem is the characters are always arguing with everyone. Franklin is always arguing with his aunt and with street friend Lamar. Michael is always arguing with all his family and Trevor. And Trevor is all the time arguing with everyone specially with Michael. When you reach 50% of the game it's impossible to continue listening Trevor complaining about what Michael did 10 years ago. Always crying like a baby about the same history. It's just boring annoying and depressing.The protagonists are even all the time arguing with the supporting characters so don't expect make and lose ""friends"" in this story. They already hate each other. So you will make jobs (missions) to guys like Dave Steve and Devin but you will never sympathize with them. Honestly that's not very exciting... Could happen some times but not all the game. But... worst you will make dozens of missions and you will earn ZERO. Yes you read well... some guy will give you a mission and then you don't have a real reward (or you get some ridiculous reward). You will kill guys and earn zero steal cars and earn zero chase cars and earn zero kidnap people and earn zero. Why? Well the support characters will just tell you they will ""pay later"" have no money or some other stupid things. So you only will be rich in the last mission (the irony) what means you will not get real fun buying things and expending your money. Some missions (too much examples) are just boring like get some specific car and put it in other place so sometimes you will just drive to north and to south and it's all. Also the story mode is really short and easy so don't expect have lots of fun.Just to finish don't expect to create some street gang and make your own money in the Los Santos criminal underworld. Rockstar have other ideas to ""Grand Theft Auto"" like lost time playing golf tennis or watch tv (wtf?). Seriously? C'mon guys... if I want to play tennis I would buy a real tennis simulater and not GTA. In GTA I want a criminal simulator can you do that?So GTA V got the best graphics and gameplay ever but the story and missions are a big big big disappointment.

In this past week we've decided to come back to the game for a fun time and now one of them has been banned for no reason. To my understanding it's related to just being in the same game as anyone who has ""hacked"" or altered the game or whatever so now there's many players in the same boat. And what does Rockstar do about this? Nothing. Once you're banned or suspended until a certain date they won't accept tickets for these individual cases and when you try to contact the support Twitter account they advise you to send a ticket. It's a vicious cycle and poor management by the customer service side of things.Overall definitely play the single player story. It's a tonne of fun in this large sandbox world the game has. Don't touch the online part of things until these issues are sorted. Also if you've had a similar situation to this you should absolutely bring it up here or in any way that Rockstar will see it.

2018-06-21,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,I've played it on PS3 and PC and have spent way over the 150hrs on here on the console but this is more a review on rockstars customer service and there actions against players considring there running with an online game which we haven't seen from the GTA series before not to this scale atleast not without mods such as GTA San MP mod which may i say was amazing and fun as it was a sandbox which you could miss around with friends on but GTA V online is horrible its nothing but a grind simulator to the point you'll probably get boried and give up way before you get to enjoy the end game content which is only getting harder to get to with each update.It will take you months even a year or 2 of grinding to catch up to all the others thats if you dont get killed left right and center or you pay 100's to buy your way there. on that they treat there player base like trash they may never reply to your emails or they may just ban you for no reason or reset your progress for no reason and if your on the same match or server as a hacker chances are you'll get banned just by being there. The player base is mainly made up of kids and teens who will just run you over for fun or something dont get me wrong it was funny the first few times but once its all the time then its annoying. this game pushes people into finding exploits as its soooooooo... tedius and slow by the end i played Invite only and used the internet glitch to play online but with no one else as it was just horrible. Rockstar really needs to change there business tactic and treat customers like there paying customers and not like scum.Thats my rant about this games online game and there customer service it needs a really big redesign before im touching it again. But single player was amazing sad they chose to dump it and consintrate on there Pay 2 Win online modeSingleplayer 10/10 Online 1/10 Left a terrible taste after!,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-20,1,3,598,False,Not Recommended,Single player is excellent. Problem is that it has no recurring revenue generation like GTA Online. This means if you do not mind playing with at least 2 hackers per lobby ginding for cash or paying real money for fake money then this game is for you. To be honest wait until a huge sale and enjoy the single player just do not expect them to expand on it. I am going to give it a thumbs down simply because they have alienated the PC by stopping the modding community. The only reason PC games survive as long as they do is because of the amazingly dedicated modding community. It is a shame because this could have been so much more.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-03,0,0,521,False,Not Recommended,There is alot to say about GTA Online but I'll sum it up with this It should be better. It should be much better. The GTA series has been a staple in the industry with a reputation for good design and cheap fun. That all changes now. Now I see the GTA series as a goddamn chore.The single player game is good. One of my favorites for the year it came out.The online portion is what I came back for. It's bad. It's designed poorly on purpose. The devs want to manipulate new players into spending extra money on the game to avoid the grind. The problem is all of the deeper gameplay in GTA Online is PURE GRIND. Start of the game huge grind to get your first business. Then you realize you bought the wrong business and you're actually LOSING money. Then you grind to get a better business. Then you grind once that business is up and running. Then you buy more businesses. Then you continue grinding. It never stops.Without spending money an invdividual player progresses at a snail's pace. It can be punishing at times. And you do not feel like your time is well spent. This is notwithstanding the other players who are ENCOURAGED to interrupt your progress. There are plenty of edgelords that will grief you but the game encourages regular players (who otherwise wouldn't grief) to go out of their way to ruin your fun. I have to make this more clear THIS GAME ENCOURAGES OTHER PLAYERS TO RUIN YOUR PROGRESS AND SPOIL YOUR FUN. It can be very discouraging disheartening and downright depressing at times. Revenge can be sweet but simply not sweet enough.In conclusion this game has ruined the reputation of Rockstar in my eyes. I loved their products from GTA III to The Warriors to that stupid Ping Pong game. They made great games. Now I see Red Dead 2 on the horizon and I encourage people NOT to buy it. I simply cannot trust them anymore. I feel somewhat betrayed. Rockstar has made enough money they made it clear they don't care about the gaming experience or their consumers anymore. They should stop making games. More importantly people should stop buying them.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-13,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,As someone that has played GTA 5 since its released way back when Xbox 360 was still a thing (was it ever) I have been very disappointed with the new sign in system. I am one of those players that like to enjoy the game in single player fashion every now and then as a method to reminisce. Despite this I was disgusted to find that for single player I have to create an account (despite my already existing steam account). I don t have the patience or the time to go through an account recovery process especially when there is absolutely no reason to take a wonderful game that can be played as a quick action sandbox by players. The game looks like a data cash cow now without any of the real value that is expected to be added to a GTA game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-13,0,0,50,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V as a single player game has it's ups and downs all over the place. When it comes to the writing some bits are funny as with Rockstar tradition. The game also looks fine no matter what platform it is on. For the gameplay it is still Grand Theft Auto and not much has changed since the days of top down view but it definitely has some welcomed features such as being able to hold more than one type of pistol rifle and so on whereas from Vice City to 4 only one weapon of a certain class could be held. Other small tidbits like being able to turn on and off the lights of a car or even activating the roof of convertibles is the small touches that make the game more interesting than the rest. The map is also huge but it is also mostly pointless since only 25% of it is an actual city where the rest are just mountains country side and nothing worth driving over.Everything else is either lame missions that makes Grand Theft Auto 1 missions look good or gameplay and mechanic wise choices that make the game feel inferior to other games in the series. Notably the lack of 6 stars and even evading the cops themselves is more of a chore than it was in GTA 4 that did it much better. With the next gen version of the Director Mode allows some funny shenanigans to be put into play and even getting to play in first person if that is your thing. The iron sights could have been better but it is thankfully optional and not forced into the game.To put it best it is playable but I would not pay full price for it. However there is the online... oh boy GTA Online is the worst ""casual"" game in existence. It is such a grindfest since it's launch in 2013 having microtransactions to boot (even to the point where Rockstar has a overpriced starter pack) griefers that get more punishment than games with actual invasions *coughDarkSoulscough* but hackers somehow avoiding the ban hammer despite Rockstar's attempts to clean house (although websites that claim to add funds into your account STILL EXIST) and Rockstar's greed that singlehandedly killed the feeling of beating enough missions and races so you can enjoy your prized vehicle or apartment. It is overall not a fun game to play period unless you have (a) dedicated friend(s) to play with which makes leveling up and getting reputation points and cash easier than playing in a invite only session since playing in a solo lobby that you are not allowed to customize (unlike GTA 4) restricts you from doing missions that can be done by yourself.By the way the expansions that are added all for online go completely against GTA tradition (at least in the later years)... flying cars the stunt races the batmobile third rate throwbacks to other better Rockstar Games (Smuggler's Run) and the heists which is the most overhyped feature in a video game period. There are also RNG missions that can only be done in a public lobby... it's a Recipe for Disaster.Worst of all the PC version tends to crash whether you move the mouse or even fire a gun or even trying to start up the game. The PC version also requires a Social Club account just to play offline. You only need to sign in once but just to play a game with zero updates to the campaign because Rockstar wants to profit from whales and sheep of gamers who think online multiplayer is the future of gaming.Playing on console 360/PS3 or Xbox One/PS4 would be a better investment as even Take Two is against mods that don't even effect Rockstar's precious online component. I would rather buy a game that will work when I put in the disc even if I need to install it than to be online to install a game pretty it up with mods but still experience crashing because Rockstar apparently can't optimize their games for The older 3D era of GTA games that you can buy that have SecuROM DRM have better optimization than a modern AAA game. Quite sad.Scratch that buying the older GTA games on Steam albeit censored and removal of certain songs would guarantee a better experience than from a company who has made way better games with actual content instead of bloated prices that has several paywalls behind it.And finally the overuse of clickbait and dubstep on how to get easy cash and RP from the cancerous section on YouTube has also influenced my overall rating of the game. Buy it on console if you must but don't bother on PC unless you can bypass the crashing and the hackers.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-14,0,0,271,False,Not Recommended,Your checklist reviews are crap!Quite frankly I can't reccomend the Online portion of this game to anyone unless you enjoy hours of endless grinding that amounts to having large amounts of nothing. If the grind won't deter you the playerbase might. It's mostly 20 somethings and below with mental deficiencies or egos that stretch to flipping Narnia. Not to mention Rockstar's spotty servers causing massive desync in critical moments. The singleplayer portion as always is masterful but that's expected from a Rockstar game.

I know and respect the way game developers have to update a game like this with new features to keep it alive but why the hell does it need a rocket powered flying motorcycle that can shoot rockets? Or a flying delorean? The game went from GTA (Grand Theft Auto) to GFA (Grand Flying Auto). This a excrement ton of vehicles having the same max speed (I get the balancing reason but cmon..) and tons of tons of hackers who drop you money and even tho you report it you will get punished by Rockstar by just ripping all your money out of your bank multiple updates after you have apperantly ""cheated"" by getting moneybags drop from hackers you basicly cant avoid but just not play in public lobbies.

They emailed me sand said I was hacking cheating or otherwise broke the terms of service. I have never installed any mods cheats or hacks for GTA V ever Period. I called suppost several times and was literally hung up on over and over without anyone even listening for 1 second to anything i had to say. I read the terms and services they have it written in their policy that if you even connect to the server for GTA Online you are basically already in violation because they instantly reserve the right to ban or delete anyone if they affect anyone's online experience regardless of what the affect is or how minor it is. For instance it's fully within the policy to be able to ban a person and delete their character if they have a bad connection to the server for just a moment and cause a lag spike that affects the players on the same server. I dunno if that's what happened to me I had lag semi regularly when i played but if it was that's even more reason not to play this game.

The game is simply a masterpiece which is why I recommend it. That's where my recommendation ends. If I could split my review into SP vs Online I would.I have over 440 hours in this game probably another 300 hours on the PS4 version prior to arriving to PC. Many of these hours were spent on GTA Online.Myself and three other friends would create a Crew Server and play immune to the griefers. Just free roam around and play the Rockstar created missions. We created this persona around this ""Unsuspecting Van"" the name of our crew. Like a crack team of idiots unprofessional to the core.All that frivolity came to a screetching halt on March 4th 2017 at about 11 45 PM PST.Nearly all of the new content since Heists has required to be done in Public lobbies. Our once safehaven of getting all of the game's content within the confines of our crew/friends only lobbies was removed. We were forced into the detritus that makes up most of GTA Online. Griefers and modders mainly. We accepted this as inevitable to make stuff like motorcycle gangs make sense and for CEO contraband thefts/deliveries to not be ridiculously easy. We even started contributing to the game in the form of Shark Cash cards. Between myself and my three friends we probably dropped over 600 US dollars in Shark Cash both for entertainment and to be able to have the infrastructure to support the new content (CEO towers motorcycle clubhouses import/export garages etc)Tonight as we all joined into lobbies to find the least populated one (and then join the friend that found said lobby) to minimize the chance of griefers and modders everything went on as usual. We began to steal CEO contraband prepping to make a delivery with only three to four other individuals in the lobby. During our third delivery something happened. Our worst nightmare so to speak and something we could never fathom.One of our friends incidentally the one who had spent the most on the game ""left the server"". He was hysterical in our Discord server. He had been banned. Until April 4th. That wasn't the problem the problem was that his character who he spent over 220 hours crafting and playing with had been reset and all of the property he spent hard earned money on had been removed. We have never modded we don't support modders we hate what they do to the game. We used to play in Crew only lobbies for a reason.Tonight we all collectively uninstalled Grand Theft Auto V. A title we have spent a combined total of probably over 3000 hours on and probably around 1000 US dollars across two platforms. There is no way to argue the ban. There is no way of knowing what he was banned for. The rest of us are not banned but have no interest in playing now. An automated system had determined my friend guilty of some crime and all decisions are final. In fact supporting a ""ban appeal"" trouble ticket at Rockstar cutely is a dead end as they literally throw it into the trash as you press submit with the message ""All bans are final."" Power trip much? Why does the ban appeal option even exist then?Be very wary of spending your hard earned cash in this game. I finally understand why people mod by the way. After picking up a 30 day ban and more importantly a total character reset my friend has nothing left to lose. What's stopping him from actually modding and being a head until being caught? Nothing.

Gta 5 single player is worth the money but gta online is not its kinda sad cuz underneath all the greefing and grinding there is a good game but becuase of shark cards you just dont have that much fun and sadly all upcoming games from rockstar are gonna have some kind of shark card like system in them and its gonna focus on the online part of game. because of all this i cant give this game a good score now if shark card get removed then gta 5 is 5/5 masterpice. but because of shark cards this game is only a 1/5,Grand Theft Auto V

Instead of at the very least allowing players to do CEO/Hangar/Gunrunning work in private lobbies Rockstar forces you into paying in Public sessions so you inevitably run into the stupid s who only derive enjoyment from ruining yours (by spawning cages on your character hacking orbital strikes etc.).So unless you want to spend a few hours constantly looking for that one lobby without a modder in it don't get the damn game until they fix this issue.

After playing for about 2 years on the PS4 i finally made the move to swap over to PC MASTER RACE because of a new gaming rig i custom built I bought a pc copy from rockstars website loaded up got into online IMMEDIATELY met with a ban. i didn't even get to do the tutorial for the gun you start with. I tried to appeal because they have a BAN APPEAL section on their forums instant denied even though i was recording and had proof that i wasn't hacking. I said what ever and that what ever was my first mistake. after about 2 weeks i bought another copy off of loaded up again immediately banned. After about a month or two it became on sale on steam i bought it for a lower price and was able to play for about 4 hours no issues I log off and come back on the next day to play for a few hours and ban again.

The last time I played this game also happens to be my first online mission and after they started banning people without an appeal option for virtually anything they felt like. These devs have destroyed GTA 4 as well with DRM from hell without any upkeep. San Andreas was also gutted. Enough is enough.

2018-04-08,0,0,1210,False,Not Recommended,"Single Player/Story ModeA job well done on part of R* as they have been doing for many of their past GTA games up until this point. This aspect of their games has never ceased to dissappoint me. The character development was on point as well as the overall plot. This was the main reason I had invested into the game to begin with and if you're in the same boat I would recommend it (ONLY ON SALE though since this isn't exactly a new game to begin with).Online/MultiplayerI tried my best to enjoy this part of the game but R* had made it hard for me to justify any reason to really continue playing. I personally felt like this could have turned into something great for everyone but in the end hackers just ended up ruining everything. The fact that most of these hackers reign without consequence is reason enough to stay away from Online in general. However should you find yourself wanting to live the experience free of this insanity ""Invite Only"" or ""Solo"" sessions are your only other hope. And if you're lucky enough to have friends join you that could become the redeeming factor of Online I suppose. Other than that there is very little point to playing Online right now as long as hackers remain in control of the majority of servers and little is being done at least to my knowledge to stop it (reporting doesn't seem to help all that much even with proof provided S H O C K I N G). Not to mention there is the potential to get banned even if you happen to be innocent or legit as hackers can still screw you over by dumping modded money or RP (xp) on you involuntarily.Long story short (1) Avoid public lobbies if you're solo (2) you're advised to only play with friends (3) just don't play Online save yourself the trouble and frustration.One more thing everything in Online nowadays is MUCH more expensive than the last gen days (PS3 Xbox 360) to the point where it could take you weeks to months to get what you want legit.

2019-01-15,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,The gameplay itself is fun you move around in various machines do insane jumps shoot all around and otherwise defy reason in a visually pleasing way. You might actually be satisfied if you only play the campaign but I actually bought it for the online part to play with friends.First thing you notice in the online mode is the loading screen and I mean you'll have at least full 5 minutes to recall the sound of cassette tape drives. You must keep your eyes on the game as there is a short countdown (at most 15 minutes) before you get kicked for idling but you will get randomly dropped from a session as well so be prepared to see the loading screen a lot. This is especially annoying if you try to do something organized with friends.The heists (gated by a reasonably short prep time if you already have 4 man team) are not really fun to slightly frustrating so you don't really do them for the little monetary rewards but as a distraction while your staff produces a bit of money. And you need a lot of money to afford anything interesting.Anyway after few hours you will nurture the masochistic tendencies to like the endless grind interleaved with colorful loading screens.

2017-02-03,1,3,367,False,Not Recommended,Unfortunately everything people are saying about the game is true as far as the multiplayer. Here is the ***IMPORTANT* Info that you need to know***!!***The game's netcode is written... so terribly that not only can people cheat. They can see your info. Your IP address. They can even mess with your game. They can DDOS you and worse. I killed a player in the game and they told me to let them kill me or they would ( i can't remember the phrase they use) any way I said no and they screwed my game up. I don't know to what extent they can upload files to your computer. But risking having you PC hacked just to play a game isn't worth it. This is due to rockstar making too many things client side. Because they want to save money on how many servers they have to buy.*Other exploiters are just there to ruin your experience. And at this point you run into one on EVERY server you will join. If you join one and there isn't any one exploiting... don't worry give it a few minutes and one will join. They make the game unplayable they will just constantly make you explode. Ruin your vehicles you have bought... mess up missions you are playing.. etc. Some exploits follow you even onto other game sessions. *It seems like everyone EXCEPT the cheaters are the ones that get banned. People get banned for no reason ( possibly because hackers have put files on their computer) There was an exploit hackers used changing your gun skin that got players permanently banned. So just playing the game risks you losing your ability to play multiplayer ever at this point. Several times warnings have gone out on GTA news sites telling everyone not to play until a bug that gets you banned is fixed. Ridiculous..*Rockstar has the nerve to charge people for in game money when hackers just give themselves as much money as they want. DO NOT BUY THEIR SHARK CARDS!*Rockstar knew that this could happen. They had the same issue with the last GTA game. And decided to use the same style of netcode. This has everything to do with them wanting to save money.* They are so nice to continue releasing content for the game dlc you get for free! Except.. Oh wait it is usually cars that you have to buy with in game money. That takes forever to get ( they want you to buy the in game money with real money) so it basically is payed DLC unless you are a hacker.So basically this comes down to Rockstar being cheap. They didn't want to cough up the money for servers even though they made billions off of the game. If you recently bought the game get a refund if you can. For those who have the game. You can send complaints to Rockstar about their netcode. That they need to use dedicated servers. ( this is completely possible. There is a modding project that allows you to join and create dedicated servers good luck finding players though. )Do not buy this game.It sucks because the game WAS fun. And the multiplayer WOULD be awesome. If it wasn t for these issues.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-06-26,0,0,300,False,Not Recommended,"Just like many others before me I have not played GTA online in half a year. I have been playing GTA online since its first release and I decided to log back in a day or two ago. Little did I know that I would be faced with a ""your account has been suspended until June 25"" statement along with a reset of my online account. I have tried sending a request ticket but I do not have any hope that they will help me resolve my issue let alone reply back to me and it honestly ruined the positive experience I had with GTA from now on. Do not get me wrong however. The game itself is great in my opinion. The have had very fun experiences with my friends but I do find their customer service and their approach on anti cheating really unfair as I think that those who have been playing innocently have been paying more of the price for what the hackers and modders are doing. This game has so much potential and I really hope to buy GTA 6 if it ever comes out but they really need to improve on their customer services for the sake of those like myself have been playing this game for nearly 5 years just to see their hardwork get deleted in a day. Also while I did have fun with the game and have been a fan of the franchise it has been quite unsettling to see how much of a grind culture the GTA online setting has been progressing towards but other than that and the need to tremendously improve on their customer support the game has been really fun for me while it lasted.",Grand Theft Auto V

However vapid story mode loss of gameplay elements which were present in GTA IV dumbed down (sorry I mean ""assisted"") driving mechanics and Online totally negates that. All the latest updates only have content for the multiplayer mode which is not only excluded from singleplayer without any reason but actively kept out of it. The whole game looks like it's oriented towards preschool kids who buy the ingame currency with their mothers' plastic cards. For me it feels like a massive downgrade compared to the amazing GTA IV. With a heavy heart I do not recommend this game.Now Take Two the company owning Rockstar Games has gone too far this time. They have stopped FiveM an alternative multiplayer project without Shark Cards nonsense development in the past they forced RDR V the RDR map conversion project to shut down and yesterday it became public that they threatened guys behind OpenIV into stopping developing and distributing their tool which was essential for a GTA game modding. They don't understand that the modding on PC is what made their games so popular and them so rich and famous. They don't understand that OpenIV has literally nothing to do with all those hackers and cheaters Online is full of. They need to be taught a lesson.",Grand Theft Auto V

Not even warnings!I had been working on my profile for months and one day I logged in to find that I had been banned for 30 days and my entire account wiped without a given reason. With this I gave up. Rockstar doesn't give two worth of a crap about their player base. It used to be a lot of fun but the game is so riddled with Rockstar isms that it's not worth the money anymore.

The balance of multiple characters in an overarching plot all of which have their own unique traits quirks and lovable sides that endear the player is amazing. It shifts the tone of the story and the world with each different character fluidly without coming to any harsh breaks.If you're looking for a good GTAV Single Player expierence PLAY THIS GAME.Now let's get to the reason why I can't reccomend this game.Rockstar got greedy.Now the multiplayer is nothing but a grind. The designers and developers are so laser focused on implementing new overly expensive cars in the game to either I don't know pretend their Forza or to give more players an execuse to pay ludicrious amounts of money to fill their garage without having to be creative.There hasn't been a SINGLE DLC to come out for single player. All of the devs' work have been put into their multiplayer side of things and it shows. The multiplayer completely lacks any tone management and you can easily tell that along the way Rockstar forgot what they wanted GTAV multiplayer to be.It's grindy annoying unfun to play and if you ever manage to find someone that'd be willing to play the fun stuff with you (The Heists) you have to wait for hours on end for the loading screens to pass by to set everything up to filter out the newbs and griefers (Whom of which go unpunished constantly) and have to spend millions of dollars just to buy the damn heist itself making the return profit a loss if the host doesn't gobble up 80% of the cut. It's pathetic.This is a prime example of what it looks like when greed overtakes creativity. Study it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,323,False,Not Recommended,Edit Rockstar got Take Two to allow mods for singleplayer again so good on them. However my negative review still stands for the online portion.However there's still an incredible amount of things that really don't appeal in this game when it comes to the online portion. Let's list off a few things...1. Grinding is extremely tedious. It's like a mini MMORPG but you can also get screwed over at any time. You have to wait till character level 20 to do any Heist and even then you have to get a good apartment/home for it so you'll need a ton of money to do it. Heists make good money but well you can only really reliably do it with friends due to random pubs mostly being extremely terrible.2. EVERY player that isn't a hacker apparently is just basically Trevor. If you even cross paths with players in this game it is highly likely that they WILL kill you and blow up your vehicle. The game is only bearable in solo or friends only sessions but...3. In order to do anything that makes money you must do it in a public session. Apart from Heists you have to do everything in a public session. CEO missions are extremely lucrative especially if you have some friends to do it with but there will be a humongous target on your back that everyone will come over to shoot. Everything in this game is designed to be one huge grind that is made worse by the game's community.4. Hackers and Modders are pretty rampant in the game. I've never actually come across hackers myself however I tended to stick with non public gaming sessions. Did you know that a hacker can get YOU banned by putting tons of money into your account? Talk about a kick in the 5. Shark Cards. Remember how I said that it's incredibly hard to make money in this game safely and reliably? Well you actually do have a way... by spending REAL money to get in game money! So yeah an extremely toxic community that would rather blow you up even in your own apartment than let you have some peace combined with the fact that CEO stuff can't be done except in public servers and you have yourself quite the business model. You WILL play the online you WILL see how infuriating it is to make any sort of money and you WILL be extremely tempted to spend real cash on in game cash to get everything. Heck there's even a radio advertisement in the game that references the shark cards. Then let's just say you buy something with that money. Surprise! Since everything is so expensive you'll likely have to put down even MORE money to get more things you want. More houses? Exotic cars? Helicopters or Jets? Yup all of that cost a pretty penny in the game.Just go live out your life and you'll be playing a far better version of GTA 5. Minus the cop chases of course I would hope.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online was meh but it was always meh. Free updates is okay but hey you know free is free. however there's a twist with this. Where as a big game like Battlefield 4 back in its hayday DLC wasnt free. however paying for DLC would certainly cost less than GTA's proposed updates. You pay $20 get content. Simple. GTA you need to grind. You will not advance in the game until you grind. You must grind. If you dont want to grind you have to shovel cash into Rockstars pocket. This will only get you the barebones of what you want.Even then online is a hellhole. Most of everyone said "" paying for cash"" (for good reason) and have gotten money from scripters who cheat in cash. And even then scripters run rampid and normally unopposed. They dont have any retribution for banning people no backlash for anything.to simply put it GTA O is a cool concept yes. But milks the fact you the person who enjoys the content of GTA O Also doesnt have the time to farm in GTA O. So you're more likely to pay or try to find a scripter who may potentially ban you instead of well. Grinding. Grinding is terrible. It's hair pulling annoyance. It's repetitive. Every issue with it is just obvious.While I do applaud the content of GTA O it simply plays you the player like a fiddle if you want to play it ""Legit"" If you dont? You risk getting banned. Even if you get the cash from a scripter and dont report it there's still a tiny chance of getting banned permanently from the games servers. Which they've changed their policies ridiculously.Once again GTA O is just a of cool content and terrible management. Now I will say this. I wouldnt mind paying $20 towards the game if the game gave me more money and not just a 3% of any money I need to accomplish anything. I think we all would. Even then the game is poorly optimized I'm told.Singleplayer is cool storys neat all wraps up. If you want my advice though Just play Singleplayer with mods. We fought Two Take hard to get Open IV back (which enables you to swap between normal GTA and Modded GTA to prevent getting banned in GTA O for mods) Because singleplayer with mods is more enjoyable than online. Online is impossible to enjoy anymore.Dont support Rockstars bad habbit. Dont buy shark cards.

Rockstar has done hardly anything to stop this and as a result its just gotten worse. GTA Online is great when you find a lobby without someone hacking but nine times out of ten you will always be in a lobby with one. It's a shame because GTA Online would be so much fun if everyone just played fairly and didn't resort to cheating. Until Rockstar fixes this issue I would not recommend this game.

Sometimes it will tell you that loading has timed out and then you have to wait until your singleplayer mode loads so you can try again. This can happed 2 3 4 5 times in a row even more if you persistent. You can't put any filters on jobs that you want to join. For example it would be great to be able to choose to join only jobs that you haven't played or jobs that are comunity created only. Freemode is just plain boring. Bring us servers.

2018-05-01,0,0,330,False,Not Recommended,After playing for about a month with friends and family one of the members of our group got an automatic ban which was not warranted(we don't cheat or mod or grief). One day we were driving through town and our car hit an invisible barrier and 10 minutes later the driver of the car was booted out of the game with a ban. Autorespones explained that it was automatic with no human oversight permanent and non appealable.We all had by this time paid for the heist pack and a couple shark cards for fun stuff. Once we saw how Rockstar had handled the customer support side of this issue we all decided to stop playing the game We're in agreement as well that we won't be purchasing any future titles by Rockstar as well which ends an incredibly long string of purchases.It's a shame to be honest. We were perfectly happy playing within the game's rules while spending more money than was responsible on the online portion which their flawed and unsupervised automated chat system put an end to.TL DR buy only if you're ok with the chance of gameplay being taken away from you without legitimate reason resulting in wasting the money you've spent on it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Well let me tell you First you wanna buy every single vehicle you probably know from the real world. You are playing with your friends and doing heists or races or something like that. It takes quite a while to do if you are a starter but that will be fine. In the open world you'll get ""trolled"" or just killed by higher level players with their expensive jets and so on. That really gets annoying and you just want to have a lobby without these kind of players in it because you can't do any of the free roam missions without getting blown up. That sucks because you just spent money and time into the game and won't be rewarded. Now you can say but that is what Rockstar wants. Yes they do. They want you to fail at making money in the way of grinding endless amounts of hours just to make you buy a shark card for real money. And they will continue to make everything more expensive so you don't even try grinding and take the easy way out buying a shark card. That is what the game has become. Micro transaction. In the end I just want to tell you that you can do so much in this game but it will get boring really quick if your friends are getting tired of this game because they want to do other stuff not just grinding.

2018-07-18,1,3,51,False,Not Recommended,Gta online is filled with hackers and very incompetent people.I found hackers extremly common and heists extremly hard to do not becausde they were hard but because most of the players failed the missions. I'm unsure if I should rate this game based on the multiplayer experience though as the main game is pretty spot on. The single player is as they say where it's at.To concludeOnline is quite rubbishWhy? Extremly grindy it'll feel like an mmo pretty quickly unless you wait for Rockstar to release an event that showers you with gold for no effort but that ain't fun. Hackers sadly this game seems right filled with the buggers. I'm unsure if I'm just unlucky or I'm right but I found them everywhere.+ Heist Variety I felt the heists were pretty rad. Once I got a solid team they were quite fun.Singleplayer is awesome+It has so much more content. And yes the online is filled with hundreds of hours countless players organizations and butt loads of shazzam you feel overwhelmed. But I felt the content didn't have bite to it. It felt so lacking like I ordered a BLT and all I got was damned lettuce. I mean seriously GTA Online is lettuce and lettuce is one of those things you just don't eat alone it's a garnish at best. I mean come on what sort of tail end orders a BLT with only lettuce? What sort of sadism would allow a person to walk from their house to your shop and order a BLT hold the bacon and tomato.A psychopath.In conclusion I have come to the proposal that GTA Online is lettuce and GTA 5 Single Player is a wholesome Bacon Lettuce and Tomato sandwhich.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-09,0,0,84,False,Not Recommended,"WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING GTA ONLINE MULTIPLAYER READ BELOWI have never wrote a review before for any game however never have I felt more compelled to share my thoughts of this particular game. I'll start off by saying the singleplayer hands down is amazing the world the environment and the heists are fluid and extremely entertaining. Awesome characters from three different backgrounds and three different stories that mash into one. Definitely worth the 20 bucks I paid for the singleplayer.Now the multiplayer. The multiplayer is in one word an extreme GRIND. All the major DLC releases include 2 things a new way to make money and awesome new vehicles to purchase. The new ways to make money are through businesses and the barriers to entry are stupid expensive. The upgrades you can put on your businesses can cost to be more than the business itself. Rockstar does this to leave you with two options GRIND 100+ hours or pay actual US currency for ingame currency through shark cards. Shark cards can give you that vehicle you wanted as soon as possible without any work just 100 dollars for 8 million in game or something like that.Now modding I'm not against modding however I did not mod myself (not even the singleplayer). Modding gets you whatever whenever you want. Skip the grind skip the shark cards you can do awesome stuff modding and in my opinion it increases the longevity of the game. Rockstar has made it very clear no modding is allowed in any way shape or form. Modding can result in a temp or perm ban which is basically because they want to squeeze every dollar they can out of their player base for those shark cards. Yesterday I was in the midst of a supply run when a modder teleported the whole lobby into a bus and told us we were going on a ""magic school bus trip"". Just some dude having his fun with the lobby we were doing some crazy like zooming across the entire map in 4 seconds and dropping nukes like it was Nagasaki below. I thought when he hits the ground I would exit and continue my supply run and I did exactly this. This morning I was hit with a temporary ban and a full reset my next ban would be permanent. I had no mods nothing installed on my computer just discord running in the background. You can and are likely to get banned for not doing anything wrong just being present in a modded lobby (which is every other session) can get you in trouble. I read up about this in the forums and Rockstar will not appeal any bans they don't care if you were modding or not. Many people had 500+ hours in the game playing legitimate and still get banned thank god I didn't invest that much time in the multiplayer only to be wasted away. Rockstar clearly has a flaw in their system that probably won't get any attention due to the fact RDR2's release date is approaching and Rockstar could care less about about appealing unjustified bans.tl dr singleplayer gud multiplayer is ruined by Rockstars greed and ban system",Grand Theft Auto V

People praise Rockstar for continued support on a game where they add DLC for free and nowadays this isn't the norm but isn't this what should be expected?

DC's exploits poor server connections netcode bugs that result in crashes getting stuck in black or white screens during load and having to force restart the game hackers glitch exploiters expensive weapons and vehicles that exist only to grief other players to frustrate people into buying Shark Cards terrible transaction logic (when you purchase A for your car and then purchase B you have to rebuy A to equip it and no discount/refund is given for the transactions) I can honestly go on and on and on about how poorly GTAO was designed and implemented. When the game was designed to prioritize micro transactions over everything else you will not have fun with it. I am writing this as I quit trying to play GTAO after 10+ ""Program has stopped responding"" crashes ""Lost connection to servers kicking to GTA 5"" error messages and game loading to white/black and nothing else while trying to play with my girlfriend. For the 3 or 4 hours I played I think 1 hour of that was actual game time. If I were to ignore all these issues would I recommend the game? Yes. But they happen in every single gaming session (today being especially worse) that there are absolutely no excuses for the devs.tl dr if you can deal with terrible quality for a finished product go ahead and buy it.

The SP part is extremely short and not as well thought out as San Andreas. Yes the world is huge but there are far less things you can interact with in SP vs MP. If you're looking for a fantastic SP GTA experience go back to San Andreas. Saying that this game blows is an understatement.

2017-09-25,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,Okay I love GTAV but Rockstar needs to pull their ing together. The whole customer support is automized with pre written messages and they never even bother to look at issues that players are experiencing. The servers are trash ridden with hackers who Rockstar just loves to let slip while they ban people for using singleplayer mods.I used to have so much respect for Rockstar since they always give out every dlc for free and you have the ability to aquire everything ingame without microtransactions if you're commited enough. But this is t even the third party MP client works better than their official servers.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-08-13,0,0,322,False,Recommended,"Okay my first review was pretty much satire so let's do actual serious one so people understand is this game worth it or not? Averagely yes. It's alot of fun especially with friends. But I'm talking about online not story. To be honest I haven't even touched story if we don't count obligatory prologue. But most people are here for the online anyways. So where we begin? Pros Gameplay Gameplay is straight forward. You live in city of Los Santos fictional city on West California. You are going to create your character with some random clothes and starting skills. You spawn to city without apartment car or anything. So you're vulnerable to attack unless you go to passive mode. Passive mode is status that you can't take damage but you can't hurt anyone either. You can do simple things. You can mess around in freemode go to the missions heists or host then yourself. Or just race with your friends on expensive cars like Grotti X80 Proto. Heists (sort of) I like the heists. Most part. I talk about heist finales. They're most part fun to do and you get alot money from them especially from Pacific Standard. They're innovative and realistic. Unlike Payday 2 if you screw up it's over. You have to quick restart or start all over again. If you quick restart you can't do elite challenges. This is why heists in GTA Online are more rewarding than Payday 2's even though you get less money. But there is another problem with heists that I'm going to cover later. Freemode Freemode is probably funniest part in the game. You can just mess around and do whatever you want. You can get 5 star cops and then get killed by shotgun cop from kilometre away. You can make your own company deliver illegal cargo and get killed by trolling players or just drive around on your car that you wasted 1 million dollars on. Though there aren't alot ways to grind money on freemode it's still fun sandbox to mess around. Other Modes Races are fun but they repeat themself too much. Survival is easy way to improve shooting and to waste ammo. San Andreas Flight School is good way to improve your flying and getting And other modes are decent but cash from them are so low that they're worth even trying.Okay pros are over. Let's get rooooit into the cons! Cons Heist Setups Heist setups are easy way to waste time. In Payday 2 you jump right into action because Bain (aka Payday's Lester) setups everything for you. Medic bags ammo bags keycards and spotters. What does (Creepy Uncle) Lester aka hacker that talks too much do? Absolutely f*cking nothing! You have to do everything by yourself and 3 other crew members that might disconnect anytime so you can waste time and see ""Mission Failed"" screen. Setups are mostly drive to some location kill some bad guys steal something from them lose cops and deliver that something you stole. Some of them are easy like every Fleeca Job's setup or that one where you have to take pictures but setups like Deliver EMP (isn't hard if your team communicates but if not you're screwed) Steal Truck from SWAT in Pacific Standard or every 5 setups in Series A just to see that heist feeled like those missions with 15k prize money are disappointing and annoying. Also why we have to hack our way in to Fleeca Bank while we could just rush through loud? Performance If someone says GTAV is optimized I could laugh my a*s off. It isn't. I don't have high end PC or anything like that in fact I run NVidia Geforce GTX 750 and Intel Core i5 4460 3.2 GHz with 8 GB RAM but I run most games really smoothly. CSGO maxed over 150fps Payday 2 with mods High 60fps Overwatch Medium High 60fps and even Battlefield 4 Medium 60fps on Siege of Shanghai. But why I keep getting frame drops on worst possible situations possible for example Pacific Standard's bike escape? First 1 2 hours I run game Medium 60fps no frame drops very smoothly with VSync on. Then frame drops came and were none stop even once crashed my game. This is very bad because it looks like I teleport on the map and for me game stutters and freezes. Making game run Direct10 and lowering NVidia Control Panels 3D Settings helped bit but I still keep getting these even without VSync on. I readed some posts online and I found out this isn't my pc fault and actually someone with GTX 970 had same problem. It should be internet either because I use 4G Internet Connection without problems. Trolls People that kill you while moving cargo and then destroy cargo are annoying. Or people that keep killing you all over again because they can. It's funny if it's friend but if not it's not funny.There are more that I would list but you already understand what I mean. Grand Theft Auto V is great game that I fun with friends qhen you play Online. There are alot stuff to do and you won't get bored soon. But if you don't have friends and aren't interested of Story Mode don't buy it. Go play Saints Row instead for story or Payday 2 for online and heists.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-24,0,0,1237,False,Not Recommended,The game's story mode is one of the most fun I've ever played. As for online it USED to be an amazing experience when it first came out. Constant races heists and the money you got from these could easily purchase supercars in the past. My only pet peeve with this game is the shark cards have not kept up with inflation. If you went to get the $100 shark card ($8 000 000 in game) you could purchase 6 8 supercars/aircrafts/etc. Now a days a supercar can cost damn near 6 million. No one supercar and a little bike is worth $100. I've stopped playing this game.

2015-04-14,2,6,273,False,Recommended,I ve just started playing this game and I am rather impressed so far this game eats ram and I would suggest closing as much as you can before playing. The missions so far are detailed and the environment is beautiful it really everything you could want from a game that wears the label of GTA. It is the second GTA San Andreas which is a game I love and one that has inspired my interest in technology &amp computing. Rockstar did a better job with the GTA 5 pc port than GTA IV. Rockstar learned their lesson well and produced something beautiful I hope one day I can create something like GTA 5 something different but equally if not more beautiful. In summary this game is good and it would be a unlikely that rockstar would be able to push the wall any further even assuming computer power grows. Some elements could be added to the game but I feel that the choices made on the game where the right ones. I am not one to give 10 ratings but in the case of GTA 5 there are few improvements that could possibly be made to this game. 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

While no game can truely live up to it all this game certainly comes close. The Single Player sorry 'Story Mode' is what you'd expect from a GTA game these days long fun and somewhat captivating. There's some silly moments in it (not quite San Andreas level but pretty close) that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes.While I haven't even came close to completing the game at the time of this 'review' I still feel the game was worth the 39.99 I payed.Now GTA Online Oh boy...It's hard to explain or even define but there's something about Online that makes it addictive. Much like your Skyrims you're constantly wanting to get better stuff. Be that cars boats helicopters jets weapons or clothes you're always after something new.Yes there are ""lobbies"" with much higher level players in there ""destroying"" us newer players but they're not that frequent. Even when in one you'll have some enjoyment getting your revenge (or go into ""Passive Mode"").While I brought the game for the 'Story Mode' I'm finding myself focusing more on the Online play.There's some issues with lobbies randomly being ""emptied"" (in short you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the Rockstar Servers claiming your rig or connection can't handle the current lobby) but you can still join ""Jobs"" with others no problem.In short I'd highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone.It's great fun has humour and is excellent value for money.",Grand Theft Auto V

Unfortunately GTA Online is all wrapped up into the same files. Only a few weeks post release and evidence abounds of thousands of players getting banned for using the new generation of mod content for single player. People getting banned for using a simple Field of View MOD is totally uncalled for. Not supporting the honest efforts of the mod community disgusting. I really want to recommend this game but honestly it will not be fun without mod support. Stick to GTA IV if you enjoy the PC advantage of mod fun.PROS Beautiful game.

No use the money for another Steam game that you can mod.Besides Beamng.drive's physics are 100x better seriously this game has nothing on it other than some story (which was good) guns and random AI traffic you don't have to self program.If you just like crashing about and making a wreck of things play Beamng.drive as the physics in GTAV are laughable at best in comparison.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-30,0,0,487,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto VSingle Player And General OverviewI have been a GTA fan since the very beginning. Unlike most GTA ""Fans"" coming to GTA V my favourite game in the series was GTA IV not SA. I loved GTA IV and fully 100 percented it and probably put in nearly 300 hours on a single player game without ever modding it I loved it that much. When I first heard about GTA V I was excited to say the least. Excited but skeptical skeptical that they wouldent be able to better IV especially when I learned about the three character story and character changing. Waiting for the PC (superior) release seemed like an eternity. But when it finally came I was blown away. The game is visualy beautiful the world is more alive than the previous versions. The story and the characters were fantastic. The gunplay and first person mode is great it gives a new feeling to a game we are all familiar with. As with GTAIV I will be fully 100 percenting this game as I feel it deserves it. Their are aspects of the game that were definetley better in IV in my opionion. I feel IV &amp V are both masterpieces.Well Done Rockstar whats next?MultiplayerGTA Online COULD be one of the best multiplayer games out there could.The range of activities and the heists are fantastic. Daily challenges random pop up challenges all the diffrent events fantastic.Throw some friends into the equasion and you have even more fun on heists etc.The problem with online the crippling hideous and depressing problem with Online is the Hackers &amp The Modders.Dont get me wrong as a PC gamer we have the power to mod games but Rockstar should have a choice in servers. One for people who want to play vanilla and one for the Modders. ""No Mr modder I dont want you to spawn me any vehicle or money as I like to complete a game with skill and feel achievement for what I have done""The hackers jesus christ! Casualy cruising down the road and suddenley ""EXPLOSION"" oh great I'm dead oh the whole server is dead and now its raining cargo planes and tanks! Oh and I'm dead again!The commuinty is odd. Its 80% bad in honesty. Hackers and modders justifying what they are doing and even legit games begging modders for money then praising the modders! Shows the calibre of gamer when they accept cheaters in a game as they can profit from it. Pathetic!I respect Rockstar as a company keeping the game up to date and giving us free DLC and Additions (I'm looking at you EA &amp Ubisoft)But cmon guys please sort out the hackers at least! Its hard to get excited about a game when you cant play online without the fear of them messing up your game.

2015-06-12,2,6,4542,False,Not Recommended,Compared to its predecessor GTA IV V to me is a let down in terms of mediocre vehicle mechanics and damage modelling. The physics engine is quite bad compared to Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption those which used the same RAGE engine. If GTA V is still selling up to date it is because the Online portion is constantly getting updated bringing new content and game modes keeping the community alive. The game is fun to play with friends they are the ones make it fun and enjoyable.To speak for the story I only advanced till %18 and I found each mission boring and dull. I am a big fan of Grand Theft Auto series since the 1997 GTA V to me feels very dumb fun and GTA was never meant to be that way if you take a look at the previous titles. The humor is still there but it tells an engaging story it always had for each title. That was not the case with V. I'll pass on story and carry on playing Online until Rockstar stops pushing updates which I reckon will be after the release of Red Dead Redemption 2. Looking forward to the next installment hoping that Rockstar is working on a better project. P.S Creating specific sessions (invite only friends only etc) and connecting to online is an hassle. Did I even mention hackers? Rockstar makes great games but they cannot administrate their online portion.GTA IV ile V'i kıyaslayınca hikaye bakımından yerlerde sürünüyor oyun. Nefret ettiğim araç mekaniklerini ve vasat hasar modellemelerini saymıyorum bile. Rezalet bir fizik motoru Max Payne 3 ve Red Dead Redemption'dan sonra. GTA V sırf bugün hala online özelliği sayesinde yaşayan bir oyun. Yoksa çoktan ölmüştü. Ben de aldım ve hikaye modunu %18'de bıraktım. (Trevor'ın ilk açıldığı görev Johnny'yi öldürdüğü) Bıraktıktan sonra online geçtim. Hemen her gün online oynuyorum. Hikayesi ilerlediğim yere kadar hiç mi hiç sarmadı. Görevler eğlenceli ancak boş. Bir görevi tamamladıktan sonra GTA oynadığımı hissettirmedi oyun bana. '97 tarihinden beri GTA oynarım V GTA tarihinde oynadığım en kötü seri. Aylardır düzeltilmeyen ERR_GFX_D3D_INIT hatası ve ''Alert Your save data could not be loaded from the Rockstar cloud servers at this time. Returning to Grand Theft Auto V.'' hatasını saymıyorum bile. Bu oyun yarı fiyatından daha ucuza satılmadan almayın. Paranızı hak eden bir oyun değil. Rockstar zaten artık hiç bir şeyi hak eden bir firma değil. Hala beta sürümünde anasını sattığımın oyunu. PC'ye geliyor dediler ballandıra ballandıra trailer yayınladılar ettiler elimizde tamamlanmamış bir ürün var amk. Bu eksiklikleri bir yıl sonra filan anca tamamlanır herhalde.

Fairly good story only a few bad missions a lot of stuff to do in between and endless hours of fun. Around the time of GTA IV the internet became a place where gaming and player made content were starting to meet and one of the best things we saw was the introduction of Single player modding in the form of LSPDFR.Rockstar since then has Favored microtransactions rather than developing new content. Refused to actually deal with the hackers and instead blamed the modding community for their inability to prevent people from corrupting the multiplayer area (reason why I stopped playing) despite the fact that most if not all modding goes to Single player.Rockstar USE to have a great game.

Your buddies account of 4 years just got wiped for him playing in a public session... New missions can only be carried out in online public sessions. Is it worth risking loosing everything?This game has taken a sad downturn the new updates are hopelessly overpriced and the threat of being effected by a hacker is not worth the punishment.

The story is great the characters are all interesting in their own ways and the character swapping mechanic is used in some interesting ways both the main missions and the assortment of side missions are a lot of fun and there's plenty of things to do in Los Santos more than enough to last at least 60+ hours without even touching online. The game even has hot swapping gamepad/keyboard support so if you want to walk and shoot with a mouse and keyboard but drive or fly with a gamepad all you have to do is plug in your pad and just use it when you get into a vehicle it even toggles the vibration on and off automatically when you switch between controllers. The PC port is pretty great overall and there are a lot of mods out there.But what really surprised me was how good the newly added first person view mode was which lets you play the whole thing in first person. They really went the whole nine yards for it it has iron sights for the guns vehicles have detailed interiors and characters in the car animate more than you would normally expect for a primarily third person game etc. I played the whole game in first person and I'd very highly recommend trying it because I think it really helps show off just how much detail Rockstar stuffed into this game's open world. Driving in first person makes much more of a difference than you might initially expect encouraging you to drive more like you would in real life and adding that little extra bit of immersion in. Playing the game like this changed it to the point that I don't know if I'd be able to go back if they remove the feature in the next game because of how well implemented it was here.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-25,0,0,121,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online is real terrible and badly designed. They could have done so much but they did so little. And for what they did they made a lot of real dumb balancing decisions. It's unplayable and boring. Everyone just rushes the armored Kurama car and rolls with it extensivelly. Yes good idea. A game entirely about shooting things put into it a fast and manuverable car that's immune to bullets but allows the people inside to shoot outside paradoxically. Without fear of retaliation. You dumb dumbs. Transforms any PvE elements into a yawn fest and PvP into Rocket Launchers All the Time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-28,0,0,517,False,Not Recommended,Never. Buy a console because that will save you the pain and frustration of dealing with modding and hacking online. I one day got so sick nd tired of reproting players and submitting video to rockstar I just join millions of random lobbies just to see how many I could join and enjoy. My tally went from 1 to 278 in 6 days. 278 lobbies I joined and tried to play on but couldn't because it was either A being destroyed by modders giving cash freezing players and spamming objects till people were forced to leave or their game would crash under all the load Or B Filled with children 13 years and under Or C filled with modders killing people blowing people up and using godmode and aimbot and saying it wasn't them and it wasn't hack. The game is so unplayable on pc The only way I could enjoy it is to find players who weren't modding and go to a Privet session. With how much I tried I could get maybe a total of 7 players in a single privet lobby before someone had to go to work or go to bed.Match making is horrible. theres no one doing anything else but hiests (If playing the missions at all...).If I want to play a mission I do it alone or suffer through it while everyone else teleports about and kills every thing that moves breaths or lights up. If I wanted to play a game with this many hackers I might go back to GTA4 or 3 Or just join old modern warfare games. Also I have tried modding online too. Not for money exploits Not to teleport about the map not to give friends money not to do anything but no collide and godmode so I didn't have to deal with hackers. Now hacking online has gone so far as to teleporting players godmoding other players framing players by killing whole lobbies in their name passive mode or not. Virtually I have given up on this game and if you plan on buying it GTA V Online is almost broken and storymode has been done by myself enough times that if I played through it again I would start ramming rusty nails into my forehead everythime I had to do another story mission or side mission other than exploring los santos. My rating? 2 out of 10Date is 1/28/16 All madders appear to be banned and I too also am banned by asociation. Also out of 15 lobbies I joined today Not a single one consited of people who werent constantly killing you for no ing reason. The community is so hostile I couldn't even do a mission without people joining and destroying everything. Right off the bat I've joined everything from gamemodes consiting of coop DM and normal vs mission to plain free mode and the enviroment of players is so hostile I couldn't even record or go about my business without going passive or just plain joining in the madness. Over the past 4 months I stopped playing GTAV online to go to work and make actualy use of my time I have had low blood pressure less grey hairs and my phyciatrist said I had changed. and NOW I literally feel like I'm going to rip 23 Select few players ing head off.PS4 PS3 XBOX 360 XBOX ONE PC STEAM PC R* launcher I have played on them all and while Others use everything different Console gaming is the most chill I've ever faced compared to PC. If you really want to enjoy the extents of this game Again as mentioned before Buy a console because PC servers are completely screwed by s and badsports. I have long videos of Horrible experiences on my youtube channel I'm currently building and it will be quite clear the actual state of the community.UPDATE 4/15/2018 So I haven't been online since the fall of OpenIV and to be honest those were the good days. For a breif time No one was modding at all. But I quit enirely a month after the modders came back. I haven't played since. But Five M was introduced to me. I played that on and off every other week when I got REALLY bored. Today marks the day I played online for the last time ever. Maybe when gtaVI comes out I may buy it. Not full price of course Wait for a steam sale or some other Sh*t. I purchased a copy of GTAV for windows and the first Lobby I join I am level 2 and go t pose an assorted number of object spawn on me and start rotating. the modder teleports to me and claims he can recover my account with millions if I paid him 15 dollars on paypal. I told him he was the reason we couldn't have nice things and to go away. So he crashed my game. From then on I played solo sessions doing only Meth'd up because thats the only mission I can play because I am so low level. I join into a lobby unaware there are others to buy ammo and snacks and get killed by someone in a 3.6b$ hovering tic tac diq P*ssy mobile. I told him he couldn't kill me on foot so he had his modder friend T pose me and spam money on me while he repeatedly killed me 5 times before smarting off and saying I was terrible and I sucked at the game. Kinda hard to fight back against a big headed when your being frozen. I got 5 million in my account now and shortly after he crashed my game. When I log back online right after I am greeted with a black screen saying I have been suspended for 2 weeks for suspected Cheating. Just Get FiveM or a console. This is the only way you will ever enjoy the game. However if your one of the s who mods and gets others banned I hope you burn in hell.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,Modding is a fundamental feature of almost all PC games and is partly the reason why I bought this game in the first place. Now that it has been made 'illegal' for this game there is much less of a reason to buy it. The story mode is good however the online is very microtransaction heavy and Rockstar's money hungry business practices are very evident with the recent shut down of the OpenIV website. Rockstar if you are not willing to accept that your games are going to be modded don't consider bringing your games to the platform in the first place. Or better yet reverse the damage you've done to the modding community and allow full mod support for all your current and future games. However it's very clear from this move that the call for even more microtransaction money is too strong.You should be ashamed of yourselves Rockstar and Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story thus far is fun and makes sense for the most part.There's plenty to do when not on a mission. You can Free roam anywhere and explore the map via a bike your car cabs helicopters motorcycles planes trains and of course walking. You can also create havoc too by picking fights going on a killing spree and blow things up or mug people and rob stores.As with GTA 4 you've got lots of music to listen to or create your own playlist. There are 3 characters you get to play. Each one is interesting and comes with their strong and weak points. Franklin great driver. Micheal great with weapons and Trevor great pilot. They also have their own missions and story and you're not stuck playing just one of them during the game.Driving with KB/M is better than GTA 4 and can be tuned to your liking.Best place for Mods is right here https //www.gta5 mods.com/misc/most liked.

2015-11-15,0,0,309,False,Not Recommended,I tried my best to give this game a positive review and a thumbs up but the horrible online experience is completely ruining it. (Singleplayer was amazing though honestly. The story and the characters are incredible PC graphics are really cool and there's insane attention to every little thing and details.)Every time I try to play and have fun in a public lobby a hacker will come and mess everything up.For example here's the last time that happened just a few days ago when I tried to get back into GTA Online I buy myself a nice new car from the latest update drive it to Benny's. I get in I get amazed by the insanely high prices on EVERYTHING but whatever it's Rock$tar and it's their biggest cash grab (mind the shark cards) yet so.A hacker warps into the garage spawns a ton of copies of my car. Then ejects me from mine. Gets in it drives away. Gets out warps back into the garage. Spawns a ton of my clones on my head that constantly run and scream I can't even walk around anymore. He then tries to order me to do things like getting in the car (I can barely walk around with all the lag and hacks) all in an annoying disgusting arabic kid's voice. And then he crashes me. And that's only one case of many.Yeah nice. Cool. My money are well spent.Honestly I think GTA V and GTA Online should be sold separately. $40 50 and $20 30 respectively maybe. While one is an excellent product the other is clearly a piece of garbage ruined by its own terrible community and the developer.Please note that GTA O is actually tons of fun if you've got a LOT of friends who also want to play it with you in a private lobby. The problem is not everyone has even a few.There's a ton of mini games fun custom races and missions the 5 heists are better than all of PAYDAY2 (especially since the latter now has terrible microtransactions) the game is constantly updated with bits of new content here and there.The problem is all of this can't hide the fact that the online still sucks. Hackers aren't even the sole problem in this there's actually a lot more. Insane loading times heist leavers and that's only to name a few.P.S.Take Two and Rockstar are pulling some of the shadiest stuff in the modern gamedev industry and are not even slightly ashamed of it.Sending investigators to the doors of modmakers?Increasing the price by bundling your game with useless stuff and not allowing to buy just it alone just before it goes on sale?Yeah all of that is perfectly normal apparently.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-26,1,6,513,False,Not Recommended,This games story is good and actually pretty content filled overall singleplayer is very good but then we reach the terrible money grabbing grind of grand theft auto online. GTA online can be described in forr words It is a grind. In order to have any amount of fun in online you either need to play for 10 hours doing nothing but thier boring unexciting jobs that pay way too little money for the hyper inflated economy that every item and vehicle is based upon so it ends up leaving you in a hard place you either keep on grinding and waste your time or the two easy options and YES you guessed it one of the easy options is (SUPRISE) MICROTRANSACTIONS when you spend your real life money for fake money and for the amount of money you pay you get SO LITTLE ingame cash for example around 60 dollars for 8 000 000 in game so you can purchase and mod about 3 MAYBE 4 cars for the amount of money you already payed to play the game. Option number 2 is modding when you don't want to give the jews of developers more money you choose to mod and end up getting banned (which is almost always permanent and if you linked your steam account you can kiss playing the game EVER again goodbye) keep in mind all because you want to have fun with your friends in online without sinking in 500+ hours into the game or 500+ dollars into shark cards.

2017-04-16,1,6,191,False,Not Recommended,BEFORE ANYONE DOWNVOTES THIS I would just like to say that the GTA V Story Mode was excellent. 5 stars (pun intended). EDIT Take Two (the publishers of this game) made the most moronic decision to ban SINGLE PLAYER mods so unless the online portion of the game has some appeal to you do NOT buy this game. However the only reasons I do not recommend this game are due to the other half of this game GTA Online which is what most people play. If you don't care about playing online with other players then you can ignore this review. Here are the reasons why I wouldn't recommend this game in regards to GTA Online 1) There are modders/hackers everywhere you go whether it ranges from simple unidentifiable aimbotting to completely adding/wiping your in game bank account and ing with your Reputation Points. I had about $2 000 000 in my bank but a modder decided to screw with everyone on the server and lower their RP and money. I had lost all of that money I earned and yes it is permanent (at least until another modder decides to with my stuff). After witnessing that modder take all of my money away I was pretty ing I am not the only that this has happened to there are many other people that have been screwed over by a bunch of dirty modders.Because of this I don't want to see all of the GENUINE players who actually PLAY THE GAME LIKE IT'S MEANT TO BE have all of their hard earned rewards be in the control of numerous sadistic cowardly modders who only live to with other people. Another lesson to be learned from this NEVER BUY SHARK CARDS! Modders can easily drain you of your money so NEVER spend any money on Shark Cards. 2) Rockstar is not doing very much (if anything at all) about the current modders situation. They are very slowly banning them but due to the popular usage of hacks and mods in this game it's not uncommon to find a modder in your session. A large chunk of the GTA Online modders still remain and continue to mess with people by spawning in weapons vehicles teleporting etc.. They completely ruin Freemode Events and many other things.Mods should not even be as popular in the game as they are now. This game has been released over 4 years ago which is a sign that Rockstar is not doing a lot to prevent people from using mods on their servers. 3) There are not very many people in the game at all. There might be around 8 people total in a few sessions but I've gotten into sessions where everyone has left and I'm practically alone. It's not very fun playing alone in GTA Online. I mean why play online when I might as well just play the Story Mode? Sure you can still get Reputation Points and money online but that doesn't mean anything when modders can just instantly take it all away. The other issue with there being fewer people is that you're more likely to get placed into a session with modders and I already shared my story on how my experience with a modder went. 4) You would think that with very few people playing the game nowadays that the servers would be really smooth but they aren't. I was in a 2 man Mercenary Mode match and a lot of my bullets did not register when I shot at the other player. In larger lobbies it can become even worse. I sometimes even lag out of sessions when there are only a few people or even nobody else on. Now I don't want to sound extremely pessimistic about the game it's just the modders in the Online community that ruin it.Here are some positive aspects about the game 1) There is a LOT of content in the game it's one of the most extensive games I have ever seen. You can fly helicopters and planes ride modded (not hacker terms) vehicles motorcycles and boats play different games modes like missions and jobs to get money and other cool stuff buy housing business buildings and even yachts! There is so much more to list but I can't list all of them in one review because there's so much content. (Literally over 60 gigabytes of content.) Plus Rockstar is always pushing out new in game content every once in a while.2) You can team up with your friends and other players by joining or forming your own club/business and working for or with your friends to complete objectives and get more money. If you're a CEO you can have your executive assistant bring over vehicles give you food and etc.. I forget which one you had to be but I believe one of your powers as a CEO (when you become one) is being able to place bounties on people and I LOVE that perk!3) Did I mention that killing civilians is amusing? It's especially hilarious hearing their screams when they burn alive. (I cannot stop laughing at some of the male civilians' screams.) Overall the game has a lot of content and is excellent to play with friends. However I am not recommending this game for now because of the little effort that is made towards stopping modders from ruining the experience for others.EDIT I was just suspended from GTA Online for reasons unknown and now my character stats and inventory are being reset so that really solidifies this negative review. I also just looked this up and people who have never even modded before have been victims of the flawed anti cheat coding of this game. In other words regular people have been suspended AND had their accounts wiped of everything. So... I highly recommend NOT getting this game until Rockstar actually fixes their poorly designed anti cheat software because modders can EASILY make multiple accounts change their IP addresses and still continue playing GTA Online right where they left off and get all of their money and stuff back while players who have ACTUALLY BEEN PLAYING THE GAME AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE are just screwed over by faulty internal anti cheat programming.,Grand Theft Auto V

Edit 28 August 2017 My friend recently had a legit 14 million removed from his account for no reason. He made all this money over the course of 3k hours in the game. Rockstar is killing Grand Theft Auto. Also to note he is very much anti modding. If a modder is in a lobby he would ALT+F4 just to get away regardless of what he has done in the effort to make money. I currently cannot even launch the game due to it crashing during social club... Edit 15 October 2017 This game has become literal feces. I could not even recommend it if Rockstar as to stop their shady business practices. As stated previously only get this cancerous feces of a game if it is on sale for LSPDFR and/or FiveM.

2015-11-11,0,0,745,False,Not Recommended,"Just no. ""Something's Wrong in San Andreas..."" Crap story (In my opinion). I don't even know what to say it's just really bad. Mostly boring characters with very poor development anything involving Trevor The FIB or Merryweather Security comes off like GTA fanfiction. BAD FANFIC. THANK GOD Ken Penders wasn't involved. Horrible Radio music. Worthless idiot DJ's and boring ad's. Self radio lets you play your own music though (without the garbage) but only MP3's. No FLAC or OGG support. Everyone shoots with aimbot accuracy from the military to drunken gangsters holding their guns sideways. it's not unfair since you shoot with aimbot accuracy but it's a LOT more annoying then GTA IV. It's insanely annoying when you are in a car chase and 75% of the bullets being fired at you are hitting you. At least the REGENERATING HEALTH is a big help. Super clunky movement. It's somehow more awkward feeling then GTA IV. At least it looks REALLY good though. There are only 5 stars in the wanted system now despite the military being in the game. Wonky weird driving. It's like every car comes from a different game. It's not bad but far less ""drifty"" then GTA IV. You might like that certainly. But all of the cars still top out at 90 140 MPH. WTF? It's not even that logical either most normal cars top out at 100 ish but some sports cars go less then that. While a box van (Rumpo) and Pickup (Rebel) top out at about 110. Also super cars apparently max out at 140MPH(ish) even with $150 000 in upgrades. It's an absolute crapshoot if the game will run decently. Most of my perfomance problems went away after I started running the game at a HIGHER resolution. What in the actual f*ck? Cheaters still run Rampant online. (This is good if you like people shooting money at you or exploding you a lot) Terrible online Servers (Have ""fun"" failing to connect to matches and then being dumped in a random server) Terrible TERRIBLE DRM (No signing in without an internet connection it f*cks up for no apparent reason and forces you to change your password 3 times in a row the last steam update broke the launcher LMAO) Insanely overinflated prices for things in GTA Online ($25 000 for a Owl mask?) They also reduced the amount of money you get in Contact missions as well. Yay? Wait there are microtransactions? For money in multiplayer? When I have to go out of my way to avoid cheaters ""gifting"" me millions of dollors? Hahahaha! That's pathetic! GTA Online kinda sucks overall it's way less fun then GTA IV's MP. And the free roam is abyssmal. No choice of PVP or PVE lobbies it just throws you in with random people (without turning on the ""Passive mode"" either!) and hopes you will create fun on you own forgetting that most people online are so stupid they try to teamkill you IN GAMES WHERE FRIENDLY FIRE IS DISABLED. Just expect people to shoot at you on sight. In short the game is ok but there are an enormous amount of deal breakers and many stupid design choises. I shouldn't need to mention the drama that rockstar keeps causing you can see the other rewiews.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-17,0,0,42,False,Recommended,If you enjoy this review please consider following my Curator page here . After a nearly 2 year wait I can confidently say that Grand Theft Auto V was worth the wait. This game ups the ante in every way possible and has the unbelievable polish that you would expect from a Rockstar game. I would say that GTA V is easily the best in the series and does everything better than the previous iterations with the exception of music and setting with Vice City.The gunplay in GTA has never been very mechanically sound before but V provides enough control options to make it very competent in this department. The driving is also easily the best the series. In previous games it always felt like you were driving on ice but this game gets driving right and makes it not just palatable but fun as well. The story is also a standout to me. I really enjoyed the mission variety and feel like the developers spiced it up more than in previous games. The three character switch mechanic is very well implemented letting you choose who you want to be on the fly. I felt that narratively this was the most cohesive entry in the series as well.As far as optimization goes I found it to be pretty good but not amazing. I played the game at 1440p with a 970 on mostly high and some ultra settings. I did find shadows to be very subpar as well as a fair amount on aliasing. That said it's amazing that they made an open world game this detailed and vibrant.This is an easy recommendation for me. Everyone knows what GTA is at this point and this entry has perfected that formula.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-24,0,0,125,False,Recommended,Everyone knows the Grand Theft Auto series and the basics behind the game play so I'll skip that bit.What I will say is that this is by far the best of a game franchise that I've already been a massive fan of for years. Instead of playing as one individual you play as three that you can (for the most part) swap between at will. Each character has their own skills (which you can improve through use) and their own unique special skill. For example one of the characters is extremely good at driving and therefor when his unique ability is used it allows him to slow time and pull of incredible stunts while in a vehicle.The first person view is also an exciting addition while using this the game actually takes on the full experience of a FPS gun sights and all. Though this wasn't a feature that I personally felt was needed once I actually started playing with it I realized that it was a lot of fun and the developers did not skimp out on making it a well rounded and entertaining experience.On a final note I very much enjoyed the story of the game. It had its twists and turns and I actually felt very much in tune with the main characters. Several times I got pumped up in real life as if I were actually there robbing a bank or pulling off some other incredible stunt.I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys the Grand Theft Auto series and what that means. You might want to avoid it if you're ten years old unless you have some kind of an early warning system for when your parents are coming.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-11-28,4,37,1199,False,Recommended,You'll be hard pressed to find a game as detailed and nuanced as GTA V. I've played since June 2017 so I can't attest to how the game has changed over the years. However from the time I've spent I can say that GTA V is most definitely a worthwhile purchase whether it's on sale or not. I've spent the vast majority of time in Online so that's what this review will be focussed on. Pros Insane levels of customisation be it cars planes or your character. You could change the windows/wheels/interior of a car have endless clothing combinations together with mask/hair/tattoo/accessory options.Wide variety of weapons from RPGs and Miniguns to Broken Bottles and Flashlights.EVERY WEEK R* has in game sales for basically anything you can own making it more affordable for newer players.The range of activities/missions you can do in freeroam is again endless. Not only that you have access to a number of maps for TDMs races and R* own special game modes.Players are able to own businesses both passive and active helping to boost daily income. Plus who doesn't want to be a car exporting druglord? And of course the detail... not just the scenery of Los Santos and Blaine County but also NPC actions and speech which are pretty darn realistic.DLC. R* is still regularly introducing a lot of new content in the form of large updates a few times a year which is quite respectable considering the fact that the game has been out for several years now. Also all DLC is free *cough*EA*cough* Cons Of course the major problem GTA Online has is the rampant modding/hacking which not only screws with others' gameplay but risks them getting banned for spending illegitimate funds. Unfortunately there's no way to stop these modders apart from reporting but there are ways to minimise the risks of having modders in your lobby.Griefing. With all the weaponised vehicles in the game it's not difficult for some to destroy important sale missions or just repeatedly kill newer players. My advice to avoiding griefers if you're new is to find an organised crew where members will readily escort or provide backup.Shark Cards. Although it's true R* has recently been getting greedy with Shark Card sales by pricing new vehicles pretty highly which encourages one to buy some GTA$ it's completely do able through grinding which doesn't take long if you do the right thing efficiently although that may not be everyone's thing.Because of R* using a peer to peer connection instead of having a dedicated server some like me who have not so great internet connections will find that dropping out of a session can happen fairly often. Not much you can do to get around this but if you have a good internet connection dropping from a session will likely be very rare.Loading times. Can be lenthy depending on your connection speed but you can speed it up by entering Story Mode first before joining on someone in your friendslist to get online.All in all GTA V does have it's flaws but there are ways to minimise said flaws. Besides in my opinion all the things that make the game great still outweigh the problems that plague it. Pick it up on a sale if you're still unsure. If GTA Online doesn't suit you the singleplayer is still worth getting the game for.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-28,4,18,1209,False,Recommended,"I recommend this game but only to a certain degree it's more like thumb sideways and here's why Singleplayer is probably where you will get your money's worth. It's fairly entertaining through out the whole game depending on your personal tastes and there is enough content to keep you occupied for at least 100 hours (if you are a completionist type). Admittedly the story is kinda mediocre and isn't going to blow you away with it's storytelling or big twists but the gameplay is fun and almost perfect for the first time in GTA series although previous titles had better story and atmosphere. There is also Rockstar Editor for the creative types to make interesting videos and enough mods around to keep the game relevant way past it's life cycle. Just remember to revert your game back to vanilla before going to multiplayer because mods tend to be flagged as cheats and can get you banned so beware.Now multiplayer is whole different beast. First and foremost it is very time consuming in the sense that everything will take a while to achieve. You can still have a lot of fun doing all sorts of jobs and activities with friends while being a low level with no money but you will be at a disadvantage at every corner. You need to level up to be more competent in missions to earn more money to buy stuff which is unlocked by being a high level and screwing around in free mode won't get you far. You have to literally work for your level and money which may sound discouraging for some people with little time on their hands.For that case you can buy Shark Cards in game money paid with real money micro transactions if you will. You don't have to buy them (I certainly never did) but if earning money the usual way is a grind for you then there's this. Shark Cards are also the reason for the countless free updates as well as the reason why they abandoned singleplayer for good. Heists are the biggest money makers but doing them as a low level is a sure way to fail a lot and annoy your teammates. Personally I do not recommend tackling them before reaching level 50.And of course there are hackers. Every game has them but GTA 5 has quite a few of them thanks to the shoddy network infrastructure. You see this game uses ""Peer to Peer"" connection meaning technically there are no servers in a lobby everyone connects to everyone. This makes for absurdly long loading times for connecting to public lobbies and transforms PvP into a chore where depending on your opponents connection it almost seems like a drop of a dice decides whether or not your shots will actually register.So with no actual servers to run checks on people to know who's hacking hackers are running rampant thanks to the netcode. That could be fixed with dedicated servers but the last modding team that tried to mod that into GTA 5 got their SC accounts permabanned so yeah... And Rockstar's own methods to remedy that by screwing with the code have instead caused a 10% 20% decrease in performance for a lot of people. The game may never run as smooth as it did on launch day (Hacking got better these days but still my advice for now is to avoid public lobbies and just stick with your friends in private lobbies instead. You'll also get the added bonus of faster loading times in private sessions DBottom line / TL DR If you're a single player person then this game has you covered with fun gameplay but with a so so story while multiplayer although fun at times requires from you a lot of time and a lot of patience to put up the bull s**t it often throws at you.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,1,4,511,False,Not Recommended,So when I got the game on PC it took me well over 8 tries to get it working. Already not a good sign. After a while the prologue mission started. After changing some of the graphics settings the game ran at a really smooth FPS rate. Not much later I started getting massive FPS rate issues. There was not a second where the FPS rate was stable. At all. And this is an effect from one of the game's updates. I'm a little confused. Shouldn't updates fix issues? I'm certain that the update fixed some Online issues but the FPS rate and consistency is unreal. Changing the graphcs settings doesn't fix anything. Now I've bought the game 3 times on PS3 on PS4 and on PC. When going from platform to platform I was expecting more than what the previous version had. Was there more? Yes and no. Yes there is exclusive content and features with the newer version of the game. But to me it's not enough.I was really hoping for some expansion to the single player mode and it's story. While GTA V's story did have enough to keep me going until I beat the game the story felt a little short and boring. Don't get me wrong the game does have some more mission variety this time around. But the story could have used some more. I occasionally found myself bored with the story. Some of the characters were there for a cutscene and maybe a couple missions. And that's it. And with most of the story characters they just aren't interesting to me. The game does have memorable moments but they are very few.In terms of gameplay it's pretty good until you look deep into it. The guns can be fun to use and cars are fairly easy for beginners to use. But it's not all good. At times the guns feel so bland. They all have incorrect fire rates and they are not in sync with their respective firing sounds. Some guns have way too much accuracy. There is very little bullet spread. There are times where the cars in the game are just not fun to drive. Fully upgrading the fastest super cars in the game makes only small differences in terms of performance. Cars are limited to a really low speed. Even when fully upgraded. Most of the cars feel the same. They don't feel special or unique. There's really no special characteristics that vary from car to car. And don't get me started on aircraft. The fact that a huge commercial jet can recover from a stall with so much ease just annoys me.And the Online feature isn't that special anymore. I've been playing it since it came out back in 1 October 2013. And I still play the game. It honestly is just boring now. The fact that the rank cap is at 8 000 and the highest rank rewards unlocks at rank 135 is just confusing. The much awaited heists were cool at first but now they're just annoying. If one member of the crew is down you have to start all over. Unlike the regular missions where you can continue despite you losing your teammates. The fact that I can do a mission that involves busting a drug deal taking down professionals shooting down a plane and delivering a load of drugs to a cartel leader all by myself but I can't break a safe take out stacks of $100 bills and drive a motorcycle to a boat on my own continues to anger me. And the way mods are being handled is terrible. A mod to change the FOV slider can get you a ban. I don't see how that can harm the game. Graphics mods that make the game look prettier? Ban. Mod that lets you change the helmet you put on when on a bike? Ban. Changing the weather in the game with a mod? Ban. A mod that makes you ragdoll and fall helplessly to the floor? Ban. A mod that adds a speedometer on the side of the screen? Ban. You see where I'm getting with this? Mods that don't harm the game grant you a ban. It's ridiculous. And the glitches where players can clip through walls lose no health etc. are still present. Server issues are everywhere. Online has more priority over single player and Online is abysmal. Apart from a few exclusive things like cars and the video editor this was not worth $60. It's more or less the exact same as the other versions of GTA V and the fact that mod support and mod control is terrible I can't say much to recommend GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-20,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,If you are buying this for the single player I'd say go ahead and do it because the story mode is just fine. However the multiplayer portion is where this game takes a nosedive. Yes heists and some missions are fun if you have a group of friends to play them with and I probably will continue to do those missions but the free roam is infected with script kiddies who think it's hilarious to blow everyone up in the server make themselves invincible and cheat in challenges. I bought this game a few days after it came out on the PC and after about a week I stopped playing because I was bored of being killed constantly by cheaters and sitting in loading screen for way too long. When they released the Executives and Criminals updates my friends and I decided to play online again and I was hopeful that those problems from the launch had been fixed but to my disappointment they had only gotten worse. I haven't been in a session yet without cheaters in it and it defeats the fun of the new VIP missions because it's impossible to get to your objective when an invincible chrome plated helicopter kills you until the mission timer is up. I can't think of another game with this bad of a cheater problem and I'm sorely disappointed that one of the selling points of this game is rendered unplayable because Rockstar can't get its act together to stop the tampering in the game.This will be my last purchase of a GTA game if this problem is not fixed.,Grand Theft Auto V

I finished my PHD thesis while waiting to enter online mode re linking with my friends watching clouds. online experience is crap.

Now GTA V... well it didn't dissapoint ONE BIT quite frankly now i own it on the PS4 as well so yeah... the game is marvelous the characters are well written the story is amazing and the ""character switching"" is well amazing.But enough about all that since well like me most of you watched the YouTube videos before PC launch.Now the game on PC runs VERY SMOOTH (compared to GTA IV when it launched) so that was simply a joy to feel watch and enjoy. The 60fps the first person well the graphics everything so far... is amazing to be honest.To sum it up... I gave into the hype and I got swallowed whole and I can admit... this game has not dissapointed.I mean come on... the detail that Rockstar has put into this... blows my mind drive your car through Los Santos park it in your garage and listen to the engine cool off sizzle or hell even the AC cool off depending on what type of car you drove. Things like that... simply are amazing and what make a game enjoyable.

D i Remember that in GTA 4 was fun. No increase in body mass when gaining strength or for that part the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional ( (Think of San Andreas then you know what i mean)GTA Online Not enough houses to purchase (High End with heist rooms) i mean come ON we wanna be neighbours to the Playboy Mansion ) Stock Market disabled ( (Kinda hope to see that back / activated) No increase in body mass when gaining strength or for that part the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional ( (Think of San Andreas then you know what i mean) The heists are fun but loose re play value once you do the Elite Challenges i hope to see more Heists either in Patch or DLC form. No animals (well then again think they got removed to reduce lag etc. but still could be fun to go hunting with RPG's P )And honestly thats about it... its a honest review with my own point of view... and ill say this... i will STILL give this a 10/10 why... simply because the game delivers to the hype it recieved... no questions about it.My Gaming/Work Rig CPU Intel i7 4770k clocked to 4.5GhzMotherboard Asus ROG Maximus Hero VIIRam 32GB DDR3 Kingston Beast 2400mhz RamHarddrives 2x 256 Samsung SSD+ 2x 500GB Samsung SSD + 2TB 7200RPM External StorageGraphics Card Asus Nvidia Titan 6GBMonitor 2x Asus VG278HE 144hz Monitor",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-07,0,0,197,False,Recommended,This game is good in its own way. There's some stuff that I really hate it's the loading screen when entering the multiplayer. You see I think I've spend more time in the loading than actually playing it and earn some money from the heist. But I like the game I played the hell out of it on XBOX 360. (I didn't get it on launch though I bought it when it was on sale.) The online experience may differ from one another.The key features that I want to talk about Story The Story is interesting. I love playing it there's this feeling that I get when playing it. The feeling is like when you first started playing a really awesome story based game and you want to know what's going to happen next. Also the illusion that's the game story is long and there's a lot to cover. It kind of have that feeling if you get what I mean. Gameplay I like the overall gameplay of this game but I kind of don't love that fact that there's a like a delay when using a controller for walking and looking around and stuff. I love driving cars around the Los Santos in both multiplayer and singleplayer. Online The online is amazing if you have friends to play with otherwise it's going to get boring at some point. But of course there'll be some people that really like the game can play alone and still enjoying it. I'm not that kind of a person. I love playing the game and all but you see I love co op. Of course you can find friends online and not just some of your mate that you know well. But I'm not really that great at talking with other people. There are some hacker that I've met and don't really care. I mean as long as it doesn't involved me it doesn't matter. A lot of people wants money and I do to but at the same time I don't even thoug I'm really poor in the game right now. I tried to do a lot of heist but there's too much of a problem because it's with strangers and it's better with friends. Performance When the game first came out it have a great performance already. I can totally run it at 60fps on almost maxed out with a Geforce GTX 780. But it gets even better when they're giving out more updates. I'll give this game 8.5/10That's just the number I just pulled out of my head.

It's just like the old SAMP or MTA (From GTA San Andreas) used to be with a lot of new stuff new missions etc.EDIT Fun fact MTA/SAMP's connection was so much better than GTA online's.But I just can't enjoy it. This gamemode has way too many issues with connection. I get problems 7/10 times I try to join a friend and get randomly kicked to empty rooms.No it is not my internet speed. I have 40MB and can download up to 4MB/s. I can play any game without a single issue. I tried to enjoy it I tried to look at the good side but there were just too many issues and problems connecting that I give up.Plus you get to spend the 15% of your time playing (depending on how much you play. In my case it's the 60%) watching the loading screen which by the way is a MUST for anything. Finished a mission? Loading. Wanna join a friend? Loading.

Most open world games do not feature first person mode and I always found myself thinking ""This would be so cool in first person!"" no matter whether I was playing Saints Row GTA Just Cause 2 or Sleeping Dogs. GTA V granted my wish. Just driving around Los Santos in first person is incredible. You will drive by people who are engaged in conversation marvel at the detail of cockpits dashboards and guns in first person enjoy the radio and have fun speeding down the highway with great controls and plenty of sightseeing. Do you want to do missions? Have fun. Do you want to just rob banks or try your luck in the club? Go ahead! You can do so much and it feels like you are walking around an actual city. You can fly planes as well (except getting into a plane gives you heat) spiralling across the sky looking at all the lights during the night and generally having a fantastic time.

2015-10-30,0,0,2288,False,Recommended,great game overall however i only play online because i have played the story mode on ps3. my problem with this game is the modders in online the problem was solved for a while but after the most recent update it's back i can't join a single session without everybody in the session exploding. the modders are also able to crash players game now i have had that with a couple of my friends while playing online. Modding(hacking) seems to be super easy so the most annoying ten year old can do it. I would still recommend this game though if you have the hardware to handle it at least there is A LOT of good stuff in here and there are so many free updates wich add a lot more content into the game like cars weapons clothes masks and other stuff. The heists the missions the deathmatches even the races have their charm. The story made is ing great i loved every part of it(expept for that towing minigame). but i do think that online is were it's and it's so great when it works but rockstar really needs to put their efforts in getting rid of the modders in game it breakes online.hope this was a usefull review,Grand Theft Auto V

With no way to get unbanned all progress lost and all money invested also lost. If you get banned you should be refunded the amount you spent on the cash cards. Especially when its not human controlled whether you get banned or not. Unlikely to ever be fixed since rockstar cant reach the computers due to all the money in the way that they ripped off innocent consumers.

Just don't do it Its not Worth it. It's like Eating a JAwbreaker its fun after a couple of Licks but then its a Taste Sore and you don't want it anymore so please.. Don't buy it. Update Ever since the new Update Modders are officially now a Thing of the Past the cunning stunts DLC is a nice hit to the Game and the Game is quite enjoyable again. Its very very rare to find a modder now and days which is a good thing. So for some reason you are somebody in 2016 who wants GTA5 and hadn't got it yet. Sure you can buy it now Its safe ( modding and Hacking wise) I've just went back to making a new character again so that means I'm starting back from scratch To survive in this game from Other players I reccomend buying the Horning Luncher Marksmith sniper rifle (if you are good with it) and some Automactic gun like a Micro or something. These can help you out for Small distances Long ranges and Short Ranges. You also need to learn how to dodge and Manuver in a car because since your a low rank you can't have armor or Bulletproof tires. So in conclusion would I reccomend this game again? Yes Update I don't play online anymore I just play single player with mods Just treat this as Skyrim with guns if you go this route otherwise...

Do not buy this crap if its not on a deep sale.Sure the game is fun but I already played it all two years ago when it came out on 360 nothing has changed since then and the developers are still bags.Sure Director mode is fun but not really worth the $60 price tag.They also struck down the FiveM mulitplayer alternativeGTA V is the last Rockstar game I buy ever.Sure there will be those times Red Dead Redeption 2 or GTA VI will look interesting but I won't support this anti community content driven t.Rockstar either needs to calm the down or learn that when you support your community people will side with you and buy your not the other way around.GTA Online is still MASSIVLY broken with hackers and script kiddies running rampant in 95% of the sessions that I join.I know it's their game and property they created but to take down an improvement upon something they obviously don't support that well anyway? Do they think they are doing someone a favor other than stroking their own ego hoping that one idiot that wants Shark Cards won't find out FiveM existed?From my point of view they just want to make sure nothing GTA Online ""like"" pops up that's potentially better so they can make more money off of the little kids who can't afford to play the game to earn cash and buy their chromed Zentorno.I hope the FiveM team still has the dreams ablility of continuing their work at least getting a server browser working because GTA Online is suffering.Many of my friends here on steam and the some on Xbox Live have both said that it's an unplayable mess as in its not fun to be exploding every 20 seconds after it happening the last session they were in and after this stunt of R* they're most likely quitting and switching over to other games.I wish I could refund the game but I've got 172 hours into the game from Story alone.I won't tell you guys on steam how to spend your money your hopefully an adult that can make decisions on your own but SERIOUSLY consider that if you buy this game you promote this kind of behavior for Rockstar saying that it's a good thing that they don't allow alternate multiplayer mods and maybe even other singleplayer mods.Because they DID at one point ban people for using FOV mods in Singleplayer they don't now but they did.

2015-06-24,0,0,262,False,Recommended,*TEMPORARY JULY 8TH UPDATE* I'm a little upset because I haven't gotten the update yet and other people on PC have so I'm going to remain agitated until it gets fully pushed out.*This review focuses mostly on GTA Online not the base game singleplayer* GTA Online Ok I got my problem fixed so now this is being changed to a fully positive review. The game runs great even on a GTX 650 which is a couple years old. The gameplay is smooth and it is probably the best GTA PC port I have played. GTA Online is lots of fun and hackers/modders aren't as common as people think. The one thing with them is that they sometimes will throw hundreds of thousands to millions of GTA dollars on random people which can be cool but kinda ruins working hard for stuff. I got over 30 million thrown on me in one lobby! I made sure to get rid of it by spending it on useless stuff like the golden luxor and the golden swift but that only took off like 15 million. So if you are a legit player the occasional modder throwing millions of dollars on you when you haven't even earned 200k can be a little annoying but you can easily get rid of it by spending it on useless crap. To more away from the hackers... all of the online gameplay is smooth and lots of fun. I love the ability to play races with only your skill level and the ability to turn off custom cars (which when fully upgraded can be beast). You can easily make friends in it and there is tons to do from races to heists to flying around in an attack helocoptor killing everyone on the server the fun never ends. The ammount of customizability in the game especially with cars is awesome! My only big complaint is Rockstar's servers sometimes they are great but sometimes they suck.Singleplayer I haven't spent a lot of time in singleplayer but I know that the story is quite good. I usually play games for the multiplayer but I do like to just play the singleplayer once in a while. I only have about two hours into the singleplayer but it has been fun. Again I focuss on MP more but I may finish singleplayer so that I can add to this review. OVERALL RATING Pros Smooth gameplay Runs on most computers Fun MP Great graphicsCons Occasional hackers/modders Rockstar servers sometimes lick bumholeFinal Rating 8.7/10This game is worth every penny and I/m sure you will enjoy it just as much as I do.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-25,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,"Well for the singleplayer experience alone the game is worth getting. That is solid fun.However on PC especially since the launch was delayed compared to consoles people mostly get it for the multiplayer component.It feels like a cheesy MMO in many ways. You just grind the money. You do a lot and I mean a lot of work for very little pay compared to the prices of everything.Many things are clunky and rough on the edges. Higher level players love to bully everyone out of boredom. A lot of the missions are designed in such a way that they can be easily interruped by other player for no real benefit to them.. So people just destroy each other's fun. Plus a lot of missions are a terrible chore. Like you may not believe.There are hackers in the game not so common nowadays but it used to be a huge problem. So again no fun.And now imagine my day today I'm tired last months were tough. So inbetween all the Xmas stuff I log in to play with my friends. Nick says that I should clean up my garage and get the discounted Kuruma (armored vehicle extremely useful) and a free Hermes. OK I help him out with the missions I'll buy the cars later. And so in the evening I get into the garage to sell one of the cars I get inside and.. a helicopter spawns inside I can't get out... OK finally I buy the Hermes it says ""FREE"". That substracted 535 000$ from my account. So I'm 12 000 short of a Kuruma. For the last delivery mission (that's my biggest source of income) I was paid 168 000$. And I need a crew for that and hopefully an empty session. Yeeeees. I feel very done.It's some weird kind of rat race more money better cars bigger houses and the way you get there is through boredom and pain. Get a job instead. It will help you pay the bills interact with people face to face good stuff. It will keep you sane. This is like a bad job slowly drives you insane.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-23,0,0,611,False,Not Recommended,"The perfect game if you wish to waste time... Even so there is a potential for good content creation if you use the world/cars correctly. The problem however is the fact that the player base has no interest in creating interesting content or even testing things. If you wish to mess around with AI the spawn pattern of NPCs or even how the physics work you will have to play solo. Even if you do play solo however the game still boils down to very simply elements thrown together with the goal of mindless entertainment... There is no challenge in this... There is nothing to be gained...In reality this game was created for two purposes and those purposes were to provide mindless entertainment and waste time. While I still believe it is possible to find something worthwhile in this game you will have to spend ALOT of time searching for it if you do not create it yourself. The main easter egg for example relies on barely strung together clues to locate the end ""meaning."" While puzzles and easter egg hunts usually have sense of merit and achievment behind them GTA's easter egg is too losely tied together to provide you ANYTHING. It seems like the treasure hunt in GTA was created for one reason wasting more time. That is the main point really why would you want to waste time?If you are the type of person that wants more from a game like this do not despair completely. Even though the game itself was created to pander to a lazy player base you can still create a ton of interesting and new content. The world of Las Santos is a large and populated place. There are bound to be a ton of locations that fit nearly any type of video idea that you might have. You could create a homage to Goldeneye by using the Land Act Dam. You could even create a cheesy 90s style car commercial using any of the countless cars in the game. The possibilities in this respect are nearly endless. The biggest rebuttal I hear whenever I say video games should be more than just fun is the fact that some people just want to relax after a long day of work... While this is true that does not mean you should waste your time. Try finding enjoyment in learning things. If this is not possible than at least try your best. The very moment you decide to do nothing is the very moment you are nothing.",Grand Theft Auto V

Buttery smooth 1440p.Radio is very entertaining. The map has definitely changed alot since San Andreas but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. Cars handle alot better than GTA IV. Switching between characters isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other GTA games. First thing I did after the prologue was boost a car drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane I found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). Love this game so far. Only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. Lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-14,0,0,85,False,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong single player is fun (when it doesn't softlock that is) for most of the time. The online was a huge miss. It is an uneccessary grindfest that makes you work hours to get to the fun part. It's not even worth it without friends. As for the programming involved in this game it is utter crap. I have encountered plenty of softlocks crashes and other stuff. Sure it's a step up from GTA IV but this is the biggest game budget wise in history. We should at least have half decent programming. If you have a console play it on there you won't have to deal with as many online cheaters the game doesn't crash or softlock and many other things. Personally I would just recommend avoiding this game. The reason I keep buying indie games is because at least I'm not wasting $40 to just have a bad taste left in my mouth.EDIT After building a new $1500 PC one of the games that influenced my build (this one) doesn't launch.

Too slow to effectively money farm.Vehicles Mostly reskins of eachother with mildly variant stats. There are rocket cars but those are gatedd behind millions of dollars to buy them and a huge investment needed to start a corporation.Companies and whatnot became the entirety of gameplay shortly after release. Makes money grinding bearable but only because it's faster not fun.Community Usually the worst but sometimes you'll find a friendly guy who's fun to play with. At least until one of you gets a false positive for hacking.In conclusion this game has so so much to gain if it stopped taking itself seriously. At first glance it looks silly with all kinds of semi subtle jokes and references but they really really want GTAV to be an LA simulation. The rocket cars are a great addition but they're gated so not everybody has them. Lord knows we can't have people rocketing of skyskrapers in rocket cars. This is GTAV after all.

The game is still fun but to get money you have to grind for it now. Ive only been banned once and I get reported many times by other users because I ""teleport"" but I don't get randomly banned or ever hear about it until looking at the current reviews. I used to get free money all the time and I haven't been banned from that. I got banned that first time from modding then I stopped doing it. All these reviews from July to now talking about hackers and getting banned randomly I'm sure those are all lies given what I've observed in game. Multiplayer isn't necessarily broken at all except for the Peer to Peer server hosting the game runs. The new CEO update isn't worth playing either because you spend 200k on crates you earn 212k back and your associates gain like 10k maximum. To earn money you have to have a competent crew of 3 people to do Pacific standard in an hour. Not really hard but its more of who you're playing with.REVIEW IN PROGRESS (2015) So far in my experience on XBOX this game easily wins 9/10 because of how fun it is. Many bugs are easy to ignore.Hackers are a bit of a problem if they arent on your side and the pro to that is that there are hackers that can make you benefit from them (because sometimes they give out money/RP (rarely))PC includes better giraffics and better gameplay (IMO) and its not fun unless you got friends to play with.The only negative reviews I've seen are kids saying how they can't buy the game itself when you clearing f*cking can if you look on the store page (6/15/15) and kids complaining about ""hackers"" giving them money or some ridiculous bs like that (You can obviously ask r* to remove it).

2017-06-22,0,0,109,False,Not Recommended,"So this review is not ALL about the recent crap involving Take Two AND Rockstar (remember that Rockstar clearly didn't do anything to prevent this so they're just as much in the wrong.) banning mods. No this is a bit broader than that.My main fun factor in this game (was) the amount of stuff you can do both in singleplayer (which is clasically what GTA is all about) and multiplayer. The story was pretty mediocre the characters not too interesting and the ending pretty boring. It's the game around the main story that was exciting. I liked the heists in both single and multiplayer (I liked the single player version much more though). I liked driving dirt bikes up and down the country sides. I like robbing stores or having shootouts on rooves etc etc.However once that ran out you turned to multiplayer. Which you could do missions and complete objectives with friends. You could make racing tracks and make fun mini games out of the tools rockstar provided.It all kind of hit the fan after the Hiests were added. Hiests were expensive (in game) meaning you relied on grinding buying money via shark cards or having friends who are loaded. Thankfully I'm frugal so the starting 1.5 million went a long way.Then you repeatedly had updates for only multiplayer that required even more money to take part in. The executive offices the gun runner update the overly priced new cars and stuff. In order to play with the new toys you needed money. The only way to earn the money is to become a mule to an executive. Some were good but many were bad since they mostly consisted of hackers or people who used real money to buy the exxecutive title rather than ""earn it"".It just became an increasingly impossible grind to earn anything anymore. The ""new"" care of yesterday that you were just able to buy is far surpassed by the latest and greatest car that's twice as much. That's why mods were fun. In singleplayer you were able to drive the older new cars and build race tracks and blow up towns... All dressed like a hooker. There were gamemodes (albiet singleplayer ones) that increased replayability.TL'DR The game stopped being about fun and started becoming too realistic for my liking. It's a game not a job. I have real life stuff to do. I don't need to waste my time grinding another version of me in order to buy a virtual Jaguar. That's why mods were fun.",Grand Theft Auto V

Didn't I mention the loading before? Well it's actually 30% of the time you'll spend on this game.Moreover they can still improve the optimization. Even though I run the game perfectly (with a GTX580 almost 4 years old) the usage of video memory is too damn high for nothing.That said I'd still recommend you buying it but only if you plan on playing with friends online. Otherwise I'll have to admit it's quite boring playing alone and the community doesn't help (bunch of 12years old who have a lot of fun killing you for nothing).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,204,False,Recommended,"I bought this game three times. THREE TIMES!I bought it when it came out on PS3.I bought it when it came out on PS4.I ing preordered it when it came out on PC.Needless to say I was pretty dedicated not only to the franchise but this game specifically. Was the PC version the great culmination we expected it to be? Mostly sure.Performance was my greatest concern much like everyone else's. With GTA4 Rockstar sort of earned themselves some negative opinions. With good hardware today GTA4 doesn't run too bad but that's not saying much considering it was released in 2008. SO what's the verdict with GTA5?Well it runs pretty good for the most part. I was getting very smooth 60FPS in the opening parts of the game but those were in an isolated rural town of the game certainly not the most intensive area. However even when I got to the middle of the city I was stunned to still see 60FPS with just about maxed out settings.There are framerate dips don't misunderstand but NEVER have I once found any situation in the game where I dropped below 45 and considering Far Cry 4 can barely manage that on my hardware I was rather impressed. This IS a very large detailed open world we're talking about.For those who have been patient for the PC version and thus haven't played this game at all gameplay is mostly familiar if you've at least played previous games in the series. It's an open world sandbox complete with a lengthy well written story where you play at 3 characters simultaneously and can switch between them when it suits you or when the situation calls for it.With the First Person mode specifically combat has become smoother and better controlled. It's rather bizarre to control the game's combat with a keyboard in mouse considering it's so accurate. It's made the games online deathmatches feel more like the next AAA First Person Shooter rather than a GTA game.First person is also as dramatic of a change as you've heard. It's essentially the same gameplay but the perspective makes the entire game much mor visceral and believable. If you can let yourself get absorbed into the game's world you will. It's gorgeous with all the enhanced graphics options. I thought the PS4 version looked pretty damn good but there's no mistaking that the PC version can look a LOT better. Higher resolution shadows higher textures better lighting more crowded streets and sidewalks this version of the game hasn't disappointed visually. There are problems though. BIG ones. Many people can't even launch the game. The launcher itself just crashes or does nothing at all when clicked. I was one of the fortunate people that didn't have any problems but my brother did. There are a couple ""solutions"" but some people say they don't work at all. There's this .exe file floating around but despite numerous accounts of people saying it's safe I still have no 100% proof that it is. A much safer solution involves disabling a laptops Nvidia GPU before launching the game and quickly reenabling it just as it loads. This seems to work for my brother but it's very tedious and NEEDS to be fixed now.I'd hate to say it but seriously Rockstar after two additional years and people already buying the game TWICE I did expect a much smoother launch. The game is still fantastic though. Great gameplay visuals sound story characters it's really a very well rounded game and the online mode will only keep you coming back for HOURS.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-26,1,4,103,False,Not Recommended,"let me tell you the two biggest issues with this game 1) you are either going to pay for money grind for hours on hours for just enough money to buy something or use mods so you can have a quick fun experience. I tried for hours attempting to grind for money but unless you have heavy armor and the best guns and the best squad you are getting nowhere financially. I refused to putting any money into this game just for a currency i can get otherwise. (also the game money to real money ratio is garbage). So i downloaded a mod menu to give myself money and screw around with friends. keep in mind i never used the mod menu unless i was on a private server with ONLY friends. after a specific update i was no longer able to have my mod menu in the game. whatever i knew what i was doing was against the rules even though i never affected strangers. the game worked fine after verifying game files for a while. which leads to point number 2) if you ever have a technical issue it is already over. after a specific update i could no longer play the game. keep in mind i removed the mod menu and was able to play for another 50 hours and i was NOT banned in any way shape or form. I could no longer run GTA V because an error message started to appear saying ""could not find *$&amp $% 3(87&amp 865* "" wtf does this even mean???? this isnt a file or even a common enough error that i could find online. so i attempted getting a refund because my game literally no longer works. i wrote i detailed reason as to why i would play for a hundred hours then request a refund suddenly. i got a denial with no reasoning. so let this be a lesson on Rockstars behalf they only want your money. they will not care about you after youve bought the game and played just long enough so they can hit you with the ""played too long for refund""",Grand Theft Auto V

Didn't remember it too well last time I played it was when it released on PS3. +Great optimization+Customizable keyboard layout and controller support.+Great graphics (watching the sun set is awesome rain and weather effects are all top notch especially at night with all the neon in the city reflecting off the roads)+Driving is great+A.I. is great. Cops will use real world maneuvers to wreck you and you feel like you are actually on the run. You can dip off in an alley and if they see your headlights they will get out and investigate have them cut off and they will likely drive by if you are hidden well from sight. My car was parked in dark shadows and they drove right by.+Some funny characters story isn't the best but it does fine+Heists are plentiful throughout and fun with multiple ways of playing them making replayability higher.+Shooting and combat is top notch loads of guns+Detail in the world is amazing. The city looks and feels real and the outskirts in the desert feel just like they should+Plenty of activities such as boat races scuba diving flying planes and helicopters desert races etc+Side missions although some are boring but not horribly boring.+Online is fun and will keep me coming back to it more and more but haven't spent enough time with it to offer a valid opinion. Played the heists on xbox one and they were great from what I played. Not really any negatives for me although some people have reported having launch issues but seems they are getting sorted out fast. People just basically killing each other in free roam instead of doing something fun like running from cops.TLDR This is one of the best action open world games on PC if not the best in game world for this type of game. It's well made and deserves your attention. They spent a lot of time with this port and it shows. There are bugs but it's nothing to write home about compared to the console versions and they are getting addressed.

2017-10-20,0,0,204,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer Fantastic story arcs with great character development. This game has a cast of unique characters that are fun to explore and play as. Watching them interact with the world is a lot of fun in and of itself (cough Trevor cough). Each one has a unique approach to different situations. The story is interesting and keeps you gripped with every mission. Only few missions don't really match up to the rest of them (Scouting the Port) but they're few and far between. The inclusion of the stock market and being able to manipulate it by taking out figure heads of rival companies is also a unique aspect to the game that (if played correctly) can make you millions even billions. The problem is there isn't much to spend it on. Overall though it's an interesting and fun experience that will keep you playing for hours. Multiplayer A mess of an online game. Hackers left an right run freely and ruin everyone else's gaming experience calling themselves 'trolls'. Moderators ban the people affected by the hack instead of the hacker. Everything is expensive as hell. All the content for Gunrunning (bunkers vehicles etc.) total up to an estimated $43 million. To put that into real world money terms every $8 million in game dollars costs $140. 40/8 5 x 140 $700. Every $500k in game is five dollars. 3/0.5 6 x 5 $30. So for one free DLC all the content would cost you $730. That's ridiculous. Or alternatively you could spend 500+ hours in game spending all the money you make on one part of the game. This was done by Rockstar to incentivise people into spending their hard earned money on their microtransactions. ing scummy as hell. 12 year olds flame in voice chat NON STOP. Trying to get a contract done is absolutely impossible because as soon as someone is alerted that you're trying to move a shipment everyone in the server is chasing you down with fighter jets just to blow up your cargo and you over. Tech support is absolutely zero help. Trying to appeal bans just gives you an automated response from a rude bot and human employees are probably less help than the pre written response from bots. Money is sometimes randomly deducted for your account because reasons.In Conclusion If you're going to buy this game for its singleplayer wait till it goes on sale. It's got a great story mode but nothing to spend full price for.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is even now years later almost full price and the B#""# S #""t that a gamer has to endure with their launcher rockstar club membership and gtaonline (which is GTA V mmo style) How can I recommend it even if the SP campaign is great? They attack modding community that only change the SP game yet do nothing about the problems that plague the online version and the only solution they offer is more microtransactions on a regular basis and tighten the noose around the consumer neck. On several weeks and occasions I have not been able to even play the game because of the rockstar social club BS that every now and then just fails for whatever reason to login you in in order to play the games you have paid for.

2015-12-20,0,0,67,False,Not Recommended,Ok . GTA5 is vast. well layed out with some great ideas on making money in game. The graphics are great with no lags. Many little sub games within the game making it extra fun. Could have been the game of the year but its totally over run by blatent hacking. If you want to play in the real world (multiplay) of gta5 and be visible and you dont hack your in for a pretty bad time. As you drive around the world trying to make your way you will encounter many who just regard you as an easy target. You cant play them on a even playing field cause they have every gun in the game with god mode and many hacked millions in their accounts. If they like you they may drop millions in cash on you. Rockstar is trying to ban this but the hackers are 1 step ahead. You will see luxury boats off shore and almost certainly these are all bought using hax cash. I could go on about this problem but I really want you to consider the long term play ability of this game. There is no long term online playability unless rockstar overcomes the hax issues. If you are think of buying this game for the story mode then its a great game. If you are buying this for the online experience I would highly recommend avioding this game. I understand after each patch the hax doesnt work so i suggest rockstar make weekly small patches to keep ahead of the cheats. Please please please avoid this game.

The open world feels lively and bustling around you not to mention how varied and diverse different parts of the map are.

2016-12-09,1,4,728,False,Recommended,As many of you all know GTA V is a huge game. It began way back in the day with GTA 3 and ever since then has continued to get better and better. I do love the game and I have completely enjoyed every title they've released. Unfortunately there are also some negative areas too and the this is by no real fault of Rockstar to be honest as with ANY online game there will always be those few that ruin it for others. This game is plagued with cheaters/modders and whilst rockstar do their 'thing' to try to keep this as low as possible it is simply not working. At the time of writing this the game has at least one or more cheaters/modders in every session you goto. It's quite frustrating since there are a lot of rumours that claim people can get banned through the actions of a cheater/modder doing something on their end which the detection system thinks you (the innocent party) is doing and thus bans you. I'm a bit of a programmer/coder so I genuinely find this theory hard to believe and I honestly think it's all a lie but there are a lot of complaints by people claiming that this is what happened to them so I'm open to the possibility but genuinely feel they're simply lying. If this is actually true then Rockstar need to sort this out.Now putting aside the modders/cheaters the only other thing that really frustrates me is the loading times. I have neveer been in an game whereby you spend more time loading (the same map!) than you do actually playing the game. I mean unless you just stay in the lobby....the loading times are just unreal. Even going from the lobby to a mission lobby such as Races e.t.c there's a loading screen there and if you cancel that another loading screen to get back to the map that you spent 10mins loading just prior to the race. It's a joke. How can there honestly be THIS much loading required when what they're loading is the same map! I mean all missions and the alike are all loading the same map...the only difference is whether or not cops are disabled or whether certain peds will be needed and spawn at X Y Z e.t.c which doesn't require any loading... (Yes I've done some modding in GTA V for single player so I know this doesnt require loading screens) yet we still have loading screens for everything!As you can tell i play a lot of online GTA V and havent spoken much about single player.Single player is great the city really is full of life. It's a shame my R9 290x broke down and now I can't play the game in the way that I used to. Non the less the only thing I found a bit annoying was the fact that we're playing 3 characters at the same time. I think it's great to try new things but I honestly didn't like the fact that as soon as you got to the point where you started to like a character and know the storyline and what's going on and enjoy it all boom you're no longer able to play that character because you have to play as one of the other 2 characters to continue the story further....and then the same thing would repeat whereby you start getting into again and boom now must change character one again. For me this was the onlly negative thing really with the story line. I would absolutely recommend this game I've spent many hours in this game although you do get bored and stop playing for a month or two here and there you always come back for more sooner or later!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-13,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,"Single player story mode is crap. Vice City and San Andreas had far more impactful stories at the time they came out.Online is another beast. I'll start off by saying that 75% of my hours logged in this game were most likely spent sitting at a loading screen. Not only are the loads long but frequent. You'll get an invite to a heist accept the invite get brought to a loading screen only for it to tell you that the group is full another loading screen for ages respawn in some random spot in the world so if you were doing something you have to backtrack.The original heists started off great ended up a painful grind. The Prison Break is actually a really great heist but it's quite difficult compared to the rest in my opinion and it's the first big heist you get to play. So you often have a lot of inexperienced players trying to do this and it is a show.The CEO and biker updates were the last I played for before going on hiatus. Both were quite unrealistic grinds for chump change that at any point during a sale could all get blown to smithereens leaving you with ZILCH. All it takes is one with some rockets to ruin solid man hours of work. It's incredible how long it takes to fill a small warehouse compared to how easily it can be destroyed top that off with the fact that it pays out a very pathetic amount of cash. The amount of cash payout in this game is ridiculously low compared to how much all the content costs.I don't have enough money to start any of the new content myself so I basically have to wander aimlessly around free roam until I get an invite from someone. It isn't very often.What pisses me off the most and this isn't exclusive to GTA O is the constant in game nagging to buy I think this is happening more after the Doomsday update. I just came back after a few months of not playing. I constantly get bombarded with calls from the various NPCs telling me to buy a hangar buy a facility buy this buy that. I'm like YO CHILL IT'S LIKE A MILLION AT LEAST FOR EACH. I'm sitting here like grinding my way past 200k. They never stop calling. And when you do finally buy a place you'll still get annoying calls from these buffoons about something or other. But bottom line it needs to not be in the game. I prefer ""hey cousin let's go bowling"" any day over this I get it ya'll need your money but too many games these days are heavily incentivizing buying from the in game store till I feel like they become more like a dressing room sim than an actual game.Hackers in this game are . Sometimes you get a tasteful one. Most of the time it's just annoying and not entertaining.R* doesn't know what it's doing regarding correcting hacking issues. Both my friend and I were hacked money in free roam on separate occasions. We both log in one day and see a message saying our in game balances have been adjusted. They ended up taking back more than the money that was hacked and left me with 20k. My friend logged in to MORE money. Get your together FFS.Overall if you're a GTA fan you may as well play the game just to say you have. But I wouldn't declare GTAV a pivotal release in gaming history. The music is straight until you've heard it for the 80 billionth time. Lots of good tracks though. Gotta give it up to GTA games for influencing my musical tastes over the years.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-04-01,1,4,1960,False,Not Recommended,"For at least a year GTAV has been one of my favorite open world games. However this has given an excellent chance to watch this game degrade into chaos. The game itself is actually fine. The big problem is in online mode where you can play multiplayer with strangers. Ever since the original GTAV came out people have been creating mods for the game that add extra content. Since the game was originally just a single player game this was fine. However when online came out people found they could still use those mods in multiplayer. People created all kinds of mods to allow players to hack in a large number of ways from just 20 minutes of work. In addition to the usual such as aimbot invincibility and teleport players can drop unlimited amounts of money and pick it up themselves or give it to other players. I personally spent about 50 dollars on this game so i could start ceo work when it came out. This made me very angry when it got to the point you could find a money dropper after just a few lobby hops. Some other mods(hacks) include instantly killing players from anywhere making them unable to spawn crashing their game spawning in any object or scripted vehicle including hacky super yachts that can fly and shoot missile hackers even have ways of making it appear that another player is hacking so that the blame goes on them. That brings me to my next point which is that rockstar games has a very ineffective way of dealing with modders and hackers in online mode as well as disruptive players in general. Players have the option to go into the online menu and report a player up to 2 times for things such as disruptive behavior on chat or on the mic exploits griefing and a few more i cant remember. However these reports do very little. Even if a player recieves upwards of ten reports in a single session it is unlikely that their account will be terminated or suspended but instead it lowers their ""reputation"" which makes them more likely to be put in lobbies with other players that have bad reputation. however bad reputation can be obtained in a number of ways including blowing up peoples cars which is an integral part of the game. Not only is the system in place ineffective but many players blatantly turn a blind eye to hacking and money dropping and many even encourage it. Often times if you speak out against a hacker and encourage others to report him you will be met with replies of ""HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG"" or ""WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN"" and you'll even see players asking in chat ""who's the modder can i have a money drop i'm poor"" and if you go long enough you'll find your game mysteriously crashing. This makes for a game where people are helpless against modders and hackers and anyone who opposes them finds themselves public enemy number one. Rockstar if you're reading this modders are cutting into YOUR profits by causing lazy and unmotivated players to seek illegaly made money instead of buying money from the ingame store. Rockstar is one of my favorite game developing companies and i want the best for GTAV but as of right now it is near unplayable and players who have worked for months and months to get where they are in their 4 story penthouse watch lazy undedicated players shoot to the top sitting on a pile of fake money. Anyone who is considering this game please consider this review before you make your purchase. Rockstar please consider this review when you decide whether to work on improving the disciplinary system or add more types of alcohol to GTAVI and modders who read this please consider that you are actively ruining a long lived franchise filled with dedicated players and incredible communities who are being forced out of this game by people like you most likely never to return. You are the problem but you can still help fix it. All you have to do is delete your mods folder.If I find that the modders and hackers problem is resolved or repaired such that the game is significantly more playable I will replace this review with a positive one.Note since i wrote this review i had my level set from 165 to 13 by an unusually salty hacker. When I applied for a support ticket on rockstar's website I was pleased with the response. Within 48 hours of submitting my ticket i had all my levels back the way they were. This incident has shown that rockstar is not entirely ignorant of the hacker problem. Although this alone is not enough to change my overall opinion i will consider this if i ever consider changing my review to positive.Update I have just heard the news about Take two banning the distribution of OpenIV which is a modding software. At first i was grateful they were taking more action to get hackers out of online even after i stopped playing the game. But then I read mroe about the situation. OpenIV weren't the kind of people who forcably gave a whole lobby 50 million. They understood the damage modding does to online and use of their mods in online was already not only banned but disabled. They werent kicking money spawners out of online lobbies. They were disabling people who just wanted to mess around in singleplayer where their actions don't affect other players. I've always supported modding outside of online but now rockstar has once again screwed themselves over by setting fire to one of the most cherished aspects of the game that they spend so much time to milk for just a few more shekels. I am disgusted at the actions of rockstar and take two and i can promise everyone reading this i will never spend another penny on any games or merchandise realised by this corrupt company. There is currently a petition going around that requests that Rockstar and Take two immediately reverse their decision about banning the distribution of OpenIV software here https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv I doubt that rockstar will change their policies just because of one petition but hopefully it will show them how many of their loyal customers are on the verge of leaving permanently due to their poor decision making. We are only 20 000 signatures or so from our goal of 75 000 please do some good and sign this petition now for the sake of all things criminal.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-13,0,0,1217,False,Not Recommended,"Part 1 Ok so this thing says to ""be polite"" when reviewing games so i'm going to do my best...here we go...To say that I have a deep hatred for this game and Rockstar as a company solely because of this game would be an understatement.. If you have not purchased this game yet let me do you a huge favor and say unless you are buying this game SOLELY for the story mode and have 0 intentions of playing online DO NOT WASTE YOU'RE HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS TRASH! Don't waste GIFT money on this trash! Don't even waste stolen or money you just found laying around on it! Seriously...First thing's first...some positives about the game. You can steal cars drive around shoot stuff go to the strip club upgrade cars purchase military vehicles and buy a rather nice looking house or yacht to live in. Also the single player story mode has an interesting plot that's engaging with a huge world to explore and some in depth nuances a person could play ""game theory"" with. And if i'm being honest that's pretty much about where the positives end. When I first started playing this game online I ran across a hacker. He was a benevolent one though..I was low level and he helped me out by giving me a ton of free money and his reasoning for why or should I say his warning I never forgot. He warned me then there were plenty of s that I would run in to playing this game and so he figured he'd do what he could to at least give me a fighting chance starting off. Boy was it much needed so much more so than I could realize. With that said on to the negatives.First off there are a number of different ways to earn money online ALL of them suck. Here are your options you can either do heists which you HAVE to purchase a house with a 10 car garage first to even be able to host heists. Once you spend a huge chunk of your change you likely saved up from helping other people do their heists to get your house now when you host you gotta sit there sometimes for 30 minutes 45 minutes it's not uncommon to even be sitting there for up to an hour or more waiting for people to join your heist. But lets say you get lucky and you ONLY end up waiting about 15 minutes..then you start the heist fail about 5 times because some swears they know better than you and wont listen to instruction or plain old doesn't speak your native language which i assume to be english if you're reading this review or they just keep foolin around until finally someone gets fed up with doing the same thing over and over and never passing it and they leave. Now you've wasted another 30 to 45 minutes just trying to complete ONE setup mission. You're already in an hour and some change and have nothing to show for it..and now you have to load the lobby back up and do it all over again...and speaking of loading...dear God I have NEVER played a game with longer load times than this one. I've timed it before and literally no kidding again another 10 15 minutes sitting at a black screen or a white screen or whatever loading screen waiting to get online..then waiting to join a new lobby after a mission or heist...then waiting to go to a new session because the one you're in is littered with dickbag hackers but more on them later. So if you aren't heisting your next option is CEO missions which can either be done as the president of a motorcycle club a shady warehouse owner selling drugs jewelry weapons and the like or bunker missions where you have to buy a bunker or as a VIP and a few other options. The ONLY one that doesn't involve any risk to your assets is VIP but of course it doesn't pay as much as the others and there's a timer on the missions so once you do one you have to wait before you can do another. If you want to fill up your ceo warehouse you have to first buy a warehouse which is expensive af because gta's economy is ..40 000 dollars just for a dam color change on your gun..50 000 dollars for a silencer or extended mags or a useless scope that doesn't seem to do anything but make your gun less accurate if you try to use it in first person view...10 000 dollar shirts and that's on the cheaper end..anyway you gotta buy a bunker then you gotta place an order for supplies. The cheapest you can go is 2 000 but you'll spend FOREVER trying to fill up a large bunker buying 2 000 supplies every time. So most people opt for the most expensive choice of 18 000. Once you purchase the supplies now you gotta go pick it up but of course that's RARELY ever simple. More times than not you have to fight a ton of npc's guarding it when you get there then after you kill them and collect it more times than not it's in a slow van or truck that damn near any other vehicle in the game can run down with ease and you have to transport it half way across GTA's huge map with MORE npc's chasing after you trying to kill you AND other players...because you know Rockstar thought it was a good idea to say ""hey! why don't we notify EVERYONE in the lobby that this person is minding their own ing business trying to collect supplies for their business so they can make money and reward people for stopping them and destroying their stuff! We'll even make them show as a big bright red dot on the map so there's no way you can miss them!"" Inevitably someone swoops in with a jet or runs you down in a car blows you up and now your 18 000 dollars worth of supplies is gone and you've wasted your money and your time. I would go through the nitpicky details of each ceo mission type but for the sake of not writing an entire book for a review just know that it's basically the same thing for the other ceo mission types. And lets say you FINALLY managed to fill your warehouse and you're ready to sell and collect on the big bucks! Welp if you've gotta large warehouse you're gonna have to ""hire"" other players to help you drive all the vehicles you'll be given because of course you can't choose to the drop off spots. And of course everyone in the lobby will again be notified and rewarded for destroying your precious cargo that you've undoubtedly spent literal actual hours trying to collect. Not only are you now even more concerned about other players but you've gotta be concerned about the people you hired. Lets say they're not the best driver or the best pilot..i've literally been in the passenger seat as I watched a plane carrying 1.2 million dollars worth of cargo a full large scale warehouse that was packed out in it go down and explode because the pilot didn't know what he was doing. Imagine how mad the completely uninspired to play this pos game you'd feel knowing it literally took you weeks to fill that thing playing here and there in your off time. I could go on and on on just that subject alone but lets continue there's so much more to talk about!Secondly you can't sell your guns houses warehouses bunkers clubhouses yachts or specialty vehicles! You were scrolling through the guns in Ammunation and accidentally bought a gun you just wanted to look at? Too bad! It's yours now! No sell backs and even worse you can't even permanently drop it and just leave it on the ground. The only way to at least get it out of your inventory for any solid length of time is to buy the gun locker upgrade which is about 3/4 of a mil if i'm remembering correctly for your ceo business. And even then it ONLY applies in free roam! If you pick up a heist or a mission all of the guns you've ever bought are in your inventory which means when you're looking for one specific gun you've got to cycle through about 30 other guns before you finally get to the you want and that's every...single...time...you load into a new mission..It's like Rockstar keeps putting out updates for more cars more aircraft more missions and that's nice and all but fix the you already got! Let me sell the guns I'm not using anymore",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-21,0,0,1287,False,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto Enter The JobAs of 6/21/2015 I can heartily recommend the singleplayer. The multiplayer is not worth it however.Let me preface by saying I usually am very forgiving of buggy game's. I have braved Skyrim Oblivion and Morrowind's bugs as if they are no issue. I take GREAT fun in many of them. The caliber of GTAO right now is akin to downloading 100 Skyrim mods without reading anything before installing ignoring load order et all then trying to play the game.Let me also preface by saying that I have been on Rockstar's side for waiting on the game and for it's overall good attempt. I figure with its unique engine that it is impossible to flesh out the expanse of a game without some serious bug fixing.However whether i'm on Rockstar's side or not i've come to a collected agreement that this game feels more like a job than a game.1) The hacking situation. What do most people do in open world games but kill one another? Open world no need for any Dayz need for survival. Have at ye! Except how many of these games do I get to kill someone before they retaliate through hacking or i'm already in a server with a beloved hacker.Since the update particularly the situation is so bad that there is a surplus of beggers in game asking for the hacker's to drop money. There's been points where missile's are falling a split second behind each player in the game to where it feels like you're in Fallujah.I'm sure someone has a grand explanation for this. I'm not entirely sure why Rockstar isn't using Valve Anti Cheat. I heard Rockstar state that they would separate hackers (whom were caught) so that they could only play in rooms amongst one another. The problem peaked that any sort of posting photograph's and whatever is implemented is not working. Furthermore modder's for single player are getting banned.2) DRM. The social club is a nightmare. I see why it's there since you can communicate cross platform transfer characters etcetera. It still has way too many hiccups ending up as something more clunky than Steam's in browser setup by a long shot.Frequently and I mean every hour one of my friends ends up showing offline through the social club. Mind you these players showing up offline are all in the same house as me.I'm sending invite after invite when my friends are ""showing up"" online. Did you get the text message? Nope.I always resort to using Steam for sending out invites.3) Cell phone matchmaking. Short and sweet. It's a joke. Unless you have 3 or more friends playing consistently it's unplayable to consistently find good games without a crew. I don't know anyone that even listens to the text messages sent to other people's phone's. It's like looking at spam.I've spent hours waiting for a player to join for a heist.Overall it's a very unsociable game. I'm sure this is different on consoles since more trolls are willing to use their microphone's. In short I don't blame Rockstar for that. However the difficulty of finding a good group for having people to screw around with in the open world back you up sorting a heist takes SERIOUS effort from the user in organizing. Despite all the waiting I heartily recommend people not playing without friends a crew or a canon of charisma and networking ability. I have spent a significant quantity of time jaded by this one experience until I started going out to Reddit forums google etcetera in finding good groups and crews.I'm ranting here but everyone else I play with that communicates at all is all just ""on the job"" just like me. The combination of waiting here and the joblike set up really interferes with the whole open world mentality toward approaching the game.4) Disconnect's Crashes and Loading and Stuttering. Not sure where to start here. I'd say a disconnect happens between 3 of us every 30 minutes. A crash happens about every hour. Loading takes about 2 minutes average when starting up 1 minute joining to a new server sitting through matchmaking or worse hosting while no one joins because of a connection bug. Stuttering has become a more recent issue.Anyway's do the math and see how it adds up.As a note since initially playing I have changed around every component on my PC reinstalled GTA V reinstalled Windows checked every driver on my PC tried setting up alternate connections through LAN WiFi to the same results.It's Sunday night and I have spent 1/2 of my game waiting debugging avoiding hackers among other things (this includes friends computers). To have patience with the game is a massive understatement.It's not one issue bringing the game down. It's the fact that i'm spending my day resetting my connection avoiding hacker's dealing with the wait time from disconnects rejoining from crashes sitting through loading screens failed loading screens returning me toward single player resetting games anticipating different results. Like a job the game has become obstacle management.At the moment i'm using 16gb of ram a 970 and an Intel i7 from the last year.Since the beginning I see Grand Theft Auto throwing money at player's.Yet I can't help feeling like i'm at my cubicle spending every day contemplating quitting my job. I'm looking over at the dirt bag's whom don't work cheating (hacking) their way as if surfing upon the economical carpet floor. I'm looking at the door. For a while now I can just walk out the door.But there is nothing like this game... My friends need me here. I sit around. I toast in the air conditioned oven.Hours of waiting moments of fun. Hour's of waiting. I walk to the door and a million dollars is coming my way.Oh this will go toward retirement......Would not work for again.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-02,0,0,61,False,Recommended,I picked this game up on Steam because all the trailers and promotional videos made it look very enticing.I don't have a full start to end review of this game because there is so much to it and so much to play. There is also the GTA Online game and the video editor that I haven't toughted yet either.Once I get to experience the entire story mode I will try the GTA Online and review them in full. Until then here is my first impression of the game.GTA 5 is defiantly an action adventure type game due to how open world it is and all the places to explore and things to do in the game. I enjoy doing all the side missions before doing the main story line.When I first loaded up the game I found that the action was intense right of the bat. No slow buildup of your character coming over on a ship to meet his cousin and start a new life nope you were right in the middle of a bank robbery and from there the intense getaway while shooting your way out left you holding he controller playing more and more.If you find yourself getting easily agitated when lots of noisy things are going on with shouting yelling and screaming then the start of this game will push your buttons and get you going. Its that intense I found.The game plays just like you would expect any GTA game to play and works just fine with a Xbox360 controller on the PC.I did find that on my Ultra Wide monitor that during the loading screen there was the black bars on either side but once the game play started then it went away and you got the full gaming screen.No matter what you pick the game up for it is worth getting if you like the GTA games.Pro'sOpen WorldIntense startXbox Controller compatible Con'sIt takes a high end system to max out the graphicsCVGAnton's Ratingːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-05,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,"This review is for GTA ONLINEI want to leave good feedback on this game for the quality of the single player but unfortunately the online has left me sour. GTA online is a clunky mess of hackers griefers and what seems to be continous load screens between missions and trying to party with with crew members. They make it incredibly hard to start off for new players. Most existing players have so much money and replenished ammo and guns that make it nearly impossible to counter them. When griefing gets too serious you can opt in for passive mode that makes you a ghost so you cant crash or interact with other players. There are ways to still grief a player while he is in passive mode. You can shoot out store clerks from anything they try to go into or shoot out the tires of any car they are trying to enter. A lot of the missions require team work to complete to make any decent money. Without the missions there are small objectives you can complete in free mode that give you petty cash. With all this being said without a group of friends to play with the online community is very toxic and childish. The best option to get away from the crappy lobbies is to join a new session. From the several online hours I put in so far I feel like I have entered that loading screen enough for a month of gameplay from joining new sessions trying to find a decent non toxic lobby. The grouping system ""crew"" is the clunky part i spoke about. They make it very confusing just trying to play with a friend. If all these problems pertain to you don't worry you can just spend real money or GTA online cash to overpower other players trying to earn the cash in game. PAY TO WIN! There needs to be an online matchmaking system that matches you with players based on the money you have spent and what is in your bank. The only saving grace this game has is the incredible Story mode and voice acting. Rockstar has never failed by that. I can definiely say that I am enjoying the single player 10X more than online.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-26,0,0,1121,False,Recommended,"This review is about singleplay only. I'm not a multiplayer guy and were it up to me I'd separated GTA V solo and GTA Online completely. But anyway that's not an issue and I'm just talking of the single player game Rockstar finally released on the PC despite their ugly ""maximize profits"" policy. And I really think that GTA V is hugely overrated.A little spoiler up ahead (it's not even a spoiler technically) In the end of the game Michael says ""I'm too old for this"" and that's I think the words of Sam Hauser.You see technically GTA V kicks asses alright it is still the best GTA like game on the market. You have cars bikes boats jets helluva lot of activities and stuff to make your play a unique one an unforgettable experience... But it fails in the most major aspect for what so many people loved Vice City and San Andreas titles the attractiveness of the story. The compassion thing. I've blamed the GTA IV for it and it's the same and somehow even worse with the GTA V! Just like the Mafia 2 &amp 3 where the main characters are so boring and unpleasant people I'd kill them myself were it an option.The case of GTA V is worse than GTA IV and alot worse than San Andreas by the originality option as well. Let's take Trevor for instance for he's obviously the most noticable guy of whole trio. He's all kinds of a bad dude sure but I've played the game with just the same character a decade ago! It was the Scarface and even the ""special"" the rage mode was the same for Tony Montana as it is for Trevor. Scarface game was quite a mediocre one somewhere on the level of True Crime maybe and by the time of San Andreas it would be a joke to copy something into Rockstar game what was done in some wannabe competitors title. Today it's a major issue. Now GTA V is still a quite good GTA like game it's still making shots and all but it's just one in a row. It's not an overmighty king it was once.Oh I'm sure that 10 years old who now plays and streams GTA Online like mad are not gonna agree with me. And some middle to old aged creeps like Sam Hauser itself would point me at the more realistic world around that was made in GTA IV and V. I know I know I'm myself a middle aged creep who likes realistic stuff much more than some phantasy elves and ponies. But there is still a compassion thing. A mood after playing San Andreas or Saints Row 2 is better in my case than the mood from GTA 4 5 or Saints Row 3 4.. Those late games provide less than pretends and sometimes even hollowing your emotions rather than provide you with some new and strong ones.So let's come to the mark thing. I'll give GTA V a 7.5/10 for the amount of work they made. Minus point is for hollowing unlikely characters minus point for an overall creepy atmosphere GTA V providing. Even the radio was worse than usual oh mate that's a disaster!",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-12,0,0,725,False,Not Recommended,"Despite the fact that I still play GTA V's Online it just really isn't worth it anymore.It just takes so long to get money to spend on anything anymore there's a neat car that's just shaped like a ramp that's fun to mess around with friends but it's $3 000 000. but you still need to spend another $2 000 000 in order to get a 'suitable' place to store it which you can't even buy until you also buy a $2 000 000 Office building.That's $7 000 000 for a below average car shaped like a ramp 100 real life dollars will get you only $8 000 000.The servers are so insanely fragile and I've never seen a game have these same problems I have never ever had to open any ports for any other game and Rockstar insists it's necessary for Online and it still doesn't fix any issues anyway.It's impossible for new players to get anywhere in online now because Rockstar just milk the game for money.The only time the game gets anywhere near fun is if you're using over the top high end vehicles which are near impossible to get without spending extra money on them.Rockstar has put very little effort to get rid of any of the negative parts of the games and only puts their effort into more and more cars with arbitrary limitations that you either must spend more money than you spent on the game itself to GET STARTED or grind out the same missions over and over and over again for a fraction of what the time spent doing it is worth.The game honestly just isn't worth it. the servers are so fragile and it just takes so long to earn anything that comes close to fun that it's just not worth playing the game at all.EDIT Nice a few updates later and literally cannot connect to a friend who lives in the same state.

It perfectly blends silliness and seriousness much like Saints Row 2 did thanks to its fantastic characters writing setpieces and world. Good god GTA V's San Andreas one of the greatest open worlds I've ever seen. I can't begin to imagine how much work went into it. And it's still a fantastic game with so so much fun stuff to do in free roam alone.But the multiplayer does not play kindly to those who don't pay. Everything is a grinding hell unless you're willing to pay up to the Star's bank account. There's horror stories of innocent people getting barred out by Rockstar and hackers roaming free and causing trouble for normal people who then get locked out by Rockstar. Hell there's the time they even locked out the single player modders who they used to embrace. GTA Online isn't GTA Online it isn't about a bunch of free roaming criminals jacking cars and causing mayhem it's about who can shoot the most rockets at each other or use instakill pay2win lasers.Actually scratch that.

Feels pretty ingenuine and dishonest to me but I guess that's how they roll.Rockstar is banning people who use mods in singleplayer. This mean if you use a silly little mod that does absolutly nothing other than change the character you're playing as (Trevor for example) into a penguin so you can watch a hilarious little penguin going around and robbing cars (and screaming profanities like Trevor does) that's enough for Rockstar to ban you.I'd completely understand them bannning people if they were modding things in multiplayer (taking advantage invincibility cheats or something) but that's not the case. Modding the singleplayer offline game that nobody but you gets to see and play is grounds for a ban from their multiplayer services.The game is good otherwise but with draconian practices like this I can't reccomend it.The ironic thing about all this is that people who are cheaters or have malintent were hiding their hacks from the start. That means people who wanted to cheat hid their hacks so they can continue to play online without Rockstar banning them.

2015-05-14,0,0,1026,False,Recommended,"It's been a while since I've been this enamoured with a game before. The world is incredibly detailed the graphics are incredible and really well optimized it's so far ahead of the console versions in every way. The online is great especially if you have friends to play with. The heist missions are a lot of fun and so are the online races. The single player story is phenomenal. I love all the characters and how dynamic it is that you can switch between them and see how their stories separate and join together again. Each mission including the non story missions feels like its own thing. It's not repeatitous like most sandbox game quests are. The world is filled to the brim with random encounters that you can have with random people on the street and elsewhere. The driving mechanics are solid. Planes and helicopters are easier to fly in my opinion but turbulence now exists in the game which can make things a bit trickier if you aren't used to piloting in games. The water physics is beautiful. The world has so many different types of environments to it. The world itself is absolutely huge. The city alone is about the size of previous GTA games let alone all the wilderness there is. Driving around is never boring no empty expanses like in San Andreas. My only complaints is that some of the rewards for missions are a little lacking it seems like its a lot more difficult to make money in this game. Most of the properties you can buy and businesses you can run cost more than you'll ever get back unless you play for a particularly long time and most don't give you a lot of advantages. The rewards for all the types of collectibles are pretty dull and uninteresting and don't really make going out to find them all worth it unless you like doing that sort of thing. The online/lobby session is poorly implemented in my opinion as it's next to impossible to fill a lobby that isn't for anything other than a heist or a race unless you have friends around to play with you which makes a lot of fun game modes go unappreciated and unplayed. ""Quick Job"" which immediately puts you in a lobby for a particular type of job helps a lot but sometimes it will land you in a lobby with someone playing their custom job which is being used to exploit for in game bonuses and unlocks so you have to be careful with that.Besides that it's an incredible game and if your system can handle it (it's pretty graphically intensive even on minimum settings) I would definitely recommend getting it.

Today they were spawning giant jets lying all over the roads lagging everyone terribly and making it so you couldn't get anywhere. Another popular one is to suddenly teleport everyone on the server to one spot usually the airport and immediately blow them all up. Fun!! Basically everyone just begs the modders for money constantly that's all that's ever going on.If you think it's going to end or get better think again. Rockstar has no interest in stopping this. These modders buy all the toys with their hacked money and then play ""legit"" for a while killing everyone with their jets and tanks and miniguns. It gets plenty of people so worked up and angry they go buy shark cards to keep up. HACKING IS A MONEY MAKER FOR ROCKSTAR DON'T BE FOOLED. Hacking drives sales. It isn't going to get better.After a couple years of watching videos of folks playing GTA V Online and having been a huge fan of GTA in the past I decided to built my first PC in over 15 years and trying playing games again.

2016-06-20,0,0,383,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE GTA V publisher Take Two has served a Cease and Desist to the makers of OpenIV a major modding tool necessary for asset modding. Don't buy this game or any of their other products.I'd rather put a ""thumb sideways"" than ""not recommended "" but that doesn't exist. Rated down for the annoying updates that seem designed to break all the mods for the game updating every few days without adding new things to SP while being required to play at all. All in all GTA V is a fun game. That doesn't make its business model not a piece of though. If you have the money it's probably worth it but this game shouldn't be a high priority. Wait for a sale.PROS Reasonable story mode Plenty of fun gameplay when completing the single player Apparently a lot of replayability in the multiplayer*CONS Rockstar (or maybe Take Two) has a taste of the microtransactions so they've ed the SP in favor of Online where people can buy in game money for RL money***I haven't played much of Online because by the time I started playing everyone was level 200+ and had weapons that could 1 shot me. I tried grinding in private sessions but that's incredibly boring. And I'm not going to spend $60+ more just to buy the end game content.**The last few updates (pretty much all since the game's been released on PC) have not even added content to SP and they specifically blocked new cars from being spawned in via mods (although there's a fix for that) and new weapons from being saved in your loadout (so you have to script loadout systems). Additionally they've stated they're not adding new heists and expansions like in IV are apparently not going to happen either. Overall the singleplayer is enjoyable (although a few sections are a bit annoying gameplay wise although they make sense in the story) with heists being particularly fun and online seems fun too although it's a bit to late to join in now without paying out the It's a shame Rockstar C&amp D'd those multiplayer SP mods and the others haven't been updated.Edit also playing online as a low level scrub is terrifying quickly dashing outside to do missions before someone kills you with lock on missiles. Haven't played long enough to see hackers. Finally I changed my review to negative because of how much of a POS the online made the game for people who prefer the singleplayer.",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-25,0,0,1012,False,Not Recommended,As much as I would like to reccomend this game at this point I can't. The graphics are stunning the SP story is deep and enjoyable if anything it feels short. What makes this game anymore is the online portion. Nothing quite beats running around with a group of friends trying to accomplish sometimes seemingly impossible odds and overcoming or just hooning around Los Santos with a set of supercars. However like so many others state the game is plagued by griefers game crashers and other not so nice individuals. You can go private however more than half the ways you would be able to make any money in this game are now neutered. R* wants to force you into risking everything against the others in the most insane PvP sessions there can be. For a game that has always been about the money it's become increasingly ridiculous. For a long while the T20 was king at $2 million however that creep has jumped to $5 million for the new Ruiner 2000. You want to earn money? Sure there's heists which haven't been updated in forever you can sling drugs or counterfeit goods or move packages all while being forced to run like hell and hope you don't have someone in your sessions just itching to ruin your chances. You want a house? How about the new office? How about the garage for that office? Keep paying out. $3M 5M 10M the creep is unending. The game either makes you want to cheat and use mods to gain money or you best have the best damned heisting crews and go at it non stop to afford the lifestyle which the game always puts just out of your reach. Buy more cards buy buy buy. That $100 card you bought to give you $8M? That could be spent on one car and maybe a few mods if you aren't totally careful or how about that yacht which does nothing but look at you off the coast. I really enjoyed the game I did but I can't reccomend this game to others right now while the amount of money or time you need to spend grows exponentially. If you have a lot of disposable income and wish to spend a few months salary playing catch up go for it but you've been warned.,Grand Theft Auto V

I heard about how RDR2 took 6 years to produce and write and put out. But that's hilarious the game is awful and so is this one. From hackers running rampant in online matches to just general s shooting people for no reason in free roam there isn't a single play rockstar missed an moment to try and sell you shark cards or other balance breaking 'starter packs'. Really sad to be just trying to hold up a convenience store and then some guy on a flying rocket bike with homing missiles and miniguns decides he wants to my day up. What can I do? Find a new game put on passive mode and then be insulted. For what people make this game out to be it's really ing bad and if kids are playing this then I'm sure Rockstar should be charged with contributing to the delinquencies of minors.Holy R* I can't believe you guys. This game is not a game it's an avenue to sell Shark Cards I swear R* sponsors people with those ing flying bikes so you're enticed to buy their fake money. FDA should really investigate these sorts of practices especially concerning the minors who constantly play this game which also involves completely pointless but graphic sexuality involving prostitutes. Seriously do not understand the pedistal this game is put upon despite it being lousy with bugs and difficult to the point of rediculousness so they can sell some shark cards. Kind of crazy seeing as they made a ton of money just on the game sales the first time then the second time as well. Getting sick of greedy as devs who can't develop their way out of a paper bag. Uninstalling this garbage pile right now can't believe there haven't been any additions to survival maps.Oh and by the way no one at all is playing this game on the PC whenever you look to find any kind of lobby it asks if you want host when you that you just keep waiting there's no way to initate games on your own you just wait with a timer on your bottom right corner of your screen and then some guy shoots you for not reason whatsoever and then it doesn't even matter when they have to pay the insurance because either they're a tryhard with shark cards or they're a hacker. OH YEAH. The hackers I haven't been in a game lobby without one unless its one of those game lobbies that's just had everyone leave all of a sudden due to r* poor netcode which they've been relying on for I guess 6 years now. I wouldn't be at all surprised if the same netcode went into the failed project that was RDR2 Online Beta. Mark my words next title by these guys is gonna' go the same way as Fallout 76 Battlefront 2 and whatever is next on the list from completely unethical game publishers and the developers who simply cow down before them because they're and rockstar devs are no different absolute mongoloids if you let your game end up like this sacrficing fun for your ability to possibly make money of the random chance someone gets so frustrated they just wanna buy 10 million in game monies. What a piece of garbage in 2018. Can't believe a game can age this poorly but then again it's like if a wine was sitting on a shelf and then an came by and uncorked in it then recorked and said ""I'll sell a cheese that takes the taste out of your mouth along side this wine."" Waiting for when RDR2's online beta is over and they start selling buffallo cards or something equally as ing insulting. Hope this norweigen company gets gulag'd by activision. Serves them right. PS.

I've only played single player so that's what this guide is focused on.The game starts off following the storyline of three career criminals from very different backgrounds that somehow manage to make an effective is not extremely violatile team. I can honestly say I enjoyed the storyline of all the characters and found myself actually liking certain NPC's that I found ingame. The game's an incredible sandbox and alot of detail has been given to the map to make every area feel unique and realistic. The side missions are great distractions from the storymode and they don't break immersion in the game. The game has a variety of good music to listento. The dialogue is excellent and pokes fun at all sorts of hypocrsy's and throws in witty jokes for those with the ear to listen. The map is absolutely huge and has a variety of diverse areas. I enjoyed the gameplay both the gunplay and the fast cars. Each character has unique abilities that dictated different playstyles of the player. So if you're feeling the urge to speed around the city in a brand new custom job car you use Franklin. If you're in the mood to go on rampages through the city you pick Trevor and if you're in the mood to be more sniper/stealthy secret agent type you pick Michael. Con Every game has flaws. Flying. I felt like this game deliberately made flight controls difficult. The AI sometimes cheats to find your character instead of using line of sight or sound.And that's about it. I had a blast with this game I wish it was longer but plan on replaying it again soon for a more completionist playthrough. I wa personally a fan of the character Trevor. Very good game I highly recommend it.,Grand Theft Auto V

While it does feature some interesting heists missions and gameplay the grindfest it is ruins everything. I can understand to a certain extent having a certain micro transaction system for a ""Game"" that receive free updates but Rockstar has done so that getting a good majority of any special content of an update (New buildings special weaponized vehicles etc...) Cost around $30 000 000 per updates.That's 281.25 of Sharkcards per update. You would think they would add more ways of making money. But to reach just 1 000 000$ here's your solutions Farm and Refarm missions rewarding you around 25 000$ for a mission that can take up to 20 minutes to complete. That's up to 800 minutes of gameplay or 13 hours.You'd say ""Seems fair you have to earn it""? But remember rich people can just buy a of shark cards (Accurate name seeing how they're sharking us) buy special vehicles that can one shot anything and transform these 13 hours into an endless loop of pain and frustration.Grindfest apart even Blizzard and Valve together manage to make more proper balancing to something than Rockstar can. If you're planning to buy a giant military plane to show off you're better off buying yourself a golden as a small flying bike can fire more rockets in a minute than all of history's rockets artilleries have fired throughout the ages.The balance choice doesn't make sense. A ing car with 2/3 metal sheets on its side can withstand more direct hit rockets than an actual tank can.So in a TL DR SP is good Online is only good with friends for heist.

2017-08-24,0,0,72,False,Not Recommended,I have been playing games on pc since before i graduaed high school. I never had any issues. I recently started playing watch dogs 2 online and it is alot of fun. I was hoping this community would be fun too. It was fun for the hour i got to play online. All the hours after that were spent trying to play while the same guy kept gunning me down at spawn or right after spawn. I couldnt even move from spawn half the time before i was dead. I logged off and tried again and another guy did the same thing. I have never had this issue in any other game before that had online elements. I am returning this game and maybe will try again once they add a way for freshly spawned people to get away from spawn before having a marker on the map.

I'm just hoping none of my progress will be effected.. Rockstar needs to start listening to people and do the following A) Create USER HOSTED LOBBIES for those wanting to use mods online with friends weather it be something as simple as a ""Real Drift Mod"" or full blown ""Mod Menu's"" so users that wish to do so can But leave ""Rockstar Official Lobbys"" with a ""ZERO TOLERANCE FOR MODDING"" These lobbies would be vital for content creation with friends using the ""Rockstar Editor""B) Allow Car Models..

If you have a group of 3+ friends to mess around with then this might be the game for you.. just bear in mind that if you see another player there is a 99.99999998% chance that they will kill you.. The Extreme lack of money in the game and the main source of money ( The Heist's ) is one of the most abysmal executed game designs we have ever seen... plus they have pretty much removed the choice of giving your friends some of the cash they just helped you earn while doing the second main source of income ( VIP/Missions/CEO ). Also takes about a week of ingame grinding to get a midrange car with upgrades..... You will also need the luck of all gods from all religions and more inorder to not get banned for nothing within the first 5 steps youve taken in GTAOnline. ( but we won't go into the mess that is their banning system )If you are one of the 1% of gamers that only play singleplayer games then DO NOT get this game.. although the story is good and the graphics at times are stunning... Its lacks that panache you's require there is no replay ability with is one.. the story just lacks this and grinds on your heart and soul which inturn will make you go outside and sit in that bright beautiful light of what we call THE SUN.This is NOT GTA San Andreas ....

So many people got a ban without any reason but the modders out there don't get banned because Rockmorons aren't capable of doing their jobs. I guess they just can't handle work and all that in their mouths at once. Don't buy this game if you plan on playing fair and expect not to get a ban one day because some of them was choking on a while trying to ban someone. At least the singleplayer is nice.

And I try to report and catch the cheater in the game. And why you guy did not ban guy AFK in set up heist or job and bully who kill attack player Non Stop and real cheater who make player live hell in game.I think I will stop playing GTA 5 because the game broken as hell right now because it ban the innocent player and not the cheater hacker troll or bully. + many of the game breaking bug is still there for some reason it still there and more bug form the new heist. you know what's the saying if it's not broke don't fix it. at this rate I rather play game like COD WWII or battlefield hotline.

2018-03-28,0,0,213,False,Not Recommended,"After over a hundred hours of t I finally made up my mind about this game. I absolutely love GTA but the worst thing that ever came to the series is online play. Now I believe GTA 5 is a great game with so much effort put into it and it deserves all praise it can get .... except for GTA Online. Much has been said about GTA 5's online mode and some of it probably will be repeated here but after 160+ hours on this game I can safely say I loathe the online portion. Not being a fan of playing with strangers online in general it feels even worse when the game becomes a jerk simulator where you can't actually enjoy the world without having to suffer from a random stranger's sudden bout of autism trying to compensate for their lack of virility with a Shark Card bought metal bird of death. Seriously one of the worst things about GTA Online (dickish players) is fuel by an equally bad thing the possibility of buying power with their fat IRL wallet.If that's not some kind of pay to win I have no idea what it is. Like many other poor souls before me I tried advancing in the online game I tried earning the impossible amounts of money required to invest in businesses and military vehicles but it's seriously impossible to advance at a steady pace. Everything's ridiculously expensive and businesses don't even feel they're worth the investment. I can't seriously see how you can justify spending over 3 millions GTA$ for a fully upgraded business running at its maximum capacity that will net you no more than 80 000 GTA$ an hour assuming you sell your stock in Los Santos and that some of the dickless jerwads mentioned above won't destroy all your hard work with their expensive fighter plane/helicopter.This game is too grindy for its own good because of this modders keep roaming the servers and giving players cash that anyone who's not willing to fork over real money for Shark Cards would have to grind for months to get. Even the idea of doing heists feel like a hassle because you need a solid group and you need to do setup missions and you'll have to go through all this over and over again so you can scrounge up enough green to get the cool stuff. This is seriously ridiculous.So I'm not recomending this game because of this because of all those expensive features you either have to grind for or that you can get by paying real money. More personally I don't recomend it unless you enjoy being a jerk using your virtual power to annoy other players. Red Dead Redemption had ""Friendly"" servers so why not this? Because Rockstar apparently has a very high tolerance for toxic players with a superiority complex. I play a game to enjoy all its features but unfortunately the online portion does its best to be as unattractive as it can be.Seriously unless you're one of those guys with no pride in life other than people off for no reason stay away from this cesspool of a game. Otherwise log in and find some other jerks. I promise you that you'll have a taste of your own medicine.",Grand Theft Auto V

Bob Seger Night Moves started playing on the radio. 10/10But really there are so many little things about this game that will make you crack up it's worth it just on that alone.

2017-07-06,0,0,616,False,Not Recommended,This was a great game. But the rise of overpriced additions to the online mode and the successful attempt at dousing the creativity of anyone trying to bring new life into the singleplayer mode which has been neglected for so long so that Rockstar and Take Two Interactive could squeeze more money out of the player base has brought this game to a most awful demise. I still play this game but for a minimal amount of time. All of my friends used to play this game and it would be a centre of interaction between us. But now most of us have become mainly disinterested and the only ones who still play it are those among us who can afford the additions to the online mode.This downfall is what greed and an obsession with money can do in business and most importantly in gaming.,Grand Theft Auto V

No Defaults for user preference settings (e.g. Racing NO RADIO STATION) it doesn't even care to remember your previous settings. 2. Automatically defaults you into populated lobbies after a job. If I wanted to be in a populated server I WOULD HAVE SELECTED IT FROM THE START!3. Single Player Required DRM (Is this still working out for anyone? Apart from steam.)4. Friendlist is less than intuitive. While I get they want you to manage things with your phone. It would make sense to have those options that don't tie directly to YOUR CHARACTER but your account in the game over menu. (Your element is in the wrong spot!)

2016-04-26,1,14,777,False,Recommended,I have always been a huge GTA fan. My introduction to GTA was through Vice City when I was a kid and thinking back now really brings back the memories of how amazing and fantastic that game was. I originally owned GTA V on PS3 a year or two back but upgraded to PC for obvious reasons. I was on a laptop and was worried GTA V would be far too much for it to handle. It was only recently a friend let me download and try GTA from their account (Love you Geronimo &lt 3) and surprise surprise it actually runs good on my laptop. But enough of that.On PC GTA V is just perfect. The graphics are so amazing and the possibilities are endless. The main thing I do is play modded GTA V LSPDFR. It is extremely fun and addicting to play the opposite side of GTA and while Rockstar may not be happy with modders I am very thankful for them.GTA V's story is keeping in line with its older brothers although I will say this story is very unique in that you play as THREE different characters and throughout the story they slowly intersect. When they meet this leads to epic missions with either two or all three of them in which you can switch between them in the mission.The main characters are the complete opposites of each other and it's simply hilarious and brilliant. Out of the three Trevor is my favorite. Rockstar did an amazing job putting this crazy psychotic character together. The sh*t he does and says will have you rolling. While Trevor can be intense and very different from most people's tastes I think the best part about him is that he is this crazy law breaking Redneck hipster.All in all GTA V is an incredible game and I love it. However there are two things.1) GTA Online is pure cancer. Every single lobby is full of either people that hack/cheat stalk you and continually kill you people in tanks/jets etc. GTA Online can only be properly played with friends. There is peaceful mode but that does not stop people as there other things they can do.2) While Rockstar may not want to pay the real life vehicle makers to use their vehicles in game I find it sad that Rockstar is unable to make the vehicles look real. I've downloaded vehicle mods for all the police vehicles and all of the mods are far more accurate. The Police Stanier is a perfect example. It's supposed to look like a Crown Vic but it's not as close as it could be to being accurate.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-14,0,0,258,False,Not Recommended,Ok so. Let's break this down. In essence the game is really well done. It's beautiful and it does a very good job of displaying a parody of californial life....Then you go online. And for a bit everything seems okay Then you start to realize just how much of an effort R* puts into making sure you absolutely CANNOT make decent money without buying their sharkcards. From NPC Civilians deliberately trying to crash into you while you're sourcing or delivering vehicles to the lack of regulation for the difficulty of your buisiness jobs I.E. A solo C.E.O Sourcing a car that will be hunted by helicoptors with no chance of a solid defense. The online portion of the game is a wasteland of bad choices and deliberate measures put into place to make it as trivial as humanly possible to make money And that would be fine if rockstar actually looked like they cared about the overall status of it's online play. And maybe they do on other consoles but it does seem like the PC players are getting shafted by more modders less fun and a complete silence form the company that keep in mind has no problem taking as much money as possible from the fanbase while releasing little to no TRUE content to the game. Single player DLC was shut down long ago and doesn't look like it will ever be a thing And while originally there was some decent content poured into the online play with DLC such as the heist DLC. Recently theres little to no REAL content being put in. And it can be argued that the bunker was put in but is it really that content or is it reskinning buisiness's like the cocaine lockup? I stand by the latter. And while it is understandable that the company is looking forward to their new games the lack of creative inspiration and overall fleecing of the fanbase. GTA V is not sitting in a very pretty spot. Which sucks because GTA has been a mainstay of my entire life. I can't stand by these practices. But that's my opinion. I hope that in the future Rockstar takes the time to look back at the behemoth they created and give it some more love. But as it stands the game no longer deserves to be sold under a 60$ pricetag. The online play is a mess and quite aggravating. If you're looking for an amazing single player story go ahead pick it up. The story is well worth experiencing for yourself if you haven't. But since it's 2017 and most people already know the story of T F and M. The lack of any meaningful singleplayer DLC should be a huge turning away point. And if you're looking for fun meaningful online gameplay with your friends and others just keep moving this game will only hurt you.,Grand Theft Auto V

Well here goes nothing...Firstly no I do not recommend this game... Before I explain myself let me just preface that this review has absolutely nothing to do with the multiplayer since I haven't put a single minute of playtime into it. This review is solely focused on the single player experience. Also maybe if you asked me if I would recommend GTA 5 maybe closer to the release i might have said yes just because of all the hype surrounding it blah blah blah...Anyways on with the review already I'll start by mentioning all the things this game obviously does very well The graphics and attention to detail are phenomenal and this shouldn't be a surprise considering the massive budget it had for development. Heck i would feel ripped off if it was short of anything other than looking amazingly good and detailed. IT is a technical marvel that's for sure. There is a large open world for you to explore and a lot of things in that world that you can interact with although the level of interaction feels quite shallow...Now for the bad As I left off in the last paragraph Yes there are many things to do and 'stuff' to accumulate but it all feels so pointless and disconnected from the characters and subsequently you the player. Money is so easy to accumulate that the value of it becomes absolutely meaningless. You can buy stocks and businesses but your interaction with them is so surface level it leaves you wondering why it's even a feature in the first place. As for the storyline while I found some of it mildly interesting no matter how nuanced or pre tensed the backstory for every character was it was all completely negated from the fact that none of them were relatable or had rational motivations for what they were doing at all. I can hear you saying ""but it's over the top and ridiculous"" ""It doesn't have to feel relatable"" and maybe you are right but for me personally it never felt fun or interesting after the first 3 hours pf gameplay. I have tried my hardest to return to this game on multiple separate occasions to finally complete the storyline but it becomes so boring repetitive or completely barren of any meaningful activity that I simply can't.This game to me is a classic case of too much hype and expectation that it just failed to deliver on every front save the graphical and technical aspects of it. Don't get me wrong I have been entertained while playing GTA 5 and there are plenty of those 'golden' memorable moments for example I still love the sense of humour this game has. All in all though GTA 5 did not do a good job at convincing me what it wanted to sell me... (If that makes any sense)",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-02,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,Mediocre heavyhanded writing combined with an online mode that ascribes to a scummy freemium gameplay model leads to a game that is constantly telling you how it's manipulating you while it's manipulating you.The writing relies very heavily on shock humor constantly pushing the boundaries of how far you'd expect the game to go but even if GTA V's noteriety didn't already prepare you for what to expect then roughly an hour in story mode will. After that the game is an endless parade of shock value punchlines falling flat and political and social satire with all the subtlety and nuance of a tire iron to the kneecap. Even Trevor arguably the best written of the three protagonists becomes repetitive and irritating over time as the same lines about American socioeconomic values get shoved in your face over and over again.The game is essentially a mass of small annoyances not one of them big enough to truly get you to stop playing. The long loading times shakey server connections multiplayer missions and heists that yield not quite enough cash while also demanding near flawless teamwork to complete the aforementioned obnoxious sense of humor the inflated prices of just about everything... All of this can be overlooked but one gets the sense that the game is intentionally remaining just within tolerable levels of irritation.I found it applying the same sort of pressure that mobile games gave me the same pressure that led me to deleting all of those apps off my phone and now GTA from my hard drive. While the story satirizes the glitz shallowness and materialism in American culture the online mode gleefully partakes in encouraging that very mindset. Money is earned too slowly and spent too quickly to be anything other than the carrot dangled in front of our noses just out of reach unless you're willing to spend real money but even that will not help because nothing satisfies for very long in this game. No tricked out car no fancy apartment no business or bunker or what have you will make you feel like you've actually accomplished something in this game because what doesn't lose its novelty after five minutes becomes yet another form of grinding.It's insidious and depressing and frankly I recommend either getting out as soon as possible or never going in to begin with. I did have some fun playing with my friends but those moments were too far between and cluttered with a myriad of connection issues samey missions and frustrating heists. Save your sixty dollars and go watch the Achievement Hunters play it instead. It's cheaper and you'll have more fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-26,0,0,284,False,Recommended,I ve always wanted to write something interesting on GTAV but also I ve been struggling with figuring out what to write and with my poor choices of words.Therefore I d like to apologize in advance in case my words don t appeal to whoever is reading this. Apparently it s (one of) the best game that I ve ever played.That I myself playing gtaiii since I was a kid left me unforgettable memories. Pity those days are gone. Enough with nostalgia as usual I m not gonna talk about how the story goes or analyse the characters within our 3 protagonist.There are plenty of articles on the internet. Anyways apart from the long loading which is really frustrating it only took me a few minutes to immerse myself in this open and non real digital city. I do enjoy my free roaming and exploring. Later did I know the fact that there is no such city in a movie that we can see a world so detailed like Los Santos or even live to be so overwhelmed by its noise loneliness and deprivity. And Rockstar rocks.They made the best story and the best city there ever is.No one can deny. Michael De Santa Trevor Philips Franklin Clinton. The last time I ever saw the characters in games such full of fresh and blood were in The Call Of Duty Modern Warfare series Ghost Soap Price etc. And now here. You can see Los Santos is an imaginary city based on Los Angeles but who are the prototypes of the Michaels three?Guess we ll never have to find out ThreeMan Army against the whole world and became billionaires. American Dreams. Anyway Roaming fighting crimes killing innocent heisting paparazzing air force tank sports motor sports American Truck Simulator Uber taxi driver etc and even have sex. That size of game files doesn t fail its content Gtav is a true masterpiece. Violence is the soul of the game It has never changed. Just as violent as the story can be instead of the NPCs in Online Mode the perpetrators may be as far as the malicious players themselves(hacker) or perhaps the officials who ban normal players who never cheat(of course hackers deserves to be banned for good). I can relate to how our prides are being deprived how hackers mess with us by exploding our vehicles with us in it how we get banned for no reason. Therefore we send out our complaints and curse whoever there is to hell. It s not a bad way actually. On the contrary how else are we supposed to do to make them hear us out more effectively? But violence in real life isn t the end it seldom is the solution maybe it works fine in games.we can t play fire with fire it s us who get burned in the end. To Michael Trevor Franklin. Life has never been easy on them nor it is fair and just.Sometimes we are just like them no matter how upstart we think we are how we consider ourselves above the crowd reality just slaps right into our face till we realize we are weightless of little importance like ants except many of us are lucky we have someone who loves us. Therefore do yourself a favor avoiding trouble is advisable actively leave this session if there are hackers. So a dilligent bee like me I d go registering as a CEO and steal vehicles then sell them .Speaking of which a friend of mine has recently purchased some warehouse and started his own bussiness.How envy I m of him since a CEO in GTAV is the best thing I could do or rather I m not really suited to run a bussiness. Los Santos a city where the night never ends The title may be the best describtion of it maybe not even close. I really enjoyed my time in this digital city with the other 3 of my friends with whom I stayed up till late in the night heisting the pacific bank to grind currency and talking about trifles. And I ve also met a few really friendly players who helped me during my transition from an adorable stupid newbie.My gratitude goes to all of them ThreeMan Army we are military. And we made a great team.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-09,7,31,38,False,Recommended,GTA V finally lands on PC after smashing several world records in the entertainment/gaming world and boy it was worth the wait.Sporting improved visuals more than 150 new songs online improvements and tons of new additions this is THE definitive version.Pros amazing visuals considering this is an open world game with a massive map and basically no loading screens newly introduced first person view looks good and controls well top notch sound design spot on voice actors a plethora of radio stations to choose from (you can put your own mp3 in too) good and unobtrusive soundtrack to punctuate certain game moments all three main characters are extremely well written and fun to play side characters are also really well done lots of customization options clothes glasses car colour/tuning hairstyles/ beards. engaging plot the game functions as an effective satire of today's America and the way it goes to do it is extremely fun a whole new world in GTA Online for you to play with others basically a game within the game ability to switch between mouse and controller on the fly helps alot fun gameplay overall while probably shorter than previous GTA titles it makes up for it with higher quality missions this quality extends to side missions aswell. Heists are especially exhilarating and tense. tons of extra things to do side missions activities collictables business to own (some with their own side missions/collectibles) Los Santos feels alive pedestrians go on about their business and react realistically to what happens police chases criminals ambulances try and save casualties several places offer extra activities movies tv shows play regularly on tvs heck you even get a lively internet with sites to browse videos and a few side mission opportunities.Cons a few vehicle and world textures remain horribly low res very few annoying points in certain missions due to stunt jumps or unclear directions with the world map being so large sometimes driving to a mission can get a bit dull first person view usefulness is generally a bit limited might need a bit of fine tuning (both ingame and in your gfx menu/windows priority) to work smoothlyGTA V is a game everyone'd try at least once and for a few hours it provides an amazingly fun experience and manages to keep its quality for its whole duration no matter if you're doing a main mission or just randomly driving around.I had no problems buying it full price and playing through it again despite having done it already when it first came out on consoles.Yes it's THAT good.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,2,7,178,False,Recommended,Alright I cant not recommend this game for its pure cathartic fun value and stress relief carnage. Its almost the perfect summit of theraputic violence any video gamer could ask for hardcore or casual. Almost.(tl dr at bottom)The reason for that huge lump of salt in its entirety is the Hostile NPC AI and wanted level systemTo properly explain this first let me quickly summarize GTA in its essence since the original for those in need of refresher or any new recruits to this wonderful sandbox. GTA has been since the beginning criminal behaviour followed by wacky antics and shootouts resulting in difficult but film esque police chases between clueless motorists on a freeway and cars that occasionally flip start on fire and explode (Sometimes detonating the entire highway) ultimately resulting in a grim and humbling lesson of the hardships of crime or sometimes just a dude trying to finally make it.Alright so.The wanted level system in this game shaves off a star from what Im used to the 6 star system from San Andreas (most recent gta I owned played a fair bit of GTA4 back when it came out and oh god so much vice city) where your notoriety or wanted level scale in intensity with accumulated 'stars'. This is no biggie. You pick up one star for yanking a guy from his vehicle so they try to arrest you another for bumping a cop car as you flee as they start to shoot another for returning fire its pretty simple.But thats not the issue here.1 Star wanted level sets cops off to swarm you immediately and employ overwhelming lethal force. Im talkin shotguns and all that Still no big deal right? This next bit is the thing that sorta breaks the deal for me and really sucks a lot of the fun out of it. 2 is more or less double the numbers of 1 star with a lot more emphesis on shotguns. 3 stars gets you an armed helicopter with a very large view range making it near impossible to escape police set up roadblocks and spike strips and attack en masse. 4 is almost guaranteed death 5 is almost guaranteed death except with heavy swat vehicles and assault rifles.That in mind.Here is a short list of things that can get you a 1 or 2 star wanted level from the get go and result in lethal force Loitering Walking too near a police officer Standing near a police officer Following the road rules punching the air punching the air in the middle of the wilderness (I swear to god) Honking your horn using gesture animations littering (keep in mind your character tosses their wrappers / bottles the second they're done with them trash cans arent a thing) Driving past a police station avoiding a fight with a pedestrian jogging checking your phone crashing your vehicle away from others standing in the wrong place waiting for security to open a gate getting attacked by a pedestrian unintentionally intimidating a skiddish civilian NPC getting attacked inside a store (ammunations are the worst ones) shoplifting (asking for it) defending yourself from NPC aggression Bonus if any of those wanted levels result in your death your vehicle is impounded. You have to go near a police station full of the bastidos to retreive your vehicle. Even if you decide to pay the fee legally you could still end up being fired at as you leave with a wanted level. Even more fun? Police have not and from what Ive seen will never use force on NPCs completely ignoring any crimes or murders they may commit. In some cases the police have attacked the player as the result of an NPC fistfight completely unrelated and unknown to the player.I really really wouldnt care normally but it just creates this awful environment where tiny things set off this infinite army of trigger happy holes where defending yourself only makes it worse and then punishes you for even trying. Make no mistake they dont even try to see if you're cooperating. They skip tasers cuffing arresting tickets fines etc and hop straight to delivering mag after mag of hot lead. if in some distant future the game devs decide to add non lethal options in for things like shoplifting or loitering I will gladly keep my mouth shut.tl dr I really really want to have fun with this game I really do. I have fun here and there glimpses of this wonderful game buried underneath a couple terrible stains but I cant in its current form. Really really hoping for an update where thats fixed. It very much so begs for a non lethal setting on police officers or lower numbers or just some delay to which they go from 'apprehend' to 'punch lead holes into',Grand Theft Auto V
2017-03-18,0,0,984,False,Not Recommended,"""Oh look another overpriced update that I'm not going to buy! Looks kinda cool! Oh well!""Singleplayer? A solid 8/10 experience overall that I do recommend. The multiplayer however is complete trash.I used to be a die hard fan of Rockstar but seeing how greedy they've become and how poorly they've managed ""GTA Online"" this single handedly killed all the love and respect I had for them. For a game that's supposedly so active (according to SteamCharts) I don't know why GTAO is such a ghost town even with friends.The majority of your time in Online will be spent waiting. You'll wait 2 5 minutes to connect to a session because Rockstar cheaped out and has no official servers for the player base. Then when you want to do a ""job"" or ""heist"" it takes a moment for the game to reload the world and then if you're lucky you'll have enough players within a few minutes. But most often you'll spend 20+ minutes waiting before finally giving up at which point you disconnect and have to wait another 2 3 minutes for the game to reload the world and connect to another session. If you happen to be lucky and start a heist you'll have to pray that no one disconnects (especially near the end of the mission) or it'll be forfeit and another huge waste of time. Otherwise again you'll get disconnected and wait to connect to another session getting basically nothing for your effort. There's a lot of content available in GTA Online and it blows that almost nothing is available in singleplayer you can spend $100 real US dollars and still not even own a third of the content in GTA Online. Why? Well it's not because there's so much content but because the prices are so insanely inflated and anyone who actually throws away money on this game is either a parasite leeching off their spouse's income a kid using daddy's money or a cuck. The amount of profit that ""Shark Cards"" generated for Rockstar makes me feel pretty envious of Rockstar as well as disgusted by how braindead gamers are today to support this. You'd expect that with the amount of money Rockstar has made they'd have better customer support and anti cheat and although this may not be very GTA like but finally license the vehicles they knock off. Of course they're only interested in maximizing profits to the point that they will try to kill multiplayer alternatives by any means necessary because it potentially hurts their already massive profits. Said multiplayer alternatives improve the experience for players allowing modifications that increase GTA's graphical fidelity adding new content to the game that could or should be present and makes the game run more efficiently all for free but Rockstar and Take Two won't have any of it despite it not interefering with players in GTAO all because of the chance that if players got to see just how dull the overpriced content Rockstar out is they won't waste their money.On another note why Rockstar hasn't added wildlife in multiplayer after all these years is a mystery as it just makes multiplayer even more bland. GTA Online's world is so lifeless once you're out of Los Santos there are no fish or sharks in the water no deers or mountain lions no cats and dogs. It sucks I'll just chalk that up to laziness. With all that said I don't recommend buying it unless you can get it for cheap. If anything pirate it and call it a day you aren't missing out on anything when it comes to the multiplayer. I hope all this bites them in the when churn out GTA VI but seeing how gamers today are such cucks now I doubt it.",Grand Theft Auto V

I'd give this game a 8. 7/10It's for sure worth its full price but you should wait till its on sale since this game is always going on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,385,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar is banning players for modding in singleplayer whatr a shame 0/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-07,1,5,430,False,Not Recommended,My review is largely predicated on Online since that's touted as the major feature of this game.I will say that if you want to pick this game up solely on the strengths of SP you should by all means do so since I haven't had this much fun with a GTA since San Andreas or Vice City. It's certainly a far better port than IV was.Indeed if I'm just talking about single player it is a fantastic game. Each character has a great deal of personality and watching them interact with each other throughout the course of the story is amazing.Roaming around the city even after the story is complete is still enjoyable because there are all the fun sidequests (or Strangers and Freaks as they're known in game) collectibles and other things to get ahold of.I will say that it's irksome that it's so difficult to get income (particularly compared to San Andreas where I was able to amass a nice fortune through silly horse betting) but once you have money on hand it's great to just tear around the city. I wish Online was anything like this fun but sadly the desire to monetize online with the Shark Cards means it will never be that way.That being said Online in and of itself is a wonderful concept.I say this with a pinch of salt mostly because the times I've found it wonderful were when I was playing it alone with no one else on the server.As it is you're almost always relegated to playing it with other people which is terrible. Griefers abound whose sole purpose in life seems to be existing just to kill you blow up your vehicles and generally make themselves a complete ing inconvenience. This is somehow less awful than when they start a heist with you because at least if they kill you you respawn. If they play through almost an entire heist or setup only to quit 30 seconds from the ending with nary but a 'HAVE FUN DOING THIS AGAIN' just before they leave and force you to lose all your progress because you have to have every last ing slot full to play a heist for God knows what ing reason you lose all your faith in humanity. It is events like that that make you understand why God is dead. God is dead because he killed himself because he realized what he thought were his finest creations were largely composed of the very worst examples of evil you could ever imagine.Were there the opportunity to simply do all of the content alone or with a carefully curated selection of 'my friends' and nobody else Online would be amazing. As it is it's a terrible festival of the very worst of humanity and it is only the fact that I really want to get through to Pacific Standard that keeps me returning to the game despite the fact that you cannot find a public group worth a damn because they fail given the slightest opportunity and when you do find said group invariably one of them will mock you and quit before the end.Sartre was right. Hell is other people and they all run around in Los Santos.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-05,0,0,143,False,Not Recommended,This game is absolutely fantastic. It's exactly what you might expect from a Grand Theft Auto game and this PC version is certainly the best version. The solo story is interesting and complex the inclusion of multiple characters adds depth both to the story and gameplay and there is plenty of side tracking to do in the new open world they provide. BUT. The online is a bit of a disappointment. Everything in the online experience is very expensive and gaining levels is a chore. You'll find yourself spending days upon days of finding shortcuts and exploits both to leveling and making money. In a word it's a grind. But even if you don't want to take the time to advance in level and unlock more stuff for your character you can be content with just playing in the open servers or with your friends just messing around with the world around you. But be warned the online community is crass and overwhelmed by a troll population. The fun players with microphones are few and far between. But even with all of the butthurt that comes your way playing this game at least there are mods. The mods are what make the PC version worth buying as seen with GTA 4.... Wait what? They ban modders regardless of what type of mod they use? Well what about singleplayer mods? ... They ban those users too? .Well based on the fact that they've limited the best part of having a game on the PC 3/10 would not buy twice again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,1,5,723,False,Not Recommended,To be honest. The game is good. Fantastic even. However. And this comes with a huge mother trucking HOWEVER. The game is let down horribly by Rockstar Support and the horrific load times in online. Because of the open world lobby nature of the game. You leave and enter lobbies like a rabbit on heat. Except it takes exactly 2minutes and 37seconds (with SSDs Samsung evo black) to leave or enter a lobby. You will spend your life waiting in load screens.Next up. If you are the most honest gamer in the world. Go to church 7 times a week. Have a close relationship with your priest after church chior. Despite all this. You will get banned. The game is absolutely rife with hackers You are bound to land up in a hackers lobby . They may dump money on you. Or they may boost your RP against your will. You will get banned. Their automated detection tool does not discriminate. If your stats look awry its curtains for you Johnny.Dont bother appealing. Support response times are in excess of two to three days. Unless you chase via twitter. Even then its about half a day. And you will only be greeted with automated responses by numnuts that have about as much clue as Mr Plum in the Library with the candlestick. Even then i doubt they would see the light.Once they have your money dont expect to get much more than the files on your computer.In conclusion if you have money to burn you can expect about 2 3 weeks of longevity before you either get banned for doing nothing or get bored of loading screens.

2017-02-23,0,0,114,False,Recommended,A GENUINELY UNDERATED STORY tainted only by being unable to own purchased cars within the Story Mode.Regarding GTA Online. People have their opinions but it is undoubtedly one of the most popular MMOs available. Certainly not the best. Having your account set up on The Rockstar Social Club means that people's characters are transferable from Xbox 360 One PS3 PS4 and PC. Since not everyone started on one platform there is a mismatch in levels. If Rockstar's GTA Online continues with Grand Theft Auto 6 we could see new players at Level 1 compete with business owning millionaires at Level 200. I think GTA Online will be expanded in years to come with the release of however many more Grand Theft Auto games in development and other producers will take notice Certainly Ubisoft and EA and we will see a brand new genre sweep the market. The GTA Online. I hope I'm wrong.,Grand Theft Auto V

The pirated version of GTAV brings an exponentially better gaming experience to players with support for things such as mods and custom servers.There is absolutely no reason to purchase this game when the pirated version is better.

2015-05-23,0,0,694,False,Recommended,You're probably going to buy this game regardless of any reviews or have already done so. But I would warn you that the game requires memory both VRAM and RAM. For me it uses about 5 gigs of RAM and around 1.7 gigs of VRAM so make sure you have plenty of memory and a good video card. If you have an old processor like I have an old AMD one you won't be experiencing butter smooth 60 fps gameplay. Regardless the game is still playable the framerate is still rather stable even if low at times. It's much better optimized than GTA4 that's for sure.So singleplayer works rather well what about multiplayer? Not so well. Long loading times bugs exploitable glitches hacking.. to be honest the networking in GTA Online is horrendous when considering the game's budget. Did you like to play with mods in GTA4 multiplayer? Well GTA Online has all kinds of stats and money that is universal so mods are prohibited altogether to prevent cheating this system. Because the client program the game itself has all authority on your online stats Rockstar cannot trust you to inject any kind of code into it.

Sure it does look better on PC but I bought the game because I assumed it would continue its longevity like Skyrim by allowing mods. Which seems to not be the case. The Online version of the games feels like a stripped down version of the single player of the game and with no mods or single player DLC I feel like Ive got very little left to do in the game. It's a shame because I bought my first gaming PC for this game thinking it would have all the cool mods San Andreas had back in the day. I beat it once on console and feel like a first person mode better graphics and online heists isn't enough to warrant the price.

Its that enjoyable.The stock market is a great feature and allows a player to make alot of money fast if he pays attention to whats happening around him at the time in the game.The aircraft feel better than GTA4 to fly.I believe this is the best GTA story yet and you play the game and feel like you are playing 3 different parts/characters to a movie its utterly brilliant.You get to love your characters as there all pretty funny and have unique personalities.Alot of swearing.Not for kids really.Overall an insanely fun game to play hmmm over and over again !Hope you found this review helpful.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,2,5,1213,False,Not Recommended,"Singleplayer didin't have any memorable moments. The heists focal points of the story were fun to some extent. But as the games difficulty was so low being able to kill ANY enemy with one shot the heists became a huge point and click adventure like the rest of the game. I felt that there was no real reason to what you were doing leading up to a ending which i didin't feel connected to in anyway. Being forcefully swaped to another character in the middle of a mission was stupid. Why was it like it? If i had controlled only Nico Bellic in this game i would have felt the same only without the over used charachter switch moments. The game could have been a bit harder and longer. I would say i liked it. Everything what happened was so forced and happened so fast. Huge open world filled with zero great or memorable locations not even then being capable of making the entire San Andreas only mergin some areas together. Driving around became a chore later on in the game. as you literally only drove around in 40% of the missions. I liked the re introduction of highways and the open roads. But the game only had roads. I never took a damn step outside of a vehicle. And you only do it if you wish to roleplay. No detail on the streets just people walking around on top of the same texture. The ""Killzones"" have some detail. as Rockstar tell you to go there and 1 tap the guys there who shoot you.OnlineOh boy. Grind is the word you don't want to hear. especially in a GTA. You grind the same missions over and over and over again to gain some money to buy apartment and a car. The game understood that you can get bored after doing the same mission the fifth time and offers you that you can trade real money for GTA .... After all this maybe your virtual gets bigger and you can show off the you grinder for 100 hours.Heists were boring bringing nothing innovative up. You just kill people but with 3 friends this time.oh sorry 1 friend as everyone gets put in different locations for no ing reason trying to make the SP portions of the game online. I flew around in a plane for 40 minutes in Prison Break heist as 3 other guys were having all the fun on the ground. Best time of my life. And if they up and die. YOU HAVE TO FLY AGAIN.The game still had good stuff in it. You can buy clothes! which the missions reset. You can modify cars which i only did online so you can actually show off as the SP vehicles can't be used in missions.It's like diarrhea it flows. but it's stil EDIT and after 700 hours my account was reset for no reason feels amazing",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-05-29,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,Overall a great singleplayer for what I have played of it. Fairly decent online mode as well fun with friends BUT I do not recommend this game if you only want to play online! Last played about a week ago loaded in my garage and took off with a car down the road game crashed and I didn't feel like waiting for the load time again so I went to play other games. Yet just last night I went to play with friends and my account is banned for no reason! No singleplayer mods or anything else of that sort and Rockstar refuses to even reply other than the same auto message. Very unhappy since I have bought this game multiple times for different consoles and even for two friends of mine. Guess they are just greedy and don't care about a flaw in their auto ban system. Very sad and a waste of money and time now.,Grand Theft Auto V

Unmemorable online game rules almost pay to win microtransactions and most of all cheaters. You can be convicted of cheating even without cheating. Cheaters are using your name to kill players and frame you with that. Aim bots and the wall hacks are the least problem of this game. This game is extremely easy to cheat.If you want a game with good story buy this game. Better on sale. But be careful with the multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-09,0,0,746,False,Recommended,Most of the reviews for this game from other people are for the online mode so I'll stay away from that. StoryNo spoilers here The story for this game is not good but above average. Its just a run of the mill midlife crisis basically. Having three characters make it very interesting though as you can see the different sides of the story from on of the three characters' view. Starting missions where all three characters are in i t for example put you in the different parts of the cutscene when ther character you chose walks in which is pretty cool imo. Roundup Story 7/10GraphicsThe graphics for this game is still holding up pretty well for a game that was originally released on PS3 and XBOX360 in 2013 (and re released for the PS4 and XBONE in 2014) (PC in 2015). It pushes your graphics card to the limits with its great draw distance textures and more. If you have a powerful graphics card you can always install a graphics mod (such as GTA V Redux) and make it look even better. If your pc isn't that powerful GTA V also runs great on older hardware since it was designed to run on the las gen consoles. Roundup Graphics 9.5/10GameplayGameplay for this game is just almost unlimited. Its GTA so you can do pretty much anything anything (such as driving up Mt. Chiliad in a golf cart or fly a stunt plane into the sea). This is a great sandbox game with many things to do. Roundup Gameplay 10/10Worth?Since this game costs $74.99 USD at the time of writing (which I'm positive is a mistake since i preordered this game for $60.99 USD in 2015) I would say you should stay off this game until it goes on sale. It will provide about 30 40 hours of story and take about 100 hours to 100%. As i saidw before this review will not include the online mode (which i spent about 350 / 500+ hours on) since many other people have already covered it.Overall 8.8/10 from me and memes,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,3,15,388,False,Recommended,"Campaign GTA V where do I start? The graphics are rather impressive even on the lowest of low settings and the highest settings are absolutely amazing. Rockstar have done quite a superb job on this Grand Theft Auto although in my opinion it doesn't quite meet the standards of the classic GTA IV but its very close to meeting those standards for sure especially with the online play. The campaign in my opinion seems to lack story it has quite a deverse amount of characters and situations but theres something about it that just isn't right. The characters are certainly interesting and unique but Niko from GTA IV had more of a realistic and intriguing story compared to Michael Franklin &amp Trevor. In the campaign I'm yet to find a bug or glitch yet which is absoutely grand so good work on that Rockstar. I quite enjoyed doing the Triathlons or playing a game of tennis with Amanda it certainly did suck you into the atmosphere of Los Santos something of which most games lack. Online Anyway moving onto the Online play. The character creation system was quite a change from most games and certainly brought a few tears to my eyes when I saw other characters from previous games. But some of the characters you could create just seemed a bit unrealisitc and kind of...crappy. I feel like the online characters required a bit more facial hair options as well as more hair options the character creation &amp styling of your character seemed a bit restrictive. It would've been cool to see maybe a muscle gain mechanic added to the game where you could go to the gym or maybe go for a bike ride or a run and your character is able to gain or lose weight. Talking about customisation the vehicle customisability is amazing! There seems to be a massive amount of colours tints tires &amp a number of other options to choose from on all sorts of different vehicles whether it be a motor bike or a car. While I'm still talking about customisation I'll add a thing or two about the clothes in the game. I'm not even going to lie clothing my character up is one of my favourite things to do in any game. I was very impressed to see the diverse &amp vibrant amount of clothes that was avaliable. (I think I've spent at least 2 3 hours just clothes shopping.) The apartments are a very nice touch to the game as well makes it more atomspheric and calm would be cool if there was a party option where you could invite a bunch of your mates over and just get wasted &amp just so ed up. Anyway last but not least the missions in GTA V Online...most missions are quite nice and balanced surprisingly the heists are by far the best missions to do it would be nice to see more heists added eventually or even if Rockstar allowed the community to create their own heists that would be even cooler! The races &amp just general missions such as ""Meth'd up"" are quite nice quick and enjoyable as well. The only major problem I find are annoying are very minor errors such as when doing heists and you might get stuck at a certain screen or just general server problems but it's expected so I can't really complain. TLDR Pros+Graphics+Online play+Diverse customisability +Self Radio +Large amounts of models+Large &amp interesting enviroment+Cats+Heists+Gun customisation+Smooth driving controls+Suits+Beating the out of cats+Fantastic Soundtrack+Selfies Cons Characters in the campaign don't have good stories Minor server issues Minor mission problems Weird default flying controls Too many characters in campaign No Niko No Roman No BOWLINGBut seriously you should buy this game if you meet the recommended specs it's worth the money.",Grand Theft Auto V

(There are warnings that bad behavior will result in players being pegged as bad sports who are relegated to playing with all the other miscreants but in a game designed to encourage murder and mayhem it's hard to discern where the line is between fair play and being a jerk.) If there's a meaning to be found in Grand Theft Auto Online it's in the way that through depicting a society with no opportunities to do anything constructive or meaningful it underscores the things in our world that actually are meaningful.Sometimes you might be going about your business trying to steal a car for Simeon or maybe just going to buy some new clothes but instead you get stuck in a loop of getting murdered respawning and getting murdered again. You can turn on passive mode so that other players can't gun you down though you can still be a victim of vehicular manslaughter. Violence breeds violence you end up seeing any nearby players as threats and pull out your weapon ready to gun them down before they gun you down. It becomes an unending cycle of pointless slaughter that pulls you away from what you'd rather be doing. Even if some material goods are the only source of meaning you need to motivate you in Grand Theft Auto Online you're in for some frustration because earning money is an arduous process and everything in the game is so expensive. You can easily blow a hefty chunk of change just outfitting yourself with a reasonable assortment of weapons and ammo at Ammu Nation. Saving up for a modest house or a luxury sports car means many many hours spent stealing cars and doing jobs. They say crime doesn't pay and the shockingly small payouts for so many jobs in GTA Online only enhance the feeling that sinking time into a life of crime here is pointless. The meager payouts are likely designed to nudge you toward buying in game cash with real cash. At the low end three bucks nets you $100 000 which doesn't go very far in GTA Online. At the other extreme you can shell out a hundred bucks for a cool $8 000 000 in online dollars.Jobs may not pay much but they do offer an opportunity to escape the insanity of the unstructured life you find on the streets. But you might try to launch a race mission or other activity only to find that no other players will join you preventing you from having the GTA Online experience you want to have. You can also wait for invites to activities from other players or use the Quick Job option to hop right into an activity with other players but you don't know if the activity you'll be tossed into will be a well designed race created by Rockstar or a sloppy event tossed together by another player. There are some good user generated events in GTA Online too like a novelty race I competed in that had us speeding down the highway using huge ramps to leap over train cars that had been placed in the middle of the road and Rockstar is highlighting the better user created jobs with a ""Rockstar verified"" designation but the Quick Job option doesn't seem to discriminate between the cream of the crop and the garbage.Still there's enough of a chance that you'll have a great experience in GTA Online that playing it is worth the gamble. Time and time again the gameplay the setting and the music of Grand Theft Auto Online combine to lend your car chases and shootouts and other in game actions the look and feel of something out of a cinematic crime classic. I love speeding away from another player in a car Simeon wants while the sax solo from Gerry Rafferty's ""Baker Street"" plays or clicking with a team of criminals to efficiently steal a shipment of drugs from some non player characters and then making a clean getaway.There are moments of tranquility too like when you just take a leisurely drive up the coast as the sun sets over the ocean or parachute over the Alamo Sea. Grand Theft Auto Online's greatest assets are still its incredible setting and soundtrack. Los Santos is a city that's ugly and beautiful in the way that real lived in cities are ugly and beautiful. But Grand Theft Auto Online's performance sometimes interferes with your appreciation of the game's best qualities. You might be caught up in the heat of the moment racing against other players as a great song plays on the radio only to have the game hitch up for several seconds.And even on missions other players are as likely to spoil your fun as to contribute to it. On one mission a player screeched and swore at me over his headset to get in the car with him even though it was a sporty two seater he was driving and both seats were already occupied. On another job my teammates and I needed to hijack a boat from the shipyard. I hung back to cover them and pick off some enemies from a distance and they thanked me for my help by speeding off in the boat and leaving me stranded. I didn't mind this it's the sort of betrayal you see happen in any number of crime movies after all but when in a bit of karmic retribution they got killed out at sea my only options were to try swimming my way out to the boat or to just quit the mission and be scolded by the game for my bad behavior. Grand Theft Auto V is never a boring game. I never know quite what the next five minutes will bring and in any given moment I might be thrilled or frustrated or both but I'm always engaged. But because everything is so chaotic and disjointed I can only spend a little time in its world before I need to leave Los Santos behind and return to a place where I feel like my actions might actually mean something.

2017-01-01,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,For a game as praised as this Grand Theft Auto V is surprisingly unexceptional. While I did not touch the multiplayer aspect of the game the story mode is very average and not particularly good at anything.The story itself is forgettable. The characters are made cliche and obscene in an effort to satirize American culture. Whatever the game parodies is painfully obvious from beer to torture. Arguably how GTAV handles many topics is lowbrow.Across the board the gameplay is bland outside of a very few missions. There are games that handle arcadey shooting driving flying etc. much better than GTAV. The game's economy i.e. the stock market and properties has almost no depth. The amount of customization in the game is unimpressive and there's little reason to try most weapons and vehicles.What Grand Theft Auto V offers is a mediocre open world with a lackluster story and lots of uninspired gameplay. There is nothing special in this title to recommend but it's not a bad game. For comparison Red Dead Redemption has a compelling narrative and Saints Row nails the absurd gameplay. Grand Theft Auto V is in the middle lacking either craziness or maturity.,Grand Theft Auto V

(he had played for 30 minutes and bought two shark cards before starting to play (those that were 60 dollars) So i dont think someone who literally WASTES 120 euros on shark cards would instantly start money glitching the first 30 minutes of his playtime.3/4 of us are now banned. Im not but all my three friends are.

2016-07-14,0,0,250,False,Not Recommended,"I could write a novel on this game but I'd really rather not waste my time on something that only a handful of people will ever read. What it comes down to is this GTA V really comes in two parts GTA V Storymode and GTA V Online. If you're playing for the story be prepared for a letdown. Most characters are either flat and forgettable or are so poorly written you'll be cringing for the majority of the game. There's a total of about 3 or 4 heists that you ever do through the game and while the game tries to make it seem like you have options available for how to complete them it's really all novelty and facade. Almost all of your heist profits end up going to some forgettable antagonist of the week anyway so there's no sense of reward or accomplishment when you complete them other than progressing the game. The ending is so tacked on and anticlimactic it triggers my gag reflex just thinking about it.If you're playing for the online please just save your money. The game has become ""grind the same missions repeatedly to make enough money to buy a jet so you can fly around servers and kill everyone with little chance of retaliation."" Those who play the game nonstop will get to a high enough level to be able to buy things like miniguns rocket launchers and .50 cal sniper rifles all of which can be used with little to no skill and will tear apart anyone that actually works a regular job and can't spend their lives leveling up their online character. All heists are either boring or endlessly frustrating with few redeeming qualities at all. With the introduction of the ""Armored Kuma "" players can now play through the game from the safety of a near indestructable supercar. Even if you destroy player vehicles you are forced to spend money to fix it which with the introduction of some of the newer cars can rack up charges of $20 000 which is about how much you make completing a high level mission. Oh but don't worry too much about money. Rockstar has made available Shark Cards which allow you to spend real life dollars to purchase GTA currency. Not only that but they've made every possible attempt to make sure that players cannot share their money with anyone else for any reason whatsoever in order to ensure that they sell more Shark Cards.This whole game is .

2017-02-09,0,0,444,False,Not Recommended,Pros 1. the single player mode is excellent character developments are great each characters are unique almost all the campaign missions are very fun.2. lots of stuff to do in single player many side missions most of them are pretty fun. 3. lots of properties and cars you can own very nice looking tons of customization.4. you can go to strip club and see boobs.Cons Most of the cons are mainly for online content1. connection sucks. ever since the import export DLC update i have been experiencing constant connection issues. i opened all the ports R* tell us to open and turn off all the fire walls when playing game still constantly DC from session. currently i still cannot find a way to cure this problem. and based on xfinity speed test i have over 260MB/S download and 70MB/S upload.2. online session is full of hackers modders and trollsbecause the server is peer to peer and there is no administration in a session therefore it is very hard to control hackers. there was a big ban wave during Christmas but now the hackers are reappearing. hackers controlling your cars and crash you to death. modders spawning tanks and jets in the city and blow you up just for fun. and trolls that had nothing else to do but do everything they can to stop you from finish your missions.3. online items are ridiculously expensiveif you want to play online get ready for a grind fest. a mask which cost 35 in game credits in the single player mode all of a sudden cost you over 10K in online session. i understand that a mask is not a essential item but this price is a little bit ridiculous. 4. it gets repetitiveat first you think the online session is fun because there are so many things to do all the different races all the different heist all the different mission and etc. but soon you realize the only way that can give you guaranteed money income is heist. because in heist people can't rob you and there is no friendly fire. and after the heists it only takes seconds to put the money into your bank account. doing heist is currently the most secure way to get income if you want to buy a big ticket item such as a luxury condo or a brand new super car. Or you can do the missions that R* had created however the highest paid mission Roof Top Rumble only gives you 13500 in 4 mins. so if you want 1 million which is nothing you need to grind the same mission 100 times. unless you are a high level player who already has a ton money saved up at the beginning you really need to grind these missions in order to get what you want. 5. import export DLCthe new DLC brought in a lot of content but also trouble. when you are importing and exporting any goods or cars people can come kill you and steal your stuff. i know this is GTA you are suppose to be killing and causing mayhem but that creates a problem and the problem is you have to have people to play with you in order to protect you during transportation. in reality if you are a real mafia you will never let anyone know what where and when you are trafficking you products. but this is 1 way that R* use to make your life difficult so they can force people to buy their crappy shark cards. so for people who don't have lots of friends to play with all of a sudden import and export doesn't sound all that effective. 5. import export is not for everyone import export DLC requires gigantic upfront cost you need 1 million to purchase the cheapest office YES the CHEAPEST office but the good thing is despite their price all the offices have the same function. then you will need to buy a dedicated car warehouse to store all the cars you have stolen and the cheapest warehouse is 2.3 million. so in total you need to have 3.3 million just that you can start import and export. and each top range car you sell will only net you 80K because you need to spend 20K just to modify the car and the final pay out is 100K. that's assuming your car take absolutely 0 damage during transportation which a lot of time it will be impossible because there will be other players who will try to destroy your car or steal it from you. so assuming you do everything perfectly you still need whopping 40 top range car to recover the initial cost and only after that it is pure profit. ConclusionR* pretty much made this game in the way that you have to play online because the single player content is not enough the missions are pretty short and after you play couple of times you get tired of it. the only way to find new fun is to play online. but as you can see there are lots of problems when play online. I'm not saying online is worthless trust me I do have some fun when playing online. but it's just that the cons outweigh the pros.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,439,False,Not Recommended,The company that owns Grand Theft Auto V Take Two is the most SELFISH company ever known to gamers. Banning mods in GTA5 is the biggest mistake ever taken by GTAV or even Take Two. When people are done and complete single player mode of GTA5 the only thing that keeps them interested in playing GTA5 is the offline/singleplayer mods of which makes the game better for playing entertainment. Take Two has taken this action one of which is the biggest mistake that they have ever done and probably will ever do in order to create more money proit off of the game and to think the 3BILLION DOLLARS that they have made alone by gamers buying the game was not enough. Take Two only wants people to leave their fun in singleplayer and join online/multiplayer vesion of GTA5 in order to increase their money profits of the game which obviously is proving to be the MOST DUMBEST MISTAKE ever to be taken by any gaming franchise. This game is HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED because of the PURE SELFISH GREEDY UNCARING attitude that Take Two has for selling games as they only was them as a source of billions upon billions of dollars and don't care what so ever about the customers of wich purchase their products.,Grand Theft Auto V

What made me put almost 400 hours into this game however was mods. There was a great community making extraordinary mods for GTA V. I found the roleplaying elements I wanted. Features from previous games were restored! I was excited as hell and prepared to play this Rockstar Title to death. Now Take 2 and Rockstar say mods are a illegal infringement of thier publisher rights.

2016-06-22,1,5,77,False,Not Recommended,"First I owned the PS3 version then bought the PC version lured in by some gameplays on youtube.I already finished story mode in the PS3 version (finished as in I got bored by the bland characters without any agency other than ""gotta make that paper brah"" and stopped playing the game because the world was boring and the cops were killing any and all fun to be had) so I basically bought this for online mode.The good things first OptimizationThe game runs great. The Framerate seldom dips. GraphicsIt looks pretty good.Now about the negative aspects. GTA online is a boring grind. I told myself I'd not care about money and levels but it turns out you have to and you have to grind the same few jobs over and over and over to get money and rank points to level up because EVERYTHING is hidden behind a pay and rank wall so tall Trump would tell Rockstar to take it down a notch. The payouts are really poor so it takes you forever to save up money for something you'd like but can't buy because your level isn't high enough. Now I wouldn't mind this if the races were fun but all I get is the same boring supercar race (looking at you congestion charge) over and over then maybe some ""muscle up"" perhaps one or another offroad race but they're all equally dull.Where the hell are the oddball races? Taking rusty tractors down Mt. Chiliad? Racing golf carts on a runway which planes are taking off and landing on? Cycling on the freeway in the opposing lane with traffic on? Helicopter races through the wind mill farm? Faggios through a cow farm? ANYTHING ELSE THAN ANOTHER ""DRIVE THIS EXOTIC SUPERTURD ON THE SAME COURSE YOU'VE DRIVEN ON COUNTLESS TIMES JUST TO GET THAT MEASLY PAYOUT?""Oh"" you'll say ""Just make these races yourself and then host them"".Yeah I'll make them and then grow a nice beard waiting for even one soul to join.

2015-05-05,0,0,82,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 5/26/2017 This game is filled with hackers and Rockstar/Take Two do nothing about it. Most of the game is spent watching loading screens tons of missions are bugged and impossible to complete and the entire racing scene has completely died because there is no point. This game is terrible and anyone who likes it should be drug out into the street and shot. I wish I could get my money back for this garbage. I hope anyone who supports Rock Star and Take Two in the future by purchasing their games dies of cancer them and their whole family.Original Review I bought this game specifically to use mods and contribute to the modding community with my own creations. The online mode sounded very appealing to me as well when reading about it but the actual experience of the online mode leaves much to be desired. Granted this is the first foray into official multi player for the series and as long as it mostly worked I would let it slide. My favorite of this series of games is still the first two before they started forcing clichéd story lines and character arcs down our throats and for the most part the online mode of GTA 5 is a return to that style of gameplay. I'll focus more on this before describing my dereliction from Rockstar altogether.I couldn't jump straight into multi player the game forces you to complete the intro of the single player story for no apparent reason before letting you go online even though the intro doesn't segue or connect in any way to the online experience. This is a poor design choice even for rookies in multi player. After about 15 minutes of single player rushing and skipping cut scenes I was finally able to go online and create what would be my in game persona. Dear god every human you can possibly create looks like an in bred mongoloid. This is because you don't actually create your character you're forced by Rockstar to believe in evolution and choose your parents who all look like apes wearing clothes to form what would be a genetic representation of your character. After this you're given extremely limited tools to fix the disaster that is the belief in evolution and perhaps dress your character to look like some cliched persona (there are plenty of fedora's by the way more evidence that Rockstar wants to force its belief in atheism upon you). There are no body modifications you aren't allowed to gain muscle or weight. Originally I thought it was a default slate and they would let you alter this by working at it like in San Andreas but no you're stuck being an out of shape un evolved caveman or if you choose a woman you'll look like a crack addicted harlot with saggy breasts.The online gameplay is pretty much a grindfest for cash. Race in various ways against other players that don't know how to turn off the default rubber banding so the less skilled players get to cheat by slowing you down They haven't improved the driving since the last game so you either get the car with no traction or the car with traction there's no in between. You can also have shootout death matches with other players in a very under developed battle system. What to do with cash? buy cars that you can steal anywhere but now you're able to paint them and add lights on the bottom. If you grind enough you can upgrade the performance very slightly. You can also get an apartment or condo if you save enough cash to uhh... Actually I'm not really sure what the feature is supposed to be for I guess it's a place to hide from other players but you can just go offline to do that. In fact the only thing worthwhile to do is watch TV which Rockstar poured a ton of effort into. They have full length animated shows on TV. I wish they would have used those resources to put more actual content into the gameplay. If Rockstar wants to make TV shows they should do that instead. They've worn themselves out too thin on this game and it shows. I became bored very quickly online. All the players in the open world are extremely cut throat. The world feels empty even with all the pedestrians and traffic. There's no depth to anything. The heists are fun but the novelty wears off fast and becomes another repetitive task to earn cash. I guess I was expecting more of a ""grand theft auto"" experience. Something like where I could start a gang with some players go steal a car out of the garage of a rival gang's leader and then challenge them to a race for it or have them perform a heist in exchange. Or use our gang's resources to take over a territory of the city for our drug trafficking and prostitution and try to expand it through gang wars with other players. Give me something risky to do let me put something at stake. Let me race some proctology patient for the pink slip to my pos car. Hell I would love perma death in this game it's not like I am very fond of the truck stop harlot I was forced to use through the abysmal character creator.I was a bit disappointed by GTA Online but this is PC. I waited about one week after release to purchase the game because I wanted to give the community some time to develop some very much needed modding tools. My prayers were answered in Mr. Alexander Blade's notorious Scripthook V release. There was so much joy to be had running around the streets of SA as a husky mauling anyone who looked at me funny or taking a swim in the ocean as a dolphin. The latter conjured up ideas about a mod I would love to create based on the old Ecco the Dolphin games. With renewed vigor I happily installed various mods including a bodyguard script which allowed me to spawn npc's to follow me around in the open world and the most fun of all the pedestrian riot mod which simulated an end of the world scenario in which every citizen has gone mad and gets a random weapon and kills anyone and everyone in a frenzy. It is quite literally chaos and the most fun I've probably ever had in a game I can remember. I made a mini game out of it by trying to survive while crossing the map. I had hours of fun with this but it came to an abrupt end when Rockstar pushed out a patch which broke scripthook.I didn't bother loading the game back up. I decided to wait for the next iteration of scripthook and give a few more days for people to release even more mods. Today I saw a video of a guy that made a gravity gun mod (Half life 2 yeah I know what you're thinking. It's ing awesome) and also that Rockstar is now banning people for using single player mods. Rockstar is banning people for using single player mods. Banning people for using single player mods. Kill yourselves Rockstar I'm done. I won't disseminate your company any more you've become another corrupted developer/publisher like EA Activision and Ubisoft welcome to the club. I'll never purchase another Rockstar game in my life unless you reverse this and publicly apologize. I'm also going to attempt to get a chargeback from my credit card for this purchase changing the EULA after purchase should be illegal.I hope everyone who works for Rockstar gets their cars stolen and then run over by them. Do not buy Grand Theft Auto V/5. Torrent this game and wait for private servers to be available if you want to check out the online experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

The CONSTANT USELESS UPDATES break mods and make the one thing that makes the game fun for more than 10 minutes broken! The NAZI like Social Club is another horrible addition.....it FORCES YOU to login and if you can't then it destroys your entire game.

Dunno about GTA Online.But let's move onto the Story Graphics and Gameplay. Graphics are amazing with mods even better nothing more to say. Gameplay is pretty awesome too you can do countless of things it's extremely realistic and fun. The story is great.I downloaded the game in 9th class when a new girl came into my class. I fell in love with that girl. As the time progressed i tried on that girl but she didn't show any interest in me. One night i saw on her snapchat how she's hanging out with another boy and being very close with each other. I bet they had s*x that night. At that night i was playing GTA 5 and the mission was where (SPOILER ALERT) Michael catches his wife in bed with another guy. I felt like whatever was happening in the game happened to me in real life kind of. While i was driving around Los Santos i've been listening to sad songs that include Love Hurt and it really touched me. Like this game was especially made for me. Now everytime i hear the songs i get reminded of this girl. She made me suffer by always posting snapchats hugging flirting and cuddling with other boys but GTA 5 was here for me. I've found comfort and peace here. Michael Franklin and Trevor were like life teachers talking more about life while me 16 years old had no idea what would come in future. But now 1 year after i finished GTA 5 and got over that girl. I'd still like to get in game put on my favorite radio station and listen to those songs that gave me so many emotions just to feel that pain again. The pain that made me feel like a real human being. For me this is a best game ever made. I will never find another game that will have the ability to touch me emotionally like this one did. Thank you Rockstar for making this really awesome game!! At the end i just want to say something. ( Anita f**k you you f***ing s**t for f***ing with my feelings! ),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,1,2,35,False,Not Recommended,In itself GTA Online is fun to play whether you're hanging out with friends or grinding it out on your own. The issue I have with Online is the sheer volume of hackers/modders ruining the game for others be it through farming kills on noobs by switching in and out of passive mode or dropping ridiculous amounts of money into innocent players' accounts. The recent slew of bans on innocent players with no option for appeal too is definitely not helping with that part of the experience. I have friends who worked hard grinding into a pretty nice setup that were banned for no reason whatsoever while hackers and modders still roam free. Pretty move especially since I've heard customer service is pretty bad as well. Apparently people who've just gotten the game and have only played for a few minutes to an hour have been banned too so it's definitely got to be an error in their detection. Overall I won't tell anyone not to play the game... just do so at your own discretion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-16,0,0,32,False,Not Recommended,Overall it is a good solid game with many fun and interesting aspects. Has plenty of things to do to occupy your time with friends or by yourself. Good for people who play with mouse and keyboard or gamepad. The only issues I really have with the game is rockstars lack of punishment and vigilence for hackers or rather modders. People using mods to hack special vehicles buffs or levels and the like to utterly ruin multiplayer sessions. I am all for modded servers that add a special bit to peoples gameplay experience but when someone spawns themselves a super buffed tank or plane and goes around killing people for the lols it ruins the entire experience.Then those same people turning right around and getting pissy when people calling them out for it and using their mods to kick people from the server or lock them in invisible boxes or otherwise screw with peoples ability to play the game. I'll never understand why people do that. They may as well be playing by themselves at that point.So until rockstar cracks down on the hacking I cannot in full consciousness recommend the game to anyone that wants to play open multiplayer. Otherwise I would highly recommend the rest of the game. private sessions with your friends or the campaign are all great.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,789,False,Not Recommended,"What a Pity.Up until very recently (yesterday or thereabouts as of this posting) this was a game I would often excitedly encourage my friends and family to purchase and play. Despite being shy of being released 4 years ago and still retailing at full price I felt that the experience warranted the cost consider the single player This game was/is essentially the Don Rickles of its kind/time. Nothing is safe nobody no social circle no profession no fad or meme escapes its ridicule and that ridicule was so very very smart. It speaks to the quality of the voice acting the writing and the story overall that once this game is said and done you feel as comfortable as you do with the sociopathic narcissists that occupy the game's sprawling rogues' gallery. It was dark gritty often filthy but never in a way that wasn't self aware or lost its sense of fun.The multiplayer compounds the value of this game threefold as far as I'm concerned. Think about it you've gone through a campaign that can take anywhere from 30 60 hours (depending on how many extra missions and events you choose to explore and complete) if you're like me you sat down and watched a few of the in game TV shows or listened to Dr. Ray DeAngelo Harris ""Ommmmm"" his way through abusing Cheryl on public radio time and again and then Online opens up and it's beautiful I can honestly say it was everything I'd ever dreamed Multiplayer GTA could be.With a ragtag group of malformed bastards looking like something from a Hammer Horror Multi Creature Feature my friends and I robbed convenience stores broke into Fort Zancudo and requisitioned Fighter Jets to wreak havoc on Player and NPC alike! We took bike rides up mountains and found holdfast locations to incite sieges and slaughtered LSPD Officers in their hundreds we beat other players to death with golf clubs then took those golf clubs and played 9 holes at the Country Club near the high rise condos we'd purchased. We one upped each other with car mods did the co op missions the races and the deathmatches.And then like a bolt of lightning Heists. Ho lee she it. We robbed banks we robbed Private Military Compounds we broke a guy who was basically Walter White out of prison we got into raging gun battles with biker gangs we robbed drug dealers and then to top it all off we robbed another damn bank except a big one and rode and died and died and rode and shot and were shot at on a high speed pursuit across the damn map before finally jumping off a ing cliff and parachuting into a river to get into our escape boat. . What a rush!Then it started to happen the cracks started to show a bit. First came the announcement that there would be no more heists www.digitaltrends.com citing the amount of 'effort' a ""huge undertaking"" which I took to mean ""money"" which was funny because they were keen on selling those Shark Cards for in game fun bucks. 8 Million in game for $100 USD was/is the best possible exchange rate. That's about the time they released the VIP content and then eventually and many patches later the CEO content and then the Bikers and now as of a few days ago Gun Running.It was a slow decline but it was damn steady. Two years in and the content shifted from the traditional mission based co op with a twist of overworld mayhem to a fully two fisted overworld brawl everyone and their dog trying to sell meth or boost cars or perform assassination missions and everyone at odds with everyone else new vehicles with ridiculous advantages being released nearly every major patch it became an arms race the overworld was chaos.And it was a grind to get the reward a major grind and the only person who really profited was the guy who owned the business the people who helped him got a nominal fee at best and the chance to look at or sometimes play with his toys. Two years in and we're still selling the game at full price. Two years in and they're still hawking those God Damned cards. I just wanted a new heist but I guess those were too expensive to make.Despite all of this I was still recommending the game I still loved Franklin Michael and even Trevor. I still loved replaying the single player heists and I still loved the writing and the different voice acted versions of conversations you might hear on the way to/from a mission and every once in a while they would give online a shot in the arm Cunning Stunts was a favorite of mine and had me reliving childhood fantasies of being a Hot Wheels race car driver but it always boiled back down to that same old monetary formula and this last update the same as the two before it changes nothing.Here we are new content patch and it offers new destructive expensive weapons and vehicles that you have to grind for with a minimum buy in of something like $4 6mil in game to even get the full benefit of the expansion and the overzealous nerfing of everyone's bank accounts because of the hackers/modders who protest spammed money into everyone's hands that they possibly could and of course this happens right as the new expansion drops. But hey you can always buy a Shark Card right?Between the news about Take2 claiming we're not giving them enough money and of course the policy www.vg247.com concerning gamerant.com mods in singleplayer as an obvious attempt to shut down the massive waves of free money that the aforementioned hackers/modders spammed into Online I can't recommend this game anymore. I'd gladly pay for new expansions I'd gladly pay for a season pass hell I'd pay episode per episode for new heists!But I cannot and will not support a company who claims we're not giving it enough money 4 years in charging full price and outright demanding I either grind my off or pay to skip to the reward in their previously glorious yet increasingly online experience.I'm uninstalling and I'm keeping it uninstalled. I have no further interest in this game and am not likely to support future releases from Take2 or Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

I have played around 300 hs most of them have been using singleplayer mods. Why? Because once you finish story mode the singleplayer gets very boring but you can add almost unlimited new content to enrich your singleplayer experience with mods.About online let's better not talk about it. 35% of the time playing are just waiting for loading screens. Once you are in a session you have a very laggy gameplay only to be disconnected from your session with no apparent reason 10 minutes later. And this happens always to me.Want to pilot a cool plane? Or ride a nice car? Sure just play 10 hours of missions you don't want to play in order to get the ingame money OR pay T2 for those ridiculous ""shark"" cards.

Sort the hackers out and don't threaten your loyal customers when they have become victim to a hacker.

2017-01-14,0,0,1280,False,Not Recommended,"I would only recommend this if you get it cheap and intend to do little more than mod around in SP. Many people loved the story and missions but I found too much of it lacking. The extent of your experiences within the game never really make anything more than a cheap imitation of immersion. It is a world full of great detail and promise that is wasted on too many shallow experiences. MP was a grindy sort of fun in the beginning but every new update takes this closer to the grind/price scheme of your dime a dozen mobile game. If this game was made before selling in game currencies became ""de rigueur "" it could have been a respectable experience. While you don't ever have to buy anything new and fancy everything is priced so excessively that the grind necessary to achieve any level of ""success"" is catastrophic. Rockstar seems to be doing everything in their power to sell you Sharkcards. As it stands now a new player to MP would have to spend several million dollars just for the opportunity to marginally take advantage of the newer updates. Money earned on CEO missions is very poor for the CEO (who fronts significant money) and embarrassingly poor for his associates. On top of that Rockstar encourages PvP activities between rival companies and random players to further reduce the money earned. You don't have to do any of that though.

GTA Online remains a cash cow that is whipped by Take Two and Rockstar regularly for money. It is still riddled by s that just want to ruin your day. The gunrunning DLC looks really cool not going to deny that but as mentioned before I am not buying $17 000 000 in shark cards or grinding for hours on end for that. It's just not fun.Rockstar and take two get your together guys.EDIT They removed Open IV support. Remove that... remove my positive review. Shame on you rockstar for bending over to take two.Take Two AND Rockstar have taken all this milking of the cash cow that is GTA Online too far. $17 000 000 minimum for all the vechicles in the new update. In shark cards that is worth another 3 copies of the full game. This is unacceptable we paid $60 for this game I do not expect to pay another $180 dollars for vehicles in a new update. Remember when you could actually WORK for the new items and $700 000 was expensive? Yeah I don't.Shame on you Take Two for ruining what was an excellent game shame an you Rockstar for allowing this to happen.ORIGINAL REVIEW (From 23/08/2015 DD/MM/YYYY) If you don't mind the extensive amount of hackers on the online servers who can remotely control you and ruin your game then this game is just purely awesome.Even though its quite a hefty price the amount of gameplay you can get out of this game is substancial. I have already completed the single player but I can still get alot of fun out of it and when you mod single player its a hell of a lot of fun.Online is also fun when you have friends to play it with. And even though it is tuff to get a good amount of money without buying shark cards playing with your friends in races and freeroam is really fun.All in all I think the game is worth the money but only buy it if you KNOW you will put alot of time into this.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-02,0,0,2359,False,Not Recommended,"This game is addicting as hell and was fun when it released but it has so much potential that hasn't been reached. It's a shame.This review is from the perspective of someone who has played almost every game in the series (1 2 3 VC SA LSC VCS IV EFLC V) and has sunk tons of hours into most of the major releases. I've been playing this game since launch preordered on PS3 and PC and at this point I only play to hang out with friends and race / collect cars.Story Story is weak IMO if you want a great gritty story play IV and EFLC. I adored those stories especially with the how the expansions tie in to the base game. V's story feels tacked on like they designed a ton of cool missions but had no idea how they would impliment them into a cohesive story. They probably heard people say IV was too boring compared to SA the game that came before it and went over the top in the other direction.Missions The missions are the highlight of the singleplayer they make great eye candy for trailers and are super fun the first time around. Don't expect massive replayability though because the game kinda forces you to switch characters in a lot of the cool shootout missions so the experience ends up not being as varied as one might assume. The main reason to replay the story is to try out the heists in whatever option you didn't try the first time around but I think you can try that from the ""Replay Mission"" feature after you beat the game so you might not have to go through the whole story again.Driving The car physics are great and provide a very good platform for serious racing. There are physics bugs like curb boosting in the game and the ""Mid Drive Speed Boost"" but they don't spoil the driving too much. If I do have a complaint I think the cars are a little too arcadey and too easy to drive fast. Complete polar opposite of IV. There are some cars that are tough to push to their limits like the new Issi Classic or the old Dominator Racecar and the Elegy but many of the cars feel a bit too easy. The bikes are a pile of twitchy death and garbage. IV's expansions made the best bike physics of any GTA game to date but V's bikes have way too much grip and most of them are too twitchy except the big sports bikes like the Hakuchou and the choppers.Shooting The guns feel like airsoft or something similar they don't have any real powerful feeling to them but the actual shooting mechanics don't feel dated yet. I will always love SA but I'll admit the aiming and movement while shooting feel dated now and that feeling is starting to creep in with IV too. Plus you'll find if you are online the only guns people use are the minigun and explosives or the heavy sniper so I guess shooting doesn't really matter. There are a lot of guns with tons of customization especially in Online but you won't really use them because they aren't ""meta"".Flying IV had much better helicopter physics than V and they were the best in any GTA to date. V's probably come in 2nd but the severe limits on how far you can lean your heli are really annoying. You'll find that if you need to fight ground targets in most helis you have to fly above them and jerk the heli back then forwards until you can shoot straight down on them. Also they feel too arcadey compared to IV's helis. As far as planes go of course IV doesn't have planes but R* still did better back in GTA SA because there is much less turbulence and interference from wind in that game making planes more fun even if it's less realistic. Also in SA the camera didn't tilt with your plane which made stunt flying much less disorientating. Why can't we turn that off in the settings?Graphics On a good PC when you crank up the graphics the game still looks amazing and even after 2 100 hours on the refined PC port of the game (Old gen looks much worse than current gen and PC) I still am in awe sometimes of the beauty of the game world.Map The map is large sure but it sure as hell isn't designed with the same inteligence they had in GTA SA. This map is many times larger but much less dense meaning large areas of the map are far under utilized. Like unless you're driving around an offroading truck nobody ever goes to the mountains to the east of Los Santos even though the terrain is gorgeous. Most of the area outside of Los Santos consists of straight up mountains which is boring. The Alamo Sea also takes up a good portion of the map although it is a pretty cool area. The desert is too small same with the forest. The mountains make it a royal pain trying to fly by helicopter or drive to Paleto Bay and back so nobody ever goes there. SA has a smaller map and is a decade older but you should still buy it and at least check out how much more diverse that map is. Not only was the desert and forest(s) larger it has many more towns and 2 MORE CITIES. Also there are not as many cool interiors to enter than GTA IV and unlike IV the ones that are there are not always open Online which means you can't just enter all of the singleplayer's interiors with your friends for a shootout. There are some like the bank but not all of the SP ones are open.Online Don't play online unless you can get hundreds of millions from a kid with a mod menu or unless you want to stick to private lobbies with friends and do co op missions until you have the cash to take on the 5 mains heists.Heists The SP heists and Online heists are fun and definitely worth doing but they (Online) get boring if you need to grind them for cash. Enjoy doing them once with friends and maybe once more for Criminal Mastermind but if you grind them enough you'll get PTSD every time you get an invite to Prison Break Finale on your phone. Never do heists with randoms. Even with 2 friends and only 1 random they can still it all up for you.Doomsday Heist If you do decide to play Online and like it you'll want to do the Doomsday Heist eventually. Once you work your way up from being a liquor store robber to being a hired gun car exporter gun smuggler airborne terrorist etc you and your friends will want to do this set of 3 heists. It's the most fun you can have outside of random messing around with friends in freeroam. I played it on hard mode all the way through with 1 friend and it was a blast and a real test of if you were actually good at the game or not. I loved it. It was extremely satisfying to complete. Economy This is why the review is negative. GTA Online being the place you spend most of your days has an economy that pushes microtransactions in a full price game. Then they inflate DLC vehicle clothing and weapon prices every update (A top tier supercar in a 2014 dlc pack was $550k $725k now it's $2.5M $2.7M) and they have the audacity to try to shut down singleplayer modding and add shortcut packs for like $100 for a full price title... Remember in 2012 or so when Battlefield 3 did this and people lost their minds? I haven't heard any outrage from people about it now.. Luckily on PC you can have modders give you cash if you know where to look but those poor S.O.B's on console are stuck with this awful economy and having to grind for days for a new damn car. It's a travesty. GTA Online with the economy it had in 2013 maybe with adjustments to payouts would be a great game even with all the new vehicle combat and military gear that has no place in a multiplayer GTA title..All in all if you want to buy it for the singleplayer go ahead when it's on sale but you should try other GTA's too because I feel the stories are better when the games are set in a time period. The outlier is IV which was set in present day 2008 and is the best story of the bunch IMO. SA set in 1992 and VC set in 1986 also have great stories based on pop culture from the time.If you want to buy this game mainly for Online do your research and see all the shady R* does and see how toxic the game is..",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-22,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,The game play is very clunky You would think that after it being out for about 2 years it would be running smooth. Boy was I wrong for assuming that. The game runs very laggy mostly due to tons of hackers controlling the servers. Game play with friends is very difficult. For example there is a 50 50 chance of getting the invite to join your friends game and if you want to click on their name to join their game 50 50 chance of the game telling you they're off line even though they really are online! Hackers will kill you over and over again and again and you will be stuck in a circle of death for their entertainment or until you just log off the game. If you are still trying to play the game there is a very good chance that you will get banned for hacking just by alt tabbing out of the game to look up something online which was the case with one of my friends as well.

2015-06-11,4294967295,2,524,False,Not Recommended,"All of what Rockstar Games meant to me is kinda going out the window. Since gta 5's online situation ( hackers wise ) the game is slowly being ruined. Every attempt to stop people from using scripts or whatever programs they're using to bypass R*'s 'security' seems futile. The cheaters bounce back every time. The micro transactions heaven also didn't help because after I paid 60 Euro for a AAA game the next logical thing to do is to spend more and more money on in game currency with artificially inflated prices for items that make the game more enjoyable. This is mine and others' fault for encouraging this type of business practice but the gaming industry is slowly going down the pooper so there's no surprise there.The last disrespect towards the old and new fans of the franchise is the OpenIV ( possible no mods allowed ) situation that is currently happening right now ( June 2017 ). Seems like a slap over the face to people that actually enjoyed the single player only experience and as well tried to make it even more enjoyable with the addition of mods. This particular modification had no effect on GTA online since it doesn't allow the player to connect to any online sessions thus the devs making sure that the players could only play single player version of the game. ( in other words they weren't hurting anyone )From a business point of view I understand what's going on here T2 CEO wants more people to join online and thus being tempted to spend more money on 'Shark Cards' and thus increasing the company's profits but even so I don't like or agree with this tactic ( seems a bit aggressive to me ) since I doubt people will now think to themselves "" Hmmm... no mods eh? Maybe I should join online and see what's that all about. Oh this car costs i.e. a ridiculous amount of in game currency so I must either grind the game or hey look micro transactions... nice"". I doubt people would have this approach. ( maybe some will who knows )Also another thing to point out YouTubers that are making a living out of modded gta 5 gameplay videos are also being affected if not now then in the long run.I might be wrong about everything I just wrote but even if that's the case I can say with a clean consciousness that I won't be playing online any time soon ( unless they somehow rectify this situation ) and even then I'll stay away from the micro transactions.That's all I have to say about this.

Customer Service sucks as all they do is ignore you.Here are some Pros and ConsPros Graphics are incredible You can actually install mods to make singleplayer fun Sounds a little bit better.Cons All lobbies have cheaters and little kids that spam the N word multiple times Cant play a normal lobby without being killed by a random explosive from a cheater Cheaters can literally do what they want and how they want since Rockstar doesnt care about PC Version Did I mention that nearly in all lobbies there is a cheater? Cant play without friends so you can do your own session without cheaters. Basically online ing sucks on PC Singleplayer is better on PC. Everyone of the players are toxic and basically cant play with them on missions. Better doing the missions yourself. Cheaters are also in every mission so dont do the missions unless if you wanna get shot in the head from across the map.I reccomend if you want to get GTA. Get it either on Xbox or PlayStation since Rockstar mainly concentrates on the consoles. I regret paying my $60 to get this game back then. I havent been on it for a while but after hopping on for a bit to see if anything was done and to be surprised that there are still cheaters in every lobby.

There is very little of actual traditional PvE content and almost all of it is of a low quality. All what is left is ever unsatisfying racing and a empiric toxicating PvP.The only way to have fun is to buy cool stuff play around with it for less then an hour get bored and then to wonder why you even bothered wasting your time or money to earn it.Even if you decide to just play with friends and to hope to have some fun together then I sure hope that all of you are playing from the same location because peer to peer system makes even pleasent evenings with friends into a frustrating cluster of re connecting loading screens.Glue together a PvP nature of the game and peer to peer system and you get yourself an envorement in which it is almost impossible to track on who is really using hacks and who is just a victim of said hacks. And thanks to early Omnipotent Orb* unlocking (Kuruma(armored)) game managed to recruit enough underaged players who lack needed gaming skills and instead trying to compensate for them with hacks and mods. Actually ""enough players"" is a bit of an understatement. GTA Online is actualy infested with cheating players.If you expect for your account to survive through as many hours of Online as mine you will either end up in a very tight crew who tries to controle public sessions with sheir numbers of legit players. Or if you not a sociable person you will end up exploiting OS firewall settings to block yourself from the most of other players in online. If you will risk it and go out and play GTA Online the way it meant to be played in Public Sessions then your account probably won't survive even for a two weeks.Rescue of a drowning person is a responsobility of a said person. This is what mentality of the people behind this game. Banning both. Cheaters and victims of said cheaters. And after so many years nothing is changed. They did not make any investments nor any proper developments for a better anti cheat system. And that isn't even the worst part. Even if you are just a victim you still going to be treated as a cheater by the technical support team if you adress your problem as being unjustfully banned by their automated system. So don't expect any help from people in power unless you are some sort of media platform celebirty who promotes their stuff.It is unclear who is behind this. 2k Take 2 or The Rockstar themselves but story mode support was cuted off completely after moving into current generation. Leaving players with no choice but to play GTA Online if they want to taste some new content. Sadly latest content rased prices on in game goodies and introdused more spoilsporting ways of earning a good score. That resulting into players getting into naturally frustrating situations that induce violent behaviour towards each other and a desire to simply buy in game money with some real money. Combine this with cheater infestation and you get yourself one heck of a scum ride.Considering all of the above in current state game is simply not worth it to be picked up unless you played previous games and just want to play some story mode.*Omnipotent Orb effect term originated from a Persona role play game. Omnipotent Orb item is a treasure gained from one of the hardest challengies in the game contains the power to make the user immune to about 90% of all attacks in the game. Said item meant to be used to ease the grinding process. The effect of ""Omnipotent Orb"" on a player is an interesting one. It is basically a very desired item for new players thanks to how overpowered it is. So it motivates them to move forward and to try harder to obtain it. But by the point when players suppose to get their hands on it they are already masterfull enough that they don't need help of this item to be good at the game.",Grand Theft Auto V

I recently got a good PC and I played this game for over 500 hours back when it was active on the 360 500 hours may not seem like a lot but put into perspective this was on the 360 and I probably spent 200 hours looking at the ing loading screen so that's 700 hours 700 divided by 24 is 29 so that's basically a month of my life wasted playing this ing game on my xbox 360 not to mention all the shark cards a bought for that character so around 3 years later I get my pc and I want to get back into GTA V I boot up the online and GUESS WHAT? the ing character transfers are taken out. Now I don't want to hear any t like ""oh they did that because modders will bring their modded accounts from the 360 and ps3 to the next gen versions of the game."" because that's ignorant and ing stupid my cousin plays GTA V on pc and I have friends who played this game on next gen and can confirm there's modders regardless and if you still don't believe that Take Two Interactive did that so that you would have to restart your online mode and dump more money into this atrocious online mode these are the same ing people who tried to take down a single player mod loader from the game because they thought it was for modding the online mode.

2017-06-16,0,0,525,False,Not Recommended,TakeTwo's recent devision to give the modding tool OpenIV a cease and desist order means that I no longer recommend buying this game or supporting rockstar in general. The modding community has always been huge in GTA and it is sad to see all of the hard work put in by these modders go to waste. After exhausting all single player content mods can breathe new life into the game and banning them will seriously affect the longevity of GTA once primary development ceases. Presumably OpenIV was shut down to get rid of modders dropping people cash and turning people away from Shark Cards. The is ridiculous as OpenIV wasn't even used to get mod menus into the game. Shark Cards and micro transaction in general are a cancer on the gaming industry and I will never be purchasing any Rockstar products again if TakeTwo continues this attitude against modding.,Grand Theft Auto V

A few months ago I was messing about with my mate and a modder started dropping money. We ignored it and carried on with what we were doing thinking nothing of it.A week later I got banned for a month account reset and everything. Over a hundred hours of grinding 40 on Shark Cards and all it took for me to lose everything was some guy to join my lobby with mods.I love this game but honestly Rockstar need to fix the banning issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,540,False,Not Recommended,"First look at how many hours I have in this game. I have spent a lot of time in it with friends. However there is no way I can recommend this game. I'd like to start off by saying I've been playing since the original lauch on Xbox 360. I had technical issues there with the single player and when I contacted their support about it it somehow became my router's problem that I was getting disconnected from GTA Online. ""Fine"" I thought ""I'll just play single player"" that was until the game would crash any time I left the city (which was where my story missions were). After dealing with bitter support agents I finally got it to work and I played on 360 until the pc version came out and I used it to push my newly built pc (980 ti i7 6700k and 16gb of RAM). All of that said the single player is pretty fun for one or two playthroughs but it gets old kinda quick.That's where I thought either multiplayer or mods would help increase the lifespan of this game. Let's start with mutliplayer. At first it seemed rather fun. That was until I tried to steal a car that was deemed ""too hot"" to add to my garage. Um it's called Grand Theft Auto why can't I commit the crime the game is named after just because of the value of the car in question? Then there's how the game punishes your actions by judging your ""mental state"" which would be fine if it didn't treat player kills and npc kills as the same. Yes the game will label you a psycopath if you're gunning down NPCs who are shooting at you or passive NPCs that you're just mowing down and/or if you're killing players letf and right or even if you're just trying to defend youreself from another psycopath! To GTA Online it doesn't matter which IS a problem. Of course they do offer free dlc every so often and the updates that add new missions are...lackluster at best. They usually involve bad writing and no variety as to how you as a player can approach them (which considering how much variety there should be in a game like this is laughable). Some missions are built up as taking a ""stealth approach"" but no matter what you do you get caught so what's even the point of trying to be stealthy? That is assuming you're doing this with friends like I did. God help you if you want to try doing this with randoms. They don't just add new missions though they also offer new vehicles and properties to buy that is assuming you're willing to shell out hundreds of real life dollars on their shark cards because let's face it there's no way that you could earn that much money grinding it through missions and it still be worth it. I've lost more money trying to grind because of the way the game incentivises other players to ruin your multimillion dollar investments just for a few RP points. All in all the multiplayer is an unbalanced mess that wants players to buy into their microtransations scam.Great that's mutliplayer out of the way. Now that we know it's garbage let's try out a few mods...and as I'm sure you've heard by now Take Two Interactive sent a Cease and Desist to OpenIV (which is a very prevalent modding tool I've not really seen any mods that DON'T use it to be honest). I'll say that while it's not exactly unexpected that they would do this it was far from a good move on their part. From the start of the pc port they said that they would not support nor condone modding however they wouldn't do anything to stop it so long as players kept it in single player (think content mods or graphical changes) they would be fine heck rockstar even said they liked a few of the mods. Jump to recent news and apparently even that is a no no according to Take Two Interactive because ""using mods disracts players from our shark cards how else are we supposed to gouge players for money if they're not playing our terrible multiplayer?""Lastly I'd like to say how bad their support agents are. For instance I was in a lobby where a player was clearly hacking. After I reported him my game slowed to a crawl and then crashed. When I tried to log back in the game it told me I was banned for hacking. I tried to contact support about having a technical issue (because my game orginally started running very poorly before crashing). Even with my system specs IN HAND the rep asked if my pc could even run the game! Dude of course I can play the game at this point I already had like 200+ hours in steam and they make you give them system info in the initial contact. What's the point of giving you my system info if you're going to completely ignore it?! Then after finding out that I was banned by an automated system the rep forwarded me to an automated email reply that simply said I had to wait out the 2 month banning period.TL DR This game could've been more fun if the executives were more open to the community and willing to focus more on balance instead of money.

The recent revelopments of take two now deciding that they need to quash out mods in order to presumably make more money for themselves via shark cards are the final straw for me and will do what I can to avoid take two products going forward. I may have already bought the game and played it for 60 hours but I can still leave this negative review and maybe new gamers will take a hint that take two is one of the worst kind of money grubbing game publishers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,64,False,Not Recommended,"So when I bought GTA V it was when it had declined a bit. At the time I bought it modders were rampant in Online griefing or dropping money on people without consent Rockstar's systems seemingly only ban the innocent due to this. The singleplayer had nothing of the Online ported to it making it seem way worse on top of the grind that is required in the Online to get anything.Though there was a constant fear of getting banned due to a rogue modder or getting my account with all of its effort reset the fallback to this was being able to mod the singleplayer if anything went wrong so yeah that's gone now.Around E3 where little would notice Take Two ordered a cease and desist for a SINGLEPLAYER ONLY MOD a mod that is the staple (like SKSE for skyrim) of all mods in the Singleplayer.They later claimed that it ""enables recent malicious mods"" to be used in the multiplayer which is naturally wrong as the devs of Open IV put effort into not affecting the Online in any way.Though moves like this to get people to play the Online has been done before this is a step too far as many including me bought the game on PC perhaps after owning console copies JUST for mods.BTW if you also disagree with this post a negative review yourself it may seem like a flash in a pan but it is the most effective chance of Rockstar acting as the negative review score is really what they care about.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-23,0,0,164,False,Recommended,"After 60 hours of playing through the single player campaign and the multiplayer I would recommend getting this game on PC and here is why. Perfomance and Optimization Firstly I'm gonna talk about performance and optimization for this game. I remember picking up a copy of GTA IV when it was finally released for PC. Good luck trying to get that to run higher than medium at the time on a decent rig. After numerous patches they kinda fixed the framerate issues to that game. This time around Rockstar actually learned their lesson from GTA IV and hired a team of people dedicated to working on the PC version of their games. It really shows with GTA V. The current rig I'm playing this game on is a GTX 770 2gb VRAM and I can run everything at high/ultra at 1080p 60fps. Rockstar added a ton of graphical options to the graphics settings that you can tweak around with to get the game to look great and run nicely on your rig. And if you have no idea if a certain setting will impact the perfomance of the game they do have a video memory slider that shows how much memory the game is going to use of your graphics card. If you are clueless at all about how to optimize your game if you are running an older rig I would look at this video. It actually goes into detail about what each setting does and which settings you should adjust and why. Click here One thing I do want to mention is the loading times. Those are a kind of a turn off especially when you are trying to load the multiplayer. They take quite a long time and I have no idea if they are ever going to fix that but it's quite annoying when you load into multiplayer boot up a heist with friends then load the heist do said heist then have to sit in a loading screen to load back into the multiplayer again. Loading times on average take about a minute and a half and that's the multiplayer. The single player's loading times for me seem to load a bit faster than the multiplayer's. Single Player Campaign (No Spoilers) I actually held off on playing this game on console because I wanted to experience everything the game had to offer on the PC. The story features 3 characters that you can switch through to do story missions or whatever you want. I mean it is an open world sandbox game. The story was interesting and Trevor and Michael were fantastic. Seeing the struggles they both go through with each other or with family and friends kept me interested and the voice acting was top notch. You may ask well you never mentioned Franklin? What about him? Honestly unless I was super tired when playing the game as Franklin his character was a little lackluster. He also had very few story missions compared to Trevor and Michael that made me not have a stronger connection to his character and when I did do the missions he just didn't seem that interesting to me. Overall the story between the 3 characters is really well done and very interesting. Multiplayer/Grand Theft Auto Online Multiplayer is a giant open world sandbox where you can pretty much do anything you want with random people online or friends. You can go do team deathmatch or racing or parachuting or even golfing. Now after a while these do get boring really quickly and repetitive. Rockstar added heists to the multiplayer which actually spice up the game quite a bit. Think Payday 2 but where it's actually a lot better and more fun than Payday 2. I've only played 4 heists in the game so far with friends but I will say that it will keep you entertained and test your friendship especially if you put the difficulty setting to hard and you only have one chance otherwise if you die you have to start all over again. The multiplayer has that huge grindfest where if you want to be a certain level you need to do a ton of grinding in deathmatch/racing/etc. Since they added heists to this game those actually give you a pretty big boost in XP but still tons of grinding. Now I should mention that there are a ton of bugs/glitches in the multiplayer. One of the biggest ones I can think of is when you are doing a heist and you fail the mission and the game reloads the mission you are stuck looking at your character and the screen is frozen but you can hear the game still going on in the background and if you move your mouse you can even see the map rotating but the rest of the screen is frozen. The fix to this is ALT+Enter twice to put the game in fullscreen then back to borderless windowed mode. Myself and a lot of my friends have had this problem and it gets kind of annoying everytime you have to do that fix. Rockstar Editor Now I've read a lot of Steam reviews for this game and even looked online and nobody has given a detailed description or even a review of the editor that Rockstar added to the game. I messed around with it for about 20 minutes and it was enough to understand how it works and what my pro's and con's with it are.At first I couldn't even find the damn editor but basically you need to go into the single player first then go to the pause screen scroll all the way to the right until you get to the editor. Once in you find that you can edit clips taken in game and a director mode where you choose any character/animal you want to be. You can change the the time of day the weather if you want to be invincible whether you can get a wanted rating or not if you can fly. There are a ton of settings here that you can adjust so you can load into the single player world with said character/animal of your choice and start making a movie. Now I kinda had a different idea of how the editor was going to work. I thought it was going to be a more user friendly Source Film Maker but I was wrong. You just either record a clip in single player/multiplayer or the director mode. I was really hoping you could add multiple actors to one scene and make a movie or some kind of machinima thing. Now someone can correct me if I'm wrong keep in mind I did only dabble with the editor for about 20 minutes and it was just to make a quick video to get the achievement in the game.What I did do with the editor is go into single player load up Michael went to the airport stole a plane while the cops were chasing me and flew it away. I told the game to record my clip and the game splits each clip into about 1 minute segments. Once you feel you have good footage you stop recording then go to the Rockstar Editor. In the editor there are options to add a clip from the clips the game recorded for you add music add text to a scene save the work you have done and export the video so you can upload it to YouTube. When you add a clip you can edit the clip by manipulating the camera. Now with the camera you can't have the camera too far away from your character which kind of sucks. So in my clip I edited I just had the camera kind of rotate around the plane I was flying. What I really wanted was to show the cop cars chasing me but the editor kind of freaks out and goes back to following the player actor. Now you can add music to your clip and off course my first thought was ""I'm flying in a plane from the cops of course I'm gonna use Danger Zone even if I'm not in a jet."" Nope. I don't know if it's a copyright thing but they don't have every single song from the radio in the editor. When you go to the rock station that you hear Danger Zone on in the game's radio it only had about 6 songs and Danger Zone was not in the list which kind of disappointed me.Overall I'd say the editor is a decent tool for people who want to make movies or just some kind of Machinima looking video but don't expect something super detailed and in depth. Also if you're looking to add a song that you liked from the game don't get your hopes up yet as to how they don't have every song added. Here's the clip I made",Grand Theft Auto V

The multiplayer is mostly P2P and short of them redesinging it it will always be vulnerable to cheating. However the biggest annoyance is the Shark Card crap.

2016-11-28,0,0,1291,False,Recommended,I've owned and played GTAV on PC for almost two years straight now. It is a mixed bag to say the least and if R* would pull their heads out of their posteriors on certain things it could be far better than it is now. That said even with its shortcomings I will recommend it with the following pros and cons Pros Large vehicle pool spanning a variety equally large enough to be able to satisfy almost anyone's desires. Equally large variety of clothing that should satisfy most people. A mountain of free content spanning (in reality) 3 years since its console launch that you get for as said free. As of both the Finance and Felony and MC updates it's easy to make money hand over fist especially with a group of friends.Cons Hackers/Modders. Everywhere. A toxic community with a fetish for stickbombs. R* connectivity issues.The cons can /usually/ be circumvented by doing an invite only session bringing in a plethora of friends to combat them session hopping until you find a quiet one or by bugging your own session out (Google it.)Even with these drawbacks I've sunk almost a full 1 000 hours into the game and have far more pleasant memories than awful though the awful do stick out. R* are planning on releasing a new paid expansion that is rumored to contain three new cities so getting in now (especially at a low price) would be wise so that you're prepped for the new content. But above all just remember that if you don't like the game for its online functionality there is still a solid single player campaign that is worth the money alone (even if it won't be getting any expansions now.),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,114,False,Recommended,"Earlier this year I gave a negative review to this game to join the rant band wagon. Now I am going to give my honest review. However I will only touch on the online a little because that IS NOT GTA.THE STORY I am by no means a fan of single player games. I prefer online co op killing action. With that being said GTA V NEVER failed to grab my attention with the story. You are given plenty of options throughout your playthrough (such as killing someone or leaving them alive) that impact the game. The characters are without a doubt some of the greatest voice actors in recent video game history. There is not a character in the game that isn't unique and each one has an incredible backstory that you learn more about when you progress through the game. There are also random events throughout the game that keep even the most basic driving exciting. If it was from story alone this game would EASILY get a 10/10.THE WORLD When it comes to the design and detail of Los Santos I can promise that there is not a better open world in the gaming industry. The colors are vibrant the world feels alive and the designs of certain areas are pure perfection. Only games like ""The Witcher 3"" can compare so if that is something that you have played you will be able to appreciate this world. The parodies are a major bonus as well.THE GAMEPLAY I consider this the weakest link of GTA. The hand to hand combat in the game is a major down grade from GTA IV but the guns are a major improvement. Everything feels very smooth for the most part during combat. The cops function very well and work as a cooperative unit. The cars all feel amazing and have unique traction and speed. CUSTOMIZATION From clothing items to paint jobs GTA does not fail to embrace the freedom of choice. You can completely change cars that you buy from the vast Internet that was created.THE ONLINE GTA Online feels almost nothing like the actual game. However it is still one of the best open world games you can play with your friends. It is not nearly as fun without friends though. The Online also fails at producing a fair market. The amount of money that you earn is not nearly enough to purchase what you want and it has been a major complaint from the beginning. It is a shame that they have not yet added more housing or heists but there is still plenty to do. Shark cards are ridiculously overpriced so I would recommend staying away from them. Hackers are also very common.THE VERDICT GTA earns a 9/10!The base game is absolutely amazing and the game is definitely worth the purchase. IF you are going to play online make sure to grab friends!",Grand Theft Auto V

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

Don't get me wrong I love the game but the banning system is unacceptable and must be fixed.The banning fiasco starting around a year ago I believe... They started banning everyone who used any sorts of mods mercilessly... Forums were flooded. I was a victim of this massacre and got some of my assets lost and most of my money from what I recall. Now one year later and this is still an issue. I haven't personally been banned again but a quick look at the forums and you will see hundreds of cases of people being banned with no way to even appeal them... It's not like their system is flawless or anything ffs... At least give a reasonable way to appeal it.They don't give any technical information on their banning system (I don't really blame em though) but them banning constantly players is really inconsiderable. I don't believe banning people for cheating in your game is a proper solution the problem when anybody can grab a cheat menu in a few minutes and cheat in your game.

But why I am downvoting is because last night I was roaming around a public lobby when I got banned out of no where for ten days. I checked to see if I got a ban report and the report said ""I have a complaint regarding a ban"" (That was from the rockstar automation at this point I did not try to contact support) Then I went to make a ticket regarding the ban and as soon as I posted the ticket an automated bot posted about basically them not even bothering with temporary bans unless you recorded basically your entire GTA session proving you did nothing wrong and closed the ticket entirely and made me wait 12 hours to make another. When I could make another it did the same thing again with not even an appeal topic. So again will have to wait to make another. Tried at least 7 times to get a hold of the twitter support but that system seems HORRIBLY inactive and responds to maybe 1 random question every 30 minutes to an hour. Negative review is more for the terrible anti cheat and support. Twitter should not be used for a live support and bots should not automate ticket questions relating to that. Gameplay can be extremely fun don't get me wrong with friends it's one of my favorite stress release games. But again anti cheat and support are garbage. Let's the innocents get banned and cheater roam freely in game. (And this is just an assumption is was based off of I was in a hacked lobby and didn't even know it at the time. Because I still never got an answer to why I was banned)TL DR Anti cheat and support are garbage. Got banned for no explained reason. Support is no help.Edit Finally called the Rockstar support line.

Now you might wonder what made this game that had ""very or overwhelmingly positive reviews"" on steam suddenly take a hit. Well this was because of the publisher of the game tried to curb modders/ modding. And the modding scene in gta is one of the biggest and people didnt take this very well and rightfully so hence a lot of folks decided to change their reviews from positive to negative. So this stupid facade was recalled and everyones happy again.Onto the game this is truly one of my favorite masterpieces in terms of singleplayer. If youre solely getting this for SP you wil not be disappointed. Great characters great story a fair amount of choices for a Gta game amazing visuals and graphics good physics highly detailed environments so much stuff to do the missions are well laid out and driving around Los Santos is just breathtaking and the list goes on and on all combined with the classic GTA formula.The singleplayer was well worth the complete price if not more so look no further if you want to get this game for the offline story. The modding scene will get you hours of fun when you just want to fool around as the hulk or if you want to make the game look like a supposed Gta 6Now multiplayer is GTA is kind of a mixed bag its not bad but surely could be done better. You will not run out of things to do very soon since R* constantly pushes out content updates for the game. But unfortunately with each update the prices of the items from that update are highly inflated now this would be fine if the jobs would pay out more as well but they dont they give you almost the same amount of money. Hence the grind to get any of the new stuff is infuriating. Then there are the occasional K/D warriors who kill you and then go into passive mode so that you wont be able to kill them and random in hydras waiting to bomb the out of you when youre delivering goods.

2015-12-16,0,0,61,False,Recommended,My GTA V review. StoryI won't be spoiling anything but I can tell you the story is more like San Andreas' story far less realistic than GTA IV's story. It's also noticeably meant to be more comical and not taken very serious. There isn't much emotion in the story which is kind of dissapointing but also a tad logical since Los Santos isn't your gritty depressing city like Liberty City was. There isn't really much to tell other than that it's not very believable but still entertaining. More meant for 'n giggles than a deep story. GameplayGameplay wise the game is really strong. Everything moves in a very fast smooth manner which is really nice definitely more fast paced but less realistic than it's predecessor GTA IV. Cruising around with your car feels fluid. Aiming isn't difficult at all neither is driving but flying in my own eyes is a bit. Concent &amp MPLet's talk about this game's content. There is soooo much content it'll take weeks before you've seen it all. This is really nice and it's a fact they release DLCs (free) once in a while which add enough content to make the game interesting again. Especially in multiplayer which Rockstar Games has done in a brilliant manner. There are so many activities jobs etc to do there's always something to do. Just cruising with friends satisfies my needs already enjoying the eye candy while driving on the coastal highway is definitely entertaining.TL DR Worth your buck.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-23,0,0,429,False,Not Recommended,Single player of the game is highly recommended and is a lot of fun.Online bit on the other hand is not recommended. It has three major issues.Issue 1 GTA online has turned into a massive grind. If that wasn't enough the things you buy after the grind require you to grind even more to be useful. Effort Reward relationship is completely messed up.Issue 2 Half the time you'll spend online will be spent watching loading screens especially if you are playing missions or doing heists. Joining friends' lobby takes forever entering their houses takes forever setting up a heist takes forever...Issue 3 If you aren't doing missions you are in a free roam lobby which is relatively free of loading screens... and instead full of modders of one type or another. Cars can randomly blow up cash may rain you may be teleported around start burning and or just die for one reason or another caused by mods. It's just a giant waste of time to join a free roam public lobby (which is where you need to be to complete a lot of the new missions brought in by the updates...)Game itself is fun but getting to actually play it properly with decent equipment takes ages online. It rarely ever feels rewarding.Leaving this as Not Recommended as many who get GTAV now are getting it for the online bit.

I cant belive I was made the fun i had with single player so sour so fast by such a weak multiplayer that seems to be trown in. please just dont buy it unless is on sale for like 30 bucks or so 60 or even 40 dollars its just not worth it.I am recommending only the single player if this had a middle thumbs id give it that the multiplayer is currently still completely terrible.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,So I bought this piece of game way back in 2015 and the only reason I did choose this version over the PS4 one was mod support. Not only take two backfired on their deal with OpenIV since they had consent and could do wichever mods they wished for as long as that ecosystem would not interfere with Rockstar own lackluster online experience for the game. Despite OpenIv not alowing mod users to even launch GTA Online some t statement about this and other meaningless excuses Take Two Interactive pulled a Nintendo and issued a DCMA Takedown notice. What I end up with is a game that is more demanding than it should be given its last gen ish visuals one that is also incredibly inconsistent in its performance and overall a shalow reskined package of the original 2013 game.i7 3770Sapphire Tri X R9 390X16 Gb DDR3 1600Mhz,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-24,0,0,1293,False,Not Recommended,This game has been left to the wolves by the developers. Cheaters can take all of your money and reset your character to rank 1 erasing almost all progress you've made even erasing money you bought from the developer. They could also stuff your wallet full of money and set your rank extremely high making most of the game pointless and making you look like a cheater to others. For any other game developer cheating this severe (ruining someone else's account) would be a critical flaw and they'd take matchmaking servers down while deploying a hotfix but rockstar has ignored it for weeks and their support staff often turns down requests to fix the damage done.I'd recommend avoiding this game until (if ever) they get their act together and start supporting it. Those of us with a lot of time spent in it are now having to file support tickets every other day just to be able to continue playing. And all indications are it's going to get even worse from here.EDIT 2017 06 13 I've just had all $25M of my legitimate money deleted by the developers by their failed attempt to correct account balances for all the fake money that was stuffed into our accounts over the past two months since this review was written despite being extremely careful in following their guidance on the matter.,Grand Theft Auto V

Multiplayer+ Extremely fun (Racing Co op if you dont mind repetitive missions)+ You can meet really good friends+ Track editors+ Customization+ There is a great game under all the t I never got banned so atleast that is a plus +. Weapon balancing is bad no recoil 1 hit kill anywhere sniper rifles miniguns sticky bombs and homing missiles rule. All other weapons are not viable and suck compare to them. Playing freeroam is really cancer sometimes. Helis suck anyone can carry a stinger with 20 rockets and ultra fast locking + you dont have flares so you are almost always dead. There are ways to dodge rockets but yeah good luck when you dodge 1st he has 2nd already in the air. Unstable sessions P2P connection FTW boyzzzz ALOT less hackers now. There were times where you got out of garage only to get killed by a windmill or changed to a toilet or christmass tree. Multiplayer could be something great aswell but unfortunately it is burred under a rug of long loading times. Stupid sessions system (where when you accept an invite to lobby it dissconnects you out of your own lobby and then attempts to join the lobby you were invited to. But it doesnt check if there are any free slots left before it disconnects you. So most of the time you will get session full message and then it will force you into another loading before it will find an another freeroam session) Infinite loading glitch still present (Still 2 years after launch) Hit detection is terrible (You cant even find your own ping) Multiplayer is a big grind. You can either play PVE or PVP for lousy 20k a game if you are lucky most of the time it ranges from 5 18k depends on player count match duration (Btw pvp is dead all their ""Super fun modes are mostly dead mainly because of the lobby system which doesnt work fast enough to get enough players into 1 lobby""). Or you can play 4 different heists from which only 1 is viable (Pacific 375k per hour if 20% payout and all setups) and pay is good enough so after 4 5 hours of the same missons. You finally will be able to buy that mad 2m super car that you wanted. Only to find out it costs another 350k to fully upgrade. When playing heists you need to get a good crew you never want to play with randoms or they will destroy your sanity mainly because of the terrible checkpoints. (Leavers griefers idiots noobs kids this game has it all). Many of the items are insanely overpriced. If you complete all the heists challenges like I did. Some of them really long like play all heists no deaths in order hard difficulty. You will get something around 14m cash to spend that is really not alot when you want to buy some of the more nice fun things like fighter Jet 3Mil Tank 1.5Mil Some High end apartments lets say another 1.5Mil clothes 50 200k for single piece of clothing no problem Capitalism has you here aswell. Some super cars like (Its a car game ofc you will spend money there) thats like 6 mill here EASY with upgrades etc ... AND puff your money is gone Annnd you can start grinding pacific again... The DLC missions (Lamar and CEO stuff Bikers) again you need to invest ALOT and it will take yet another 10 20+ hours to even get some sort of a reasonable profit.I could rant here for ever but I think I will stop here. After all I will still give positive rating bacause like I said there is a great game hidden there but My love &amp Hate relationship is real.",Grand Theft Auto V

I would 100% recommend this game if you're looking for an amazing gta singleplayer experience even if there's no sale. However the same can't be said if you're interested in multiplayer.

Not to mention the price value of shark cards is extortion level absurdity yet I'm at fault for buying 3 4 times back in the day but that's it.Yes it's nice to have more content for free due to all the whales spending money to the online mode but the grind and prices is ridicilous as stated.

Well just spend your hard earned cash on in game money. GTA V Online is a blatent cash grab in the worst possible way. The single player was what you would expect was fun but all in all they've shifted all dev time to their cash crop the online. No single player DLC and all the online DLC that comes out is available for tens of millions online which most of us who can't stand to grind for 40 hours a week are forced to buy shark cards to access the DLC or forgo the experience all together.

2017-06-15,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,(Review Including Mods)The whole point of me buying the PC version was for offline modding and letting myself be creative with retextures....a lot of PC people don't care about online. Sorry it's the truth. Take Two taking too much. If star ratings could go it would here.There is a huge community for GTAV modding. It's massive. Don't throw away your allies. Watch your step because actions now will have implications on the future and your future products.(Review Excluding mods)I don't recommend this game unles you want offline. Althoguh offline does not have all the DLC vehicles buildings weapons clothes and more it still is a base for a lot of fun. Random events messing around better crash and ragdol animations/physics and some of those missions offline are timeless and fun. When you complete offline there is that sense of I can mess around AND I'm rich!! GREAT!!...But you will eventually increase boredom. Just like any other game. That's gaming for you. I can't blame them much for not adding DLC from online. It would be nice if they aded the least/2nd least expensive vehicle from each new DLC to offline. Plus it may inspire people to get something more expensive online and have that more unique car feel. As long as it's not the same cost as my bus for a week ticket. Which is starting to push the limits. In the end. It's a business and they NEED to earn money. I just think their strategy could kill them in the future if a competitior to GTA isn't as money obsessed and has an equaly or similar appeal and longetivity.Online does offer great modes and missions and it can be further improved with friends. Some cars are also great too. Same for all types of transport to be honest. BUT...After 3 years of online (PS3 PS4) I can say there are major issues. I understand that the DLC needs to be expensive and grinding can be rewarding. I remember grinding crazy with Rooftop Rumble for my Infernus. It was fantastic! But there is a limit. GTA surpassed that limit in my opinion from the Yacht DLC onwards. Furthermore the griefing and constant mayhem is not great in public modes. Always have to watch your map. I understand that it's a free world but haha you'll see when you leave LS Customs in an exploding fireball from sticky bombs mines THAT jet...etc. The passive mode does need improving though it is a good system already. Such as another player can explode an AI car next to yours and you can get damaged/die from it. Missions....AHH NO! Standard missions have had their prives cut massively compared to the older days. Want proper money? Heist it and grind those or do a CEO or Biker equivalent etc...Which involves public lobbies. You could spend ages doing your best earning a load of money and some person decides to Hyrda or throwable explosive you for no other reason they can. Well sometimes there is a reason like they own a business themselves. You get the idea. You know whats fun?! Stress and denile of hours of work!!! $$$When I play GTAV I always go into friend/closed sessions. Public sessions are for mayhem. Friend sessions are much nicer and enjoyable. Unless your friend goes completely crazy or something or you decide to headbut your TV/monitor for no apparent reason. You CAN meet nice people in public sessions. But it's much rarer than it used to be. GTA for new players online is horrible and attrotious. I've met people who find sessions to blow up less that level 10 people. This is our community now? Though so many people play GTAV that you personally could meet all the nice players and enter the right lobbies. It's too vast for straight comparison.GTAV marketing and almost the entire point of GTAV is GTAO (GTA Online).GTAV If this was a 1 10 star system I'd give 3 as a guide for someone new to the game who's interested in both sides.For me as someone who's had GTA for 3 years I'd give a 5.

I do not regret the time I have put into this game. It was far from perfect but it was still a good game. I was ok with how Rockstar introduced microtransactions. They gave everyone access to the dlc for free but you had to either pay real money or grind a lot of missions to be able to own the content. Unfortunately microtransactions are here to stay and this was a more palatable way to introduce them. I feel that this method was implemented improperly though. They priced the new content extremely high and kept the mission payouts low so modders felt the need to ""help"" everyone. Modders runined the online community by giving out large sums of money to players. So to keep up with this you either had to pay more real money grind more missions or become a ""cheater"" by accepting this money.I decided to say online and went back to single player.

First bought and played on the console before the PC release then bought on the PC to continue enjoying GTA Online. We were away for quite awhile but started playing again these last two weeks. There are a lot of cool fun features but require a decent amount of in game cash to buy the properties to unlock the new features. In a way that is a decent way to release new DLC folks can grind out the money or buy Shark cards to gain access. I won't go into the debate on just how expensive the new content is in game but hey we were enjoying the game so we bought some Shark cards. Last night we get home from going out to dinner and find out I was banned for a month and my character will be wiped. All but one of the support tickets I opened were instantly closed with ""all bans are final deal with it"". On the one ""other"" ticket I opened I was told that the money from the Shark cards will still be on the account when the ban is lifted but the character will be wiped. No information on why I was banned so I cannot make any changes to prevent it from happening again. Most likely the ban will be lifted then will just happen again and be permanent.I had fun with this game but due to what seems to be faulty cheat detection software and a draconian customer support organization I will not buy a Rockstar game again.If you only care about single player go for it.Online expect to grind out cash in game or buy shark cards and have it all possibly taken away due to a false positive in their cheat detection software.I did have a lot of fun over the years with this product just wish that I didn't spend the money I did recently in Shark cards just to lose the ability to play the game.

2017-12-30,1,2,78,False,Not Recommended,Like many I had high hopes for this game which were dashed by the delayed PC release. I did not own consoles at the time so just wrote it off as a game I might watch someone play but not invest in myself. Eventually the game did release on PC and by this time I had little to no interest in it.Fast forward a couple years I eventually decide that if I can catch it on a decent enough sale I would get it. As chance would have it I was able to pick it up for relatively cheap during the most recent winter sale. The singleplayer for GTA V starts out incredibly strong establishing well rounded characters that are not just defined by a quirk or two and is reinforced by fun gameplay and an engaging storyline. Sounds great right? Well this is how the game goes for the majority of the singleplayer until you get about 2/3 through it. At this point the missions become very repetitive almost as if Rockstar didn't know where to end it. This is passable as like I mentioned the characters and gameplay are great. That being said for players who enjoy 100% ing games the side missions in this game feel VERY unrewarding with the plot lines going nowhere and the side characters being proven as meaningless for the overarching plot. I played through the first 2/3 of the game doing all of the side missions before eventually ignoring them due to how pointless they felt and how repetitive the whole story was becoming. Instead wishing to just hurry up and get it over with.If your intentions are to just play the singleplayer I would say get the game when it is on sale otherwise perhaps just watch a streamer/youtuber play it and save the money. Despite the strong start I don't believe the singleplayer is worth the normal $60 price tag.This brings me to the multiplayer. Where to begin. One of the biggest factors that kept me from buying this game for the longest time were the reviews about the multiplayer. First the mass hysteria of hackers running rampant and innocent players being banned for no apparent reason. These two alone were big enough to put me off. Eventually the reviews shifted from this painting hope on the desolate scene of GTA Online the hackers are being choked out and the random banning is a thing of the past. How wonderful to hear. If only it were so. The new negative reviews began pouring in. Seemingly by getting rid of their hackers Rockstar got rid of a big portion of the populace that made this game profitable for them on PC. This along with the dark tide of seemingly every video game in this era needing some kind of microtransaction prompted Rockstar to introduce the dreaded Shark Cards and significantly bump the prices of everthing in GTA V up. My initial reaction to the reviews was skeptical assuming the people that were complaining about unfair prices were just too lazy to grind a little and wanted everything handed to them instantly. Sadly this is not the case. Items that you can buy in the singleplayer for say $500 can end up costing $10k or more. This is extremely offputting from a new player's perspective especially considering the leveling system that is require to even have access to most items. There are definitely some serious balancing issues between new players and those that have spent real life money for the shark cards and just makes for a distasteful experience if you are the former. I highly recommend you take your money elsewhere if Online was the main reason you planned to purchase this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

However online play is now the bigger and more saught after part of the game which is why I rebought it for PC and I found it to be very grindy and devoid of many worthwhile rewards. You have to play for hours and hours just to afford even the most basic stuff like a mid end sports car or something like that. The missions are boring and repetitive (except for stunt races in my opinion but they hardly give any payout) and a large pecent of the time I was dealing with someone else in my game who was lagging and therefor kinda ruins it for everyone else.I would say if you want this game for the single player campaigne do it no doubt about it.

Heists are pretty fun arguably has some of the best racing gameplay even amongst racing games shooting is simplistic but satisfying character movement is very awkward and clunky you will always move a little too far or too little or perhaps in the wrong direction of what you were aiming for I personally found it a nightmare to deal with. Air vehicle combat is a bit messy as are some controls for a few of them.The game itself is very hard to have fun in if you have no money and are a low level since most weapons and upgrades have level requirements. Ontop of most ""fun"" vehicles being very expensive and unless you spend an entire day grinding with high level friends who will carry you through heists you will not be able to afford anything.Does it run well?For a port I guess. Lots of stuttering when moving quickly incredibly long load times even with an SSD. Constant lobby connection issues constant issues in minigames constant saving issues constant glitches in heists. Singleplayer runs alright I guess probably because it doesn't have to deal with R's crappy servers as much. So to sum up No.Are there a lot of modders/hackers? Oh absolutely. Though I will say this game has far more modders than people give it credit it's just not all modders are the ones actively trying to ruin your day. I'd be very surprised if there were many people over level 120 in a lobby who actually obtained that level entirely through their own volition by grinding. Or perhaps it's some level 30 with an Office Hangar Bunker Facility doing bombing runs with their maxed out Avenger then jumping out in their maxed X 80. You get the idea.Do I recommend this game?No. I can't recommend this game. I've had fun with it but the amount of times I haven't far outweighs those experiences. From all the connectivity problems the in game performance issues the copy&amp paste of a lot of its content the constant mindless cashgrab vehicle updates R's lack of care about anything other than money constant distruptive modders who have nothing better to do other than spawn cages or go invincible and kill everyone in the lobby the complete mindless grind that this game is if you don't spend hundreds of dollars on in game cash and to top it off the awful anti cheat. It is not only letting modders get away with pretty much anything (you would not believe the stuff I've seen reported and nothing come of it) but if a modder spams RP or money onto you YOU are the one who is banned. I have been banned Twice I've never been able to get over level 100 because of this and I'm just exhausted.If you want this game even despite all this maybe your friends are egging you on to buy it wait until it's at the very lowest sale price because it is without a doubt not worth this price.",Grand Theft Auto V

Today I was banned for a month and my character has been completely reset. I have never hacked in my life in any game I have played. I have nearly 2k hours in CSGO and I hate hackers. Apparently with a recent update people are just getting banned left and right.Rockstar claims to be working on the issue but as of right now they have completely destroyed the great experience I was having with this game.

2017-11-26,0,0,635,False,Recommended,Well this game is in alot of ways good but in alot of other ways it pretty bad. First of the storymode is great...The first time you play it the second time just feels kind of boring since you have already played it. Taking for consideration that the online feature is the main part of this game from my point of view this does not really mather. However. The online incudes alot of buyable stuff that you will have to own to get a decent expirience of the gamemode. This inlcudes a propper apartment so you can play heists alot of fancy car a yatch and aircrafts. All this is my opinion necessary to get a decent expirience of the game. DLC's are free. Well this means that you can download them for free but the content costs a fortune in game and its ceeps adding on. You could purchase sharkcards but you will feel less scammed buying a dead rat. So do i recomend it? Consider that i have played this game for nearly a 1000 hours (on two acounts) i do. Even if you would eventually get bored and the pricetag might not be worth it so i recomend buying this game on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-19,0,0,74,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is not really all that fun. Buy this game on sale if you want to enjoy the story or if you have 3 other friends to enjoy this game with. Otherwise you'll spend 1 5 minutes waiting for GTA Online to load login to server with people level 500+ and a penchant for killing people who aren't in passive. Trying to find a lobby with people to finish a heist is next to impossible when people either leave at the sight of a lower level or less than perfect performance and with little incentive to stick around I don't blame them. Constant begging for shark card purchases everything in the game is locked off by extravegant amounts of money that are only possible with (as mentioned earlier) 3 friends who are willing to work together sheer luck hacking and buying shark cards. Online races are essentially just renditions of TrackMania user made content with sudden inclines and busted track design. Do yourself a favor and play San Andreas or stick to the story mode in this game. If all the above isn't an issue for you then go for it.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's badly balanced badly designed and the team is charge of it have a contempt for it's users. I even got banned for litterally just lagging at one point and I am now perm banned for money exploits (Ban was fair perm wasn't).That however does not change GTA V being an excellent game one of the best ever made in fact. The Online is an extra and is not and should not be the main focus of the game. The world R* have created combined with the excellent shooting driving and just general gameplay make it an incredible experience. The story is weak esspecially compared to GTA San Andreas however that doesn't change how incredible the experience is. Don't let the bad reviews made you think the game isn't good it's just people justifiably annoyed about the poor online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-27,1,2,527,False,Recommended,The game is a blast. Really fun and a good time sink.The single player is amazing very good story and fun to play and had some great laughs. The only problem I have with the game is multiplayer or GTA 5 Online.I enjoy Online using friend invites or solo mode but the problem with online is rockstar and modders. Rockstar has no real anti cheat detection to ban just the modders. So modders will go in and give free money and do others things which can get normal playeras banned for no reason and even if you didn't do anything rock star will perm ban you or ban you for 30 days either way you lose your character and all you worked for online.So be cautious when playing online in a public server. Even if you didn't do anything you could still get banned.Also make sure to check for graphic card patches in some case in the early days of the game people with MSi GPU's would get banned for something and couldn't get online but still able to play Single player.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-20,0,0,1060,False,Not Recommended,"I sent this to Rockstar's feedback email but they'll probably ignore it so. ""First of all advertise your feedback page more because I didn't know it existed until I looked it up and I've been playing the game since it came out for Xbox 360. That was in 2013. Anyway back to the game. You guys must have forgotten that back in the day Ads for GTA V teased info about gambling and maybe even casinos in fact there is still a casino in game the says ""Coming Soon"" even though more than three years later it's still not active. The same goes for the stock market in the Online portion of the game. Also why are there so many things in GTA Online that are not in GTA V and vice sersa? For example if I would play GTA Online and accidentally blow up my car I call my insurance and pay some money to get it back no big deal. But If the same thing happens in GTA V then I just lose the car entirely and have to buy or steal a new one. Then we get to the shark cards. Did you know the fastest way to get the majority of players in a game to hate it and stop buying it isto add an option to pay real life money to acquire in game money? The reason for that is that it causes massive inflation. That means that when a gun costs say $150 before the option to buy money the gun will cost $200 or $250 instead. And yes I know Rockstar is making massive amounts of money on this but let me show you what this really does. I had a character in GTA Online for a while and transferred it to PC the earliest I could and worked on it to try to obtain as much as I could but also have fun. The problem though was that to have fun in GTA Online a player has to spend TONS of money. Now this is pretty normal but then you look at the average job and see that even though a player can buy a SINGLE plane for $10 million the average pay is only a few thousand. Then if you calculate how much money it would cost to obtain everything (Assuming the player fills all garages buys all Pegasus vehicles which is around 88 and buys all real estate with the highest pricespossible) he or she would spend upwards of $300 million. I ACTUALLY TESTED THIS. Then if you calculate how much that would cost in real US Dollars to buy the shark cards it would cost $3 750. Do you honestly think someone will pay that?

2017-06-15,0,0,629,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto. A series from my childhood in which i cherished forever ...Until now.Since the launch of GTA V the experience has been slowly getting more annoying awkward and repetitive. Rockstar Games has shunned off the modding community since the beginning and fail to realise that THAT is a huge reason why people buy the game on PC in the first place. No longer. I have been playing since day 1 on the PlayStation 3 and later PlayStation 4 before upgrading to PC racking somewhere around 2 to 3 THOUSAND hours across the board. Hear my words as a veteran of the series as well as this game itself...Rockstar Games has started to think with their bank rather than their brains. They've made billions off this game alone and has STILL been charging microtransactions on GTA Online for years as well.Making it impossible to play and earn money huge paywalls into new features for updates slowly catering to a community of children and trolls who just want to ruin any fun you might have in Online by launching features and weapons that are so overpowered (and again behind a paywall so those who cant afford it are helpless and those who have them are ego driven trolls) to the point where they've entirely ruined the storyline and feel of their well put together game into what is bascially the equivilent of Syria. Tanks APCs armored vehicles cars with guns on them all driving around and creating chaos. Free Mode is ruined and so is this series now.Pros Good cars somewhat decent fun in private lobbies with friends fun to hang out and do dumb $#!T on.Cons Community is trash huge paywalls in features mods are dissappearing the game has turned into a third person sandbox version of Twisted Metal and Call of Duty mashed into one horrible game.Money will be better spent on PC parts food... You know what you're better off putting the money in your mouth and swallowing it than wasting it on this. At least cotton paper has some nutrients.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V is like the whole franchise combined its amazing how good is the voice acting the back story's of the main characters.Its not only Rockstar that makes this game amazing and really fun its the mods the people that make them sometimes some mods are even more creative that rockstar.And the community is not as mean and bad like CS GO and other games theres actually a lot of friendly people to play with. Theres a lot of things to do in freemode too making an organization buying a yacht and defending it and many other things.The game is fun but not really fun without friends because you can do much more stuff with friends and have fun when you play with randoms you're kinda more competitive and you dont see how fun the game actually is when you play with friends you dont take the jobs as serious so you have more fun.I strongly recommend this game 11/10 IGN .

2017-06-18,0,0,588,False,Not Recommended,"I'm done with this game. 500 hours and nothing to show for it. Never took money from a modder so maybe its my own fault because friends who have played less than 100 hours have 2x 3x the high end stuff like armed vehicles and new bunkers/club house crap because they had money spawned on them by modders.Unless you want to grind the same lame heist over and over or fork over $$$ for shark cards don't expect to have anything. Every new update adds lots of new cars sometimes new guns but you can't even access some of the newer content without $10 million gta$ because modders spawning money has inflated the price of ANYTHING released post ""next gen"" GTAV. Quickest/most efficent heist will hardly net you $300k/hr and thats only if you don't fail which getting a good team that actually talks is almost impossible. And as ever hackers/modders are rampant and I've heard that recently that its possible for modders to make it look like YOU are cheating and get your character reset.So summarize I love the game. Its a blast. But its not worth $60 or 500 hours. I hate that its a boring grind fest to unlock new content. I hate that Rockstar would rather inflate the prices of new content to deter modders rather than fix the problem at the source. Because lets be real about it modders don't hurt Rockstar's bottom line they improve it. They can justify inflating prices because of modders and anyone who plays legit can either grind keeping GTAV up on the list of most played on steam or buy shark cards which in turn makes Rockstar money. They really don't give a I won't buy the next GTA unless I see that it has proper anti cheat post release. Same goes for RDR2 which I guess will be an indicator of how much Rockstar actually cares. Below is a review that was posted when scripthookIV ceased development I actually thought that it would curb the number of cheaters boy was I wrong. At that point I had about 300 hours tells you how much of a sucker I am. On behalf of everyone who was tired of mod menus in online thank you rockstar.On behalf of all modders out there you are a rockstar but that's your usual MO as far as mods go.On my own behalf I don't give a so long as the cheaters stop. GTAIV has had rampant cheaters for far to long and sadly people should realize OpenIV and ScripthookIV were the first to break the lame ""security"" rockstar put in. It wasn't until people started getting dropped that they made the single player only requirement and even then there's tutorials to get AROUND that and still use scripthookIV to load your stuff.

2018-06-24,2,2,150,False,Not Recommended,The game's great don't get me wrong. It's a really fun game and a great improvement from IV and San Andreas. But most of its loading is hell and could take up to 30mins (+patience). This one really taught me not to mess with the NPC and they'll get yo boi. Truth is I've bought the game mainly for its online mode so I can be the gangster with ma homie. but that's the real problem. Rockstar could really be unforgiving to cheaters but if the game hates you you're out. There's this random banning going on still since earlier this year (2018) and it's still hot. I was one of the victim. I knew the risk of it but I thought man what are the chances right? With my buddy still swinging round town gunnin them Ballas and robbing big cars. I contacted the Rockstar support live chat but he almost sounded like a robot. Bans are unappealable and undiscussable. Final and all. I understand that they take it seriously but I believe they should at least hear us out. Though that makes their life misarable with exploiters and cheaters faking it (damn them really). The banning system is pretty unpridictable and unforgiving wiping people off the server as Thanos wills it. I hope they would try to find out what is going on with the banning as I'm pretty sure it is unfair as it may be. I have not modded not griefed and certainly not alter any scripts. Well about the cheaters oh damn they could set you on fire on their command. Spawn you a campfire and you're the walking camp fire now. That sounds fun I've always wanted to light the way.Well if this seem like a review off topic it is because the online service is the problem and not the actual game itself. Loads like a charm and controls are pretty smooth. You can do heists (most of the time are 4 man team) buy properties and be a CEO of a company shoot people shoot cops steal cars and beat people up.

Hoewever as of June 2017 Rockstar's parent company Take Two has declared that modding a game that I bought is illegal. I really hope this goes to court because it lines up with the recent supreme court case Impression Products v. Lexmark. I hope that action is taken to prevent this from becoming a precedent. Single player modding should not be illegal because it cannot affect anyone other than the player.https //www.washingtonpost.com/news/the switch/wp/2017/05/31/how a supreme court ruling on printer cartridges changes what it means to buy almost anything/?utm_term .cc5012b73152,Grand Theft Auto V

For those of you who do not know what this is basically you buy the 60 euros game and they start you off with 20 grand in online ( for those who did not pre order)... If you think this is enough money then you've never played online before. Anyways once you have spent your 20 grand and you can no longer afford private dances from FuFu at the strip club your knee deep in You have the options of grinding up money through missions or through robbing random stores but if you have no money no ammo you're in the But Rockstar being the great game making gods they are allow you to BUY in game online currency using your mom's credit card.Is this some kind of cruel joke? Does Rockstar seriously expect people to buy in game currency for their half online mode? They never add anything cool and the game gets boring very fast. If you're low on money you should just zoom from lobby to lobby looking for hackers to drop you money.They gave us PC mode which is ok but it's not worth 60 euros. Just go buy csgo for 13 euros and you get way more for your money.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-10,0,0,319,False,Not Recommended,GTA 5 online modeThe only issue I've encountered to date is that GTA 5 online kills your internet connection thus rendering it useless for other applications. The game is not optimized to share bandwidth and hogs the TCP application layer. Rockstar will persist the issue is the customers issue and that you'll need to use PortForward your private network... that is a bogus statement to start with yet packet sniffers note otherwise. It's very clear Rockstar has not troubleshooted their application nor has any intention in resolving the applications constant barrage of dgm requests caused by GTA 5.It's been an issue since GTA 5 has been launched and still thousands of customers complain about it and Rockstar does nothing to resolve it.I do not recommend GTA 5 to anyone until Rockstar resolves this issue. GTA 5 offline modeRockstar will ban any user using mods for offline use. This is unacceptable. All customers who purchase the game are entitled to use mods to enhance and add to their enjoyment. Rockstar ought to have implemented a way to block mods which would verify the file integrity of valid files upon launching online mode thus present a *warning* to the customer that they have modified files within the GTA 5 directory and or launch the game and placing these modified files in a seperate directory allowing the customer to run GTA 5 in a verified mode online while keeping the integrety of the users modifications for their and friends personal use. I'm sure there are other way's to accomodate this but Rockstars blatent neglect for this is both irresponsible and unprofessional. Rockstar was and has been well aware that customers will use mods for offline use as it's been a popular feature in previous titles. Either way if you mod and enter online mode you risk the option to be banned and by reading other reviews Rockstar does not care and does not resolve issues. Clearly this presents a legal matter.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-11,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar's most recent patch has put game performance before multiplayer in an attempt to confuse modders which has contradicted Rockstar's statement of supporting single player modding. Not only that but the way they are trying to rid of mods is ridiculous inwhich they infected the game with junk code that has caused severe FPS drops for everyone alike. All of this for some pricey digital car that Rockstar wants you to spend shark cards on. The game itself is fantasic nontheless but the poor attempts to salvage the crappy mulitplayer and prevent modding which makes the game whole leaves me with this negative review.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-25,1,2,445,False,Not Recommended,There are a REDICULOUS amount of hackers on GTA Online. So much so that there is little point playing in public lobbies or public jobs as you are guaranteed to get at least one hacker ruining it for you. Rockstars stance is that they don't care as long as you arent hacking to give yourself in game currency they could be selling to you through shark cards.Other issues include Excruciatingly long load times online (even with a SSD and 50mb/s internet speed) which is by far the worst I've experienced on an online game ever. Poor performance in certain areas of the game Large amounts of game breaking bugs which will kick you off online or crash your game altogether. Latency and network issues leading to high pings and teleporting all over the map during missions/jobsAs much as I like GTA I can't recommend it until rockstar does something about the insane amount of hacking going on in multiplayer and fixes the other issues I mention above.

I work on a towboat so for six months out of the year I live and work on a boat with no internet connection aside from my phone where cell service is crappy at best. The only form of entertainment that i bring with me is my laptop. The offline feature requiring a internet connection is utter bulls**t. I paid money for this damn game i should be able to play it when i want. It says you need to sign in at least once to play offline. That would have been no big deal but them saying that is simply not true. You need a internet connection Every. Freaking. Time. Needing to have an active connection to play without a connection every time is just idiotically stupid. Rockstar apparently does not understand or care that they are pretty much screwing over fans of the game who live in rual areas or because of their job have to live without an internet connection most of the time. Telling me that i only have to sign in once to play offline is a out right lie and as far as i am concerned it was a lie told to me and others simply to get my money. Tried looking up solutions for this problem now that im home and this has apparently been an issue for a while that they refuse to correct. Until Rockstar pulls its head out of its a$$ and removes the restriction that prevents me from playing a game that I paid for a game that i would not have paid money for had i known about this issue that they flat out lied about i cannot recomomend buying this game.

You can't even get the Hydra a fan favourite jet of the series in singleplayer without the use of mods. Which brings me to my next point.Take Two has sent a cease and desist to the developers of the biggest modding tools for GTA IV and GTA V. Basically saying ""Stop doing that or we'll sue."" They just want more people to play multiplayer instead of singleplayer and buy their crappy microtransactions because everything costs to much. Do not buy this game. Do not support this crap.Update Even though they retracted the cease and desist the fact remains is that they did it in the first place. And the game is still being ruined on purpose.

2017-12-28,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,"Review Multiplayer is utter garbage the whole thing is a grind fest due to this the limited number of missions is quite apparent and how often missions are recycled but just with a different goal e.g. Lamar s missions where the 2nd and 3rd mission is just drive from A to B then shoot incoming waves of enemies from different places preplanning feels like a waste of time with no purpose but just to serve as an AGL.The game constantly tries to shove it's Sharkcards down your throat by making EVERYTHING really ing expensive and by using the equivalent of ""pop ups"" in the form of reminding you every 2 minutess that they have a really cool expensive base that costs min 900 ing k or more from which you can access the new missions which I've heard are quite a pain to do as you have to do some of the preplanning in freeroam . *NoteThere are also a ton of script kiddies in multi you can avoid them if you turn passive mode on BUT if you pick up money that has been spawned by them you have a high chance being banned. You can also get banned for leaving any mods in from sp. when joining a session even if that mods is just a texture mod/overhaul this just shows how the ""Anti Cheat System"" in place is.During the 2 weeks since I've purchased the game the servers were down for hours but when checking the official R* site about the status of course it still said that the servers were up despite the fact that people were complaining on the formums. I've had constant issues with lagg and latency issues when playing with others in a session taking a clip or so to take down a single enemy with headshots often registered as hitting in the chest or not registering at all however this all quickly changes when you are alone in a session the number of bullets to take down an enemy noticeably decreased and headshots registered twice as often. I also checked whether the problem was on my end or not (it was not) and found that it didn't make a difference whether I was hosting the heist/mission or some random the issue was still present leaving me believe that the issue must be with the servers not being able to handle the bandwidth or something.Loading screens would often take way too long after missions ranging from 3 to 25 minutes IF it load at all as I had quite a few ones where I just gave up and restarted the game. Joining would often take twice as long to join multiplayer than sp even though it doesn t need to load in that much more again leaving me suspect that it s the servers that are slow. Conclusion The multi still has problems latency issues script kiddies loading times and many other things I ve not mentioned despite being out for over two and a half years (2.7 at the time of writing) and if they haven t fixed it since they never will.I would only recommend it for the sp or if you have a friend (or friends for a better experience) to play with and a load of free time however it definitely does not worth the 40 asking price wait till it s on sale or avoid it if possible (it s probably better if you do so). Notes Text Explanation sp singleplayer multi multiplayer AGL ""Artificial Game Lengthener"" *Note I recently discovered that you can view stats on e.g.. total income which for me over a little less than 40 hours was just a wee under 1 million which just goes to show how much you have to grind in this game. Even if I kept it all and not spent a dime I could just blow it on a SINGLE VEHICLE but I had to spend on guns to be capable taking on more difficult missions meaning that early on you have to spend on guns then later on some armoured or gun mounted vehicles become a must for these missions.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,391,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar and Take Two are horrible when it comes to pleasing their fans. At first I thought they were great for releasing all the free DLC that they did. But then enter the cash fixes... Modders are in every lobby some teleport around and kill you while others just drop money on you. If you receive the latter Rockstar eventually will end up taking away ALL your money even the portion that wasn't from modders. This happened to me recently. A modder dropped a ton of money on people via CEO bonuses or whatever they're called in portions of 500k per bonus spamming it probably 3 times per second. Obviously that adds up really quickly. I don't necessarily care that they adjusted the banks of modded money but where I get off is where they take away ALL your money for something that is out of your control. It's not like there's a function to remove or drop cash so how am I supposed to get rid of the modded money? The answer is you don't and that's the worst part about it. Because they will punish you for something someone else did to you. I even wrote them a ticket to ask them for my 8M of legitimately earned money back to which they replied ""We adjusted all illegally gained money"" and quickly closed the ticket without letting me respond. That is hands down THE WORST customer service I have ever seen. I have gotten better customer service from McDonald's... And then my favorite part is when Rockstar puts Shark cards on sale immediately after taking away everyone's money. It's like they're not even try to hide their intentions any more. Rockstar has once again chosen the road that is profitable over the road that keeps their fanbase happy customers. It really is sad as I have sank over 350 hours into this game 95% of it online. One other thing that really bothers me that goes in hand with their customer service is the fact that Rockstar doesn't listen to their fans when developing new content. Some things players have been asking for a long time such as lobbies to freely use mods and other things along these lines would have been so nice and a great gesture from Rockstar that they really are listening to their fans. I personally think that this strategy is why games companies like Riot and Blizzard are so successful because not only do they listen to their community but they value their input. Being a part of the creative process really makes a fan want to play more! But Rockstar seems to have gotten it backwards as they don't seem like they would give a rat's about what their customers and fanbase have to say. It's bad business and it's going to come back and bite them in the I would have easily recommended this game to friends had Rockstar not been the company they are turning into. I probably won't be buying GTA VI when it eventually comes out and probably not buying Red Dead 2 either. I will give my money to a company that values its customers. It's a shame to see such a formerly great company become the worst in a matter of months.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,173,False,Not Recommended,That's great Rockstar told TakeTwo to back off of OpenIV. TakeTwo has still destroyed its reputation of course. Apologizing and reversing actions does little to repair the insight we've gained about the company's motives. Its heavy handed approach and ignorance of the modding community shows that its only goal is to maximize the money in its bank account. Whether or not people liked OpenIV or that it was singleplayer only was irrelevant. If it posed even the slightest threat to TakeTwo's bank account it'd sic its lawyers after the creators.You are this company's cash cow whom they feed shark cards and from your swollen udder they milk your money. It's still reprehensible that such a well known and well designed game stooped low enough to charge you money for the base game turn around and force microtransactions in the form of shark cards down your throat and then follow up by releasing DLC ONLY for multiplayer where their shark cards are effective. In fact these two companies care so little about your online experience that the only thing that GETS patched in online is money cheats. That's it. Not car spawning not exploding other players not infinite off the radar. Just the only thing threatening their shark card sales. Whether or not a cheater comes by and s up your day is irrelevant to them.They wouldn't give a if cheaters could blow up your computer and kill you with the resulting explosion as long as they had a clause in their EULA that let them own the contents of your bank account upon your demise and a way to avoid the PR fallout. Hell they'd probably even try to make it easier for cheaters to do it.The only reason those microtransactions are there is because YOU yes YOU buy them. It is effective for TakeTwo to muscle in microtransactions through Rockstar's game because you are being WEAK WILLED and making the tactic WORK. Giving in to their manipulation is the surefire way to ensure these ing disgusting business practices are in the next game and the next game and the next game.Don't like it? Don't buy it. Vote with your money you weak willed piece of Basically singleplayer was great at first until we realized all DLC was going to multiplayer which is a festering cesspool of microtransactional manipulation. Would be a 10/10 game otherwise. Microtransactions just ruin it and turn everything into a giant grind that anyone with more money than you can just skip and flaunt to you. P.S. FiveM is a popular alternative to GTA Online multiplayer. You can get all that cool stuff and more without having to empty your bank account into the creators' Bahamas vacation fund in exchange for a useless yacht and some fast cars in an online game. PS WHATEVER Rockstar doesn't pay jack to host GTA Online servers at least not on PC. It's all peer to peer meaning you're hosting their services for them. They just have to host moderate traffic to authenticate players and that's it. You're literally paying them to host their servers on your computer and use your internet connection.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,378,False,Not Recommended,"When I first got this game and played with friends I had mixed feelings. Truthfully I loved the game overall. It had it's issues such as enemies spawning out of fat air (in view too) a terrible menu system that's clearly just ported over from consoles and some other stuff too but I could look past it because of the fun I was able to have with my friends. I loved playing online and just doing stupid stuff with my friends maybe working towards the next cool car or something. Over time however they started introducing new content which sounds like a good thing right? I thought so too but I always had a bit of a problem with the pricing of their new online content. Say they introduce an awesome new vehicle for a couple million in game dollars. You have the option to farm up this money at no cost of your own (aside from a tremendous amount of time) which is great but as someone with a full time job I feel like I can't keep up playing the game this way. So maybe after so many hours it's time to drop some money? After all I've received HOURS of entertainment from this game whats a few more dollars? Unfortunately the price of their ""shark cards"" (the way to buy in game currency) is just ridiculous. Take a look at the wiki which shows the prices for these cards http //gta.wikia.com/wiki/Cash_CardsI recall when they introduced all these amazing new vehicles I wanted to try like the Ramp buggy or the Rocket car each of which costs you around 2 to 3 MILLION in game currency. Not only that but you'll end up spending a couple million on buildings that you'll need to house this stuff and warehouses you'll need to earn more in game currency. I look on the wiki here and see that 3.5 million in game dollars costs $50.00 USD... What? Is this a fun way to play the game? I want to say that I believe more people would purchase these cards if the prices were more reasonable but I can only say that for myself. The game has quickly become stale for me and I place a large amount of blame on the terrible choices for pricing on all this new content. And with the newest debacle of mods being under attack by the game's publisher it has become more and more clear that the people in charge of this game care more about filling their pockets with your money than they do about making a good product. Maybe that seems normal to some people I know you can't build a business on generosity but I know there is a middle ground and I refuse to support this.

GTA V has mediocre gunplay and decent writing so that's a step up but it still suffers from the same problem that makes all GTA games dead boring to me most of the time is spent driving from point A to point B. That's the reason I almost didn't finish Watch Dogs 2 and that's the reason I'll never finish GTA V. GTA Online can be fun with friends but more than 75% of the time is spent in menus and loading screens. If you're playing alone it's going to be painful rather than fun.Steam needs a 'meh' option for reviews. This isn't a bad game but it definitely isn't a good game either.

It becomes mind numbingly boring very quickly yet you want the new shiny stuff they keep bringing out so you subject yourself to doing the same things over and over. Then you get banned mistakenly and Rockstar Support is utterly useless. If you have ever managed to get hold of a human on the other end of Rockstar Support then you should try and find a Master Ball and capture it quick because that's even more rare than finding someone on this game who doesn't behave like a BECAUSE THEY CAN.Everything is ridiculously expensive yet jobs yield very little and unless you have some very good friends who can actually play the game you won't find a random player willing to Heist with you. And when you do they are ten levels of utterly suck. You'll rob a bank for $1.25 million and come out with 3 cents because they kept walking into the line of fire and losing all the money you just spent hours trying to get. In conclusion if you haven't got any friends this is the game for you. Play singleplayer and mod the hell out of it. If you dare play GTA Online prepare to waste many hours before finally realising what a load of garbage it is and returning to a game which does not revolve around microtransactions ( 60 for a shark card are you kidding me Rockstar?). By the time you get enough money to buy something new and shiny another update is released and your million dollar car is redundant.

2017-06-15,0,0,259,False,Not Recommended,I don't tend to use mods in this game since I do enjoy online races and creator mode and the like but I can't in good faith sit by and watch Take Two try and drive the modding community out of the game presumably an attempt to get more people to play their horribly balanced multiplayer and force them to buy the microtransactions you essentially require to access most of the new online content at this point without hours and hours of grinding. It's worth noting that OpenIV the tool that T2 are trying to take down can't even be used to mod public multiplayer sessions if T2 thinks they can justify their actions by pinning the blame on the mod menu problem that plagues GTA Online they're sorely mistaken.I usually don't buy into the whole 'leave negative reviews because of developer/publisher actions even if the game itself is good' thing but in this case I can't even call the game good anymore. It's hard to believe that the first content updates used to be completely free and were available in both single player and multiplayer when we're now forced to pay upwards of $2mil just to buy the PREREQUISITES for accessing the new content. Single player hasn't had a single update in almost 2 years if you absolutely must buy the game and don't want to play multiplayer a pre owned 360/PS3 copy will have almost all the SP content of the current gen version for a fraction of the price. Don't give T2 any money whatsoever.EDIT R* has convinced T2 to back off single player mods. Regardless I still can't recommend this game for full price online mode is still bad and single player isn't quite expansive enough without mods to recommend.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,293,False,Not Recommended,"As a person who bought this game almost solely for the modding opportunities I am seriously disappointed with this games management. For those whom aren't aware TakeTwo the games publisher sent a Cease and Desist notification to the developers of OpenIV a modding tool which allows users to replace and modify files in Rockstar's special archive format "".rpf"". This means that the future of the game's modding is in question as files for vehicle models player models peds voicelines and various other game files will no longer be accessible to modify. This could hinder the benifits of model replacements ever wanted to change the models of police vehicles into realistic CVPIs? Not anymore. Wanted to change the models and environment to look like it's from another country? No longer possible. The direct consequence is that the player or modder can no longer create or install these mods an open world game like Grand Theft Auto is ideal for modding. These have no impact on online play (as the anti cheat system would block you from accessing GTA online) and this decision mostly has its affects on the players who want to enjoy single player with something more than just the vanilla game whilst most cheaters in online play get off free. This decision affects the modding community at its heart and is not something I will condone. Fair enough people who cheat in online play should be banned but the developers who change the game in single player or the players who use the mods where it does not impact on anyone's gaming experience except the player enjoying the mods are not cheating. This was a terrible decision to make and if you don't redeem yourself now by withdrawing the Cease and Desist order GTA VI will not be a record breaking hit on the PC again.TL DR TakeTwo Interactive sent the delevopers of a vital modding tool a C&amp D notification. This will harm the modding community therefore I and many others am angry.If you believe that OpenIV should continue to operate please sign this petition. I am not confident that it will make much of a difference but it's something https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivEdit There is a clear difference between modding and cheating. Modding is changing the game or your own experience in an environment where it doesn't affect anyone but yourself. Cheating is where one changes the game to give themselves an unfair advantage over others. So for those who say that this shoots down cheaters you're wrong.",Grand Theft Auto V

The game has literally like... FOUR missions in it.""Steal the coke!"" (Literally 50% of all missions you are lucky when the coke is not deadbolted to a 10 mph car... Also i just count every ""steal"" mission towards this because seriously does it make a difference if you do ECACTLY the same mission but in 1 it says ""steal the coke inside a plane by stealing the plane"" and in the other ""steal a plane""? No! It is EXACTLY the same thing!)""Kill the guy!"" (Yea sometimes they could not even put a real objective in so... like 25% of all missions are JUST killing faceless npc... who can outnumber you by like 50 to 1 and auto aim in the dark...)and... uhmm... What other missions were there again? Thinking of it... even the last heisst i did was ONLY ""Steal the X!"" and ""kill the guys!"" missions... The ONLY difference is that there is this npc that just won't stop talking through the entire mission otherwise it's EXACTLY the same stuff you always do except that the location is a tiny tiny tiny bit more fancy this time. I.e. instead of killing someone in the middle of the city you now have to walk up 10 stairs in some military building and THEN shoot a guy! Isn't that SUCH a different mission? Instead of killing a guy you walk stairs and THEN kill a guy WHILE listening to that ing INSANE NPC???I can't wait for the next update on the game! Can't wait for the one where we get all the normal missions again but this time while playing the mission there is just a huge picture of a dog turd on your screen so you can't actually see the game!

Some vehicles in this game are unbalanced like too overpriced or just completley unbalanced. Also there is modders that is a problem with the online I haven't been seeing them that often though since Rockstar recently shutdown one of the most popular mod menus out there so I can't really say much about modders. The playerbase in general on the other hand aren't that nice they like blowing you up and want to stop whatever you're trying to do supply mission or just trying to have fun with your friends.

2017-06-10,0,0,1418,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is a very technically impressive game especially considering it launched three seperate times for 5 different platforms. With the pc version being the last to come out Rockstar/Take Two has only kneecapped themselves as the game progressed. Very nice driving physics and fun third person gameplay cannot excuse the absolute cash grab that is the multiplayer. For a mode originally tacked on akin to goldeneye for the n64 Take Two has put a lot of faith in the continued longevity of GTA Online. So much so that they have neglected the single player and refused to release single player dlc. It's a hard truth to accept but Take Two/ Rockstar has given up on the game itself to shill thier moneymaking desires. As GTA gets older in my opinion it is becoming less of a game and more of a job. And I believe games should not aspire to be jobs first and foremost games should be for the enjoyment of the players. And I have enjoyed myself as much as possible with this game. Even with the interests of take two interfering with the balance of the online mode and the neglect of the single player GTA 5 is still a damn good game and you will definitely get your moneys worth on it. Just dont expect to have extended fun with this game.Edit Due to Take Two's decision to send a cease and desist letter to the modding communtiy I cannot reccomend this game anymore.Edit2 Due to the recent ban wave on March 24th 2018 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Rockstar has shown little regard for anyone banned falsely and resets characters with thousands of hours for false reasons and I will not support any more of their games in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V

Out of the 287.3 hours I have played I think around 50 of that was playing Online.

2015-07-18,0,0,775,False,Not Recommended,So I had a decent review for this game when I first got it years ago Then I changed my review due to the removal of mods and the ability to mod the game. But now I deleted my previous review and this is a new one why?As far as I am concerned a cheating system is there to keep away cheaters from the actual legit players wanting to enjoy or in this case atleast try to enjoy the game.I downloaded the game AGAIN after i deleted it a year ago because of the new updates in online which got me excited who doesn't want to buy a new flying car to fly around the city? Now I try to grind a bit and play online and I open the game not 5 minutes from writing this review to find my account suspended for a month till the 16th of June 2018.So here's the question. What in the actual happened? Is this game's cheating system just a bunch of random bans to anybody who was playing? And I didn't even find a modder or any cheater within my game when I was playing hell I didn't even do anything but missions and races.So? I'm off not because a non fair suspended my account where in this case other people are also getting banned left and right for no ing reason. But because I didn't get a chance to actually play the online of the game.And for someone who was dying to get their hands on the new cars of the new update or even having a property in game and these kind of stuff this is seriously ed up to prevent someone from the experience they paid for their game.So for an actual review the game's singleplayer is good. online is trash because if you think you won't cheat or meet a cheater at any time this can happen to you for no reason.Don't get it for the online. And even for the singleplayer the 60 dollars aren't enough for it alone. What a ed up situation.,Grand Theft Auto V

That was until I got a random ban due to playing the online version of the game for an hour.I've probably only clocked about 10 hours of online play since I bought GTAV when it came out. It's not something I really get a kick out of and amassed a ""fortune"" of about $4500. I don't mod my games and my PC system is clean (I'm an IT pro with over 30 years PC experience so I *know* my system is clean).The night I (somehow) got the ban I logged in on a whim wandered around a bit bought a jacket in a shop (accidentally) and then found someone sniping me. I died a few times before I spotted where they were and returned the compliment. It was pretty even on the kill/die count after that. I then went into ""observation mode"" to go look at my assailant before I shut down for bed. Went over for a nosey then exited the game. That hour was probably the most fun I'd had in the Online version of the game.A week later I get the urge to go on again and found that I'm a week into a 30 day ban! No idea why. No feedback just the dire warning that a second ban would be permanent!I have no idea why I received a ban. None whatsoever. Has to be their anti cheat software raising a 'false positive'. If I play it again I could be permabanned but I haven't a clue what happened the first time so that I can investigate and correct it.There's no communication from Rockstar. I tried raising a ""bug"" report but nothing back from them. It's a ridiculous way to treat paying customers. I absolutely *hate* game cheats they have ruined some of my favourite online games in the past. I just wish I could help Rockstar to debug their system communication is essential for that.Sadly this will be the last game I buy from what used to be my favourite developers...",Grand Theft Auto V

But Online is a mess unbalanced payouts nothing done against kiddie scripts who are just out to cause chaos and think they're tough stuff by using a menu to mess with you.The dodgy business practices that the game has also sadly taken part in around a steam summer sale the games price was increased a week before the sale and was discounted for the same price before it was increased then the next day the only way to get GTA V was bundled with sharkcards which meant if you wanted to buy the game as a gift for a friend you had to pay full price.FiveM was a mod way back which was going to allow you to play storymode with friends as the different main characters so what happens is Take Two send some private investigtors to the homes of the modders to get them to stop development of FiveM and I beileve this also happened to the team of GTA M which is shady as .Recently around 2017 June Take 2 basically stated they aren't milking the GTA Online community enough of money for a full priced game they've already paid for which you can only wonder how well that went down with every and then during E3 they send cease and desist letters to the OpenIV more than likely hoping gaming news would blow it over and keep it on the low down.Now OpenIV was more than likely never used to be fiddling with Online however there has been a couple of stories that this banning was more than likely an attempt to bully single player users into going into Online so they have to suffer the grind and then T2 pray for them to have no back bone and buy lots of sharkcards.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now I make public the current state of Online I want to expand my last review. This game gave me so much happiness and frustration. By the amount of hours I played you can trust me that both V and Online are amazing games. V has an amazing history and plot. Not the best and can be a little boring here and there but you enjoy the game. And the graphics are very well done. For a 2014 game is ageing well. The introduction of three characters is a good concept and for me works very well. The game has its flaws dont get me wrong but its a game worth picking in discount of 25% or like now at 50% just for single player.But Online is a different thing. I did and still enjoy the game till this day. The frequent updates keep the game fresh ish. The friends I made and the amazing crew I been introduce to make me play even more. The amount of things you can do are tremendous. Heists races tune cars modify your PC at your liking and a lot of more stuff that gives a sense of freedom in a game that sometimes shocks you with high prices.This game is great but no for someone new. Unless you have friends who already play or you are a ppl person you wont enjoy Online. Too much overpowered vehicles roam Public Lobbys making the experience frustrating for new players. Trying to do things with randoms can get you kicked most of the times for being low level.Almost forgot. Shark Cards are made so tempting when you are new and need that boost.If you are new keep in mind what I said please.Final veredict. Sp is worth if you like the history or plan to mod the game. It has a great community with mods and things like that.Online only with friends or a friendly crew or have the temperament to play with randoms. If not dont even try Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,In light of the recent scumbag move from Take Two suddenly not allowing single player mods I'm now finally giving this a thumbs down. Aside from already buying this game twice at this point (once on console again for PC) I feel the way TT and R* have treated their playerbase is dissapoiting and has ultimately tarnished the reputation of a company beloved by many including myself.The game had it's problems early on the first big shock was the scattergun banning of users online for using mods which was poorly handled with many users who didn't use mods getting their access stripped away with no explination. This was a sign of things to come as R* and TT were quietly paving the way to shoe horn microtransactions into a $60 game post launch. This was to alleivate the deliberately grindy nature of the online experience turning what could have been a fantastic comminuty platform experience into a pay to progress model with only the prospect of a formidable grind over the same handful of heists and missions as the alternative.Single player had been neglected with no fantastic Stories from Liberty City type DLC to speak of. For the majority of single player users the feeling of abandonment from the developer was palpable instead favoring any development time concentrating on the small portion of the gaming community willing to pay for shark cards.The only saving grace had been the stellar single player modding community which had kept this and many previous R* titles afloat and active with thousands of wonderful and creative mods fixing many of the Single Player's gutted features and lackluster elements.Now however TT (and perhaps R*) have decided we haven't spent enough of our money and are now going after the very same community which have helped rise their games over the competition. For shame. Biting the hand which has fed them for so long in favour for short sighted arrogant greed.Don't support a CEO who shows such obvious contempt for their client base. To him we're nothing but a bunch of desperate kids cunning theives and braindead whales. Vote with your wallet or these practices will become commonplace.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is filled with too many cliches and it tries too hard to be a Michael Bay movie or something. Having a game set in present day as opposed to a certain era as has been the case with many previous games doesn't translate to nearly as interesting story or setting as it should. You can clearly see how much emphasis was but in the Online section and how the singleplayer suffered from that approach and that is not fine in my books. Playing Online is an endless grind unless you're willing to open your wallet for some ridiculiously priced in game cash or dare just go and outright hack by spawning money.Take Two's approach to hinder mod and third party multiplayer development is the last nail in the coffin in this sinking ship.,Grand Theft Auto V

With this decision by Take Two I will not be purchasing another Rockstar/Take Two game until the community is listened to (and perhaps not even then).With their continual attention to GTA Online instead of the base game is frustrating given we were told there would be single player content added in later on.

2017-06-15,0,0,172,False,Not Recommended,Singleplayer is good. But god please don't buy this for GTA Online.

Rockstar is not doing anything about them or at least I don't notice it in any way and even if they do there isn't even an option for us to report players for cheating you can just report them for insulting you and such.And now Take2 even went as far to send a cease and desist letter to the creators of openIV effectively making modding GTA in singleplayer illegal. So my recommendation if you have already played the singleplayer don't buy this game even if online wasn't swarming with hackers it has just become such a terribly slow grind to get new Cars Weapons and especially the items from the latest dlcs.

I was minding my own business the other day in passive mode doing stunt jumps and a modder killed me destroyed my personal vehicle and crashed my game to the desktop. It's infuriating having to constantly make insurance claims after a modder destroys your personal vehicle while you're in passive mode and even more infuriating having to constantly find a new session because every lobby seems to have at least one modder at all times.Until they crackdown on modding I will not recommend this game to anyone looking to play it online.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,463,False,Not Recommended,"This recent cease and desist order from TakeTwo to the team developing OpenIV finally pushed me to write this review. If you play GTA for the mods do not purchase Grand Theft Auto V. TakeTwo Interactive the publisher of GTA recently shut down development of the community mod OpenIV. This breaks the company's promise to leave the developers of single player mods alone ""the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV."" In order to push more players to play GTAOnline TakeTwo killed a core component of modding in GTA. This is unacceptable. TakeTwo clearly does not care about their players' enjoyment of their game so long as they are joining online and buying shark cards. In the years following the game's release. Rockstar has never released a major content update for the single player portion of the game like they have numerous times each year for multiplayer. Grand Theft Auto V is only worthwhile as a single player experience and without mods this value decreases greatly. Unless TakeTwo withdraws their order to the creators of OpenIV GTAV does not deserve your money.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,"Welp I've been pushed over the edge into writing this review in lieu of recent events which can be read in any other review posted recently. This review will cover actual issues the game has instead of chewing out take2 (though they do deserve to be chewed out but at this point I feel anything I'd say has already been said).I will begin by saying this game was entertaining for a short while. It has nice graphics pretty fluid gameplay and they like to keep online updated which they've done for free instead of having you pay for dlc so I commend them for doing that. Unfortunately that's all the praise I have for this game.I will begin ripping this thing apart with single player mode. Unlike other GTA games I've played (mostly Vice City and San Andreas which are arguably the best 2 in the series) the game is a cakewalk. When I play GTA I want to be challenged to the point of rage quitting then coming back to it a short while later (anyone remember Demolition Man from VC? or what about the damn RC plane mission in SA?). Not to mention this game feels smaller than SA with only 1 city and the countryside. The story is decent some of the characters are great but all of that is overshadowed by how easily one breezes through the story. This isn't a GTA game it's got the look and some of the humor of a GTA game but it lacks the soul crushingly difficult mission(s) that gives each of the other GTA's I've played their unique charm.Now on to the real killer for me online mode. Online mode is a great concept but horribly executed. It's nice to be able to play with others and progress from having your first vehicle you stole to having a few houses a business multiple full garages full of customized cars etc. It would also be nice if that were possible in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately it's not. If you're like me and refuse to do any microtransactions so you end up grinding the resourses online takes eons. They price things so exorbitantly high that most players just end up buying the shark cards making it one of the cardinal sins of gaming pay to win. Online at this point has become just a money grab. Additionally online mode is riddled with players who bend the rules. Some of these people are nice but most I've come across are just trolls. Then there's the seemingly endless supply of rule abiding trolls. Those who don't circumvent the rules with additional tools but rather use their equipment to wreak havoc on honest players. I understand that some of this is fine fun even but when it's every server then it makes it unbearable. Also you can forget about acomplishing anything in your own private server the freeroam events are disabled thus forcing you to play in a troll riddled hellhole of a place just trying to accomplish anything to make some decent cash so you don't have to spend real money on those damn shark cards. As far as running the MC or CEO stuff most people don't want to bother with it unless they get the highest cut so everyone runs their own stuff rather than working together. So many of the practices with online mode are very anti cooperative play which is in direct contrast to the real world of crime where you have people working together to achieve things. So even as a crime simulator this game fails.Now to break my own rule I gave myself at the beginning of this... talking about the Take 2 legal action against a certain modding tool.Mods are what made single player mode bearable. You could make it difficult quirky grimey and downright weird. But that's the beauty of mods in games. Companies like Take 2 think of mods as ways to break rules and ruin their games but that's not what modding real modding is. Modding for all intents and purposes is a way for people to enjoy the product that the company has released long past its vanilla playability allows. Furthermore it's a form of creative expression allowing people to view the game as a wonderfully built canvas to unleash their creative desires and share with others. Modding brings me back to the good 'ol days of gaming before all the extreme budgets corporate buyouts playing it safe with releases (which this game is... dumbed down to appeal to the widest audience). All gaming is nowadays seems like it's about making the most money rather than providing quality entertainment. I remember a time when games used to be innovative groundbreaking even people used to push the limits take risks succeed and fail. But that was the beauty of it. If a game failed it was because it was a bad game not because they didn't spend enough on marketing (in the beginning anyway... this did eventually become the reason many games do fail). Modding allows people to do what those crazy fools did back in the day push the limits cause paradigm shifts and create quality entertainment. Many of the games which have brought massive loads of cash in for some of these companies began as mods for other games so it's sickening to see companies doing things like Take2 has done to the modding community. Basically what they're saying is ""Your ideas are trash allow us to give you what we say you want"" rather than being a decent company and providing us with what we actually want. We get the same 15 games every year because it reaches the widest audience mods are there to make the more nuanced alterations that fit smaller segments within the market allowing us to turn the game into what we want. Some may claim that it sullies the original work my response to them is to wake up and realize that it's just a money game now when it comes to the big companies.Back on topic a bit Take2's legal action against a certain modding tool is appalling. They claim it's to prevent modders online which would be fine since it's their servers people may have conflicting mods there's no way to manage them all among other issues. However this particular tool doesn't allow for any sort of online modding (not to mention the modders who are online are rarely punished anyway). So why is it they claim it's to prevent online modding when clearly it's not? The answer is simple long ago they said that they'll allow modding in offline mode it's your game so you should be able to turn it into something you enjoy playing. They say it's to prevent online modding so they don't have to go back on their original promise though actions speak louder than words and it's clear they have indeed gone back on their word. Why do they want to eliminate offline modding? Well that's a simple question to answer. As stated earlier mods allow players to enjoy games long past their original playability value. In the case of GTA5 once you beat the story and quests there's nothing left to do so naturally you head online. Mods allowed peole to continue to play offline long after the story ended which was no good for Take2. Once you remove the Mods the playability factor is gone thus forcing people to play online. Once online they realize the exorbitant prices for most things and either quit playing the game altogether attempt to grind it out or in the case of most people buy the shark cards.This kind of anti consumer behavior cannot stand. Not to mention the game isn't even that spectacular and is riddled with issues that they don't appear to care enough about to fix. So no I do not recommend this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,1,2,817,False,Not Recommended,"Let me split this review into 3 sections. One for the Online mode One for the Single player and one for the Modded RP side of things.Online At first I loved Online and I love Rockstar but they have just riddled this game with micro transactions and their ""Shark Cards"". Its pretty much just a huge circle that goes as follows They announce a new DLC that has the new fastest car that everyone wants and adds some kind of gimmicky vehicle that you'll enjoy for 20 minutes then either sell it or let it collect dust in the garage. Next the brand new fastest car costs a fortune and you can either spend a week to try to get enough money to purchase it or to buy a ""Shark Card"" to instantly get it with your real life hard earned cash. Then in a few days or maybe even a week you will get burnt out until they announce another new DLC which is exactly the same as the last one but with a new skin on it. With the brand new fastest car and that new gimmicky vehicle that they have to add. + its riddled with hackers and cheaters.Singleplayer The singleplayer storyline is FENOMINAL. I can't even describe how great it is when a young poor criminal (Franklin) meets up with an old ex criminal under witness protection (Micheal) who tries to help the young poor criminal get some ill gotten cash which then the old ex criminals partner who is some twisted redneck (Trevor) figures out where he lives to get revenge.Im bad at explaining things but its just great and it is a somewhat lengthy story aswell which is always a plus.Modded RP The modded RP scene is still in development but so far its great and its all fun. It already has a lot of the functunality of SA MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and if not more. It seems very promising and I can't wait to see what it leads to.Overall You could buy this game for the Single player and/or the modded RP. but Rockstar just can't stop milking their game of micro transactions and it also doesnt help that the publisher of this game Take Two tried to take away pretty much the whole modding scene but thanks to the community that didn't happen.5.5/10",Grand Theft Auto V

Now couple that with the FACT that higher levels have access to better armor AND as you level up your health permanently increases. How the is that a feature? I have shot these minigun douches in the head because some of them suck but they survived it because they are max level and have more base health than me.This ing game...OH OH OH just remembered something real good that Rockstar pulled. The past TWO times before this last event where you ""buy shark cards and get x amount of money back"" they never gave people money. The last two times before now you buya shark card and 2x the money as in you buy a 3mil card you get another 3mil free. I would say a large majority never got that money. Now this last time of course it was only 30% of what you paid for so of course they gave that out. ing cheapskates. NEWEST EDIT So apparently all the money they scammed off people and earned isn't enough. So they shut down OpenIV which has nothing to do with their multiplayer so they can force all the users to the MP. Maybe if they'd release singleplayer DLC and make the endgame not suck they'd get the money they want. I'd literally pay if they implemented lspdfr into the game. But they don't do cool stuff like that so we mod it in. Only we can't now.",Grand Theft Auto V

If this happens when you were trying to reach an objective no worries you'll (very helpfully) respawn 100 000 years away from your waypoint and build character and patience by being killed (again) on your way there and spawning across the map (again).Despite this the game is still loads of fun. Or I would assume it is since people are still playing it. I wouldn't know because after playing online for about 1.5 hours I logged out. And about two hours after that Rockstar sent me an email telling me I was banned for a month.

GTA Online.GTA Online never mixed well with me because I'm no exactly an MMO player and it's built very much like an MMO and there's so much promise and potential with it. New content is released constantly but making money in game to actually have fun is tiring espicially if modders make it impossible to do. Some modders are great as they just spawn really dumb stuff and give you lot's of money but most just kill the players with commands and it's really ing annoying.

Or just spend 250 and have enough in game money to buy it all. Even when you opt to play the heists the community (if you could bring yourself to call it that) only wants to play the final . For you to play your own heist there is an hour ""cool down"" in which you cannot start a new heist but if you only search to join a heist final this does not apply to you. the payouts are tiny compared to the cost of a dlc car to buy 1 dlc super car you can expect to have to play the hardest heist 3 4 times depending on your cut.I would recommend the single player but compared to a newer game it is not worth the asking price alone. so if you care enough about gta's drive here shoot this gameplay I'd wait for a half price sale because the story or fun vehicles/ weapons are not up to the standard of gta San Andreas a game that was a DECADE old on the initial release of this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Probably spent more than a quarter of my time in this game TRYING to get together with friends but having to deal with randos disconnecting and ing up the entire lobby by sending you back into the 'freeroam' (because THAT was a brilliant decision by their designers!) the long loading times the clunky interface the complete lack of a party system which means that you and your friends are constantly being seperated ect ect.H) Very obvious copy+paste run back and forth point A to B to C then back to A grinding 'missions ' only to then wait for ing hours to TRY to sell it (which ANYONE can it up with a single rocket because the game encourages people to be complete and absolute cancerous to barely make a bit of money to try to get the money back for buying the requirements to get these missions to turn hours of time and grinding after grinding into some notion of profit for an OP vehicleI) Did I mention how unfriendly the game is in general? It's ing terrible. So many terrible design decisions.J) Cancerous community actively encouraged by the gameK) Rampant and blatent cheatingL) There has been dozens of dozens of reports recently of inocent players having money taken away from their account because of t automated systems which detected it as 'modded moeny' and having support tickets that's just 'You modded we took it away you're our . Ticket closed.'M) (Continuation of L) For example there's a challenge in GTA Online to do each heist in order without dying. As you may imagine it is a VERY difficult challange and nets you 10million of their in game currency as a reward. People who have completed this challange recently have had that money taken away because the game detected it as cheated money.N) Oh you know how I said that the community is cancerous? Look at how many of the positive reviews lists 'It's fun interfering with the gameplay of other players in a way which in other games would be a bannable offence' as a pro of the game.O) The game is one which constantly encourages you to play with friends but then only has activities which benefits one player while screwing the rest of them out of their time and effort. While said one player a fair monitary amount for their time their friends who helped them gain it get nothing but a penny.P) The entirety of the 'shark cards' which is the way R* monitizes the game isn't worth even half of the price it gives. As the game has more dlc added the prices of the new content goes up creating massive inflation which the cards haven't been adjusted to since... 2013. $100 is not worth 8 million in GTA$. 100$ is more like 25 million GTA$ worth.Oh and that's just the start of it.

2017-06-15,0,0,382,False,Not Recommended,It's a fun game however there are a few things I will note.They are trying to forcefully get rid of modding of the single player which there is no valid reason for since A) the game is the 4th most sold game EVER and B) it cuts a bunch of playtime from the single player that can extend how much time people get out of the game and how much they actually get from spending their money on a full price AAA release. As such I will not be recommending this game to anyone wanting to buy it on the principle that I disagree heavily with the practices of take two/rockstar this is since they are moving it more towards wiping out single player and making the multiplayer IAP (in app purchase) riddled and moneywhorish,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,In September 2013 Rockstar released GTA V. It was impressive in some ways disappointing in others. The open world was satisfyingly detailed and the main characters were entertaining to spend time with. On the other hand we were never given much incentive to explore the world the structure was all a bit sloppy (the flying school for example is never brought to your attention unlike in San Andreas) the main story never really went anywhere and there are only two talk radio stations (the fewest in any GTA I can remember). None of the characters learned anything or changed in any way. On the whole worth 30 but it never could hope to reach the heights of the Ballad of Gay Tony. All a bit slapdash and carried the air of a product with a few too many people working on it and which consequently lost its focus.The PC release added some novelties and it's a good port but nothing fundamental has changed. I've played a lot more BoGT than GTA V on any platform.All in all GTA V was a solid effort and great grounds for future expansions. Unfortunately we're never going to get those expansions. Two or even three single player DLCs were planned which would have fitted into the game beautifully and given us a reason to go back. Alien invasions and zombies check out the Mount Chillad mystery reddit for details. Unfortunately Take Two cancelled these in order to focus on the microtransaction cash cow that is GTA Online.Plenty of other reviews detail the problems with GTA Online. I played it for a while with friends when it was first available on the 360. We rapidly lost interest though as there wasn't really anything to do that other more focused games couldn't do better. And that was before T2 started focusing all their efforts on more microtransactions in lieu of doing anything about the omnipresent cheaters and hackers.So no single player DLC to give after sales support and multiplayer isn't worth a damn. So why would you buy the PC version? Mods was the obvious answer. However T2 have now decided to oppose modding. That thing which the fans were doing better than them adding value to the GTA V product. By shutting down OpenIV T2 have made it much harder to get the majority of mods running and they won't stop here. They don't want you to have fun with mad stuff that the community makes up. They want to engage you in constant psychological warfare in order to drain your wallet with microtransactions. Apparently being the fourth or fifth bestselling videogame OF ALL TIME not including the HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS they make from microtransactions ever year simply isn't enough money.I feel bad for the devs at Rockstar. Once upon a time they made videogames new story campaigns worlds and characters for us to explore. All creatively fulfilling work. Now they're expected to feed the microtransaction machine by adding the occasional new gun and new vehicle. I understand that Rockstar's already started to lose staff and I wouldn't be surprised if some of them were simply bored out of their skulls making this crap and decided to go and do more interesting work. And when T2 finally get bored of making all the money in the world and want a new GTA game...well the talent base passion and experience has already started to leave.Adequate but flawed singleplayer which Take 2 don't want anyone improving not even for free with mods. Worthless multiplayer. Don't buy or for heaven's sake don't buy it new or at full price.,Grand Theft Auto V

WRONG! Strauss Zelnick the man in charge of those idoits continues to show his active distain for the gaming community. Not only commenting on how he feels he is ""undermonitizing"" GTA Online now his company has the gall to punch the entire PC community in the face by going after mods. OpenIV was issued a cease and desist shutting the beloved service down for a period.To be fair to the game itself the singleplayer is amazing and the gameplay itself enjoyable. Like other GTA games the amount of fun from running around in the sandbox was enough in my opinion to warrent the purchasse. Unfortunately the online portion of the game is where it suffers. The overall community is a cluster of the worst people you can find playing online games. This is made even worse by the newer updates that have encouraged negative behavior by rewarding players who ruin others fun. The online was never meant to serve the players that much is clear and was clear early on. On the long list of reasons I would say to avoid this game going after singleplayer mods takes the cake. Zelnick is a greedy little man who has more in common with a bank vault than a human being. For this reason I can no longer justify purchasing anything from Rockstar due to the actions of the publisher that contuines to show EA and Ubisoft are saints when compared to publishers that are actually evil.Even updating to refect having OpenIV back up I still cannot recommend due to the actions of Take Two.

Definately not. Rockstar is moving on risky ground here and we should do what we can to make them realize their stupidity and force them back onto the right track.Also the mod was banned on false grounds. The statement says it allowed players to mod the online experience while the mod never supported online features and actively BLOCKS you from entering online mode if the mod is installed.

Ultimately the world is very boring and there's little to do besides crappy minigames. Good luck having fun when your character has almost no health and cops will chase you with little provacation(fixed by mods though).",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-19,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,Offline/Story Mode has always been immersive and exiciting but as GTA Online has started to come towards the end of its life cycle it seems mostly abandoned by Rockstar in terms of maintaining and upholding the rules. Mistreating innocent players by banning them due to accusations of hacking whilst letting the real hackers roam free allowing players to basically pay to win in terms of getting the best gear and cars and with mission payouts being basically pennies. The map has become severely overcrowded and even trying to connect to a server on a good connection can be a half hour long struggle. I'd recommend this game but due to the cracks that've opened up in GTA Online it mostly outweighs the positives of offline mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-28,0,0,919,False,Recommended,This game has a lot to bring to gamers so I'm going to make this in depth review of Grand Theft Auto V so just sit back and see if it will relate to you.Game modesGrand Theft Auto has a lot to bring with modes as they have team deathmatch races but every so often in updates they will add a new mode with a new map which helps this game out in the online department talk about about Online. The online multiplayer for this game is quite fun as you can go along robbing stores racing about in your brand new sports car or you can do whatever you can imagine. The main game mode that I would recommend is heists as they have a lot of story to them but the main reason people play them is probably the money as it goves you thousands of dollars to spend.Online free roamThe free roam aspect is good you have many options on what vehicle you want to use or what type of home you want to have. The free roam experience is quite nice the game is very pretty and has many sight like the hills and a lot of things.In free roam the best thing to do is drive your luxury sports car and gloat to all your friends how you spent all your time farming money to buy a million dollar sports car. StoryThe story is fantastic as it has a lot of drama and action the first levels are you playing as Franklin driving around and escaping people. The story introduces 3 new characters Michael Franklin and Trevor which incorporates a lot of characters and they each have different personalities.Trevor absolute psychoMichael Miserable bastardFranklin Lives in the hood smokes weed. IdolOverallThis game is amazing apart from a few gripes with how you need quite good hardware to run it along with some bugs and stuff I think anyone could enjoy this game unless they play on a toaster.,Grand Theft Auto V

Modding is the lifeblood of gaming it shows people have legitimate interest in a game and in making it better removing mods just tells the player that their contributions to the community aren't wanted and that the game despite some big flaws is perfect as is.Take the STALKER series for example. If those games had zero mod support they would likely have died long ago due to rampant technical issues/bugs alone but today they are rising cult classics with hundreds of mods that can completely change the game. These are diamonds in the rough. GTA V is arguably a very well cut gem by comparison but nothing is perfect and everyone has their own vision of how to add something that would complete an experience for them. Denying that expression is wrong.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can't do anything in this game without paying and everything is extremely overpriced. It is impossible to get in game money without buying Shark Cards. This game is pay to win and pay to enjoy.The hackers in online mode are out of control. Rockstar can't even set up a proper anti cheat system. I will admit that I had a mod menu but only to give myself money because I wasn't going to let Rockstar scam me. I didn't abuse my mods but everyone else abuses theirs. They seriously need to be dealt with.Singleplayer is probably the only decent part about this game but it gets old after a while. You could mod it to get more fun out of it unless they ban singleplayer mods again. In the end this game is garbage. Not worth the money and trouble.

They actively want to push you onto the boring MP so that they can force more microtransactions and heists down your throat and pull your wallet out of your esophagus. For the longest time Take Two has been anti consumer. From actively preventing mods to overpricing games (and extra so for Australia!) to withholding key features that make a game whole and complete to then sell you back at $40 a pop (looking at you Civilization...). Even if they withdraw this Cease and desist I will NEVER buy another 2K game so long as I live.And to Take Two Maybe you should take a second look at yourselves.Edit on July 8th It came to my attention that they lifted the Cease + Desist on OpenIV due to community outcry.

Great story gameplay and graphics. Hell I played the Story over 6 times. Totally recommend 110%Grand Theft Auto Online however is a different story. Back in 2013 it was just a better online mode that was in every way better than Grand Theft Auto IV's. Granted it was buggy but it worked...we got the Beach Bum pack and it was heading in the right direction. All the content was free and it was a test dlc as you will. Future DLC didnt follow this such as the later Business update but the prices were fair. Many DLC's later they discovered SHARK cards....these is when they become greedy. Look I get having free content post launch requires some form of Microtransaction but this is just stright up ridiculous. The inflation is so insane online (i.e. An old 2 piece suit would cost $2000 as a newly added one would cost $100k). They add ways to make ""money"" but its practically nothing and they add BS cooldowns and ways to make it more difficult and tedious. Rockstar and Take Two have just gotten so greedy almost as Greedy as PUBG. Now with this said that dosen't mean you cant have fun with the game.

2017-06-15,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V will always have a special place in my heart. GTA V is one of the most detailed comprehensive games that I have ever played one that still puts current AAA games to shame. The single player is really fun and well done and the world's detail is incredible. Still worth the money imo. GTA Online is also very fun and entertaining but it's severely flawed get ready to be banned for no reason too. However due to a horrible support team that refuses to lift bans that are often given to players by mistake and their strong anti mod stance I'm gonna have to give this a thumbs down. The game is great but the company and customer support is absolute garbage.*EDIT*After intense community backlash Rockstar has announced a new stance on modding and while it is still pretty harsh it is a step in the right direction.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have over 1000 hours on this game but the truth is I don't play online anymore and whenever I do now it's just boring the game is dull and I love GTA! I recently downloaded FiveM a mod for GTA V you know the one that made you're game popular again. I've been on FiveM for days straight and I haven't played GTA online like that in over a year! Without mods your game is gonna die and you clearly can't see that through your money driven eyes. I will always support this game but you just messed up this time!

I tried to get stuff from the new dlc it's like a secondary job for virtual money it's absurd. The content has inflated from 10million ingame money to 40 45million per dlc and this isnt because there is more content but that it has a higher cost.Tl drtoo time consuming online economy for low reward or pay your self sick for little.Also I recommend not bying rockstar games anymore before they drop this practice its ruining gaming.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,737,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT Take Two has revoked its modding ban via taking down OpenIV. Mods are allowed in single player again. However this review and its recommendation will remain as is as a reminder that these companies are capable of screwing over their fan base at a moments notice and they do not learn from their mistakes well. They deserve no reprieve.The game had a decent launch I guess. Didnt get it immediately. Played the game a lot with friends during the good ol days.Multiplayer PvP balance is broken. Always has and always will be and thats not me being butthurt thats just the rule of the game. Weapon Obsolescence is a real thing in this game. Like that shiny AR 15? Just use a minigun. Oh you like the minigun? Okay now learn to aim and just use the Anti material Rifle. It would seem that power weapons which put all the damage into a single shot are king. Theres no point to any automatic or pistol so long as you have money and a good aim. Why even buy an automatic at all?Dont get me wrong im not advocating for the nerfing or removal of these weapons being unfair is intrinsic to battle and war on every level in general. I just want my rifles to be just as relevant as those power weapons so i have a reason to use them in pitched combat.Single player is nice. Though it is now under attack if not destroyed outright for anyone wanting to play after the story.I of course speak of the War on Modders and mods in general.R*'s apparent over zealous hate of modding and mods in general came to my attention when some of my friends found that R* literally spent time hardcoding a wall so custom mostly non gameplay altering textures couldnt be used instead of fixing actual issues like making a better counter to hydra griefing or long load times. While I didnt use any cosmetic texture mods some of my friends did. So I lost the ability to play with them. A move I find unnecessary especially with its prejudice blanket blocking of non gameplay altering textures.Then Single Player was attacked.GTA in the past has been known to have extremely fun funny and stupid mods for its single player that some have achieved lengendary status.I write this on the eve of Take Two's (R*s publisher) destruction of a tool called OpenIV which to put simply is a platform augment on which to add and use mods. Single player modding is effectively dead. Keep in mind R* DOESNT UPDATE SINGLE PLAYER so anyone turned off to the idea of multiplayer miss out on a lot of content.TL DRThe game is not as fun as it used to be despite the added content.The devs and publisher hate you and your creativity because they want to control everything to do with the games content.This game has no modding.You either play under their ever increasing number of authoritarian rules or not at all.Not as ""Open"" as we thought....",Grand Theft Auto V

Runs really well and looks even better than previous gen although I have heard alot of bad things about the online on PC being filled with hackers or rockstar or whatever puling some shoddy business with GTA V being on sale that one time.

2017-09-12,0,0,1176,False,Not Recommended,TL DRThe single player bit is amazing but too short. The multi player is the worst experience I've had in an AAA title. There's no cheat protection and you spend more time on loading screens than anything else. Hackers all over.8/10 SP1/10 MPHow the hell are there still so many cheaters after two years? How? I quit playing because of this in the first place. Just a couple of weeks after it was released. I had waited for years for this game.The new pvp mode is horrible. Doing the same over and over is dull.I might enjoy it if it wasn't for the weapons and overpowered vehicles so at least you can depend on yourself. Ripping off the battle royale concept could work great but it is just very poorly executed and got old after two runs. Making it vehicle and team based was probably interesting in the office but really PUBG or battle royale are actually well thought out and balanced.Very cheap.In 3 days of extensive playing two years after it was new this sums up my experience 1. Impossible to progress my heist missions as host. Every attempt one player has just disappeared. Not even once have I been able to follow someone else leading and complete an entire setup with heist with same crew members either. It sucks balls to do an entire line of setup for then to have the guy hosting it just disappear forever as the heist is about to start.It takes less time making money by just repeating the same five missions over and over and over and over and over and over and over.. and over. Each time just long enough for them to give the maximum payout. At least it is predictable.2. Hacker plague is just as bad as it was two years ago. Have been blown up from across the map several times. Have barely survived being blown up along with most players on a server by leaving just as mass death spam occurs. Had my vehicle blown up and had to pay for it myself. Emptied several magazines of heavy sniper into target head without doing any damage for the guy to then get on a bike he summoned from nowhere and then fly across the map on it. Definite killshots Took down a gang of red players except one of them who was invulnerable on his sailboat grabbed an armed heli from a base and went after them killed them again except the main guy who aparently could pilot sailboats at sea and fire homing missiles at the same time. killed by player outside line of sight and fire several times respawning and instantly dying to them with the message you were bombed by person xxxx. Had all the vehicles in my garage replaced by those huge dump trucks which then instantly explode.3. The added content since i last played adds very little to make the daily grind more interesting. Just more pipe dreams.In short this is the most broken multi player experience i've ever played.I wish they would add 100s more missions. I'd pay for a single player dlc that adds more single player missions. Or more heists type stuff. The derpy races and death match stuff bores me to death.If I had know any of this before buyig the game I would have kept my money. I feel ripped off even though the too short single player experience was really damn good.I won't buy anything from these guys again. I feel sorry for the hardworking artists who created this beautiful world and everything in it. Such a waste for this pay to win moneygrab.This game is just one giant waste of time and the business model behind it is pure cancer.The only thing that is fun after a while is slaughtering as many players as possible on the world map until you die enough times that it gets old which for sure doesn't aid the already extremely toxic atmosphere in the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

We must show them as well as all game developers that we as a community will not stand for these bully tactics to attempt to force us into their online world in hopes to make more revenue. The modding of single player games is why Skyrim is STILL one of the most popular games on steam after years and why GTAV has been such a monster hit. It definitely isn't the horrible online experience. Until Rockstar grows a pair and kicks take two to the curb and abolishes these shady tactics I will not be purchasing any of their upcoming titles.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,149,False,Recommended,Runs very smoothly for a first day release. Unlike gta 4 when it came out. Like like Max Payne 3 Rockstars released this one optimized even though i had my doubts due to the much larger sandbox nature of the game. AS a sort of FWI the waits were partially due to rockstar being payed off by microsoft and sony to keep the game exclusive to consoles.for a peroid of time. Can run all on very high/ultra settings on my rig. ( i7 4790k 8gb ram amd 280x) 65 85 fps. Dont know how much it compares to current gen consoles (still visually better i would guess) but This definately looks generations better from the 360 version i bought back in 2013.Gta has some neat new features like Editor for recording your most epic moments and a First person mode as a bonus.Story modes great and of course theres lots of fun to have in Gta online! heists is something i had been looking forward too.Preordering the game plus delays gave additonal gta online cash plus transferring my existing caharcter from xbox pc was a quick and easy process so its great i dont have to start from scratch with the Pc version.For players who havent yet played console version of gta Gta 5 will be a fantastic experience and i would think more enjoyable. in short there are guns cars airplanes vehicles of all sorts loads of explosions epic chases epic heists. (Paydays gonna be collecting dust for a bit) A great storyline with some comedic parts for comic relief/ ironical situations 3 characters in single player. Online mode and plenty of action. Whats not to like about the game?,Grand Theft Auto V

This was 100% legitimately earned income that Rockstar provided a way to earn and they come in like ""I see you spent loads of time playing our game and really like it....well you for earning money instead of buying shark cards."" This is not the only occurance. Before Gunrunning came out I grinded around 20 million dollars with the CEO special vehicle cargo and special cargo missions and day 1 of Gunrunning they removed all but 20 000.You'd think it would be a small mix up and the provision of proof to Rockstar Support would solve the issue.Nope.After submiting a support ticket to Rockstar I was given the robot generated blanket response that they use for people asking for their money back real or not.

You have a huge amazing world to explore cool missions to do...The graphics are great the voiceacting and soundeffects are great.The characters as always are kinda s but fun to watch x)Singleplayer is fine. I am not going to say anything more than that. GTA V Singleplayer is clearly a thumbs up.But GTA Online.. Oh yes.. thats a whole different story.Its a love hatred. And lately more of a hatred than a love.I'll just say what annoys me first NEGATIVE Hackers destroying the experience massively.. FAR TOO MANY HACKERS!Youll get blown up infinitly get a teleported to your ear or get your weapons deleted.It happens ALL THE TIME and is really frustrating. Rockstargames are not doing anything helpful about this. You will have to expect that everyone is an . Youll mostly get shot on sight shouted at and called names. The community sucks ""digg"" big time. 90% of people are pure ""as s holes"". They hinder you on your mission the annoy you in chat or by trying to shoot you all the time even if the cant hit Mulitplayer Content is ONLY for Multiplayer. All the amazing new cars planes and armored vehicles are unavailable in Singleplayer. Its basically the same it was at release untouched and unpatched which is kinda sad. Making Money is really hard and takes a lot of time while everything costs far too much. take a simple T Shirt for example.. that can cost you a couple thousand dollars... I mean wtf? They constantly add new gamemodes to the game which at least in my oppinion about 90% ofthem are useless poorly made and boring. And they just keep coming. It divides the playerbase in so many small groups. matchmaking is horrible. Finding a crew for a heist can take you hours and when you have finally found a crew playing with random people is almost impossible. Theyll kill themselves all the time disconnect for no reason up mission goals and insult you. Loadingscreens. I play a lot of games some pretty demanding ones for my computer. But not a single one comes close to GTA V when it comes to loading screens. Changing a online session 5 10 Minutes. You get thrown into random sessions a lot so you always have to join back to your friends which means another loadingscreen. And if the lobby is full it will load first then tell you its full and sent you back to another loading screen. Its horrible its a waste of time its pointless. At least check the playercount first then start loading.POSITIVE You have a huge amount of vehicles and character costumization options. IF YOU HAVE A CREW heists can be very rewarding and even fun to play. You basically have a huge open world to have fun in with your friends.Those are my quick thoughts on GTA V while my loading screen was stuck for 15 minutes..Oh man... lets get back to it I",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-16,0,0,1476,False,Not Recommended,"Single player is a fairly good game overall and I had a lot of fun with it. It wasn't until I made the mistake of trying to get a multiplayer game going that I experienced the true failure of Rockstar in regards to this game. It is often times one of the worst multiplayer experiences I've had in a recent game and if I worked for Rockstar I would be ashamed. First the multiplayer servers are massively bugged. You receive ""Notifications"" about upcoming jobs only by the time the notification comes through for you often times the job is already full. The game is designed so poorly that when this happens you can't simply go back to what you were doing instead you are kicked from your current session and have to try and rejoin a new one. If you were in a car or plane across the map suddenly you are reset. Much of time (almost all of the time lately) when you fail to join a mission you also fail to join any kind of multiplayer session either. The game tries for a couple of minutes and then times out then ""helpfully"" kicks you back to single player so you can do something there. Except when you haven't played single player for 6 months and don't have the slighest fracking desire to go back and do so now. It'll spend a few minutes loading your game so it knows every little side quest and things you did in your last save game. Then when you get into this single player game you didn't want and have no way to avoid there's another minute or two of some inane dialog between the protagonists and their little piece of crap family again unskippable listening to the father give the little witch of a daughter money and her telling him to frak off for it. Then when you can finally get into a menu to try going into an online session again it tries for a couple of minutes before failing and kicking you back to a single player session you didn't want... eventually... where you listen to the piece of dirt son who drugged his father stole his car then tried to frame him for a murder talk about wanting to be a better son. Again unskippable. You will oftend spend 20 minutes just trying to get into an online session. Once there they are filled with people who have modded the game but Rockstar in their sheer incompetence have failed to stop modded clients from playing online. The result is people who are completely invulnerable to any kind of fire will spawn inside your apartment (where no one is supposed to be able to go unless you invite them) then start spawning space ships and other things inside of the apartment just to screw with you. On the off chance you're brave enough to go outside they will push a button detonate clusters of C4 around everyone logged into the server and kill dozens of people at once. Even better they can associate this behavior with someone elses name so all of a sudden people are filing in game ""Complaints"" on the wrong person. The client modder triggers behavior that gets 20 people to file ban request/complaints ... on the wrong person. Other times the moddder will go around the game spawning random amounts of money everywhere so what was supposed to ake a huge amount of work to obtain is suddenly obtainable by anyone who walks within range of the modder and gives him a verbal ****job. Update 9/28 The fun continues. I apparently enjoy pain so much that I continue to play online and there's a new twist to what the modders can do. Up until now when I find I'm in a modder session I've just joined a new one and dealt with the ensuing connection problems. However a modder today joined server and clicked a button and took every single player's weapons away. We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of in game weapons that disappeared at the drop of a hat. I am filing a support ticket to try and get Rockstar to give them back to me but so far as I can tell there's nothing to stop this from happening over and over and over again. Awful awful multiplayer experience until Rockstar manages to get their crap together and take care of the massive cheating / modding problems but the single player portion was pretty fun while it lasted. If you're willing to ignore multiplayer you'll probably have a lot of fun.",Grand Theft Auto V

I had decided to set myself goal of earning enough money through CEO Jobs and Biker Work to buy a Super Yacht. After a few days of grinding I logged on and found I had been banned. I checked my email and found an agressively vague non specific email telling me I had violated Rockstars EULA and I had been banned from GTAOnline for one month.At first I was fairly okay with this it was one month and sometimes these things happen. Then I found out that I had my character stats profile money and assets wiped out. So I left a ticket on Rockstar social club querying this and attemping to appeal the ban and got back a generic reply that I had violated the EULA and the ban is final. I have spent the last month sending in tickets asking different questions trying to at the very least pinpoint what my violation of the terms of service was. I have yet to recieve anything except identical replies all giving me the exact same vague information that I had violated the EULA and had been banned and that all bans were final. I tried calling up Rockstar technical support (which I only found the phone number for my country on Reddit thanks to who ever posted that) and the person on the phone read me the EXACT same reply I got by email and then proceeded to hang up. At the very least Rockstar has some horrible customer service. At worst they are deliberately obstructing and willfully ignoring the compaints of paying customers. No automated ban system is flawless and prior to this I would have agreed that people claiming false bans are just whining cheaters. But now I believe that there is at least a minority of banned players who have been banned for no valid reason have had hours upon hours of gameplay wiped and have no recourse to appeal the bans. There are victory stories from before Rockstar updated their ban policy mid 2016 when people had been able to appeal the bans due to false positives and this at least shows that the automated ban system is flawed. Let me be clear I couldn't even find out what I did to earn the ban let alone be given the chance to refute it.Overall So if you want this game for singleplayer go for it. It's good. Story isn't as tight as GTAIV but the gameplay has improved greatly. But if you want to buy GTAV for Online only think twice because you may end up having hundreds of invested hours wiped out for no apparent reason and have no way to even appeal or find out why.Edit Some links.

2018-02-28,0,0,295,False,Recommended,"(TL DR) Generally speaking Grand Theft Auto V is a (kinda) nice game. For overall (PERSONAL) rating scroll down till the end of this thread.THE STORY MODE The story mode is fine and maybe funny...For the first 2 hours at most that is. It's a non realistic scenario that I would understand if it was a different type of game but it's way too f'd up for me to be in the GTA franchise. Moreover Single Player is pretty boring by itself mostly because there's nothing different throughout the whole game. EVERY single mission from start to finish is practically the same. Steal cars escape from the police take the mission item to its destination MAYBE get paid just a little bit if not at all. Quick parenthesis for the ones who will buy/bought the game for SP only you won't get any (""Decent"") money until the very end where you'll have to do the last ""Big shot"" heist. Strangers and freaks...Meh. Not even worth mentioning. Fillers (supposedly to add to the gameplay) that just make the story mode even more boring personally speaking. Also one more drawback of SP is that cars apartments and businesses all cost the same if not more than what they do in Online. Money cannot be split between characters consecutively having to grind even more to purchase something. Overall story mode is not even good cliches everywhere stupid puns and gags that I would not have expected to become so irritating after a bit and comedy is tiring. Not rewarding at all till (as I stated above) the very end of the story and grinding becomes too mainstream after a while. Generally the only thing I found exciting in the whole Story Mode was the Rampage events with Trevor where you go full insanse and on a killing spree against gangs and hipsters that was fun.GTA ONLINE On the other side GTA Online is really fun with or without friends. Excluding those annoying players that have reached a really high position throughout the years that just roam around the map and kill other lower level and inexperienced players GTA Online even in free roam would be a really good huge part of the game that is really worth it. Character creation and customization in general (cars hair styles tattoos etc.) are really cool and I'd also like to add revolutionary when compared to previous releases that had minimal and more restricted customizations. First Pirson even though I do not like it is really cool if you wanna mess around with civilians and cops. Middle fingering everybody makes them freak out and start swearing you which in my opinion is a nice little feature that they added. Additionally Online has so many more activities than Single Player From robbing a store (which is included in the Story but of course is more enthralling in Online) to gang shootouts against other real life players to races (in water on the asphalt even in the air) to team deathmatches. There's also another little feature that I really like which is the ""Mental State"". Basically the more you commit crimes the more this Mental State bar rises which makes you wanted even amongst other individuals in the same session as you and if the wanted person is killed the killer is rewarded with RP and some cash. There are also some newly introduced characters in the Multiplayer that makes the game more fun and less mainstream. Ongoing events are also present all the time which guarantees you a quick buck and some RPs to rank up faster. Ranking up is also fast when doing activities. There are however cons in the Multiplayer as well. First and foremost lots and lots and lots of hackers and cheaters which Rockstar has not yet countered. In the discussions you'll see tons of people complaining about randomly getting cash and then getting banned or getting banned unjustly for no reason whatsoever. Fortunately I still haven't gotten anything regarding penalties not small not big ones either and with some luck maybe I'll never get one. Oh! One thing I forgot to mention is GTA V guarantees you 2 modes and 1 DLC even when purchasing the standard edition. These are Single Player and Multiplayer along with the Loading Simulator DLC. If you have enough patience then go ahead and buy this but if you're willing to play Online only and you don't have then you'll still have to have a lot of it. Honestly from the 145 hours I've got in this game 10 hours might be loading screens not even kidding. Sometimes after having waited roughly 7 10 minutes it puts you in an empty session so you'll be forced to search for another session unless you wanna mess around in free roam and don't want others to bother you but even though you'll be searching for another session it takes about 1 minute to enter the other one. Grinding becomes even harder in Mutliplayer as players many times leave (your) lobbies (/ y) and as a result you'll have to hamper ( Pause) your grinding for once more. In addition to that supercars bunkers stuff like that have huge requirements (in cash) in order to be purchased plus modding and customizing these takes some pretty big sums of cash too. Last but not least if you die and have to restart you'll have to see every cutscene from the last checkpoint AND if somebody leaves the lobby you'll have to go through (AGAIN) all of the lobby waiting and loading screens in order to do the activity from the beginning.To sum everything up Graphics Awesome! / 9/10Sounds and Sound Effects Really Good. / 8/10Gameplay Single Player Bad. / 3.5/10Gameplay Online Pretty Good. / 7.5 (Would've put 9/10 if it was not for the Loading Simulator)Characters Single Player Bad Annoying. / 3/10Characters Online More Than Good / 7.5/10Missions Single Player Awful Not Rewarding At All Not Fun Repetitive. / 2/10Missions Online Pretty Damn Good! / 8/10Weapons Excellent! / 10/10Mechanics Good. / 6/10Random Car Stuns DEFINETELY SUPER AWESOME!! / 69/10Single Player Story Really Poor Cliche. / 3/10Hope that my review helps all of you out there!Thanks for reading.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,Take Two just destroyed GTAV modding I loved the single player of GTAV. I thought the story was pretty good and the game itself was incredibly fun. Then I tried online. It sucks. It is a micro transaction and hacker laden hell hole. So I stuck with the single player and the modding scene that made that all great fun. Mods allow for unlimited potential in a game and can turn a good game into a great game.Then Take Two Interactive (the parent company of Rockstar) sent a cease and desist to OpenIV. OpenIV is a modding tool used by many major GTA mods and allowed modders to do things like add new vehicles.Well guess what Take Two. Go yourselves. Modding was the only reason I played after I finished the single player because the multiplayer is garbage and Take Two knows it. This is an action obviously meant to force players on to the multiplayer so we buy their ing microtransactions. Get ed 2K.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,1344,False,Not Recommended,I owned this game on PS3 PS4 and PC. Ive played this game since the first day it came out. One thing Ive always liked was the ability to Mod my PC singleplayer files. I could make awesome cars and do crazy interactive things. I believe that Modding is a gamers right. However StageTWO decided they want to over the only guys who have helped make modding big. All so they could squeeze some more cash out of this game. Really?Maybe if you made Content as good as the modders and made the Online more enjoyable and more fair. People would actually get on it to buy your stupid shark cards.Honestly Great Game.

2017-06-18,0,0,144,False,Not Recommended,The latest update and Take Two's anti modding stance are what drove me to write this review.After 4 5 how ever many post launch updates have come out adding NOTHING to the single player side of the game having to download another 40+ GB update which I will never use (single player only) was just to much. Hvaing to download a bunch of assets which could easily be added so they can be used in the single player mode but they dont is just un acceptable. It's cool to keep adding to the online side but dont limit it to online only for people who aren't interested in being harrased by children while they play.Then the stance on modding and the attack on OPEN IV. Seriously you go after the group that is helping people actually ADD content to the single player experience (which should be your job) because you believe that this will stop people from cheating in the online mode? Get real. All you've done is upset a bunch of customers that enjoy messing around in the sandbox you create. Well I'm done I've un installed GTAV and wont be reinstalling and though I was hoping for Red Dead 2 to come to PC I cant help but feel the single player side would suffer due to Take Twos choices short and long term.If I do buy anything from take two again It will be at the lowest possible price if I buy it at all.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,369,False,Not Recommended,I've owned this game since it came out for the xbox 360 and purchased it again for the PC at full price. It was an incredible game back then and still is! But it has been 2 years now since it came out for PC and Take Two's escalating greed has made online an awful experience. All the prices are ridulous... $3mil for a motorbike? You either have to grind for days or buy their shark cards which is the only reason why the online DLC is still coming. Take Two pulled the plug on the single player DLC just so the team could focus on ensuring a consistent revenue stream in Shark Cards. I don't use mods but it's a massive part of the single player experience for most and that's what is keeping GTA5 alive. These shark cards are the reason people are resorting to hacking the online experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,I'm blown away by the decisions made by Take Two and Rockstar in relation to the modding community. Way to bite the hand that feeds. Ya mods are free community made content but it keeps the vast majority of us coming back for more when you finish the singleplayer game. OpenIV was never a multiplayer modding community nor did they support hackers online or the ability to use mods online. Mods are for those of us who enjoy finding new ways to enjoy a game we all love and that's been taken away for what I can only assume is greed. If this isn't fixed I will no longer support either company in any way.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you have any love of the PC community do not give these people your money.When you see thousands of your dedicated playerbase ( a lot of these negative reviews are from people with hundreds or thousands of hours in the game) leaving in droves that is a call to action to communicate but all rockstar has said to the community is "" wasn't us"" they really need to figure their *hi* out.In addition there is a difference between modders and cheaters modders play singleplayer and keep to themselves cheaters actively attempt to ruin the gameplay of others in online I guarantee that shutting down Open IV will not result in a loss of cheaters in online.",Grand Theft Auto V

But the moment from first getting the game and opening it you know you just made a huge mistake today after a long absence from the game I decided to load into it too see how long it took to load into the game to see if it was still bad 12 minutes was the load into multiplayer and I personally find the single player garbage once you have played the story. + Amazing story+ Huge world variety+ Lots to do (but not replay) The world just doesn't feel as large as it should I don't know how to explain other than it just feels too small The Multiplayer load times are absolutely ridiculous 3rd party launcher (rockstar) Heists while looking to be a ton of fun have 0 replay value I would go as far as saying they feel like an annoying grind after one playthrough Hackers galore on multiplayer While customer support being garbage doesn't seem like a big deal to me myself when looking at reviews on game hear me out on why it's a big deal in GTA V You are bound to have problems in the game that you might want to contact customer support for that's just because the game is buggy and the support is garbage.

2016-11-24,0,0,120,False,Not Recommended,The single player of GTA V is certainly compelling full of entertaining interactions between the 3 main characters some amusing outfits you can force on said main characters memorable missions and plenty of money to be spent on fast cars and guns. However the online mode has many issues and I would warn everyone who is thinking about buying GTA just for online to think again. I've encountered many problems that have not been fixed over the years ranging from connectivity issues to hackers in lobbies to month long/permanent bans for just playing the game to even the dreaded blue screen of death. Throw in the fact that making money is a huge grind and 99% of the time you're just going to be blown up by someone hundreds of ranks higher than you who owns a tank meaning I can't recommend this game at full price. I would possibly recommend it at a sale price however that would only be for the single player if you only wish to play online then you'd still be taking a risk with that money.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-03,0,0,337,False,Not Recommended,Gta5 for me is one of the most enjoyable games out there.

People have been getting banned for no reason they've never used mods offline or online yet they get banned for using things such as fraps and Discord while nothing seems to be happening to actual Modders. Online is incredibly enjoyable but with this Broken ban system it's making me not even want to play online incase I get banned like so many other people for no reason and lose everything I've worked for. For now I'm leaving a negative review until this gets sorted (if it ever does). I wish I could give a separate review for online and offline because offine is incredible.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-03,0,0,34,False,Not Recommended,"Looks like I'm jumping on the ""I've been banned"" bandwagon. I was skeptical at first I figured a fair amount of people were being ""unfairly banned"" because they were actually cheating and being butthurt about it.But BOY OH BOY was I wrong.I haven't even been playing a week yet and I've been put on the ban list until March. No reason given no way to appeal. Just a massive middle finger. I guess I know how the majority of NPCs felt when I robbed them of something they paid for. On my last day I even got a ""good sport"" bonus which amuses me greatly.I was planning on making a silly video so I have about 10 hours of footage that shows I've done absolutely nothing wrong. Somewhat tempted to load the 10 hours on youtube and see if there's ANY possible way they could see a ban and use it as evidence. But from what I've seen it doesn't seem to make a blind bit of difference Rockstar doesn't seem interested in helping those wrongfully banned.Nice meme!EDIT 1 Alright as a friend pointed out I'm only banned until December not March. I figure since I'm playing in EU they wouldn't use American dates though the year should've tipped me off.But still what incentive do I have to turn the game back on in a month's time? There are too many risks on innocent players and that shouldn't ever be the case.

Want to do a hiest? Better have a group of friends because chances are you will barely ever find a random group who will finish a mission. Loading screens are also a huge problem in this game Every time you do a mission or join a friend your looking a 2 5 min loading screen. Micro transactions are also ridiculously over priced $100 for $8 million or have no life and grind for 100+ hours without spending anything. Support is the worst i've ever seen I forgot my password and needed help resetting it so I sent an email 3 months ago and have yet to recieve a response.If you are looking for a great single player experience then buy this game But since i've beaten the game a few times i'mgiving this a negative review based on my experience with Gta online.

2016-12-06,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,It's a good game but if you plan to use a steam controller don't buy it. It says full steam controller support but if it doesn't support using xinputs and kb+m simultaneously which is the whole point with a steam controller. Compare it with Just Cause 3 and that is a joy to play with the steam controller but this. You're stuck with simulating mouse through joystick which is the worst way to play it. Can't recommend it because if that reason.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-04,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,I recommend the single player campaign because it is fun to play and the game world looks great and feels like it s a working living world additionally Rockstar are good in that they do keep updating this game with new content.But the reason I can t recommend this game is because GTA online is a bad experience plagued with long loading screens low number of supported players in any given server if someone quits a mission half way through (which you waited in a lobby for 5 minutes to gather the players) it abandons the whole mission (AI doesn t even resume control of that player) doesn t even put you back in the lobby with the remaining players just out right quits and throws you back into the city free roaming and of course there are all the hackers and the innocent players getting banned for no reason.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-04,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,"Update I Have not played GTA online for a long time since the release of this review And Appearently I was permanently banned I played after my 30 days was lifted for like 5min before I got bored then today I'm permanently banned Great Job Rockstar.Ok I'm going to need to organize this list and try and be as helpful as posible to anyone purchasing this product.I may have only 88 hours or so at the time of wrighting this but I was a huge GTA fan and wanted to play on ever thing I had at the time I've played over 1000 hours on the xbox 400 on ps3 and this is from expeirence with all copies that I have played.Pros Great Campain truely amazing characters are funny and can be badass has a good plot not too great of a common villian because that changes throught the story. Has Replay Value and side quests Fun gameplay feels nice and smooth and free. You can use mods on single player. great constant updates to the game good support amazing graphics so much attention to the little details designs and interiors for places have great touches interior places are amazing to look at and feel satisfying. So much customization not too much on guns but a car will leave you with hours of testing different variants. feels like their are infinite things to do.... but can you do them?Cons pay to the ing win hours on top of hours of grinding the same boring thing because it gives out the most money will leave you feeling slaved out and when you finish to see all that money you got It's petty cash. You may be able to buy a non upgraded car or maybe an appartment but buying a buisness a boat a selections of cars etc with that money you have earned you will need to pour constant weeks maybe months to get that crap Unless... SHARK CARDS the new inovative way to spend all of your money on things that you should be able to work a reasonable ammount of time for I was stupid enough to buy a $100 U.S. on the largest card and I ran out of money in about a couple of hours I thought I would get a company and do the cool new jobs for that and profit off my purchase. but no I found out that yet again this is another grind for pointless ammonts of money see this is why squeakers have money in this game It's becauseMommy's credit card is hooked up to the ing PC/xbox/ps oh yea and you see all those pictures that they show in the thing up there? ing good god damn luck getting that in a 1000 hours of playtime Modders. Maybe there are some modders looking to help people out and give some money they risk a lot for facing rockstar'smoney hungry system but some are just s. go into a game not to help people but ing drop ufo's on people andblow up their and be trolls. bots thanks to rockstars t system with money bots have Infiltrated everywhere! you go to youtube and punch in ""gta v modded lobby"" and you get a billion results with clickbait titles live streamers maracuosly have 10 hands to play on all consoles somehow and don't talk in the stream while some pre reccorded gamplay is shown and then channels seem to issue out 40 videos in an hour with the same title and same thumbnail... funniest about mod videos most mods for online is a straight up virus but when the person with the video showing you how to get this mod for infinite money seems to start the video off with a shark card give away it seems a little sketchy to me. every ing person on this earth is giving away shark cards no matter what like you go somewhere ""hey guys we are doing a huge shark card give away like the video share and sub..."" and kids fall for it like maybe some can be legit but for the most part it's a trend for views and promotion. lispyjimmy is like the cover of a book called ""The GTA V cancerous community"" like I'm not even going to explain why he fuels this cancer with his click bate ok I'm not gonna go into depth about the who kill people for no reason blow up their car and ing destroy their cargo from their 50 hour grind and get a measly 2k out of it when the transporter is sitting on top of 2M potention and wasting 1M all in all I am a level 120 on xbox with 1000+ hours and I have an apartment A company 2 sports cars and that's about ing all I get for my grind. So no I do not reccomend this game purly because of it's cancerous community and the P2W of the game you really don't hear this side of the game not sure why maybe cause the game is 3 or 4 years old now and their isn't gonna be a new one soon.So I gave this game a couple more hours I tried playing some more and today I was put in a modded lobby money was dropped on my and things like that and I got kinda happy over it maybe I could expirence the things that people pay for with out hours of pointless grinding But no In this lobby I got BANNED for a MONTH and got all MY CHARACTERS DELETED including my level 120. so you rockstar you money hungry peices of who can't even fix their banning system. I contacted them over this and they said bans are what they are and can't fix on top of this there is no way to disable relations between steam account and social club so I can't play online right now. I might as well get some story mods or like that the only decent thing that came out of rockstar the crack hooker who pops out dead baby's and special needs ones that need to be on a life line to live that is basicly what gta online is.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-03,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,To sum it up Singleplayer is great it's fun same old GTA feel but better. Amazing characters well written story etc etc.Online TL DR if you only buy this game for online play... don't. UNLESS! you have three other friends who want to run missions with you. Almost all missions require four players. Accepting invites from randoms will 9/10 times put you in a queue (just don't) because they fill up quickly. The free roam of the game has next to no gameplay value. It's just a cluster F of higher level players killing you. Making money in online is difficult (thusly why they sell ingame money for quite alot of real money). Don't be fooled by the staggering amount of youtube videos telling you how easy it is to make money online. (there is a reason why they are there). Unless you're a tight group of four players completing heists is very difficult since the heists require a great deal of communication. To sum it up Online is fun only with friends. With randoms it's a pain in a pooper.,Grand Theft Auto V

At least it was until it became illeagle to have fun in the game. Take two doesnt realise the only reason people buy this game anymore is to have fun with mods. The game itself is horrible now. There is never anything to do in the game unless you have mods. No one wants to play online anymore either. Almost everyone who has had this game since release and has played online since it became available is a very high online rank. No one wants to play missions they have done over and over again. Since you can't legally mod in the game anymore there is no reason to buy it. It isnt a fun game anymore. No mods means no fun. MODDING IS NOT A CRIME. Hackers have ruined online and now ROCKSTAR AND TAKE 2 THEMSELVES have RUINED single player. This is going to begin the downfall of rockstar games and take 2. Unless they see the error in what they have done the companies are screwed. There is no saving this game with crappy online updates anymore. People have enough money to just hop on the game buy everything new then just quit until the next crappy update.

Only thing you can do is play the same s*** bank job over and over and over and over again until you get money. Gameplay value on the multiplayer is zero.Also when hackers get free stuff where i get charged why should i pay for anything not to mention the most vile shark cards which ruined the multiplayer for this.Thank you Rockstar for ruining GTA Online and i can't wait for you to ruin Red Dead Redemption 2,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-17,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is not a terrible game. The singleplayer is fun and the characters are great. Where the game does fall flat is it's online aspect.The online is horribly watered down and you can do pretty much nothing that makes GTA fun without grinding or stuffing more money into Rockstar and Take Two's pockets. If I purchase a game for 40 I do not then expect to have to pay additional money just to enjoy the multiplayer aspect (read the only thing you can really do after finishing the singleplayer completely) the way it should be enjoyed. Sure you could do some heists with friends but there are only 5 of the damn things.""But wait!"" I hear you say. ""Surely you could just download some of those famous GTAV singleplayer mods I've been hearing about to add more fun to the post story singleplayer?"" Well you could until Take Two decided that they didn't like mods and then took out OpenIV one of the things that made most modding possible.This isn't Rockstar's fault (I hope.) It's Take Two's.

How hard would it be to include these missions and new added content for solo? NPC's are smart enough to fight... why are they not good enough for me to build a crew with and try the heists? Give choices as to who you want to hire each with different stats and pay outs for their service. Maybe I need a guy who can specialize in explosives but out of my options there is only one who can be hired (Which costs more).Its just and idea.Take away the t option to buy money and maybe us old schoolers would find interest online again. The whole point of games is to earn your place (High Scores). We play games to feel the pride or ego of accomplishing things we might not be able to do in real life (Commit murder under complete stealth). Give me the option to pretty much ""cheat"" online and the reason turns into chaos alot sooner than if only a few people had the time put in and the higher levels to cause such chaos we see rampant on the servers (I know I know.

After it took nearly half a week to install on to my computer I was all hyped to finally play this game that came out nearly 9 months ago. Loaded up the t that is the ""Rockstar Social Club"" and was waiting for it to load up the game but then it said that it couldn't connect to the rockstar servers and that I should check my internet connection. I know I have internet because I'm hard wired with ethernet and it says so on the bottom right of my screen. So I just simply tried again and of course it didn't work. So I spent the next 7 hours googling and trouble shooting trying to find a reason why this thing wouldn't work after many hours I found something that said I could reinstall Social Club with a patch that had supposedly fixed this issue so I downloaded the setup file once finished I ran it. It asked for my language so I put English but then after that it just said that it couldn't install it because GTA 5 wasn't even installed on my computer and it told me to reinstall the game. Now I sure as hell wasn't going to do that so I tried everything else which included using VPN's disabling firewalls and anti virus programs none of which worked.

2017-09-16,0,0,884,False,Not Recommended,I have a great deal of admiration for this game and have enjoyed many of the hundreds of hours that I have spent playing it. I wish that I could recommend it but I can't and for anyone who might be interested here is my experience. There is much to enjoy about the game. I like the fact that it involves interaction with others. The range of activities in game is excellent. The vehicles are great and if like me you enjoy guns and fast cars then you too will love this game. That is the good. What is not good is the ongoing problem of hackers interfering with normal gameplay. They go off radar blow you up remotely and can use 'godmode' so that they take no damage (among other abilities). I have put up with this and still managed to enjoy the game but ultimately hackers and Rockstar's abysmal lack of support are the reason for this negative review. Hackers gave me and many others ridiculous (tens of millions of dollars) amounts of in game currency earlier this year. Rockstar dealt with this in my case by zeroing my accounts. I was a bit upset. I had dealt with the extra income for the most part by buying things (like Pegasus vehicles and fully upgraded office garages) which I would not otherwise have wanted or been able to afford and carried on playing the game (and earning money). So of the millions which Rockstar took away many of them were legitimately earned. However I had no real complaints at this time since I was able to sell some of the things I had bought and carry on without too much disruption. Just before the last DLC Rockstar removed money again. I had grinded cash importing and exporting cars for several days and just hit $4 million in savings but when I logged on they had 'corrected' my bank balance by $3 600 000. Which is a lot of money. All of which was legitimately earned. I don't recommend it (rather boring!) but all of this is documented in the screenshots which I upload to Stream. So this time I complained. I got a standard reply which was no help at all and just said they were correcting my balance. So I put in another support ticket and heard nothing back for weeks. When I checked it had been closed. No response at all. So I put in a third support ticket polite but indignant that a legitimate complaint should be ignored in this way. A few hours after I checked back closed again with no response at all. So I would like to warn any potential buyers of this game that Rockstar support is no support at all and that they will take money that you have earned legitimately and then ignore you. As a previously very happy customer who bought two copies of the game and a shark card I am really sad that this situation should occur. I read forum posts (Reddit mostly) about GTA and know that many players had legitimate money removed recently. I read of one (and only one) player who had it returned. I have never modded and never asked for money. While initially items in the game seem expensive there are many different ways to earn money effectively after the initial struggle and investment pays off. So I hope some of you find this informative if you decide to buy this game you will find a lot to enjoy. But....you have been warned!,Grand Theft Auto V

Heck I bought my current PC just so I could run GTA 5 on PC to play some cool mods like LSPDFR and drive awesome new cars around but now it's no longer possible. So once again if you're interested in trying out some of the best mods created for the PC version of the game DO NOT waste your money you are NOT going to be able to do that anymore. It was great while it lasted but alas it looks like Take Two has no idea about what makes games like these popular on PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

Their recent decisions to screw over its playerbase in order to squeeze more money out of you is not worthy of our respect or our time. You're just a statistic to them something that gives them money and who they think of ways to get more out of you because your initial payment isn't enough for them. Please do not support this behaviour. Go spend the money you were going to spend on this game on something else that interests you instead be it any other game or even something not gaming related.If companies like CDPR can put out an extraordinarily quality AAA product like Witcher 3 and release two quality expansions for it for a very reasonable price there's no reason other companies cannot.

Also every explosion just kills you instantly instead of having any kind of concussive force. I'd say it's more streamlined but it lacks the personality that IV had. Shoot a shotgun out of an officers hand and he flinches then continues to shoot you when it should have been blown out of his hands. Overall it's still pretty fun providing your PC can run max settings. TL DR It looks more pretty but gameplay features have been neglected. Also buy the T20.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-26,0,0,164,False,Recommended,For me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again. Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent wickedly comic and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary post economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire it rips into the Millennial generation celebrities the far right the far left the middle class the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar s sharp tongue including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first person shooter called Righteous Slaughter ( Rated PG pretty much the same as the last game. ) It s not exactly subtle he literally has the word Entitled tattooed on his neck and the in game radio and TV s outright takes don t leave much to the imagination but it is often extremely funny and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto s San Andreas is a fantasy but the things it satirises greed corruption hypocrisy the abuse of power are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.Grand Theft Auto V s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains hijack military aircraft and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people albeit extraordinarily f***ed up people.Michael is a retired con man in his 40s filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son air headed daughter serially unfaithful wife and very expensive therapist all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang banger stereotype even as he s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there s Trevor a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed up childhood. The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three and it s a credit to GTA V s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times they re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.This three character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto s personality. In doing so it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here many of Michael s missions revolve around his family and his past Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills Franklin can to slow time while driving for example which gives them a unique touch. Narratively it s effective even off mission I found myself playing in character acting like a mid life crisis guy with anger issues as Michael a thrill seeker as Franklin and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car because I felt like that s what he d want.Trevor feels a like a bit of a get out of jail free card for Rockstar providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get out clauses go though it s pretty effective and Trevor s over the top missions are some of GTA V s action packed highlights. It s a successful way of solving a problem that s prevalent in open world games the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both masterfully allowing neither to undermine the other.The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their individual lives and habits fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the San Andreas map closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him or speeding along the motorway blasting 80s hits or having a cigarette at the golf club Franklin might be walking out of a strip club munching a bag of snacks at home or arguing with his ex girlfriend there s a good chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or on one memorable occasion drunk in a stolen police helicopter.,Grand Theft Auto V

LOADING SCREENS.The loading screens in GTA V are annoying for two reasons One being they are simply boring I mean just watching half naked girls isnt enough for some people you know?The second reason is the length of the loading screens I mean I get it its a big game that has a big world with alot of content and I respect that I really do but that crossed the line.For example I was playing GTA V online for about 3 hours I was playing missions races and plain old PVP (Deathmatches and so on) 1 whole hour of those 3 hours was loading screens now some people say its worth it being able to have a good time for the sacrifice of an hour of your time.But they are simply mistaken I payed a full price of this game (60$) and when I bought it I didn't expect to have my time wasted by long loading screens I could have spent time with my loved ones during that hour or focus on my job which is a much better use of your time then playing this waste of a time game.Sorry for long review here's nothing &gt &gt,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-17,0,0,494,False,Recommended,MAIN GAME With an engaging and practical plot solid gameplay and fantastic pacing GTA V is constantly entertaining with virtually no bad or boring parts. Every mission is individually unique and memorable. You will find yourself wishing to replay it a few months after you first beat the game.PC version is the best available and runs well on even low end gaming PC's.Online Bugged and unoptimized GTA Online requires an abundance of patience. Loading screens last minutes at a time and often fail triggering another load equally as long. The in game economy is insurmountable and getting together enough money for any of the additional features requires either purchasing microtransactions or grinding LONG hours with a heist crew which is also easy to screw up if one person is not in the know or does not speak your language (did I mention it requires patience?) Ostensibly true to the Californian lifestyle you will have to pay $400 000 for a decent apartment to run heists from at least $700 000 for a decent racing car at least $1 000 000 for an office space $200 000 for a motorcycle club $500 000 for a bullet proof car to run missions with and $10k $50k per weapon plus $100 000 dollars worth of ammunition. Ready access to a tank or fighter jet will run you multiple millions of dollars and a Yacht can get as high as $10 000 000. Certain weapons cost hundreds of dollars to fire each time destroying your car will cost you a fair percentage of it's worth to be replaced ($10k for sports cars) you'll lose money every 24 minutes for every apartment and office and yacht you own... Bear in mind that the average income in this game is about $15k for a ten minute game capping out at the high end of making $500k over about 4 hours by hosting a Pacific Standard (Paci Stan) heist and paying your accomplices poorly.Yeah it's designed for sinking real money in to.There is some serious fun to be had the bones of online are still rooted in the good gameplay of the main game after all and heisting does have a sort of strategic and calmly cooperative feeling to it expecially with the right people. However inbalance and grinding can really dull it down.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-28,1,2,1600,False,Recommended,"Here's my significant and brief review of GTA V and GTA ON Singleplayer +Awesome storyline.+Interesting characters.+Marvelous astonishing graphics.+Simple gameplay mechanics.+Plenty of after main story content to keep you entertained for hours.+Easy 100% checklist to complete.Multiplayer (GTA ON)+The game let's you grow a criminal empire with diverse activities and businesses to buy.+Easy mechanics fast paced efficient for any gta on player. The game advocates a pay to win gameplay which is made up by implementing the microtransactions feature called ""shark cards"" in game.As money isn't easily gained because it requires much effort and many hours to spend into the game in order to progress rapidly through the game and compete with other players the game basicly forces you to buy shark cards. Most of the time useless things are added into the game promoting further the pay to win system. Modders and Hackers modify and alter your gaming experience in a negative way of course.For instance modders can spawn money drops they can blow you up in various ways and in no time at all.Hackers can alter your character statistics(level money assets etc).Of course you can contact rockstar support and they may or may not help you. Unfair payouts in all the vast plethora of available job lesuires businesses etc.Rockstar has nerfed all these ways of making money as to promote their ""shark cards"" and push more and more future customes into buying them. Cancerous community of cruel mean and vicious players who tend to ruin your gaming experience much like hackers and modders.To sum up i of course recommend GTA V singleplayer.As for GTA on it requires a lot of time to be put into for a person to do all the fun stuff other people do.If you don't have time to do most of the big stuff then this isn't the game for you.If you have time then aye I recommend this game to you.Beware though.+Always play in solo public sessions alone or with friends only.Watch a YouTube tutorial.+Don't buy everything.Buy only the essentials.Watch some YouTube tutorials also.Then buy the things you really want if you only have the sufficient and excessive money amount.",Grand Theft Auto V

Yeah the story was great and if that is all you want from this game then get it for that but don't go multiplayer if you have even a shred of interest in playing it legitematly because there is no real way to earn money on it without paying real money.

The one thing that has kept GTA at the top of the charts is the modding community. All the way back to GTA San Andreas there has been mods for the games. Take Two has decided to send a cease and desist to OpenIV the main program that allows modding of the game for years. Take Two has decided to say the final "" you"" to the community and players that have been loyal to the GTA series. Take Two is throwing away the modding community and support from the modding community to force shark cards and GTA Online down our throats. I do not support online mods the modding community as a majority don't support or work on online mods so Take Twos actions on OpenIV had a direct and major impact on the single player harmless mods.

2017-06-15,0,0,390,False,Not Recommended,GTA V would be a game I recommended in the past but with recent developments I couldn't possibly recommend buying a game from a company (Take 2 Interactive) which treats its consumer with such disrespect. For a more in depth view of this feel free to what Nerd's video on the matter https //youtu.be/0gKlBIPR_okand Jim Sterling's video https //youtu.be/xEYGhks8CRkThe game to start with is overall very good for a single player experience that I have happily played and completed the story. The multiplayer on the other hand is flat out terrible. The concept is brilliant however it s made to want you to pay for shark cards just so that you can make progress within the online world. Unless you have no job or social life and have an ability to sit around the whole day for business to finish with producing products and grind the heists missions then getting money and levelling is more or less very difficult.While I don't personally mod GTA V (since if I wanted to play with modded content I would play a game such as ARMA 3) I find it disgraceful that Take 2 Interactive should make the ability for a large amount of the modding community incredibly difficult. The game is sold at a pricey 39.99 which I say is reasonable but to then just in the same way free to play mobile games force microtransactions from massive time delays upon its players the game does exactly the same for the online game. Massive wait times on businesses low selling prices on vehicles and cargo etc. They make the player feel the need to purchase shark cards.Purely based on the business practices I couldn t recommend this game. Hopefully after getting a lot of this negative feedback from large amounts of players things may change.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-25,1,2,448,False,Recommended,It is one of the very best video games ever made.Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.,Grand Theft Auto V

Buying this game full price or even 30 bucks makes you support their way of doing things. Wait until its like 10 Dollars or something. All the stuff they put into this game doesnt justify their moves they made. They need to learn a lesson. VC and SA were pirated a lot GTA 4 a lot less and GTA 5 even lesser. People pirate a game cause you have to convince them with a great story and content. The less thex do that the more trust ( or lets say addiction) they are addicted to it.

2017-01-09,0,0,648,False,Not Recommended,This game is really fun when you are playing with friends whether online or private session. The main problem with this game is that while online and trying to do anything in the latest versions (CEO or Biker) it has become increasing more difficult because of all of the modders. since Christmas 2016 until the date of this post (1/9/17) the number of modders has increased at an alarming rate. At any given time in a server with 6 20 people there will be 3 4 people that are modding stealing your money and guns/bullets invulnerable to damage spawing multiple selves in etc. The game has gone from enjoyable to play to aggravated as hell.

2015-12-10,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE Take Two has decided to drop their cease and decist on OpenIV meaning mods are back!ORIGINAL REVIEW As of June 14th 2017 GTAV is dead to me the OpenIV Team and a couple thousand other players.Like most of us we loved the game the singleplayer was nice and the multiplayer was great! Lots of action and excitement. But then Take Two started to get greedy in 2016. FiveM which was a standalone mod that allowed users to join custom lobbies (like drifting and to) was shut down by the FiveM devs after Take Two issued a Cease and Desist order on them. While Rockstar in the past have told the community they welcome modding with open arms Take Two interactive was having none of it they didn't want people to stop playing GTA O and go to FiveM for a better experience they wanted the players to stick around and continue to invest in shark cards. But that was nothing to what they did today (June 14 2017). Take two decided to issue a Cease and Desist order on the OpenIV team effectively claiming SP modding is illegal and should not be allowed. Unfortunately OpenIV was forced to shut down as they didn't have the resources nor the money to go to court with Take Two.Do not blame Rockstar for this blame Take Two. Those greedy s decided to kill of modding because they feared they would lose money.So I warn you if you want to buy GTAV and have fun with singleplayer mods im sorry but it's too late. There's nothing that can be done to bring fan favorite mods back or even the modding community. Since Take Two turned their backs on the modding community the modding community is turning their backs on them.Also if you're thinking of buying RDR2 or the next GTA game don't.

The developers show no concern for the playerbase and will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last cent they can from the loyal fans that the company has no regard for. They go after singleplayer modding tools that have been active for years and have no affect on online in an attempt to curb multiplayer hacking which accomplished nothing as the hackers online still flourished while punishing players. Alot of players got so fed up with the joke that is GTA Online and have reverted to playing singleplayer with mods which is and always has been ""Officially allowed"" by Rockstar. Then they tried to shut down the SP modding tool forcing the SP players to play Online for their entertainment then being subject to the teeming mass of hackers that run rapant in Online lobbies. Rockstar's regular release of ""FreeLC"" increasingly supports a Pay 2 Win dynamic where the in game content being induced is becoming increasingly more expensive. Rockstar's goal is to reinforce the need for their in game micro transactions ""Shark Cards"". Which allow players to substitute grinding for hours on end for in game progress to paying real currency in exchange for in game currency. Even as the in game content becomes increasingly obscenely highly priced the Shark Card value / exchange rate / prices have not been altered since the game was released When the game was released a megalodon Shark Card ($100 USD for 8 Million GTA$) would get players along way. Now with the years of in game ""inflation"" that particular Shark Card which still costs $100 USD for $8 000 000 in game can barely go as far as to purchase FOUR of the new vehicles if even at that. Rockstar offers no real in game alternative to Shark Cards. The Heists payout is a joke compared to the price of everything else in game and that's if you could even get a heist succesfully completed. Rockstar has also been confiscating ""suspicious money"" from players in an attempt to curb ill gotten gains via hacking but has seemed to affect money gotten legitimately from players 80% of the time. Their customer support is a joke and is a running joke in the video game standard widely regarded as the worst period by many. Do yourself a favor Don't purchase this game.

They still can't fix their servers and don't have a good way to stop hackers from joining online lobbies so they just decided to ban modding as a whole. They did however revert the singleplayer modding ban after the crazy backlash they got from the community.

2017-06-17,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,"There was a time when I would have wholeheartedly recommended this game based on its singleplayer and multiplayer alike. It has a pretty solid story and base gameplay and initially the multiplayer provided an interesting environment for both running missions and screwing around with friends. Since then however things have changed significantly.Many complaints in the past were centered around the abysmal hacking community that surrounded this game but every day I find it harder and harder to hold their actions against them. While many laud 2K for releasing many ""free"" additions to GTA Online it's become increasingly clear that the pricing of these additions is specifically tuned to push players to purchase real money ""Shark Cards "" requiring sums of in game money that are nigh impossible to acquire for anyone that doesn't treat playing GTA Online as a day job. Clearly this strategy has paid off with 2K raking in incredible profits off of these microtransactions and giving up on any plans to release single player DLC for the game.This is fine. I don't like it one bit but it's a fairly common business practice and all I can do is expect people to vote with their dollars. What isn't fine however is the increasingly money centric strategy that 2K has been pursuing with regards to its community. They have taken to aggressively shutting down any group or service that they fear may negatively affect their profits inclding modding tools private servers and so on. This comes across as nothing more than an attempt to funnel more players into GTA Online where the money is at the expense of hurting their community.Conclusion I can't approve of this practice and I can't recommend GTAV as a fun experience anymore. It still has a solid singleplayer campaign but the singleplayer experience is now relatively limited with the shut down of the OpenIV modding suite. The multiplayer experience while fun at times is hopelessly grindy for the purpose of enticing you to purchase real money shortcuts. The community is...pretty bad. Lots of angry slur spewing kids with the occasional helpful player willing to lend a hand. Overall I just can't find much reason to play it at this point.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-18,0,0,404,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Grand Theft Auto 5 is an action FPS adventure open world developed by Rockstar Games at 2013 (old gen 2014 new gen)Its an awesome game Im glad I have a good friend that bought me this game. Its fun on singleplayer and on multiplayer.Singleplayer storyline as nice especially for GTA franchise where stories are bit mixed and stuff. If you dont like to play the storyline that much its still a lot of fun to do random stuff and in GTA there is a lot to do. Get new cars and upgrade them play minigames like tennis golf do side missions go on a robbing spree mess with the police and other funny stuff. In GTA 5 however there are 3 protagonists Old school gangster Franklin retired criminal Michael and crazy hillbilly (not really) Trevor. Each of them have their unique storylines specialities skills and emotions. Multiplayer is a whole different story. Its really messed up and good at the same time. Its awesome to do missions get new weapons mess up with friends race shoot basically everything is really fun in multiplayer. Except for one thing. Modders. There are a few types of modders either they are money modders animation modders or spam modders that most likely ruin your experience. Although rockstar made a banning system and stuff there are still a lot of modders that just ruin the game. GTA Multiplayer got a lots of awesome updates that brought new cars clothing weapons events and everything. And its still developing.Overall I rate this game 8.5 / 10.

However the publisher of this game Take 2 interactive has recently banned all modding (IN SINGLE PLAYER) resulting in hundreds if not thousands of fanmade projects such as the remaking of gta 4's world in the gta 5 engine being shut down. This was done in an effort to get you to buy the SEVERELY overpriced ""shark card"" micro transactions. I am completely against this anti consumer practice and am ashamed of Take 2 interactive.

The optimization of the game is great( 60 fps of normal setting in GTX 650 and 60 fps of high setting in GTX 970 ).The story is about 3 thiefs not gangster anymore. Story of betraying making friends making trouble finding a old friend Being betrayed Uniting Killing the people who want to kill you Being a Billionaire Collect all useless things like nuclear waste. The Characteristics of each characters are distinctive each of them have their unique skills. A world that like copying the entire Los Angeles to the game. And bunches of mods that you can use to make the game cool. The offline story take about 50 hours to finish all the missions strangers and freaks collection subjects. And the online mode is the main part of the game. You can create the charater as detail as you like. However one of the bad things is the loading time of sessions. The online contents are always update but the heists have 5 only. And bunches of activities you can do with friends ( heists jobs racing ). As well as killing the online players killing each other. A Los Santos that full of tanks and hydras. Pros Offline &gt The plot is excellent &gt The optimization is much better than GTA IV &gt Distinctive of characteristic of each characters &gt A detail world ( Large as San Andreas but not include San Fierro and Las Venturas ) &gt Bunches of side missions &gt Crazy mods you can install Online &gt Detail character making &gt Bunches of activities &gt Fun to play with friends &gt Online contents always update Cons Online &gt Too long loading time &gt Only 5 heists you can do &gt Trolling teamates in heists &gt No animals in online mode Score 9.5 / 10 ( Super Saiyan )In conclusion no reason to not buy this game,Grand Theft Auto V

This will forever remain as a black mark on Take Two and they still have lost my trust. However at this time I can now re recommend the game to everyone. Let your voices be heard because it can change things for the better.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-12-20,1,2,333,False,Not Recommended,Okay this game is good overall. BUT it doesen't compensate for the fact that Rocktar are greedy little s. It takes for EVER to make a million in a legit way in this game. Depending on your methods it can take up (at best) 2 3 hours of constant and painful (farming the same over and over again) gameplay juste to make 1M. Or you can buy a ing shark card and the best deal you can get is 8 million in game dollars for 100$ REAL LIFE DOLLARS!? And in order to truly enjoy the online expercience to unlock most of the content you will need more than 150 ing million in game dollars. Make the math. This is insane.

2017-07-29,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Bought mainly as a benchmark just for my computer I like the story of the game but that's as far as my recommendations for this game would go. Other than the modding fiasco TakeTwo tried to pull this game is just outright a ing grind. We all thought Destiny was the king of the grind but after playing GTA Online we didn't know what a grind was. Finding out that most of the DLC you guys release for this game requires ridiculous amounts of money to use to the fullest was the last nail in the coffin for me. Millions of dollars to actually participate meaning you grind the same missions over and over or try and pull heists that get ruined at the last second because some dude thought it would be hilarious to kill the target drive off a cliff etc. TL DR until Rockstar gets off their asses and puts out some single player DLC for the storyline or quits expecting you to devote your life to GTA Online don't waste your money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-10,0,0,339,False,Recommended,Hey guys I don't usually write reviews but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it. A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book Best selling action adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)Best selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billionFastest video game to gross $1 billionHighest grossing video game in 24 hoursHighest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)Most viewed trailer for an action adventure video gameMost viewed trailer of an action adventure video game (800+ milion views)Graphics1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.2. Graphic details are the best I have seen especially in an open world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me. a) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence it has been done before and not just in GTA but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.b) Rain. Again not a new feature actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well THE SOUND . This is something that not many people talk about yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).c) Night time baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that so why do I mention this ? Well because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison because of the obvious reason (2015 2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.Gameplay and FeaturesOh yea the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get a kid who's bike was stolen hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal but baby this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.3. Los Santos Customs. Again not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet let me tell you that this feature is game making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove Hilwood Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads turns hard turns. BTW if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me this is one of the best things I've seen in this game. 4. Activities. Driving mission making robberies flying hunting diving piloting aircrafts submarines boats golf tennis cards smoke weed racing playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game not even in Single Player mode. There are so many more things to talk about but the review would be monstruosly long so In a few words buy the game it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom I can tell you in short that this game excels in every aspect Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode cars have a mind blowing realistic control weather has never been better reproduced etc. GL&amp HF,Grand Theft Auto V

And when you don't have a personality vulnerable to Take Two's predatory business practices.Price creep in GTA Online is wholly ridiculous. You can at absolute best make just under $400k/hr grinding the same heist. Over and over. The most expensive vehicles and properties cost multiple millions.Unless you have some will of steel or actually actively enjoy grinding Take Two is trying to take advantage of people with vulnerable personalities to make them feel forced to buy Shark Cards.

2017-01-02,0,0,109,False,Not Recommended,While I enjoyed this game's single player and I even enjoyed playing GTA Online initially Rockstar has screwed it up.Rockstar doesn't update single player anywhere near as much as Online so buying just for the sake of single player is not really worth it. Online is runied by Rockstar slowly but surely edging the experience away from being fun and becoming a money grind to try to buy the expensive new content. Tens of millions of dollas of in game money and you still won't have everything you want. It is deisgned so that you do have to buy in game money even though Rockstar claims this isn't the case. And when/if you do use micro transactions the experience is further ruined my hackers/modders which often make the game unplayable everything from players teleporting around to spawning dozens of hostile NPCs with rocket launchers right above your character... continuously. This has quickly shifted from rarity to the norm. Does Rockstar do anything about hackers? Not very much judging by the state of it. Instead they will probably permenantly ban you sooner or later after you've bought the game (which they deliberately released on last gen consoles first so that most people would re buy the same game on the new platforms a year later) and after those microtransactions you paid for and your time playing.... all gone.

Want to traffic cargo? Buy a warehouse. 3 5 million more. Want to traffic cars? Buy a vehicle warehouse. 4 6 million dollars. Gunrunning? Underground bunker 6 million dollars. Air smuggling? Buy a hanger. Another 3 6 million dollars. All the vehicles added in these updates range from $500 000 to several million and any planes you store in your hanger now cost $1000 to replace every time you destroy them which is pretty much every time you fly something in this game. Oh and you have to pay a daily salary for your mechanic your CEO Office assistant your power and water bills for your properties and your gunrunning employees. This adds up to around $11 000 a day if you're part of everything. Meanwhile a $20 shark card microtransaction only gives you 1 250 000. Let that sink in.

2017-03-25,0,0,255,False,Recommended,Rip for those innocent people who got banned for no reasons. It's surely outrageous but I still consider those pretty rare cases which shouldn't be a reason that hinders you from purchasing this game. Story mode is just pure delicacy so I guess it's reasonable for everyone to ask for some more taste of it (meaning DLCs) though I still believe that a lot of things can be added and optimized (hopefully in the next generation ) to make the series even more legendary. But imo it's also the online mode that makes a lot of difference (love and hate combined) as you can not only play with friends but interact with strangers which is what an open world game should be like. Granted you see morons and hackers fooling around out there but it's not like they are everywhere. You can always choose to switch lobbies whenever you feel uncomfortable. This is not a flawless game and nothing will ever be. But there's absolutely no doubt that you are looking at a masterpiece no matter all the problems it has. Anyway it's a must buy and I just don't see anything that is legit enough to keep you away from it (another story if you're not into this kind of game at all).,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-20,0,0,176,False,Not Recommended,I am a long time player of GTA. I have played thousands of hours in modded GTA 1 2 3 4 and 5. The OpenIV fiasco is the breaking point for me. Modding was a large factor in my purchase decision. I dislike the stock physics and handling so I make my own tweaks. I add functions like being able to use pedestrians as human shields or make the weapon damage and range realistic. I was having an absolute blast but becoming increasingly frustrated with Rockstar's attacks on modding. I would have to reinstall mods frequently often spending more time preparing to play than actually playing.I already regretted my purchase after watching Online be introduced as a grindy p2w snoozefest targetting mommy's credit card. Singleplayer expansions were shelved indefinitely and multiplayer content like lowriders never gets added to SP. Rockstar has attacked every alternate way to play online making it impossible to enjoy the game my way. I don't care about their forced progression or doing missions with randos. I just want to drive around with friends or do weird stuff with modded ramps and a fire truck. This attack on OpenIV is the last straw. I did not have much hope for GTA 6 but now i am not buying a single Rockstar game again. No Red Dead 2. Nothing. This boycott will work because your product is not a quality one anymore. Does anyone remember when they were DMA designs? Remember the original Multi Theft Auto mod? Remember the San Andreas Car Garage or whatever it was called with modded car sprites and more for the original GTA? Does anyone else love to find a mod to put their own car in game? I've spent so many late night hours tinkering with those things. I can't believe how far you have sunk Rockstar. I guess this is goodbye.,Grand Theft Auto V

TakeTwo tried to screw us and they deserve to have lowered ratings because of their anti consumer behaiviour. Besides that there are tons of other reasons not to buy this game.Micro transactions are shoved up your left and right in this game. Grinding is okay but the sheer amount of hours you have to put in to make enough money is insane. Unless you have all the time in the world you'd have to buy shark cards which is all part of R*'s plan to milk us as much as possible.The story is decent but there wasn't ONE SINGLE MISSION which was challenging. This is not an exaggeration. I know the game isn't supposed to be a real challenge but come on give me something.Many of the side missions have no substance to them. They are obviously included just to increase the time to reach 100% completion. Tons of these side missions just have you running aorund looking for parts evading the police or rampaging.Now that mods are back GTA is fun.

But why ?I can say from the beginning to now my experience was VERY AWESOMEbut there are some cons that can drive you off the line.When you play online you NEED to play either with friendor alone most of the time. You NEED to play hell alot to gain money or just be lucky to catch heist finales. You CAN play with other player but either they will be trollers or AGAIN if you are LUCKY pros.Don't watch players that have Level 250+ because either they are hackers or they are the modders themselves.For my 100 hours experience i can say one thing. You need to be peaceful guy toplay this because i rage alot.PROS +Awesome Vehicles+Very Cool Heists+Easy Missions for Money Grind+Outgrageous Fun IF you play with friendsCONS Too Hard To Gain Money Too Much Modders (Hackers) Too Expensive Armored or Armed Vehicles Hard If you play with StrangersI RECCOMEND IT because i can just change the session if i find moddersAnd I have friends to play with and I WILL CONTINUE PLAYING XDUPDATE After 315 hours of hard work! There is that new dlc and Rockstar are changing their codes and some modders managed to make a mod that bans everyone playing online! Now my progress everything stats level money property is lost!

Cars float over the road or you'd think so based on how they handled No idea what to do between missions cause they all seem to just end . I guess I just wait until someone decides to call me... Don't press anything when the Rockstar intro video is running cause it will crash your entire computer. Rockstar think their game is an Operating System cause it wants to run in Safe Mode after it crashes Rockstar think their game is an Operating System cause it has to run a 10 second process to shutdown Rockstar promotes large scale outsourcing (which explains the above stated issues). The physics engine is unacceptable for this day and age. It hasn't improved at all since titles as old as Vice City The graphics is bad. Maybe this is related to being forced on low settings but even fundemental stuff like hair and models are at 2005 levels (compared with what other companies can put out). Dialogue is excessive.

2016-11-05,0,0,127,False,Recommended,"GTA V is by far one of the most memorable and enjojable GTA games out there right next to San Andreas.Graphics animations physics gunplay and pretty much everything feels as an upgrade from previous tittles. The story is quite enjojable too with 3 very distinct main protagonist who allow you to roleplay them very different if you so wish to. The heist missions in particular are absurdly good even the ones on the GTA Online mode(some i would say even more so than the main game ones). No game is without flaws tho For all the realism and authenticity the game is going for in many aspects it still insist in breaking said immersion by allowing players to carry infinite arsenals at any given time rather than making them choose their loadout carefully. I think they should have taken a similar aproach to that of Max Payne when it comes to ""inventory"" management at least. Most of the weapons also feel a little too ""same'ish"" and few really stand out from the crowd. The UI at times can feel very counter intuitive and overclustered specially Online with the constant use of the Cell Phone and Internet Browser to access many of the game's features and social interactions. Out of game(real life) cell phone apps being used for things like training the dog and other things also being linked to the Rockstar Social Club detract a bit from the Single Player Experience. The Online mode while having a few high notes mostly feels little akward and many of the multiplayer game modes seem deserted even when the game shows 20k + players online at any time. The ability to purchase in game money with real money is also a low note for me in particular making the multiplayer aspect seem pay to win or at the very least ""grind less to win"".It is also a shame that rather than upgrading the Single Player with new features and/or Story DLCs any and all updates so far have been restricted to the Online mode.All in all there is no reason not to purchase GTA 5 the Single Player is outstanding and the Online Mode is optional and even with its flaws is overall enjojable(specially with friends).",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,0,0,358,False,Not Recommended,"The PC version of this game is officially DEAD. TakeTwo (Rockstar's parent company) hammered the last nail in the coffin all by itself with the take down of OpenIV. I purchased this game for a third time (ps3 ps4 then PC) at a full $60 on pc after waiting forever just so I could mod single player. OpenIV was the tool that made that possible but it no longer is after they received a Cease and Desist order from Take2.Taketwo claimed OpenIV allowed modding online when in reality the tool was used for singleplayer modding not online. And lets be honest its been a little bit since the take down and the only thing accomplished was destroying the only positive experience about this game left on PC. GTA O for PC has been dead a while the mod menu users have completely taken over the online experience. Even with repeated session switching it is near impossible to find a public lobby that doens't have at least one trolling mod menu user blowing everyone up with one button locking people in cages draining all the money from your acct teleporting you outside of playable areas to crash your game ect ect ect. Rockstar has been able to do exactly NOTHING about these users they are EVERYWHERE and in every session.So what does that leave for GTAV PC? Single player. Like I said and i'm sure many other users are in the same boat buying this game for PC was the third time I paid $60 for the game and I did so solely for the ability to mod the single player experience. I already had 2 copies of the game on PS3/4 where I could play multiplayer and lets face it PS4/XBONE are the only places to play this game online at this point due to mod menu users on PC and old gen consoles. With the take down of OpenIV single player modding goes right out the window. So what Rockstar and TakeTwo are saying imo is that after $180 spent buying GTAV across 3 platforms I still don't have the right to play single player the way I wish to. GTFO of here lolAnd consider how late in the game this move is the PC version has been released for over 2 years now with openIV being an integral part of the modding community the entire time. People have literally spent YEARS working on mods and mod builds that required openIV to properly implement. All of that time has just been rendered wasted by TakeTwo. On top of that you have to consider the many many communities such as the LSPDFR who have spent years building an amazing play space for civil gameplay and roleplaying between users that are now without way to perform the modifications to the game that make those awesome experiences possible. I just don't understand how TakeTwo possibly managed to justify rendering quite literally 1000s of hours of time and effort in many cases per individual user by people who puchased the game and positively contributed to its community completely wasted. YEARS of peoples lives invested rendered entirely wasted with one Cease and Desist order that isn't even accurate smh GG TakeTwo either pony up and admit you F*cked up royaly and grant openIV permission to function again or expect to lose the same customers who supported your game to the point of buying it 3 times at full price across 3 platforms. You clearly only care about money which is evident by your outrageously priced DLC content (in game price) used to try and push shark cards you're shady sale tactics of raising the price of the game to sell it ""on sale"" with shark card bundles that make it cost full retail anyway and the fact that over 2 years after release (on pc lol been even longer since initial) the game still costs $60 here on steam.

This morning I have received email about ban in gta5 and turned game on and got permant ban. Never cheated in game neither ran any programs or trainers in a background. I didn't cheat in a game so I can only guess that I got banned because of someoelse hacking game. I didn't recieve any help with currcency from hackers any teleports from hackers. Nothing at all. So I don't see a single point why was I banned! After writing to Rockstar sh*t people off course we don't care it's automated and it's for reason. So you buy game you play you don't cheat and you get banned forever! Well played. I will be getting full refund shortly as this is beyond joke.Now about game So you understnad free to play games have in app purchases ok. GTA5 online is expensive game to buy i bought it on release day for 39.99. Everything in a game is so expensive that there is no chance in hell you will be making moey. It is so difficult to make and earn money its unreal! This game is I would say brutal pay2win as everything is done so you HAVE to spend real money and everything is so expensive and daily charges and rent and sh*t that you have to be WORKING in gta5 and not having fun otherwise you losing money constantly.I am very very dissapointed and upset that first it is brutal pay2win and also their sh*t system banning people what don't cheat ( banned forever ) but don't ban people what cheat!So yeah if you thinking buying this game I would strongly advice you to avoid do not give these pri*ks any of your real money for few reason.1. too many hackers will get you banned. Will make you leave game2. you will get banned forever for no reason like I did3. too expensive to buy4. in app purchases beyond a joke5. everything is so expensive that you will be losing money constantly6. once you get banned they don't fu*king care7.

Got GTAV preordered it was released in my birthday back in 2015 I have friends that actually requested holidays to enjoy the 1 week of gtav on pc. Really addictive game I passed the history till 100.00% I was bit disapointed when I realised that there was things (vehicles and missions) Just for console pesants but seems like there are some missions that does not count to stats. Anyway story mode 10/10. It's bullsh!t if someone say gtav story is not the best so far. GTAsa had the best story GTAiv was constantly repeating the same things now gtav with a story of 69 missions you don't even realise them because its such a cool and interesting story.GTA online is the best thing of this game a lot of updates all of them with new and cool stuff gtav online now is a ton of games between a game. Compared to when it was released its 10 times better. However it has some annoying bugs and retard d people but that's internet.

2018-07-18,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game when they were doing pre orders on Steam. I just quit playing a long time ago and never came back. Don't get me wrong GTA V is one of the best games of its time and has been one of the fastest selling games that isn't WoW. But GTA V has turned into one of the worst examples of how a game company ruins the fun experience from banning innocent players that play the game fairly to being a pay to win cash grab with the shark card system. Without in game currency you cannot really do anything unless you spend hours and hours of tedious grinding or you can make things easier and break out your wallet and buy a shark card. There is a difference between a fun grind and a repetitive grind. This online system is a repetitive grind because you end up finding yourself only doing the same jobs. Everything is extremely expensive online so you might as well just only use your credit card skills because you will spend too much time trying to get the in game item you really want that you will grow tired of this game because it just ends up being a chore that you do not benefit from at all. You cannot go into an online lobby without running into a modder that is doing nothing but griefing and ruining the experience for people who play the game fairly. Don't get me started about the inconsistant framerates online even if you have a good build. The only good part of Grand Theft Auto V is the amazing single player story and the ability to mod single player with different enb textures and just making an already beautiful looking game into something breath taking as well as different gameplay changes to really make the game how you want to play on single player. Stay away from online if you do end up buying a good game turned to an example of how not to run a game. TLDR Game was good and now it sucks.PS I am still waiting for single player dlc.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-02,0,0,583,False,Not Recommended,"First of all I got another 1000 hours on the retail version but that account got banned. This game was pretty fun i enjoyed the storymode and online untill the doomsday heist.So ehm okay... What did you not like about the doomsday heist? Added an orbital cannon (for 500k 750k a pop one kill that you cannot defend yourself to) Aging game engine The tryhard game got to sad with Flying cars with the best tracking missiles. There was already a flyin bike with missiles but it doesn't have op missiles. People like to only grief in online. Any way possibe ending up abusing systems/glitches Filled with people that abuse the passive system People that kill themselves instead of you while fighting back So that you do not get the kill credited and their K/D stays higher Modders Modders Modders Modders that crash your game Modders that can end you up getting banned Awfull dripfeed system for new content (while the content already is in game but not activated)Ok there is the negative side now everything that makes this game fun. You can do whatever you want. For 10 minutes of ""work"" you can spend endless hours in the strip club (unless a tryhard comes in and blows you up with an RPG 7) If you play in friends only lobbies you will be alright (depending on your friends ofcourse) They have made some very nice looking fictional cars that are based off real cars some even look better in game than irl. I would reccomend it if you get into pc gaming and this would be your first game since it is beginner friendly (okok except tryhars part but ok do some heists)Final conclusion Do not get this game if you want to race or whatever.Do not get this game if you want to live peacefully in los santos.NEVER buy a shark card for greedy take 2.i should get this game in sale.Otherwise get GTA VI in 2020 2021 2022 whatever because that will probably be a clean start.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,2834,False,Not Recommended,I would say Yes Maybe ONLY if you have a lot of time and can find some good friends. A lot of people are trolls and there's just no end to the modders. The fun ones quit modding due to bans and new troll modders keep popping up it just is not worth playing in public servers 95% of the time so mostly I would say NO.Usually it's only one or two people in the servers modding not everyone but that is still more then enough to things up. Rockstar does actually make attempts to prevent people from using mods but the modding community is too vicious to be stopped. In fact now public servers are a minefield now that they can spam blowing up their car in your name and take your money and put you in a bad sport lobby Public servers are just a really bad idea now. EDIT really bad really really bad. They're ed. Just ed.New Edit So I feel like Take 2 and Rockstar need to have a lawsuit on their hand since besides the supposed bans on legit players that may or may not have happened what has indeed happened is they have started taking money from people including people who nevermodded or had it dropped on them people on the PS4 who literally can't mod for money and worst of all people who have bought shark cards have had their money taken away.That right there is literally theft. It has to be. I really really hope these victims actually take a lawsuit against Take 2 and RockStar because this can not just be gotten away with. It's wrong.Even if people are cheating they literally just had their most proffitable quarter yet since the game's original launch on last gen. Which proves that modders don't really effect their bottom line that much. Just a scummy company really.There's a lot of funs to be had with friends and the grind isn't as bad as other MMOs I've played. Besides if you could earn the Yacht with just a single weekend of playtime where is the achievement?With the right competent friends you can earn it within a month's time. But ya Competent is a pretty big keyword. Youtube before you run heists lots of shortcuts.I've seen people say wallet players have an unfair advantage and that is not exactly true. Yes you can pay for ingame cash which if you compare time spent heisting to minimum wage it's not worth it and that cash does not apply to your level. The only way to level up is to play missions heists and anything else that gives XP there is no real pay to win in this game.I can honestly say I have a lot of fun with friends but this game has mostly become an overglorified chatroom for us. There's fun little things you can do here and there if you know the right people.But it can be difficult to struggle through the servers and the split servering and all the s to find fun people. I got lucky. That is why I do not recommend this game even though I still play it.Also I hear storymode is pretty good but if that is all you are going to do then wait until you can get it for 30 bucks. Only worth 20 really but good luck finding that pirce.Play with friends learn how to create a split server (I finally did) or just don't play at all.

2016-07-22,0,0,121,False,Recommended,Right from the start I had high expectations for Grand Theft Auto V. Being the latest addition to one of the more successful gaming franchises out there it's hard not to. Being originally released on consoles in 2013 and on PC 2015 yet despite being this old I'd say that the game is a must own. The sole reason to why I was reluctant to purchasing it was the price which still is hella high but I'd even say that this game is worth the full price. In fact if this game isn't already in your library by now you should definitely look into purchasing it.Firstly the game is open world with one of the best maps ever created. The best maps that I can compare this with would be Just Cause 2's and Assassin's Creed's. GTA V's map while not being the largest is both visually beautiful and also sports several events. Just that they added things like playing golf tennis and doing yoga not counting all the activities like mountain biking up the mountain and parachuting or all the events that takes place. There truly never is a dull moment.Secondly what else indicates a good game more than the storyline. GTA V tells the story of three quite different characters Franklin Michael and Trevor. They all got good stories and contribute to the credibility of the storyline. The only other game that reminds me of this would probably be Saint's Row the third and that is far from as realistic as this one.Thirdly the game is at least 40 hours long. I know several games that have only a fourth of the campaign with little to no replayability. In this game you get to choose for yourself how you want to approach heists. Either some plan for a more stealthy run or you can choose the other path where you go in guns ablaze. That's not even mentioning the multiplayer with new heists and completely new races apartments and so much more.Now you might sit there thinking the multiplayer isn't that great there are far too many hackers. Even though I've just spent a few hours in the single player so far I have yet to see a single hacker. In summary if you don't already own this game I think that it's definitely worth it. GTA V brings up very important questions and shows that some games actually actually tell stories and really good ones at that. I consider the multiplayer as an added bonus and if you got the friends for it I'd recommend it even more.,Grand Theft Auto V

Servers constantly implode kicking everyone from the lobbies and half the time you cant get into a lobby with your friends regardless of if there is room in the server or not they just constantly crash or wont let you in. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE RELEASE ON BOTH CONSOLE AND PC... and THE PC RELEASE CAME OUT LIKE 2 YEARS AFTER CONSOLE. let that sink in for minute. you can randomly get booted from a server even if you are on a LAN with friends. Throwing shade part 2 Hackers Hackers and more Hackers. I spent the entire day bouncing in and out of lobby after lobby because there was some douch in EVERY SINGLE LOBBY hacking making it look like other people were hacking and crashing their comps etc. and im not talking Modders where they do fun things and troll these guys were just DESTROYING the experience for everyone else. Rockstar hasn't even addressed it. Throwing shade part 3 Upon PS4 launch / release GTA5 online multiplayer STOPPED WORKING ON PS3's... reading TONS of angry comments from PS3 users not being able to connect i read story after story of how tech support kept giving everyone the same run around saying ""its your modem / router the game doesnt work with your modem / router"" except the game was working FINE on everyones modems before the release of the PS4 port. Throwing shade part 4 This franchise made $1 BILLION DOLLARS upon release and that was in the first 3 days when it was only available on ps3 and xbox. Let me say that again... $1 BILLION DOLLARS. this was only sales... not even accounting for in game purchases or later re purchases to PS4 or PC launch. $1 BILLION DOLLARS. All that money and their tech support is comparable to Microsoft. Human Garbage people reading from the same script blaming all issues on the user no matter what. They really don't seem to care about hackers / poor server performance / or anything regarding the user end experience. Im getting really agitated at all these franchises making more money than ever before and yet they abandon the very crowd that lined their pockets and reinvest nearly NOTHING into their infrastructure.

To get 8 000 000 in game cash which will get you 'a few nice things or a big boat' you will need to pay $100 out of your own pocket! For a game that's about 2 years old on PC these prices are unreasonable. I can no longer recommend GTA V,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,1,2,312,False,Recommended,For me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.,Grand Theft Auto V
