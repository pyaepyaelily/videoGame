2017-07-04,0,0,136,True,Recommended,If you wanted DayZ with slightly better optimization and a quicker time to entry without the zombies then this game is for you. If you want a fun 3rd person shooter to kick around on with friends this is for you. However if you don't like early access this game ISN'T for you. Somewhat buggy and still many things to add. Well worth the cost so far however.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-15,0,0,203,True,Recommended,My friends and I are really enjoying this game. Even though it is Alpha it is certainly one of the more stable and complete feeling alpha games I have ever played.The only thing I suggest is making the throwables better. ATM it takes a lot of time to take the throwable out left click to begin aiming the throw and then clicking to actually throw the item (which still takes the character a secound to execute the throw). I've had a few monents where I feel that I could have gotten a kill or laid a smoke down at the proper time but sadly the enemy team kills me before all those moves are executed.Otherwise I am really enjoying the game and I look forward to putting a few hundred hours into it.Thank you dev team.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-16,0,0,46,True,Recommended,For those who never really grasp the concept of survival shooters this game is just a multiplayer game of Battle Royale. While the gameplay concept is not too original it stands out because this is probably the only game that came out as expected. The $30 pricing is up for you to decide because while the game may be fun alone or with friends the reward content is a unpredictable and confusing. My first impressions of playing this game gave me the feeling that it should be priced at least $15. Unreal Engine 4 seems daunting but the game looks like any other mod from DayZ or H1Z1. The performance of the game on my MSI GL62M 7RD is pretty bad with texture pop ins and server lag but when things are settled out the game runs from fair to console like performance. If you have a desktop PC it should run prefectly fine. I'm not too quite sure the game wouldn't run on my laptop 60fps at med or low settings. Let's hope it gets better in later months.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you know what to expect from battle royal style games then this game is probably the best in category right now. More realistic than King of the Kill in terms of gun handling and driving (which may be better or worse depending on your tastes). Anyway grab 3 friends and play together.

2017-11-26,0,0,382,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG has it's share of problems but it's still an enjoyable game. Best enjoyed with friends but the solo mode is still fun. There are issues with hackers but I've only had one or two incidents where it was obvious someone was using hacks. Game isn't optimized the best so potato computers need not apply. Decent headphones are a must as sound is a big aspect of the game. Games still pretty buggy so if you're the type to take these games really competatively perhaps you should wait till the full release.*EDIT*So release has come and gone and then some but the game still has too many problems. I really want to say I like this game but there are just too many better alternatives coming out these days.

2018-03-15,0,0,1589,False,Not Recommended,With Erangel being the first and the only map for quite some time it felt that PUBG had a lot of inspiration from games like Stalker survival in an atmospheric post nuclear world. Once the developers realized they've hit a goldmine everything that is done further on is shameless milking of the money cow. New maps and skins are primarily done to satisfy narcissism and contribute to a mindless shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,236,True,Recommended,The only negative things I have noticed about this game so far are the ocassional glitch causing you to get stuck in walls and what not the game occasionally crashing while trying to load in and it could use more maps. Other than those 3 things (all of which are in work I believe) I don't know why this is still in early access. It feels polished and extremely satisfying to get a kill. The guns that are overpowered are rare and are so risky to get that it is extremely rare to see one. The intensity of 1v1 engagements all while being terrified that some one is going to sneak up on you and get you while you are distracted is one of the most exillerating video game experiences I have every had. Even running through an open field can be a terrifying endevour! I can not recommend this game enough especially to veteran Arma players. It takes all the good about Arma and strips away much of the complexity and makes the whole thing much more fast paced and fun while still requiring tactics planning and thinking on the fly. 9/10 would play way to much and ruin personal relationships.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-07,0,0,607,True,Recommended,This is a good game the games are intresting and last a long time. Its addicting and I love it. There is only one problem the Graphics and the Audio. The graphics settings are unfair so I have to play with Low shadows and in Duo the spectator (Usually helps his teamate) can see through walls and buildings for a few seconds. This can be used to cheat. The audio has bad issues to. For example just a while ago I was playing I hear my footsteps the doors I open and even my gunshots and enemy gunshots but no matter what I change I cant hear the enemy footsteps or doors. so I was playing I got good gear and I close my doors behind me. I turn around to open another door and I am dead by a guy with a shotgun who opened a door silently and he had no footsteps. Still Early Access but c'mon this game needs functionality before adding more weapons. And you cant adjust the volume of voices in Duo or Squad but you can lower the whole game sound down too for some reason.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

We all know that it is hard to fully optimalize game that's 8x8km large full of loots houses vehicles but guuys what the hell? PUBG is almost 2 years old and still nothing? I would say they are trying their best right? Recent updates showed us how they mean it with the game. New map? Yeah we love it. New skins? Alright CS GOs doing the same and it works. Event pass which is the exact copy of Fortnites Battle pass? Wooaah this hit me really hard to me it looks like they are done with the game acquired everything they could from sells and gave us another alternative how to spend another 10 euros. What will be next? Dance moves? I always liked about PUBG how it tries to be realistic (even though it is clearly an arcade) thats why I prefer PUBG over Fortnite. But with this attitude I hope they will lose all the players to finally set the right priorities. Until then I cannot recommend it not even for half a price.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,202,True,Recommended,About Pubg I have about 150 hours In this game so far and I can say that its the best looking playing and working game you'll find on Early Access this game blows its competitors out of the water being H1Z1 which pu helped work on but this game is very polished for it being in the state its in the team really focuses on optimization and gameplay over graphics they listen to their community about what they want to see out of the game and that alone is a feat. What would i like to see been added to the game So far the games comes with many features i really like but here some things i would love to see being added. Locked 1st person mode Higher Variety clothes and pioneer crates More maps Bigger maps More items binoculairs for example Final Verdict Overall this game is a solid fight to the death sorta deal with a lot more potential in the upcoming updates has a great replay value intense PvP the perfect example of a love/hate relationship and you can find yourself easily getting sucked in and playing countless hours before really noticing this game is on my Highly Recommend List because it is very solid game and has a great team behind it and the hype train will not die on this game as long as they keep the good updates and finding ways to change it up then they will never see a drop in players and for those of you waiting for it to go on Sale good luck the team needs all the money they can get due to company size so that being said the current price tag is way more than worth it for all that you're getting.Highly Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-08,0,0,150,True,Recommended,I didn't have high expectations for this game but I can say that I am very pleased with this purchase. I haven't played another game in this genre like H1Z1 so I can't really compare it to other games like it. PUBG has a great pace to the game and can vary depending on your play style. I prefer to start off the game in less crowded areas so things start slow and get more intense as players are squeezed into a smaller and smaller part of the map. Other players opt for a high risk high reward play style by jumping into action from the very begining (big cities). Like most games this is more enjoyable played with friends but solo is enjoyable too. This is early an early access game so expect the occasional lag server issues and minor bugs but overall this game for me has been pretty smooth. I had lag issues when I first started but I tuned my graphics settings and ever since then it has run pretty good. I would highly reccomend this game and is one of my favorites.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I heard a few of my friends tell this game is great with a squad and its extremely fun. In my case this game is neither great to play with friends nor is it fun to enjoy in solo. The game is glitchy and extremely laggy the guns feel so terrible to use. The maps are so large I don't encounter any other players for 15 minutes and sometimes I land with 3 people we fight each other in close range with assult rifles shooting at each other at point blank and missing most of the shots fired at each other. Now they released a smaller map but they're charging another 10 dollars to play on it? That's extremely unreasonable. At first this game seemed to have such a vast amount promise however I would never recommend this game to any of my friends. I don't think I'll ever log back on this either. If your interested in playing a BR game right now I would recommend Fortnite. Its easy to play but difficult to master!

2017-08-01,0,0,1470,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE 23RD SEPT 2018Ignore the game. Game is now unplayable. Not only they made it for Esports when it is buggy as but the now the discord pages no longer support rooms for you to find players and play with.Completely disregarded what the community wanted year by year and now 90% of skins you can purchase are only by real money.RIP Pubg you were amazing in 2017 hopefully other devs can learn from this failure. All my respect for Fortnite devs. At least they listen to their communityUPDATE 17TH APRIL 2018Do not get deceived by the popularity and the mass media propaganda. As fun as this game tends to be at times it's worse than H1Z1. Don't be surprised that people play Fortnite and that PUBG will eventually die.1st The game is still incredibly buggy. I just had a perfect run on a game and I died for changing lanes on a road and my bike flipped for no reason. Vehicles are a joke. There are still so many map glitches it's just stupid at this point. You can go under soil vault through walls and much more.2nd Not even CS Source was this laggy back on dial internet. The servers are extremely laggy desync is everywhere. I've had recently an encounter where (in the end I killed the guy) I ducked 2 or 3 times in front of a wall after doing so I got myself headshotted 3 times. I was lucky enough to kill the guy as I had a clear shot and he wasn't kiting.3rd RNG is absolute Don't bother with the first map people leave it cause there are too few places to find a decent weapon like scar or m416. While they ruined the first map in total they made the desert one unfair to the point you just want to uninstall as in go and loot 5 blocks with 10 floors and find the same gear you'd find in 2 ruins. Why ruins what's the point?4th Community is toxic af. Hackers all over the place. We have been asking for almost a year to region lock china and they just don't give a fluck.5th C A M P I N G . This game will be like 90% camping. Because most don't know how to shoot. Example One guy in a game shot me with the scar while I didn't see him and only got me twice. Dude throws a molotov for distraction and for the next 5 god damn minutes was camping on a table near the door in the house he was. The zone gets to him and in the end I sniped him.Where's the fun in a buggy laggy game full of people that have no clue what fair play?UPDATE 23RD DECEMBER 2017As of now I am closing to 1k hours I can say the game is annoyingly fun. The game is still buggy as hell the vaulting system is acceptable but at the same time stupid af. As the key binding does jack It still activate when he wants and not when you do lol.The new map is gargantously huge loads of new content weapons all sort of new But still some things really ruin the game. 1. LAG. Seriously guys you are closing to 1 billion income and you still have this issue. GO TO ING NASA AND ASK FOR SERVERS JESUS.2. HACKERS ( mainly chinese ). Now.. I will have that will come and tell me I'm racist but even my chinese ex agrees that the chinese gamers are super salty bad annoying and cheatsie as hell. 3. REGION LOCK. We need this the most! Prevents the bloody hackers to flood the EU and NA servers and perhaps more people will speak goddamn english .By now the game I could say is recommended as the performance is waaaaaaaaaay better. But as a pioneer to this game I honestly prefer the older version. Good old times.. good old places... good old weapons... Now with the release you barely go to the normal map all I get is desert desert and ocassionaly a c y k a b l y a t. _____________________________________________________________________________Game is cool but only 1 map. Promised another one been 4 months and nothing. A lot of bugs can't spectate anymore problems with connection.. ... and they said in the next update will implement microtransactions for a 30$ game in EARLY ACCESS. Gabe needs to make these things illegal . Until the final product is out microtransactions must be left out. Very dissapointed to say the least.UPDATE 3RD AUGUST 2017 Game is EXTREMELY LAGGY. Never played a game this laggy in my life. 2 Patches ago I would've recommended the game in a heartbeat. Since they've added the latest patch there are severely fps drops and the lag is so annoying I've basically shot a guy with my target focused on him and he got no damage but the bullets went behind him on the door. If 2 days ago I was playing with 50 60 fps now it goes down even to 20 30 sometimes.KEEP IN MIND the developers are the creators of 3 or 4 MMORPGs one I've played called Tera Online which is a huge success and they still haven't updated the lag. The game at this stage is LITERALLY unplayable.Huge dissapointed. I really hope Steam apply some fees on this early access s with their microtransactions t. They made millions of the selling of the game and they couldn't make playable servers. off!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Definetely fun but the game isn't going anywhere and still has many problems. The devs are just too incompetent to actually keep content flowing out and it's very unbalanced and buggy right now. The worst part is that the devs over the course of the year will probably break the game even more and focus on adding new mictransactions instead of even the most minute bug fixes.

2017-10-11,0,0,311,False,Not Recommended,Look the game as a whole could use a bit of work that being said... it is a fun game. The main problem is the recent monitization of the game.In Game Currency Basically pointless only can be used to buy crates which are 80% of the time locked for which you will have to buy a 2.50 key with real money to unlock. The other 20% of the time its an unlocked crates which contains nothing good.Battle Pass System Finally introducted something to work towards in the game instead of randomly playing. To bad they have put it behind a pay wall. And even if you pay its only for a limited time and the rewards from completion the missions are pretty For a game that cost $30 you would expect most content to be able to be earnt. Not as soon as you enter please pay us more money to not look like a pleb or to give you something to work toward. I dont have a problem with micro transcations but within reason. If they want a player base that will keep coming back they need to have a reason more than just try and win. In my opintion they need to make battle passes free or AT LEAST can be bought with in game currency. I will keep playing this game infrequantly but if you want people to spend money on a game its better to make them WANT TO not FORCE THEM TO.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-06,0,0,188,True,Recommended,Playeruknown's Battlegrounds is a good game After 100 hours playing this game i feel like i can finaly write a balanced reveiw for it.Currently this is one of the best games in my library and i spend most evenings playing with my friends. The game is well balanced fast paced and an overall enjoyable experience. okay sure sometimes youll land and instantly get shotgunned by someone who was quicker than you and occaisonally the buggy physics will flip your car off the tiniest bit of god damn leaf left on the road. But theres nothing quite like the feeling of seeing the glorious Winner Winner Chicken Dinner screen as you put a bullet between your last opponents eyes. PROS Dont be dissuaded byt the early access label of the game its still more complete than a lot of tripple A games that have been released. Theres no icrotransactions for cosmetics or pay to win items. the game is balanced and thats how the devs like it (however you can trade and sell cosmetics on the steam market but theyr literally a few pennies so i cant complain) if youve ever wanted to kill someone with a frying pan after they have wasted all their bullets on you then heres your game You can play with friends and they are supposedly releasing custom private servers and modding support for the game after its out of early access. CONS Sometimes hit reg with shotungs and rifles can screw you over but they are working on the servers and optimisation. Loot spwans can be very tempramental meaning sometimes ill walk into the first room of a building in some backwater little village and ill get lvl3 armor a sniper and an assualt rifle as well as healing. and other times you will land in a hi pop hi loot area and get a pistol and some new trousers for when you yourself because a team of guys with full armor and Aks walk round the corner You cant always guarantee a fair fight. All the guns can be used to the end game they all have their uses but sometime you will get outgunned purely because you have an smg against a rifle and if the loot spawns are bad theres not a lot you can do about it. Finally Playerunknown's is a fun game that with the state its in and the promised new content releasing soon is more than worth the asking price. i would reccomend getting it now just in case the prices go up after release. iIf you enjoy killing people for no reason other than the great circle of death told me to then heres your game. and hopefully ill see you lying face down in the dirst so i can take your stuff at some point ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I run high settings yes but I've lowered them and got similar results. 60FPS a good chunk of the time. Wanna open inventory? FPS drop to like 20. Wanna aim? 20. Got shot once? 20.

2018-06-12,0,0,48,False,Recommended,The variety PUBG offers compared to other battle royal games is simply unmatched. I've been a long time fan of the game and after trying many other similar games I can confidently say that this is the best out as of late. It's simply more polished. the only downfall is that you'll need a PC that can handle it. Downloading it on your average run of the mill laptop will not result in a good or worth while gaming experience. If you plan on building a PC I would base its specs around this game as playing it with the highest settings is probably the best experience one could get,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,791,True,Recommended,After having played this game for a few hundred hours I'm not going to lie there are a ton of bugs and problems with the game but at the same time it's a fantastic experience.The concept of a battle royale game have been around for along time the first iterations starting as simple mods for FPS's Arma 3's Battle Royale really kicked off the genre with the general public and H1Z1's attempt was also a hit but one is a mod and the 2nd makes Call of Duty look like the best game ever. While PUBG still has bugs and issues H1Z1 after Years of development still suffers from a lot of the same problems it did day 1 and it truly seems the development team's focus has been shifted from fixing the bugs and making it a fantastic game and more towards content and milking money from players.Unlike it's predicesors Playerunkown's Battlegrounds is one of the first games developed around and solely for battle royale. It's development is purposed around bettering the players experience in the one and only gamemode and it truly seems the developers are working hard to smash the bugs that currently plague the game and bettering the playing experience to the best of their ability. Yes this is still an early access title yes it's buggy yes you can die by the problems currently in the game but despite the issues i've experienced in the nearly 200 hours i've played this game gives me an adrenaline rush like no other game can. Every single round the thrill of the fight is a fantastic feeling and once you get up to the top 10 and the play circle is only a few hundred meters across you can feel your pulse starting to spike. It's like the thrill you get from a good horror game but every single round you get that rush.Is this game perfect? Hell no. Is it worth the $ in it's current form? Absolutely. The devs have already ironed out a lot of bugs and they continue to do so patch after patch the game is already in a great state and it can only get better. If you've been looking for a game to get you back in the FPS genre and a game that truly keeps you on the edge of your seat you will love Playerunkown's Battlegrounds,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,2482,True,Recommended,Pros Generally a fun game if you're into PvP survival. No microtransactions. (yet) Cases are earned in game with in game points earned by playing. Reward can be sold on the Steam Marketplace. Really large map (larger than The Elder Scrolls Oblivion's world). 100 players per game including game modes of Duo (teams of 2) and Squad (teams of 3 4). Realistic gunplay (bullet drop winds penatration etc)Cons Difficult for new players to Battle Royal. The servers are not 100% optimized which leads to crashes freezes and lag. There isn't a huge selection of weapons or items Duo and Squad are A LOT harder than solo. Players with lower end rigs have an advantage with the very low settings.

The way you treat your playerbase should actually be considered a crime.First of all you expect players to buy your game for 30 euro's I paid 30 euro's for your game for one map and tons of bugs I played the first 4 months not being able to render in my buildings for about 30 seconds after I landed. But I kept playing until eventually I had to buy more ram I had 8 even though your minimum requirements CLEARLY stated you only need 6GB of ram to play the game which is FALSE you CAN'T decently play the game.Anyway aside from you guys asking 30 euro's for a busted and broken game even after selling your game to millions of people you give the game a reward system that basicly FORCES players to buy ing keys for 2.50 to open a goddamn CRATE that they spend their EARNED points on? AND make it RANDOM?It's ABSURD you guys are so ing deep up your own that you can't even ing think straight.I'm actually really glad PUBG is going to die soon because you guys deserve to go bankrupt and I hope it happens from the deepest bottom of my heart. Not because the game is bad because it had potential no I just plainly want PUBG to fail because of you incompetent s at BLUEHOLE company.Enjoy your loss in yet another player s.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-16,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,Pre release last year PlayerUnknown expressed his positive throughts by replying to questions on modding he noted that he is keen on modding and said he would endorse it in his own game and could result in finding a new PlayerUnknown . Current day post 1.0 release. No modding as any mods made could result in a ban.Earlier on last year the PUBG team stated that they were certainly not going to add microtransactions pre full release. Not long after the option to buy keys and crates was added to the game while still in early access.The dev team also believe that they own the right to a genre of game that being Battle Royale. This was reflected in their action of threatening legal action against the developers of fortnight as fortnight added a free battle royale mode into their game. The similarities consist of Lobbies start out with players grouped together. You jump out of a vehicle above the destination you want to go to. A zone pushes players tohether on the map.That s where they end. Let s face it the developers of this game turned from approachable nice people into a group of scummy corporate asshats when their game was met with massive success.Overall the game is solid however far from esports ready . It is a fairly enjoyable experience as long as you are playing with friends. The major downside lies not in the game but in the developers of it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-24,0,0,950,False,Not Recommended,EDIT I am removing my old review and posting this instead F*** PUBG and BLUEHOLE. This is absolute trash. They region locked China and it was phenomenal for the last 3 months. Getting into a game was great. I could speak and communicate with my team. It made the game meaningful and exciting with call outs and social aspects were great.Now with this update from 7/4 or somewhere around there Bluehole have opened the floodgates to this sh*t once again. I can't get into a game with anyone that speaks English. This was the biggest deterrance to the game for millions of US players and they fixed it. WHY F*** IT UP AGAIN? Incompetance and greed. F***. YOU. BLUEHOLE. Now we not only have Chinese hackers and communication barriers but Chinese ADS running at top volume the entire match! F*** YOU BLUEHOLE.I have to back out of 8 10 games before I find a team that speaks English (usually only one player the rest are asian.) I just got into a game after my 5th attempt with two english players and one Asian. We loot for 5 minutes at Camp Alpha. Asian team knocks a teammate. I go to revive and he hits me with a Kar98 and then our other teammate. This unacceptable and completely unecessary move by Bluehole is going to be their downfall. I am done with this game because its impossible to actually enjoy it anymore. I stopped playing before because of these issues and they finally fixed it. Now we are back to the stone ages and they could care less. Go buy Realm Royale or fortnite if you wish. F***this game and F*** Bluehole.Also you dont get sh*t out of the crates you can open for free. I have like 100 crates sitting in my inventory because you have to pay $2.50 to open EACH ONE. In case I havent said it yet.....F*** YOU BLUEHOLE AND F*** YOU PUBG!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm also a father of five and work a full time job but this is the only game that I have continued to play every chance I can. Everything about the game just makes you want to come back for more. I have never had that experience where I said just one more and haven't followed through. I am not be any means great at this game and the learning and experience from each game pushes that limit of one more to another level. Constantly being on your toes even when you think you have dropped in a location alone is insane. The loot phase is by far one of my favorite parts of the game. Hoping that next room has a close range vector and a extended mag nearby or seeing that Kar98 and getting excited that you might have an increased chance of winning. All this is just the beginning. You finally make your way to a popular loot spot or see guys running across an open field opens all your receptors into overdrive. Contemplating the best way of engagement. You finally decide to strike or make your move and your adrinaline begins to pump. This is what happens every game. I have become immersed in a way no other game has done. The game is still early access but looks far from it. Sure you have some server issues every now and again and funny glitches that make you laugh but overall you are constantly hooked. The map and locations are beautiful and the reward boxes you claim with your battle points are amazing in the fact you use in game currency to buy them. No need to for out 20 bucks for crates that do nothing but change your appearance. The dev team is also another reason to buy this game. They listen to feedback from everyone and want to make this the best battle royale game known to man. If this style of game is what you want then this is the game you need to get. Buy it and join the hundreds of thousands that say ""just one more"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,601,True,Recommended,222 hours ingame so what about doing a review?I bought this game right at the start. I actually wanted to buy H1Z1 although it received heavy criticism because the developers stopped to work on the game and ignored many problems like bugs and hackers.So when I was about to buy H1Z1 I heard that there is this new game coming out and that the developers were putting really much work into it. I changed my mind and bought this game without even watching gameplay videos or screenshots.The game started sloppy and had many bugs performance problems and even a few hackers.But now that it's out for a few months it improved in many ways the performance is good right now the graphics are somewhat nice and even hackers are getting dumped. At the beginning the developers brought many patches in no time to face really annoying bugs and worked really hard.Now the patches are getting realeased rarely but they do bring a lot of content and fix many issues at once. Furthermore they contain lots of new stuff (weapons). This game is at a very good point. I totally recommend buying PUBG since the performance is great now and it outclasses H1Z1s in every way. So if you're looking for a King of the Hill based game this game is your game of choice. Enjoy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They wasted time and money on new maps that we didnt want instead of fixing bugs and problems that needed to be fixed. There were hacker infestations that they admitted were almost all from China but when we asked for region locking they called us xenophobes. When requested map selection they had it for about two months then practicly removed it. They sued Fortnite for copying an idea from a movie that they also copied. They then added the event pass.

This is definitely not my style however all the talk around it made me jump in and I dont regret it!You will find the usual issues with a Early Access game its not yet optimised and you will find some lag bugs and performance drop however the gameplay even at this stage makes me overlook that. Very smooth character control the guns feel good and different the environment is great for this style of game. The intensity is great you are always on the look out and listening for anyone and the sense of accoplishment is fantastic that even though I never win just going far or getting out of a difficult situation makes me feel good.

2017-08-10,0,0,132,False,Not Recommended,"This game was pretty good but sadly it has been plagued with a pretty heavy amount of hackers. It's currently still a problem and looks like it will be for awhile. The devs have been cracking down on the creators of cheats but the issue is still there.Aside from the hackers though this game still has a high amount of bugs and operating issues that are inexcusable for a full release. Things that should have been fully ironed out in alpha/beta are still plaguing the game. Textures fail to load aiming down sites still gets caught on invisible walls when peaking rails models don't match there collision boxes.It's a lot of things that really disturb the integrity of the overall experience. On top of that there are supersized updates almost every other day for seemingly no reason. The game remains the same for the most part but every couple of days a 4GB+ sized patch needs downloading. This may not be an issue for everyone but for those like myself who are on a slow connection the game is never ready when you are. Then there's the new ""Event Pass"" which is a terrible value and ultimately a farcry from competitors offers. I used to laugh when people compared this game to Fortnite as I was somewhat of a PUBG purest. But when this game started getting hit with the hackers etc I gave Fortnite another chance. Since then Fortnite has done nothing but get better while this remains stagnant or gets worse.The gunplay and realism of physics etc in this game is still something that is very enjoyable but ultimately I can't recommend it over Fortnite to be honest. Save your money and play something else. If you want a BR game Fortnite is your best option.*OLD REVIEW* (Alpha Build)*******The paid content is for a special event!********The amount of people leaving negative reviews simply because the dev has keyed (payed) boxes that are for a special event and internal testing is absurd. The paid content is to support a tournament that is going on during Gamescon as well as to iron out any issues that might be present upon full release. On top of this they also released a whole bunch of free content that doesn't require a purchase to unlock at the same time. You can choose to get a pay for unlock or free unlock crate and if you choose to can completely ignore the pay for items.As for the game itself it has it's issues many of which have plans to be fixed in the near future. Overall though the game is very fun and gets most of the entertainment from the uncertainty of other players. There's no base building nor resource gathering. This is purely a ""last man standing"" game where you find weapons and healing items. My biggest complaint would be the server speeds. They have a noticeable amount of lag resulting in behind cover shots and all around strange timing instances. That being said I enjoy it but just think people shouldn't expect rust or other games style of play. You work on mastering a few variables to focus on a singular goal. There are plans for more game modes but I can't comment on those as they7 aren't even in the PTR yet.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-24,0,0,571,False,Not Recommended,I've only been playing this for a couple hours so far but I'm already loving it. The audio is fantastic if you have a good headset. I really hope the devs keep going with this one and keep adding content and expanding on this game. The concept is great hunger games style survival. Keeps your blood pumping and keeps you on your toes. My only suggestion to add the ability to press an action button to say jump a fence or climb a ladder. I'll probably be following along with this game for hours/days of more gameplay to come! Thanks Devs keep it up and don't let it flop like the DayZ guys did!Edit After putting hundreds of hours in it I can honestly say the devs are more concerned about their pocket books in the short run then they are at actually dealing with the toxic playerbase they now have. I don't mean toxic as in foul mouthed or mean or anything that stuff is all fair play. Their refusal to anything substantial to limit hinder or obstruct hackers in this game is rediculous. I say they are worried about their pocket books because they do nothing more than ban the player name. The play can still buy back into the game under a different name/account. That's not enough! It only pads their pocket books. Ping limit Make it so that ranked matches set players with other players of a particular ping range. It's not that difficult to code that in. If players wanna cheat they can cheat in their own region. That would solve most of the problem for everyone outside of China. Institute holds on BP If you get reported for something. If you're legit and moderators find nothing illigitiment you'll get your BP if it's not legit you wont be able to continually make more money in the market than it costs to buy back into the game. This would ultimately make it fiscally impossible to hack and make more money to buy back into the game. Like I tell everyone. I love this game. The content is excellent but the way that they handle their hacker playerbase is unacceptable and makes the game unplayable. At it's current state I can no longer recommend playing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you finally see her again you realize quickly that she's nothing more than a cheap wh*re these days selling herself for cheap tricks. You think ""hey I get it... girl's gotta eat..."" but then when you think about going down that rabbit hole again you quickly realize its a gaping stargate of a hole down there having been plowed by God knows who.

2018-07-16,0,0,458,False,Recommended,"I got this game after quitting CS GO and started off immediately in First Person. Since then it has been fun to play even alone. What I have noticed is that 99% of the hackers play on the Third Person servers and not the First Person ones with the exception of 2 times out of 300. So if you want legitimite fun then play on the first person servers rather than Third Person. In regards to skins I couldn't care less. If you want them then go ahead don't denounce Bluehole for giving out skins when they are following what Valve did with their games. In terms of optimization and bugs look at skyrim and its bugs absolutely horrid. But when you don't even own the engine the game is built on then it's hard to ""optimize"" it.

2017-07-13,0,0,25,True,Recommended,This game is alot of fun but it has some drawbacks. Most of the time when I play with friends we run around and gather up a bunch of supplies and its almost more of a survival horror than an fps but its still alot of fun. Solo play and duo play are a similar experience. The problem in this game is honestly the shooting portion which I'm sure a bunch of people will just call me a noob and move on but its pretty frustrating at the moment. The bulk of its problems can most likely be attributed to being an early access game but its still frustrating to stand 6 feet from a guy and shiit him with a shotgun because he doesn't know your there and somehow it misses and then the next game you try the same shot from five times the distance and it hits. It's a lack of consistency that is honestly annoying. They'll probably smooth it out over time but its kinda iffy right now.Overall this is a damn good game the shooting mechanics will improve but it's fun even with kinda wonky mechanics.

They got the game faster done than H1Z1 could've dreamt of. The game is very fun to play and with some training and BattleRoyale experience you will find your way very fast into the game. I can only say that the developers should keep there momentum to release new updates and I seriously think that this game makes it out ouf Alpha way quicker than H1Z1 does. I will give it a solid 9/10 because it feels a bit like it still needs some improvements and atm i cant perdict how it is gonna be in the future. I would definetly recommend it to everyone.

2017-04-20,0,0,237,True,Recommended,While it leaves much to be desired when it comes to graphics and maintaining a steady frame rate. I can say this is a great game. The only game I have played that I can compare to this is DayZ and I can honestly say this is miles better. The gearing isn't tedious the action is fairly constant and is a lot of fun to play with friends. There's room for multiple game styles whether it be hiding in the buildings using the terrain to flank enemies or going crazy and shooting everyone on sight you can find something to fit your play style. The gear UI is easy to use and aiming is fairly easy. Only bad thing I would say about this game is the server lag can sometimes be an issue opening doors or getting into cars can be unrepsonsive and requires multiple presses of the interact key. And of course there's the graphics and FPS issues that I already mentioned. However the positives far outweigh the negatives in my opinion. 8/10 in my opinion.

2017-04-20,0,0,89,True,Recommended,Its a really fun game good graphics physics and more but the caracter customization to me is too small and there is not a good range of weapons or vehicles. At least add a motorcycle or something. I get that this game is Early Alpha but you need to add more things. For example Different crates buyable clothing keeping the clothing that you end with at the end of a game putting more cars on the map not forcing the parachute to deploy untill you're really close to the ground let us spawn with at least a pistol so we on't get melee'd to death the second we land and a wider range of game types. I would rather do a 50 player game than 100 people. Too many people jump out of the plane at the same time as you or people get things WAY before you and kill you while you parachute. I still recommend this game but there are a lot of flaws that need to be fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-14,0,0,36,True,Recommended,"Here's the thing...I don't like shooters. Not to say that they aren't any fun but I've never seen the purpose. With this game its a little more clear cut which really helps people like me who don't find the value in it. With this game there's only one option shoot or be shot. The reason? To be the last man standing. For me that's way more engaging then just shooting everyone. I love how focused this game is on what its trying to do. It's not focused on weapon classes or maps although those are pretty important parts. This game puts all its effort into the gunplay and battle royal style action which is much more enticing than other shooters. This is one of those games you could play for hours without even realizing it. Its addicting in its unconventional approach. This is also why I love the shooter ""Overwatch"" because there's a little more meat than just the shooting. Of course there's the gunplay but there's characters a ""narrative"" special attacks and many modes. It doesn't even need a single player! Just like this game doesn't need a single player. Now let's get into the stuff that I don't like. Keep in mind that this is early access so things are likely to change but this is just what I don't like at the moment. Although the gameplay is fun and exciting it can get a little boring if you play it for hours on end. Even just the addition of a new mode will keep things fresh. Also I hope that you can make custom servers so you can get a group of friends together to play a match just with them. And of course new maps and weapons would be cool but that's not extremely important to me. In the end this game is the groundwork of something I think will grow to be a ridiculously fun and fresh shooter in a time where most shooters are dull. Yeah there's a few kinks that need to be sorted but if it can turn over a Nintendo fan ike me to play a shooter I think it can continue to wow me in the future.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,131,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale done right. The gameplay is solid everything is straight forward for the most part. There's obvious optimization issues but it's early access and an indie game so I can't bash it for that too much. Other than that the game looks great it's updated decently frequently and issues are addressed and fixed in the patches. I've clocked a lot of hours in this game already and I practically just bought it a few days ago. Lots of fun with friends lots of fun by yourself custom servers (which I feel aren't utilized as much but that's the player base not the game itself) not much more you can ask for. My only complaint is that the matches are very quick but at the same time I do enjoy the quick matches. It'd be nice to play a longer match where you didn't have the playzone wall chasing you down if you don't get to the middle right away.Excited to see where the game is going8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-18,0,0,346,True,Recommended,"Very few bugs but the gameplay itself is fairly clunky. DPS is strange at times hingeing on bizarre. Multiple burst shots from an M16 deal little damage but a single shot from a revolver can put you down at times. The third person camera needs some extreme work. Needs ability to change general 3rd person camera side position much like you can when you zoom in and by tapping the lean buttons. Bullet hit boxes are unreliable or the objects themselves have a 50% larger hitbox than the object actually shows. (A 3"" light pole extends on either side .75"" and a headshot suddenly does no damage and gives away your position.) Aiming in third person around walls is also difficult a red marker appears when the game detects when you're about to shoot the wall in front of you instead of around the wall but 9 times out of 10 even if there is no red marker you still hit the wall and once again give away your position which still refers back to better hit boxes for objects (especially walls and fences). Minor fixes such as make parachuting seperate from vehicle controls so you can set vehicles to arrows and still be able to free fall with WASD. There's a few other things I'm sure I forgot to whine about but none the less though as much as this game has its issues I'm sure they'll be resolved or at least managed to an acceptable level and I have had nothing but fun in this game and highly recommend it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,595,False,Not Recommended,STRONG LANGAGE Ok so that's it. I've hoped for more than a year that this game fixes the most basic issues a game can have but now I'm done. After more than 1 billion dollar in revenue more than a year of development AND the 'official release' of an obvious eternal early access game the devs still don't know where they are going with this game. I have more than 500 hours of gameplay and each time I reconnect features are just randomly shuffled and not for the best. They are just constantly modifying the experience never improving and luckily never degrading introducing new bugs and retard features. The only constant in their mind is obviously 'How do we get more money in that game?' Cars and motorcycles get stuck in the most place.Objects fences random holes in the grass All the ramps are at mid waist level apparently exactly where you would aim to shoot someone... and you can basically empty a whole AKR magazine on a small wooden staircase ramp with no effect whatsoever. Your avatar can literally get stuck IN the walls between objects with no chances to get out except hoping your teammates shoots you so you can crawl out of it. People lagging are just desynced with you often giving them an advantage as you often think ''Did that guy just shoot me through a wall''? Loot is you can loot 8 building finding nothing but 8 backpacks and 15 pistols and then stumble on a spot with 2 ARs and 200 bullets There is now 9 different kind of loot boxes all giving you about no chance to get anything but garbage driving prices for interesting loot at heights. Making this whole loot thing a thriving experience for compulsive gamblers.Most games literally gets down to either jump where there is no one or jump where there is people and hope the door you took have something behind it just before you get shot behind the head by the guy who found an AR.Now I know that some of it gets down to gameplay and although I could have handled it if they just didn't try to make it less random I just can't believe that a company that has made more than a billion on the back of their players can't manage to fix basic collision bugs unless they really don't give a about the gameplay itself. It was funny the first 3 months now I'm just wondering why no one gets fired for purposely trying to sabotage the game...Don't buy it hoping it will be fixed someday. It won't. Buy it if you want to gamble on loot boxes like crazy that's basically the only thing they nailed this game is for you.Word of advice for the devs JUST STOP TRYING TO INTRODUCE NEW FEATURES YOU OBVIOUSLY CAN'T DO IT. JUST FIX THE ING GAME. IT S TIME TO END IT AT SOME POINT GODDAMNIT. I MEAN CAN YOU PLEASE JUST DO A FUNCTIONAL LOBBY. JUST THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH APPRECIATED.

I don't think the lag problem will last for more then a few days. As for people complaining about microtrans the items purchasable are purely cosmetic and the Dev's have said the reasoning for this is 1.Test Microtrans2. Fund the upcoming tournament 3.Prize money for tournament4.Donate to charity. Other then that the devs are very responsive and listen to the community. There is no advantage to microtrans nor is there any forced purchase. Microtans are also only going on for a month.

2017-08-04,0,0,55,True,Recommended,I understand people are upset that PlayerUnknown broke a promise about micro transactions not being implemented in early access but I've got to say that it doesn't change my opinion of the game personally. The game itself is brilliant and brings me back to my DayZ days only much faster paced due to the contracting circles of death. The fact that it's in early access is just gravy because the level of polish is broadly speaking very good and I can only imagine how much better it's going to get. Also the devs are consistently updating and communicating with the players so yay.Personally cosmetic micro transactions that are obtained through RNG don't bother me because they're optional. I'm also not bothered by the fact that PlayerUnknown went ahead with this despite saying he wouldn't he's not making any money off this initial test of the micro transaction system all proceeds fund a tournament.So... yeah.

2017-08-04,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,"This game CAN be great however especially for those of us on the oceania servers it is ruined by players in china. Luckily this should be an easy fix for a company that ISN'T a cesspool of greed. Not to mention this isn't a racial issue contrary to Brendan Greene's lies it's rather a question of three main issues. These include ping communication and cheating. Firstly with ping it's pretty obvious for a knee jerk reaction fps game why it absolutely has to be low. It's not exactly fair to be hitting targets only for the damage to not register due to lag or even worse to be shot by a dead player. Players from china are the main reason this occurs as they are connecting to servers waaaay outside of their region causing of course huge lag. Secondly communication. In the team based gamemodes communication is vital to success which is why it can be upsetting when teammates you were matched with can't even speak the same language. Although normally this wouldn't be an issue in shard based ""ultima online"" styled servers this is. To put it in to simpler terms you would expect someone to speak spanish in a server purely for spain correct? Well this is where the importance of the region lock and the chinese come in to play. You can pick any server which in of itself isn't much of a problem when people understand that picking european servers when you live on the west coast of the USA is a terrible idea as mentioned with the lag point. Since the chinese servers are ""bad"" they go to the other servers that don't speak chinese bringing up the communication problem. Lastly Not even Brendon Greene can deny the indisputable fact that 99% percent of all hacks in pubg orignate from china. You heard me 99% 99% of all ing hacks for pubg come from china. This is a dramatic amount considering the chinese playerbase isn't 99% of the playerbase. This with the combined effects of ping and communication has just absolutely poisened the game beyond the point or redeemability.Everything I said sounds so grim right? Luckily as I said before it's actually a pretty easy fix. Region locking is the only way to fully fix this issue. This is the only way to actually make pubg playable for westerns and Chinese alike. As since everyone in the Chinese servers has such powerful grip on Brendan's wallet if they lobby him hard enough to fix their servers he'll probably do it. They are his main source of income after all. However Brendan hasn't done this and he likely never will. Instead he has taken the easy way out by labelling critics of this problem (like me and many others) as racists. A copout tactic so lazy it's insulting but it's deliberately lazy. Brendan Greene doesn't give a flying about the western community we've already paid for pubg and not many of us are buying lootcrates he already took our money. The chinese community on the other hand is sucking Green's like there's no tommorow the amount of money they spend on crates and keys (cosmetics) is astounding and has become Green's income as less and less people buy the game and more and more leave negative reviews. Oh well pubg was fun while it lasted. Oh and Brendan if you're ever watching this just know I've always backed you since your early modding days it sucks to see how easily you threw people like me away the people who made you who you are.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-27,0,0,60,False,Recommended,"The premise of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is similar to the hunger games. You parachute in from a plane before scavenging for supplies while constantly being pushed to a smaller and smaller zone by an incomming ""storm"". Game focuses on making things like map and weapons realistic unlike some other very *similar* game. While the graphics of this game are amazing I believe that many of the players don't get to experience it because of the crappy performance this game provides. While it will still run on medium specs pcs it a no for lower specs pcs beacuse this game bottlenecks literally everything. It's a multiplayer game with no story that gives you the freedom to approach your problem how you want or to solve an incomming problem that is comming straight at you. Only until recently there havent been any dlcs or a ranking system to this game. With that situation in the past it's weird how people stayed loyal and kept coming back to this game. Now there is a season pass available for purchase which gives you a ranking system and a way to unlock cosmetics. Free users get a change to unlock *SOME* of these rewards on *CERTAIN* levels of the pass with a great slowdown in progress of levels. Gameplay wise you get an option to choose between first person mode or perhaps a third person mode in which first person mode is still available. Gameplay includes standard long range fights or perhaps if you prefer something mid range or close range that is available as well. Game utilises the usage of vehicles to get around its huge and detailed map. All in all if you can ignore the problems of this game like some bugs and a medium amount of cheaters the game at the current price is worth also it's worth mentioning that the event pass is not expensive and it is easily affordable.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-17,0,0,483,False,Not Recommended,"Alright here it is. I don't recommend this game (Mostly continue for tl dr). This game is an excellent proof of concept at least until someone puts a copy of it on the Frostbite engine and kills it. The cons list for this game are crippling and if there was any game with a sizable player base and similar flavour the cons list would be a eulogy.1. Loot Crates. You have to play games in earn in game currency BP which is then spent on a random crate. Half the crates require keys that require you to spend money. Remember when Overwatch came out and people were mad but the saving grace was you could just earn crates? Only half true in PUBG. I have like 40 crates I can't open and didn't want. It's very very... brazen. Brazen profiteering. 2. Developers. Let's be real this game isn't well made. It's full of assets that are bought it's horribly optimized extremely buggy feels sluggish to play and has major features (like kill cams) that are broken to the point of being useless. 3. Lack of region locking. It's insane that it takes me 6 8 load ins to get a lobby of 3 other english speakers on the NA servers. 4. Rampant RNG. The ""Red Zone"" has been hated since it was added by an extremely vocal majority and is still in the game. The circle spawns are bad enough (but on their own fine often adding to the urgency and reward of games) but the random Red Zones are just annoying add no real counterplay/mechanics interacton and actively seperate the player from the core gameplay loop. 5. The Loot system. It's extremely hit or miss and often spawns multiple 2 4 copies of a weapon in a single building. This also happens with grips scopes and meds. There has to be a way to make loot more uniform (not more common) so you don't get games where a 4 man squad can loot all of Prison on Mirinmar get no scopes no meds and literally 15+ grips. Other games on the same patch a squad can leave Prison with multiple level 3 vests too many meds and utilities to carry fully modded weapons of each players preference and 200+ rounds for said weapons. Areas that big should have some form of bad luck prevention to make loot more uniform. Buildings of a minimum size (especially in places like Los Leones) should always have at least 1 weapon and the 'God Buildings' shouldn't be the only consistent places to land. 6. Slow pace of content. This ties into the Loot crate and Developers issues but is also a unique problem. A year in and the vast majority of the content added to this game is content to support the loot crates. Lack of a shooting range area so players can warm up or new players can get acquainted with the gun play. I still leave the SLR and Mk14 where I find them if it's late into a game because I use them so rarely that I'd rather have a weapon like the Mini M416 or SKS that I use often and can rely on to win a game with. Seriously instead of a parachute skin for $5+ why not spend a few hours making the Shooting Range on Erangel an actual testing area? It's already a shooting range for christ's sake. In summary this game is an excellent sales pitch to Activision and Dice and prove that players want a down to earth gritty Battle Royale game with complex gunplay cover and leaning systems and all the other core features of PUBG. I'm glad it exists.If you really are looking for that gameplay experience I'd buy the game. It's not $60+ it's got free content being added and it's generally working. I'd buy it because currently no one else offers a similar gameplay experience. But be warned this game will get ran over by anything resembling Bad Company 2 in the form of BR.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-12,0,0,607,False,Recommended,Look It's a good game. The game runs ok if you have a GPU from this gen or last (GTX 970 up) and theres enough content to have fun with. Worth the 30 bucks. However It's hard to get into if you aren't playing with friends. Thats where the fun really is. The games optimization is not where it should be and the servers are quite laggy but with the recent storm of updates they are clearly working quite hard (although possibly on the wrong things) and the game should be able to own up to It's hype soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-05-15,0,0,748,False,Not Recommended,"I actually love this game and want it to succeed so ing bad but i don't think it will based entirely on how terribly it's been handled in the last 6 months especially. Wait for a AAA dev to release a game similar that actually works and buy that instead. As it is PUBG is frustrating to play at best. At worst it's infuriating and makes you want to punch things.There are so many problems with this game that i don't know where to begin.Desync due to servers while not as bad as it used to be is still a huge problem. Server connections are unstable. 1 in 10 of my games i get ""Network connection error"" and i can't recconect to the game.Optimisation wise i run custom settings mostly on high/ultra with post processing and shadows on medium. I get about 90FPS 1080p from GTX1070 but only if i let the fans run at 80% allowing it to stay under 75degrees celcius. If i run the factory Asus ""gaming"" mode it will throttle and i barely get 65 70fps. This would have been fine 6 8 months ago while it was still an early access game but it's supposed to be a release now and with the volume of sales going through this lack of performance optimisation is not acceptable.Vehicle physics have been horridly unreliable since early access. Every now and then a bug will make a certain vehicle un usable for 3 weeks till they patch it (youtube the 3 wheeler motorcycle and you'll see what i mean). Loot spawn rates are . Probably half my deaths happen in the first 2 3 minutes of a match because i'll land and go through 3 buildings finding nothing but a shotugn or a pistol and the guy that landed in the building over the road got full lvl 2 armour and a decked out AK. ""We want PUBG to be an eSport"" well then this should never happen in a ""competive"" game. At least every 2nd large building should have an auto or semi auto firearm SKS mini UMP vector etc etc. Something that you can at least fight with at 20 meters.The blue zone changes they made a month ago where it would travel slower but be less time between zones was brilliant and needed minor tweaks to make it perfect... But because they rushed it to live servers and a few people complained they ing reverted it and now the mid game is STILL SLOW AND BORING.The gun play is actually fantastic... when you don't get bugs pulling you out of ADS and making the reticle on your sights dissapear.Map select means if you que for both maps (crazy that some people enjoy a bit of variety) you'll often get put into a mirramar lobby that just sits there as people join and leave for the next 30 minutes till the game starts with 50 people. ""It won't effect matchmaking times"" some at PUBG co probably.Updates are rushed through test server sometimes not having been tested for more than a couple of days. The communication from PUBG co to the community about exactly what their balance changes are to weapons doesn't exist. ""Slight vertical recoil reduction"" is stated but it's left to independant content creators (read WackyJacky) to figure out WTF that actually means from a gameplay perspective.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-05,0,0,953,True,Recommended,Played about 25 games so far. Was a little laggy at first while I messed with settings but after that so far so good. Fun gameplay basically always have a good chance at getting gear. Quick to learn if you read through all the settings and look up tips. Out of the 25 games i've played there was only 1 instance of cheaters using aimbot and headshot me randomly. He had a random name like glakej12sakj so no doubt a cheater.

2017-07-02,0,0,31,True,Recommended,I like this game It's got a great concept. It runs superb on my rig with everything turned on max settings. I am happy to see it's getting a lot more content Especially the zombie mode coming up (Which looks fun but I hope there is more to it than just running in open fields and shooting at zombies).Only gripes I have (More of a idea I hope they add but probably will not)When you die it would be nice to see who killed you? Like in CoD or BF. I think this is just a cool idea as well as possibly help with seeing if the person who killed you may have been cheating or something to that degree. Sometimes when I see people die that I'm watching or if I die it's a little questionable considering where I was standing.Boats I've had this happen and seen this happen to a few of my friends. When they are so close to the shore that they get stuck It would be cool to see some sort of action (or even an animation) to be able to put the boat back in the water even if it takes a little bit of time.Vehicles I haven't seen a vehicle NOT have any gas in it as soon as I get in it (That's just me personally) but I hope to see cars that don't have any just already in it Making it harder for people to move so far in such a short amount of time.That's just my 2 cents. I highly recommend this game to everyone It can be super fun but super aggravating that times too lol,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,159,True,Recommended,Pros Well made for an Early Access Game Fun Gameplay Lots of players Good Game in general Good matchmaking Abilty to play with friends really easilyCons Poorly optimized(If you have low RAM crashes often) Little to no variety in gameplay(Same map only 2 gamemodes which are just 3rd person and 1st person) Sometimes laggy which is caused by the servers Rewards from reward boxes are kinda lame(Just some clothes and gear which doesnt help in game)Overall This is a very fun game and by now you have probably seen gameplay or heard of it. The game is a bit pricey for what your getting. Sure its got good gameplay but its lacking content such as new maps or different gamemodes. So far there is only one map and the only gamemodes are chosing either 1st person or 3rd then decing on whether to play solo duo or squad which really doesn't add that much variety to the gameplay. Gamemodes might be hard to add though considering the whole idea of the game is based around a game mode but I hope the developers add more maps soon. At least one new map would be good especially for newer players like myself who find it hard to go against players who have a lot of expierence in the game and know the maps like the back of their hand. Overall I give it a 7/10 and Im sure that rating will go up a lot really fast considering it seems like the devs are working hard to give people their moneys worth.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,39,True,Recommended,Game is great if your system is up to spec. I have a GeForce GT 730 and the game would run on lowest settings but very poor graphics to the point where when a truck drove by i could only see the wheels rolling the truck and driver were invisible. However most recently they must've done some optimization changes because the graphics are a lot better with same settings as before. I can't wait to see what this game turns out like when it's fully released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,267,True,Recommended,I have had some of the best experiences with my friends on this game. Chicken dinners all day. This game will get your heart rate up and you will probably start sweating when it comes down to the last 10 players. This game should be played with friends in my opinion for the most fun but even solo is pretty fun. The graphics are good and there are some bugs with the game in its current state. Personally these bugs are minor to me and I can ignore them because the gameplay is worth dealing with some bugs. I average around 75 fps with a GTX 1070 overclocked to 1995 mhz and an i5 6600k overclocked to 4.4 ghz. The only time my fps drops below 65 is during the plane ride and when I first enter a large city but it stabilizes after a little and goes back up to 75+. I occasionally get 100 fps towards the end of the game when there are less players and if the play area isn't in a city. Overall this game is great especially for being early access. I am excited for the full game and I would buy this game again if I had to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,120,True,Recommended,PUBG has to be one of the best batte royale games I've ever played the satisfaction you get by visiting a random house only to be greeted by awesome loot doesn't compare to the sudden deathmatch at the end when the built in mechanic of having a circle zone that gets smaller by the minutes forcing you to basically batlle it out and hope that you manage to come out victorious. Although the game may not be well optimized yet the gameplay and enjoyment you get by placing top 5 or maybe going against all odds and managing to surivive getting shot at by 4+ people makes the game in my opinion a buy. The devs have already made significant improvemens to this game and it can only get better from here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-26,0,0,41,True,Recommended,As someone that generally HATES shooters with a sizeable passion even I can enjoy this game. I enjoyed trying to use the crossbow and laughing at my own failure to aim as well as seeing the amazing moments this game can give you (One of my highlights being that be someone decided to drive me strictly staying to the roads and then asking for an uber rating on my trip after most of the other passengers had been shot while he drove through the cities).The large updates in this games early stages are fantastic as of the patch im in they have added a new SMG and a bike as well as putting the crossbow back into the game! I look forward to seeing where this game goes in the future hopefully they'll add some attachments for the crossbow to make it more viable then i can live my fantasy of being a black ginger haired Darrell in a circle of death based arena game.Overall i'd recommend this game to people that want a fun casual way to kill 10min per game or so with some mates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-24,0,0,52,True,Recommended,I highly recommend this game if you like Battle Royale last man standing type games. I like how quick you get paired up into a match and doesn't take long before your actually dropping into a play area. The only negative isn't any aspect of the game but is the people that randomly scream or do other stupid stuff in the mic for no reason. Hoping some glitches get patched soon where items will be inside a wall and it doesn't let you pick them up. All in all I'm loving the game in just one day of playing. Looking forward to new maps gear modes whatever they give us.*Edit* Now that I have had the chance to play with more friends we have encountered some issues. One friend had his game crash for a memory issue like I'm about to talk about in the middle of my updated review below. Another friend had frequent crashes. I will say that both friends are playing on laptops. I do know they have both have Intel i5's and one has a graphics card in it but I'm not sure of their settings and other hardware. I mostly was just noticing what seems to be very high Ram usage. At times it would hit 8gb of Ram that the game is using while playing. I also blue screened once I believe it was a graphics issue according to the message I got. My game has also crashed once stating there wasn't enough memory for whatever usb driver it was needed for. Even with those few issues although kinda big issues in my eyes I still love the game. Almost all of my time spent with the game open is actual play time and not me sitting in the lobby trying to fix stuff. I'm hoping the update coming the 27th address' some issues I and my friends have been having as well as the rest of the community. I'm sure the team is working hard on all of the reports they may be getting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,374,False,Not Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds started off as an incredibly promising Battle Royale game overshadowing the likes of H1Z1 and similar titles. Initially I was reluctant to pay the full price for a game in Beta especially with the amount of bugs it had during it's testing phases. I had a lot of fun playing with friends 200+ hours worth of fun and giggles. Then came the release of PUBG 1.0 finally the game had transcended from a testing phase to being a full blown released title... you would assume this means that after rigorous testing and tribulations the game would be relatively bug and glitch free. Was this the case? Absolutely not. That's because instead of pushing for bug fixes and fine tuning the game the dev's decided to release crates and premium keys which can be used to unlock certain crates so that you can get that sweet baseball cap worth a fraction of the 2.5 USD you paid for your keys. FPS games have always had a prevalent issue with hackers those lowlife aimbotting/wallhacking scum always seem to find a way to worm their way into our fun and ruin it. Surely the Battle Eye anti cheat system would be able to deal with it right? Wrong again. The game is riddled with hackers and instead of fixing these issues Bluehole wants to push a battlepass out along with this Sanhok update so that was can fund this hot pile of steaming garbage of a game even further? Brilliant another money grubbing tactic to distract us from the issues of the game with shiny rubbish. To sum up this review.. I have two words for this game.

2017-04-26,0,0,72,True,Recommended,This is a great game but keeps crashing at the worst time I've noticed if I alt tab when I go in a match it will consistently crash without a doubt. Sometimes my game will just freeze in game and then I would have to use task manager to exit out of the game or restart my computer. The performace could be better I'm averaging 30 40fps at very low settings but I guess it's just my trash computer so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. I would rate this game 5/5 if they fixed the bugs and constant crashes other than that I do recommend this game it's more enjoyable playing with friends instead of playing by yourself.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,130,True,Recommended,PUBG mixes semi realism with a heart pounding objective coupled with either enjoyable team match ups or nightmare match ups causing sometimes hilarious but frustrating interactions. In solo play you are dropped from a plane in an area of your choosing. You have to quickly find loot in abandoned buildings to get yourself in a position to hunt or defend yourself. This mode of play can make you jump out of your seat and it can bring you some very satisfying kills. Squad is less heart pounding however it is my favourite mode as you can quickly develop a 20 30min bond with your team mates that feels as if you all have gone through a trial for life and death together. I would highly recommend this game. It is very addictive and well built.Good luck enjoy and always remember China numba 1!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Having barely made it across the body of water to the beach we hastely ran to shelter perched on a slight hill. As we began to scavenge what little was left in the houses we noticed something... two whole squads swimming across to make it into the ""safe"" zone. We waited for them to notice each other as we crouched below windows stealthily watching their every move. one of the sqauds members reached the beach first and with no hesitation a barrage of bullets started it off. In an instant we stood up and joined the gunfight both of us with an SKS. I took out two and downed another as my comrade downed two and killed the final man from the enemy squad. It was insanely hectic but we had to quickly keep moving to the next circle. THIS is where it gets exciting... We both died. Thats it.

2017-06-22,0,0,1014,True,Recommended,I can't believe I have this game. I am not an FPS or TPS type person. My friends were playing it so i thought since $30 isn't extremely outrageous I'd get it too. Now i'm hooked. I get sniped I get crossbowed I get called weird names when people shot me. I've even been shot a few times by my teammates I've been left behind by my teammates (my friends my dear dear friends). Most of all I SUUUUUCCCKKKK at this game. BUUUUTTTT hiding pushing being aggressive being passive all these strategies you can do by yourself with a friend or with a squad makes this game so addicting.

2017-05-17,0,0,247,True,Recommended,If you have ever wondered what it would be like to have the game DAYZ into a battle royale im gonna warn you to stop right there. Only fools have ever progressed in that direction and none can get the several hours they have wasted on this game back. This game is certainly the peak of BETA and is still pretty broken. The combat system is shotty at best and the server lag is still a major problem. Optimization could use a little work but it seems as though they did a solid job for how quickly they produced this game. I think moving towards Esports would be a terrible mistake for this title as the games are heavily decided upon RANDOM WACKY BULLSH*T. All negativity aside this game is fun at times and allows for lots of good laughs and lots of rage. 9/10 would maybe buy again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-17,0,0,514,True,Recommended,So basically the game overall is good. I like to play it with friends. But where the game goes wrong is it doesnt have any penalties for people that play solo in squad que or sometimes duo. So basically everytime im playing alone and don't feel like doing solo's I hop into a squad game. And sometimes I get nice squads and sometimes after looting an area my squad will see what I have and then kill me for my loot. It is the most annoying and aggravating thing in this game. Other then the fact that sometimes it takes like a whole clip to kill someone. But its fine lets just keep that in the game so it later becomes like the other game that takes a clip to kill someone called H1Z1. Anyways my point is maybe a little balancing and maybe a penalty or small ban of some sort for friendly fire because its really frustrating trying to play and then dying to a teammate. Overall the game is still fun but sometimes its kinda iffy on when someone kills you and when you should have killed them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-17,0,0,344,True,Recommended,It aint bad I have not played it much due to general lack of time. However the hours I have played have been very fun. I think I have had 2 or 3 wins.

2017-05-17,0,0,161,True,Recommended,This is the best money I have spent on Steam in a long time. I have found myself getting frustrated with other MMO shooters such as Battlefield and COD. Something about the pacing of gameplay waiting to hear footsteps coming around the corner or wondering if there is someone camping out upstairs...and then finding out through a fusilade of gunfire gives me a nice dose of adrenaline. Finding out if you can beat a man to death barehanded before he can load that pistol he just picked up? Can you get into the building before that other dude who landed on the backside of the same building gets in there and gets a gun before you? It is a different game and strategy each and every time. I wholeheartedly recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You just really have to ignore all the t deaths where you get shot around the corner or someone you shoot 13 times in the chest just shoots you 15 times in a second but other than that its great! Squads are so much fun. You get 3 of your friends together and bait them so you can increase your KDA then back out an restart. This game has a bright future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Whats intresting is you don't need to be in a squad or team to join these servers but you would be at a disadvantage if you did. The game can match you up with friends but I suggest bringing your own and having voice comms out side of the in game. (Otherwise other players will hear your plan of ""pretending to be their friend so we can take their stuff"") However teaming up outside of your own group is rare trust no one! When moving around the map you can find cars the mechanics of driving in this game are awesome and the weird physiscs will happen that you can't hapen to laugh at https //clips.twitch.tv/ObservantKnottyBearPrimeMe The game ends when you can hold down to be the last man (or team) standing.

Aiming over the Left shoulder the red dot should be there if u cant hit if u hit a wall or something else but hes not hes showing u could shoot and hit but u cant cuz u only hit the wall I3.

2017-06-25,0,0,260,True,Recommended,I think it's a good game but it's important to keep in mind the fact that it's beta and that there's a lot of bugs. On top of the system requirements are not small you need a good computer to run it without lag that's not including the fact that the servers may cause FPS lag at sometimes. In conclusion get this game if you have a good computer fan of h1z1 and you are willing to give up some games due to bugs.

2017-06-28,0,0,31,True,Recommended,This game is an absolute blast to play and gives one of the best adrenaline rushes I've experienced in recent years. Every match is filled with silence at first (after the pre game lobby and ear on the plane) unless you drop near someone else. That silence followed by the sudden sound of footsteps or nearby gunfire allow for natural tension as you realize there is someone else nearby who could find and kill you at any moment. Getting cought in a sudden firefight is one of the best things in this game and will take your nerves from 0 100 in seconds and then back down again when one of you dies and dieing doesn't even feel bad in this game as it instantly relieves tension and you can immediately leave and join another match starting the ride all over again. The only major downside is the optimization of the game as it eats processing power like crazy I had to turn the settings to medium on my 980TI as anything higher held a constant max load even when overclocked and it kept my temps at over 70 constantly.Overall this game is fantastic fun solo if you don't take it to seriously and I can only imagine it gets better with friends. I look forward to many tense rounds in the future and hopefully some wins.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-30,0,0,804,False,Not Recommended,After playing this game for over 700 hours all I can say is that I am disappointed in the PUBG team. It should not have taken them this long to upgrade their servers when this has been an issue for a very long time. Even though they have done this the servers at the start of a game are more than pathetic with the hit registration not being accurate a lot of the time. I honestly must say I had the most fun playing this game between February/March as you could drop and actually find a weapon now you loot for 5 minutes and find a pistol. I understand that there is a certain element of RNG but how is this supposed to be a skill based game if you have no chance of finding a weapon even though you looted the whole of Yasnaya?I honestly think that to improve this game they need to up the spawn rates of items as there is no point in playing if you get handicapped by not finding a gun in 3 houses every game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,106,False,Not Recommended,"When connecting to a Northern American server I have more luck finding a Chinese person in PUBG than I do finding Russians in CSGO.Edit My steam account got hacked by a foreign Chinese person after 100 hours in this game. He gave 2 copies of PUBG to his accounts and decided to cheat under my account. He got me banned from PUBG but I got my account back. After emailing their customer support about details behind how I got hacked and what he vandalized on my steam account they emailed me back replying ""Unfortunately we cannot assist with accounts that have been hacked and banned. The account owner is responsible for the management of the account and we won t be able to assist with any issues that arise from that. The ban on the account is from the account making violations so the person who did it won t matter in this case. The owner of the account is again responsible for the account and the action on the account. Therefore the status of the account cannot change.""How am I responsible for someone randomly hacking my account? That's like saying I'm responsible for my wallet getting pickpocketed my car getting hijacked or my house being broken into. As one of the only games that I devoted paying the full price at launch it's sad to see they treat their customers like this. I will not advocate them in further progression in developing PUBG. I've dealt with their poor optimization terrible community and the destorted view on their place in the overall battle royale genre development but this is by far the worst way to treat a customer after I got one of my most valuable possesions (my account) stolen and abused for three days.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-19,0,0,5,True,Recommended,Game needs more to it. Has great ideas but you guys need to really go in depth on creating your character and customizing. Especially a clan or guild or something. And the gameplay you need to take it a step further with more death animations that make you go wow or drop your jaw at how painful it looked. Traps more ways to kill objectives to take over more ways to play. Night battles would be sick with maybe even a glow in the dark mode. So much this game needs to keep you coming back for more.

2017-06-04,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,You know I was thinking the same thing. Why do you only see black people stealing cell phones? Either he is in a mostly black area or well you can figure it out for yourself. There's a reason there's more black folks in prisons by percentage. They are committing crime at a higher percentage rate than whites or hispanics. Blacks comprise about 15 17 % of the population. Hispanics about 30 35%. Whites are about 50 55%. (+/ 5 8%) I'm doing all this from memory so my numbers aren't perfect but they're close. Blacks commit around 45 55% of the crimes that are committed. I don't like what that sounds like but instead of making excuses for bad behaviors lets reduce the numbers. Cause the numbers tell the truth rather we like it or not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,684,True,Recommended,Despite having common problems that EA games have in general. Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is a incredibly fun game to play. The development team is amazing and always hard at work and progress IS actually being made. The team is very transparent with the community and seem to be addressing what the community is asking for (including optimization and server optimization)(slowly but surely one step at a time)Despite all the complaints on how they aren't focusing on this or that most people dont realize that they have multiple development groups per project forsay optimization server stuff new content and so on so on.The gameplay is fun the combat mechanics are true to the real counterparts (EVEN PROPER SCOPE ZEROING THE INCREMENTS ARE TRUE TO DISTANCE) and the game actually requires skill and proper tactics/communication (which make all the difference) Gunplay is ultra satisfying especially when you land that 500m+ headshot on a moving target.Overall despite its flaws at the moment Battlegrounds truly deserves a solid 8/10!(Will change most likely to 10/10 as progress continues to be made!)I also want to point out that this was the first game I have ever reviewed and truly believe that Battlegrounds deserves it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-10-07,0,0,97,False,Recommended,"This is a great game while buggy sometimes is still very fun. It has great mechanics and while others may disagree I feel that it is far superior to other BRs out there (CoUGHFortniteAHEM). Some of the great things is the multiple maps vehicles and (less) toxic players. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone wanting to give it a shot but is swayed by the ""Mostly negative"" Recent reveiws. However there is some improvements that I think would make the game amazing. First I think it would be awesome if more weapons were added such as RPG's or miniguns (With balances to them like slow reload time and not so good accuracy RPG and slow reload large mag but low damage/accuracy minigun . More cool things would be adding C4 helicopters (rare) grenade launcher attachment grips for guns (rare) thermal scopes (very rare) and other things. In conclusion this is a great game.

2017-06-19,0,0,259,True,Recommended,While many people have a problem with this game I personally find it to be truly fun. There seems to be a stigma that it will never be optimized properly similarly to DayZ but the devs have already released a patch that allows me to run it about 2.5x better (Weird number but it's not fantastic yet). The game has truly terrifying gameplay especially when you have the jump on someone. You see a man running through the field in front of you do you kill him and take the risk that someone will hear the shots and kill you? I highly recommend it to anyone who can possibly play it. Although I think it would be worth it to drag afriend along too. And there are some excellent user created guides on how to get/make a good chicken dinner,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-06,0,0,485,True,Recommended,Amazing game.

The map is perfectly sized loot is completely random some games you will land and find 2 SCAR's and an m416 in one room.. other times you will have to search 4 buildings just to find a frying pan (which is beast). Ultimately most of the negative reviews are dumb kids that bought the game with mommy's credit card and failed the read the ""early access"" warning signs.. it's still in development but it's still a great game to play solo or with a team.

2017-04-06,0,0,499,True,Recommended,Looking for a solid battle royale game well you've found it! Playerunknown battle ground has the realistic feel of arma and the solid looting system of h1z1 kotk without the continuous lack of improvement. Servers are updated weekly and new content is pushed monthly. Finally theres an early access game that shows their dedication to one day leaving that status.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-06,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,Sadly this is the first game for which i had to ask for a refund. I have a pc that can run the latest games on the highest settings with 60+ fps at anytime. This game however it was impossible to achieve a playable frame rate in dense areas. After trying some of the solutions provided by people who had similar issues i managed to improve the frame rate a little bit but nowhere enough for the game to be playable. The game concept is on point and i would like to try it again when developers have done some more optimalization. It's just sad to me that a game i was looking forward to turned out to be unplayable due to poor optimization. This review is definitely not permanent since the game is in early access meaning that it is normal to have bugs and issues with it. I personally cannot recommend it just because to me it was flat out unplayable. I'll come back to this review if i decide to try it out again once devs have done some optimalization.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-06,0,0,33,True,Not Recommended,This is a really fun game. Sometimes you parachute down and are killed really quickly or you get into the final 50 and the paranoia sets in as the game area starts to shrink. The gunplay feels fine nothing special though. My only criticisms is the price point. 27 for a game in early access that feels like an Alpha build seems a bit over the top to me. At the moment I think 15 is a fairer charge for this game. I am sure there will be improvement out for the servers because god knows it needs it. Once the server issues are sorted and a bit of optimisation work then this without doubt could be a 27 game. I would say I am very much on the fence about recommending the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-08,0,0,243,False,Not Recommended,When I originally bought this game it was great. There was the occasional cheater but with all games there are cheaters there was the occasional bug but most games even AAA games like Battlefield have bugs. My problems began when PUBG Corp. did not focus on dealing with the bugs that needed to be fixed. Instead of fixing bugs that affect gameplay they decided to add new crates. The crates are the stupidest thing ever invented don't get me wrong I love crates. Overwatch got a ton of hate with all of their crates so did other games but this game takes it to a new level. Never have I experienced a game where I had to pay money on top of paying money for the game to open a create which I earned. If they decided to only allow those crates to be purchased that'd be fine. For them to practically force me to pay to open a crate just to get an item of clothing which I earned is completely unreasonable. I'd much rather play a game where I can recieve the items I earned without payment. Fix the buisness model.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fact that Bluehole thinks they own the rights to the Battle Royale genre of games and then move forward with a lawsuit against the company that allows them to use there engine to make the game in the first place. That was to tell we all needed to realize PUBG wasnt made by people that love gaming or love the game they made. What they want is the money from it. Because if devs actually love the game they make they would actually care about fixing the bugs that make this game more of a annoyance than fun.

2017-04-11,0,0,44,True,Recommended,8/10 Great game Though Deals With Some Minor Typical Early Access BugsOriginal Review April 11 2017*Update since latest patch July 3 2017*Okay so one of the biggest patches has hit this wonderfully brutal battle royale. In this patch they included a couple new weapons (a bullpup style weapon that can only be acquired through airdrops and a fully auto glock found throughout normal weapon spawning) destructible huts and numerous gameplay tweaks to further enhance the experience. All in all so far the devs are working incredibly hard to consistently improve this game. If you haven't bought into the hype yet it's worth it... Really it is. Grab a few buddies and jump into this game. I promise you won't regret it.Let s double tap some of the cons from my first review As for the lag I mentioned it s still pretty rough when starting out in a match. There s roughly a 2 second delay when trying to open a door or pick up equipment/weapons. The devs network team needs to invest in some better network equipment or come up with a more cost efficient way to handle that initial burst to the network (Just please Don t go full retard like Ubisoft does with P2P).Graphics have been significantly improved. Before I mentioned I was getting about 50 70 fps. Now I m sticking around 90 fps. Kudos to the graphical optimizations! It s noticed and greatly appreciated!Still haven t seen any in game bug/error reporting But honestly I haven t incurred any significant issues like everyone else has (i.e. the hilarious yet obviously frustrating constant falling animation). Maybe I m just lucky but I think there should be some way to report in game as reporting through a third party can be too burdening and often skipped due to unwillingness to comply! #obey*Below is the April 11 2017 review*So where do I begin? PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a Battle Royale style multiplayer game where you start off with nearly 100 players on a fairly decent sized map and work to be the last one surviving. Think H1Z1 but better executed (in my opinion).At this point I have 10 hours of gameplay under my belt. From what I can tell this game is primarily inspired by the ARMA Battle Royale mod from a while back (oh... the memories). It's super simple to get into the game you create a pretty bland character (be careful though.. it costs 3 000 in game credits to change/alter your avatar) and click play on the top left of the screen. Personally I haven't experienced any connection issues when trying to join a match but I have read that some players have experienced this. Once you successfully join a match you have 60 seconds to get accustomed to the controls or grab the nearest weapon on a bench and create your own chaos as you prep to load into a C 17 to airdrop your sorry sack o... avatar onto the map. Once the actual map loads you're sitting in a bird waiting to airdrop... Choose your drop location wisely. Pick somewhere everyone else is jumping your chances of survival upon landing are pretty slim (unless you're lucky and able to get inside a building with either an SMG M416 or Shotty). From this point it's up to you. Loot buildings improve your armor and bag space accumulate ammunition and fight your way for that 1st position. As the game progresses and the number of alive players drop the playable area will get smaller and smaller (pay attention to this! If you're outside the playable area you take a bit of damage every second).Now for the review Pros Gameplay is fantastic! Expect an adrenaline rush every time you jump into a match. Especially when you make it to the last 10 surviving.. This is where the game is pure gold. And.. ahh... the hitboxes are precise. Controls are actually pretty good. If you don't like the stock key set you can change them through the options. Controls are precise accurate and comfortable (you'll see what I mean once you get in.. it feels natural). The graphics are really nice. I have noticed some slight texture load errors but after a few seconds they seem to fix themself. Definitely in a better state than other Early Access games when it comes to graphics.Now for the Cons Lag is pretty rough.. Especially in the beginning of the match after you land and start scrounging for some sort of pea shooter. It's pretty common to have to wait at least 1 2 seconds for a door to open. Also seeing other characters rubber banding around is common. Though after you settle in and some players die off you'll notice it improve (Hence is why I recommend parachuting somewhere away from the big crowds.. No matter how tempting it may be). Though I'm sure the devs are tracking this and are working on better optimizing their network capabilities. Remember when I said the graphics are beautiful? That's because I'm running this with a 1080. I have high graphical setting selected and am only rocking about 50 70 fps. This isn't a complete dealbreaker for me since I have such a powerful card. Now for those who don't have at least a 970.. You'll struggle a bit. I've seen reviews of other players getting as low as 20fps with settings on low. Again though I'm sure the devs are tracking and are working on a graphical optimization patch. No in game error/bug reporting. I've scoured all over the game settings to try and find a way to report bugs. Apparently their recommendation for bug reporting is to record your gameplay and upload that recording to a third party website. While I understand how recording gameplay for error reporting is very beneficial why the third party website? How do we know our report is being viewed? This seems a little off. Careful reporting bugs on the steam forums as it's been reported people are getting banned by a disgruntled mod... Great...So overall this is a very polished Early Access game with tons of potential. If you're looking for a good battle royale style game that's better than H1Z1 I recommend picking this one up. If you can handle some of the net lag and are okay with below 60fps at times (hopefully this is a priority for the devs) support the devs and give this a try... I just hope they don't take the money and run like so many other early access developers we're oh so familiar with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-01,0,0,237,True,Recommended,First Impressions only 4 hours in so far Pretty much the idea of battle royale from arma and h1z1 but improved. The basics are the same run around and loot as fast as possible then carefully make your way to the circle to be killed.Where this game improves on h1z1 is the variety of weapons and how they feel when you shoot them. Weapons work so much better in PUB than h1z1 adding scopes to a gun makes it so much fun.The vehicles are better in this game but they are still buggy. I've been in a motorcycle that refused to go straight so to go where I wanted I had to tilt to the right. Vehicles flip easy as too and if you jump out going faster than like 15kmh you're gonna lose all your hp.If updates continue to be released for this game then it might become worth $30 but right now I'd wait for a sale and do $20 at most.If any devs read this I'd like to see maybe a powerup system put in place. Not like leveling but maybe put like one mortar drop per town to pick up and use or a rare RPG in a couple spawns. Only because after a while I end up sticking with just my one fav gun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I click the START button and after 3 seconds the Matchmaking has an infinite search for a game (my friends start games almost instantly). I sent already 2 Support tickets and they only answer me that it's a known bug and developers are working on it (almost 1 month from this). They don't prioritize such a blocker bug instead they spend time and money on making new cosmetics and new maps (that some people like me in the world can't play anyway). Terrible developers. Editing this comment again if this is fixed. OLD REVIEW I made a first review of this game about bad optimization but I saved for a PC master race computer (1080 GTX i7 16GB RAM) and now the game works great at 1080p resolution with some settings at High (Ultra is an overkill most of the time) and others in Medium / Low. I don't recommend it for Mid / Low PC rigs.Now that I have good FPS stability this game is the best Battle Royale game I have played both enjoyable in Solo queue or with friends. Really hard to catch up at the beginning but very rewarding when you learn how to loot positioning and strategy and you manage to get your first Chicken Dinners.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It strings you along with hope that sometimes ends in gloriously sweet victory and other times leads you to the climax then drops you like a sack of rotting meat in the dead heat of August. It has it's flaws which are overly stated for the most part. But it also has it's great points. It's not arcade ish like Fortnite it's not hyper realistic like Arma it's not an 8 bit indie game and it's not Battlefield or CoD. Personally I love this game. I used to play a ton of Solo nowadays I tend to mostly just play with my friends. It's great to sit back get into some intense fights then have it mellow out shoot the shoot other players win lose just take it for what it's meant to be. A really fun game.

2017-05-01,0,0,55,True,Recommended,"Great game decent ammount of weapons decent ammount of everything really... Schute in early watch 30 people schute with you and actually get ahead of you even though you've left the plane earlier grab a pistol or a shotgun kill a guy or drop dead. This is what the game is for the majority of people.Visually not that impressive though it really has better graphics than most games out there which is on the plus side.Performance wise it's pisspoor sometimes but do note this is still an EAG(Early Acces Game). Speaking of early access you will run into a crapton of bugs if you decide to get into weird cover spots or just slide down somewhere. BE WARNED! You WILL GET STUCK and drop dead into the forcefield without being able to move. It did happen to me more than once while trying to get into some cool cover spots.Overall the game's a must have if you're an ArmA veteran a shooter addict playing CS CS GO Battlefield COD and so on or just looking to get into a great shooter and start playing for fun. Though you will be dying a lot in this game if you're not used to playing in third person and watching your back while running.A free roam mode would be a plus for me but the game's great already as it is so don't be shy to give it a try.A thing I do hate is the ""buy a crate and get clothes system"" because i keep getting stuff that's not helping with camouflage or anything really it's better to just run naked half the time instead of putting on a blue shirt and a pair of almost white jeans. Also getting 50 100 ingame currency for a half hour game is kinda bad if you're not even getting goo d loot considering the crates get more expensive the more you buy like double the price to be more precise. What you want in this game is rounds where you're getting 2 6 kills plus top 10 AT LEAST to even get a good ammount of cash for crates.As for my rig I am running W7 SP1 64bit an I3 4170 CPU 3.70Ghz 12GB of RAM as for my GPU I've got the Geforce GTX 1060 6GB overclocked Strix version.

2017-05-03,0,0,184,True,Recommended,This game is horribly optimized at the moment. Even when playing the game on the lowest graphic settings you will experience horrible mini lag spikes especially for the first about 10mins of the game until enough people have died off. In gun battles you will get shot when your character model is behind objects and before you even see an enemies character model from behind a corner. It's no wonder most people just camp and play super slow in this game. I also feel there needs to be a smaller map with a faster circle/gas timer so there is more action higher loot spawn rates and first person only a hardcore type mode. Even with all that said I still think it's worth a try and hopefully they will continue to improve the game.****UPDATE*****Game is improving quickly but there is still issues with optimization on the network side. They push out updates frequently which include new weapons vehicles weapon attachments etc which keeps the game fresh and it is really fun to play with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It should have stayed in early access for a longer time there are many things that still need to be worked out before they add more to it. They are adding more loot boxes to the game and other unwanted things than actually fixing problems. They used to be more focused on the real issues like hackers and glitches but now it doesn't feel like their trying to fix those issues anymore. Like most people reviewing a game I'll give a pros and cons list.Pros Graphics are pretty good on all settings Gun physics feel pretty realistic and balanced Quick matchmaking times A large selections of weaponsCons A decent amount of hackers Car physics are terrible No more game fixing updates like in early access Very inaccurate deathcam You can't have any other program open at the same time and expect to get good fps.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,35,True,Recommended,This game is great. Was not to much into survival games but this one is addicting!! Can't wait to see what the developer adds in the coming future,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-10,0,0,183,True,Recommended,I've played a lot of Battle Royale games and I've come to the conclusion that Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is the best game out there in its genre.Pros PUBG actually feels and plays like a fun game. The gameplay is smooth and realistic. There are quite a few different weapons and every weapon is useful. You can add attachments to every weapon to make it stronger. All weapons and attachments can be found while looting.The matches are pretty fast every match takes about half an hour. You can also find a new match in just a few seconds.There are servers for every region out there.You can play solo duo or in a squad.The map is quite large but isn't too big. Loads of buildings contain loot. The loot is well spread.Cons The game can be laggy sometimes in both the FPS and network aspect. Right now the developers are busy fixing both these problems. The game is still playable though and usually it fixes itself in a minute.Vehicles are a little bit dodgy since you can fall over or lose speed pretty fast if you take a wrong turn.Price is quite high but that won't change. If you love survival shooters you're gonna love this game.All in all Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a beautiful Battle Royale game. The developers are going to fix a few things here and there but it's nothing too concerning. As a fan of survival shooters and battle royale games the game is totally worth it. You should pick it up. If you don't like it you can always get a refund from Steam.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-24,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,Great idea great potential superficially fun until you get aimbotted 5 matches in a row or go several hours without having a single english speaking squadmate. Lag Spikes FPS drops lopsided matchmaking (if there even is matchmaking) reduce this game to nothing but a shoddy game of hide and seek where you collect loot for the hackers that kill you. Maybe if you play at the right time of day or night every now and then you'll have a fun match but they are not frequent enough to make up for the onslaught of frustration in between. Meanwhile the developer continues to incentivise cheating by allowing loot crates to be bought and sold on the steam market and continuously coming up with more loot crates to keep the hackers hacking. Whatever anti cheat is in place does nothing more than waste system resources. You can report cheaters but you recieve no feedback. For every obvious cheater you run into there are 9 more who are more subtle and it completely undermines any confidence in the game being a test of skill. It's a 8/10 game until the honeymoon period is over and you realize what is going on then it's 2/10. Do Not Buy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,76,True,Recommended,"At least one in every five games a hacker is going to win. Some will be running around naked punching people to death with no armor no weapons and apparantly no shame. Those are only the obvious ones there are most assuredly others using programs that assist the m visually or in other harder to detect ways.The game itself is fun the gameplay solid and the overall feel is fast paced (barring the occasional few minutes of camping and hoping for survival). It looks good it runs well (at max settings) on my rig and it is fun. The ""drop"" system for customizing your character is laughable. Absolutely hilarious as an actual attempt at in game content. increasingly high amounts of the in game currency are needed to unlock a single item of clothing at a time. It feels like the devs are laughing in your face as you're putting in game time to try and unlock some sort of customization for your character. These items (in general) are simply cosmetic so it feels strange that they would be so stingy with them. It wouldn't feel nearly as bad if the character creation itself were better than that of a free MMO from the 80's.In short More (or easier) character customization would be nice The game is pretty solid and is legitimately fun and be prepared for hackers to ruin your experience every now and then. Overall I'd say the game is worth it if you buy it on sale. I wouldn't pay full price and the lack of current content makes the long haul on this one seem unlikely unless they add something more to the experience.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's still unopitimized after over a year it gets boring quick and the devs care more about microtransactions instead of fixing the issues with their game. Oh and not to mention that the devs feel the need to sue the company that made the engine this game runs on (Epic Games) because Epic has done a better job with providing a quality game for free. These devs act as if they were the ones that birthed the Battle Royale genre when that simply isn't true as there were at the very least 3 Battle Royale games before this (ARMA 3 BR mod H1Z1 and The Culling). Epic has not infringed on any copyright (unless you want to consider the dropping out of a plane/battle bus and being knocked down in team modes as an infringement on copyright). The devs are just salty that they aren't as popular as Epic's game Fortnite. It's sad it's childish and I will not be supporting these crybabies ever again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-28,0,0,232,True,Recommended,If you enjoy Battle Royal style games I fully believe this is the best one you can get on Steam. I have never purchased a game in early release before that not only beats my expectations but is routinely updated by the devs. They maintain very clear communication and each patch makes the game run smoother.With over 200 hours in the game I feel confident enough to say that it stays very replayable. The constant desire to make it to number 1 makes you keep coming back and trying new weapons and new strategies. Definitely worth the money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-29,0,0,366,False,Recommended,Why do I recommend this game? In short the fun outweighs the moments when you get killed by cheaters. I played the game from patch to patch and I enjoy it very much in its current state. The update come more frequently and there is a lot yet to come. Pubg is the only battle royal type game I really tried. I find it more attractive than the others because I prefer the more realistic style. The learning curve is steep in my opinion as the weapons differ greatly in performance and handling. You will need some time to understand the maps where to loot and when to move. The best experience is playing with friends playing solo can be really exhausting and there will be matches where you loot for 20 minutes just so to get sniped. With friends especially in a full four people squad the game gives you more time to breath and the firefights become exciting. A reason to stay away from the game is for me when you look for something that is just easier to learn AND if you do not have a decent PC. From my understanding you want to have enough power to be able to play the game at 1080p and with antialiasing on ultra. It makes a huge difference in spotting enemies as a smoother picture allows you to see moving objects more clearly.Best of luck on the battlegrounds to all that are willing to test their skills!

2018-06-10,0,0,484,False,Not Recommended,This game had so much potential but sadly everything is determined by money nowadays. Funny thing is that if this game was optimised to run at least decently they would also make more money. Lootboxes events and skins are good additions but it is 100% laughable that you have to pay even more money to get something different that an ugly red shirt. The game has a lot core issues that need to be optimized and I know it is hard but at least try. You keep releasing content that is not necesary for the game at the moment while you seem to ignore major issues that determine your playerbase. A full 2 gb patch only to add an event that doesn't even reward you that much for playing it and not a single fix about the major optimization issues of the game. You buy a lootbox with your effort and then you are asked to pay more money to open it. This is absurd. I can see where this is going... And it is sad because this game had and still has so much potential. I 100% don't recomend buying this game at the moment. I hope that the company snaps out of it but I highly doubt it.

2018-06-10,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,"Paragraph 1 Pregame LobbiesParagraph 2 OptimizationParagraph 3 Weekend Game modes/EventsParagraph 4 ServersParagraph 5 Skins/MicrotransactionsParagraph 6 My opinion/streamers and other potential BR gamesLets first start off with the pregame lobby. When this game first released they had all the weapons spawned on tables and if you got into the lobby early you could grab a gun and shoot it. It made the lobbys fun and gave you something to do during the countdown. I think when the desert map came out they took all the guns away and now you can't do anything in lobby except wait. I'm not very good at the game and I accept that but having the guns during the pregame allowed people who aren't good at the game be able to access and use those weapons. The lobbies now are very boring especially since you have to wait a whole minute. You could sit in a lobby for a few mintues before the actual game even starts. It's such a waste of time and to compare it with fortnite pregame lobbies you only wait 10 seconds.The optimization of the game is alright but not great. I have a hard time determining whether or not I hit someone from a distance unless I have a 4x scope or greater. Picking up weapons and items is a pain as well. there have been so many instances where I will be over a weapon and ammo and the ammo won't come over into my inventory or the weapon won't go into a slot. Also if I'm able to get both weapon and ammo over into my inventory it sometimes won't let me relaoad the gun. I have to drop the gun and then pick it back up for it to reload. It just isn't smooth and its very buggy. The parachuting is terrible as well. Sometimes if you try to land on a house or between two houses you will get stuck and just float in mid air and not be able to move for about 3 5 seconds.Bluehole has been bringing out new game modes during the weekend and they are either a hit or miss. I don't think they even know what they are bringing out. some game modes are pretty fun but the execution is awful. For example the first game mode they brought out was a team deathmatch where 3 teams of 10 would parachute down into a small area and fight it out first to 150 points wins. It sounds great and it was fun if you were the team on the ground. When you died you would respawn back in the plane but the plane only comes over the battle area every 40 seconds. Why every 40 seconds??? Why couldn't the plane just stay in place and you just drop every 3 seconds. there were so many instances where you would drop and die but you would miss the plan spawn and have to wait 40 seconds. That really irritated me but what was more fustrating is that when you died and you came back into the game you had to parachute down again. I can't tell you how many times I died before I hit the ground. I already explained how the parachuting animation is terrible but it made this mode so much worse. If you came up against a decent player they would kill you before you hit the ground or they would take you down to atleast 50% health before you landed. I want to say PUBG started these game modes to try and compete with fortnite's game modes.Servers are terrible especially the past few days. There are times where you can't even get into the main screen of the game. When you start up a game and your playing with a group sometimes it will kick one player and so you all will have to leave the game and restart your lobby. You will be in the middle of a game and just lose connection and won't be able to connect back in. Their servers are not good at all.The microtransactions are terrible. This game is very grindly as well to get lootboxes even though you pay $30 for the game. They have a system where when you buy a crate with their in game point system the next crate is more expensive. The first crate cost 700bp then it goes 1400bp 2800bp 4200bp 5400bp and 700bp. The way to earn points is by playing the game but I'll earn about 80bp per game. It takes forever to earn these points unless you win. If you win in solos you get 800bp but if you win in duos or squads that 800bp is split evenly among the players. PUBG is an all or nothing game. if you don't come in 1st then you don't get anything. You get 20 points for each kill and thats about it. So when you get enough points you buy a crate you get two options. You can choose to get a random crate or you can choose to get a key crate. If you get a key crate you will have to pay $2.50 for a key to open it. It's a complete rip off and depending on what crate you get there is a certain key for that crate. They do have crates where you can open them up for free but you rarely ever get those anymore. It's a joke and the developers don't seem to care anymore about the game. They seem to focus more on skins now then the actual game. They created special skins for Drdiscrespect and Shroud that cost $9.99 each. This game is slowly going down hill and seeing this three months ago I would have said that ""it's a shame to see this game dying"" but now I'm telling myself that the game deserves to die. I watch big streamers that play this game such as Shroud Choco Taco Drdisrespect Chad Just9n TSM_VISS and these guys have been ranting for months about what is wrong with the game and the developers aren't listening. They are too focused on new maps and crates. I think these streamers are the only thing keeping this game alive right now and when a new BR game comes out they are all going to hop over to it. That is surely what I'm going to do because I can't stand this game anymore. Only reason I'm still playing this game til now is because it's the only BR game I have. I have fortnite but I hate that game but Realm Royale just came out so I am going to move over to that game now and wait for Fractured Lands to come out as well. If your still reading this go look at Fractured lands. This game has so much potential lets just hope that the developers don't mess it up like PUBG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just don't be salty if you suck when you first start everyone has to start from somewhere. If you want easy kills and addictive cod like gameplay play fortnite.

I can always refund it if it didn't work out right?First few games I was pretty overwhelmed with the black and white of the game. Long periods of travelling and looting with short times of intense firefights.It took a few hours to get the knack of the flow but after that I found myself having more fun than what I thought I should be.This is a good game already and if the next major content patch is anything to go by it could be the next 1000+ hour game in my library.I would give this game 8.5 out of 10 and would definitely recommend it!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-26,0,0,292,True,Recommended,"Late game is basically sniper simulator. So at the end you have to hope you have a decent range weapon with a good scope and suppressor... otherwise you're toast. That's my biggest complaint. It's basically RNG in getting decent weapons as well as camping with a sniper/AR at the endCompared to many other ""FPS"" type games the explosives and melee are very underpowered. Even the weapons themselves are much harder to use than their COD counterparts (which isn't inherently a bad thing). It's disappointing that gas cans can't be shot and caught on fire like can be done in Left 4 Dead 2. If you want to make friends to coordinate with you're best off asking for their discord handle first then exchanging steam IDs. PUBG's name system on top of Steam's name system is kind of abysmal. Most people don't seem to know how to give you their steam handle so it's something you have to explain everytime you try to add them... so what I'm saying is it should really be easier to find recent players for adding each other. It's almost faster to give people your discord handle then link them to your steam profileAs for the positives it's super addictive. You can either fall in a high population and scrounge for a weapon while a ton of others are doing the same near you... or you can fall off somewhere away from everyone else in a location that will probably only provide you with a terrible shotgun or pistol. It's kind of a strange genre because nothing you do really matters. Yes you can save up your points and buy crates for random cosmetics... but none of it really matters nor seems to help much. You can equip all black which might seem good at first... but it all depends on your terrain. If the white circle end game takes you to the middle of a big field with little shade then you'll just stick out like a sore thumb. I don't really recommend solo mode. The number of people camping with AR/sniper in bushes goes up by a million fold. Even if you're a lonewolf I'd recommend squads or duos. With squads you're more likely to have 25 groups of 4... which in my book is sort of better because they're together and you're less likely to be shot from multiple sides if you get caught somewhere. I've already played over 20 hours and I'm on maybe day 4 of owning it. It has already paid for itself and I'm sure I'll get more hours out of it.

2017-04-07,0,0,1043,True,Recommended,This is definitely my favorite game of all time which says a lot since I'm an avid gamer. Reasons I love this game and my hopes for the future Big map + 100 people I love the map size and the fact the terrain is a huge part of strategy. It has an open world feel almost that of a Massive Muiltiplayer game. Would love to see this genre develop to the point of 300 people matches with a map 3x the size. The potential is huge for battle royal and now that it's getting support I can't wait to see what the future holds. Realism They did a great job of making things as realistic as possible in terms of look design and feel. I'm enjoying how much the scenery and characters resemble real life.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-07,0,0,109,True,Recommended,A great game as everyone has said so far a battle royal game done RIGHT! A lot of guns to try basically H1Z1 KOTK but just about 8 times as much content.Some weapons such as the shotguns are however a little broken they need a bit optimization.The game can't render buildings or keep up with the frame rate very well I've got GTX 1060 6GB and would have to play on very low to get about 120fps.Overall 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,31,True,Recommended,"This game is probably the best of its gnere that being battle royale. Even thought its still in early access I have come across little bugs and I know that the devs are constantly working on making this game even better everyday. Most people describe this game as being of a hunger games type of game. While that is true it has it own qualities and aspects. I chose this game instead of H1Z1 King of the Kill because I thought that the graphics seemed a little better and I thought that the mechanics were better as well. Along with Playerunknown who created both games. is no longer working on H1Z1 and is focusing on this game.Here is how a round usually goes You pick a spot to jump out of the plane to and hope that no one else lands in the same place that you are. Then you loot as many houses and buildings as you can before having to run to get into the safe zone or are spotted by another player. Once you have all the loot you need you will usually start moving into towards the safe zone. Some people like to camp out and kill people coming from outside the safe zone. Others like keep moving. I can't tell you which one is better but all I know is that I won my first game my camping out. Eventually the circle will get so small you will be forced to kill eachother and there will be a winner. This person is ofter referred to as ""getting that chicken dinner"" since if you win it says WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER. Which believe me always makes your confidence boost when you see that.In conclusion I would recommend this game because it's constantly being worked on the growth in player popularity does not seem to be stopping anytime soon its addicting and even though there is only one map as of writing this review each game is never the same and you are always on your toes.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,0,0,46,True,Recommended,I would absolutely recommend this game! If you enjoy scavenging for loot and the thrill of the hunt/being hunted then this is the game for you!PUBG is an arena style Battle Royale taking place on an 8km island. The landscape is dotted with towns and villages which contain weapons armor and misc for you to pick up or ignore. With one life to live and probably on your own you try to be one of the last 100 remaining alive in a Do or Die First Person Shooter experience.To keep up the pace of play the play zone gets smaller and smaller until you're literally on top of each other.While in Early Access this game is very addictive. I cannot wait for the finished product!Game also supports duo/team play. Not recommended for People who want a long play experience (frequently start from scratch most matches last 30 minutes or less) Anyone wanting a story (there is none) People who hate campers Players who can't stand trolling (it leads itself to trolling one life to live and all that),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Aparently Devs had figured the fact that players prefer to die shooting on a shooting game than having their car exploding or dying of natural causes for any other reason. Not so sure now that they introduced motorcycle that gets you insta killed in any minor bump. While there are videos of people playing jumping over a house in a motorcycle leaving while on air falling and still be able to kill players after the fall WTF!? WHERE IS THE CRITERIA!?Vehicles are a must to cover the map and the fact that we have many is good to avoid running simulators. The way that devs choose to go can kill the game pretty fast. If you want to choose between this and h1z1 i think pubg is the way so far (disclaimer i have not played h1z1 for 6 months). If you are not in a hurry to buy either get something that you like that is complete.Some ""improvements"" are getting the game even laggier we couldn't see the vehicle spawn now we need to kiss the floor and drink a coffe before seeing the guns.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,105,True,Recommended,Once in a while you'll have a game where you feel like you're unstoppable a harbinger of oblivion. You'll find all the right weapons armor vehicles and vantage points tearing apart every foe you encounter before they even realize what hit them. You'll be an intangible force as formless as the wind bringing a death as inevitable as the poorly rendered and contrived field of hunger games magic enclosing around you. Then when your in the final two having just scored a perfect headshot with your silenced VSS from half a mile away without even being spotted the other last guy will come behind you armorless and naked and while you whip around in a fat fingered panic accidently chugging an energy drink and throwing a smoke grenade when you meant to pull out your silenced UMP with a holographic sight and foregrip he will beat you to death with a frying pan your blood splaying across his exposed chest and thighs while Smash Mouth blares out of his mic.

2017-06-29,0,0,751,True,Recommended,I was super hesitant to pay this much for an Early Access game. But I'm incredibly glad I did this is easily the most fun game I've played since Rocket League came out.

2017-06-29,0,0,488,True,Recommended,PUBG looked like a fun game when I first checked it out a battle royale shooter similar to H1Z1 King of the Kill which I had already played. I bought it a few days after and was extremely excited to play. However the first week or so of the game I died pretty quickly in games but by remaining dedicated and learning the ins and outs the game became more fun and intense as I was able to get kills and make it into the top 10 more often. PUBG is always able to keep my adrenaline peaked as I play.I love the way the environment and weapons are designed as it makes everything seem real which in turn makes the gameplay experience more enjoyable and intense. Also the varying loot spawns change the way you play each game so you don't feel like you're in a never ending cycle taking the same course of action over and over again. Perhaps one game you'll be focused on stealth trying to get close to your enemy and kill them without knowing what hit them. Or maybe the next you'll be a sniper killing from range. I never have an experience exactly the same as the last which is one thing I like to see in games that I play.The overall gameplay also keeps you on your toes. Death is always a moment away as it never takes more than a few well placed rounds to turn a good game into a game over. It makes you fear everywhere that you go. Is there someone hiding behind one of these trees? Maybe inside of that house? Should you take the quick way through the open field or the long way around the hills? These are the kinds of thoughts that PUBG players will oftentimes have. But sound is an aspect that can turn one plan into another in an instant. Sometimes I'll be walking to a house and hear footsteps inside or maybe I'll be in the house and hear steps outside. Perhaps I'll be in a field and hear a car behind me. These sound cues prompt quick thinking and decision making to prevent the loss of your life and can also be terrifying in the moment. The game does a great job of having a balance of fear and action and forces you to remain calm in every situation. I am also going to include several comparisons to H1Z1 in this paragraph as anyone that has played it but not PUBG like I had might find this useful. For one at the beginning of the game H1 throws you in a random location you don't get to pick where you drop. PUBG does a better job at this by letting you pick where you drop. However to prevent a rinse and repeat experience with drops the plane appears at a different spot and angle each time forcing you to switch destinations as your typical looting grounds might be too far away. Additionally with H1 there's not a lot of learning to do. Once you can control each weapon efficiently that's all there is to it. In PUBG you have to not only learn every weapon but you have to learn how attachments and optics affect each weapon and you have to account for range so that way you can set your zeroing distance for accurate shots. While this does make PUBG more complicated it also makes the experience more fun and rewarding as you get better at controlling everything as it's quite easy to do so. The map is another problem with H1 as you're never certain where exactly you are and this can make getting to buildings and inside of the zone difficult. Taking longer to reach locations wastes time and could end up getting you killed. PUBG allows you to see where you are and reach places efficiently as well as leave markers on the map so you don't have to keep checking. This saves time and keeps you alive. These are just a few reasons that make me believe that PUBG is the better game.In conclusion I highly recommend PUBG to everyone. Even if you've never tried a battle royale PUBG is definitely worth the money and the chance. Just try not to get discouraged as you start out playing the game as you're bound to lose a lot. If you leave the game too early you'll miss out!NOTE Some things said here are my opinions not facts so if you buy the game because of this review and feel differently about the game I would not like to be blamed for it. I am not saying that you will or want to blame me I am simply making it known. But aside from that I appreciate you having read this far and I hope you enjoy your gaming!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are some major bugs which i accepted but that little pieces are everywhere and i know that they are not that hard to fix.

2018-06-11,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,"Had potential if it released like...a year after it did with the game breaking stuff fixed so they could focus entirely on content it might be different. But since everyone and their mom has a battle royale it's just too little too late.I don't like fortnite at all but i can appreciate that since they initially released they've added so much objectively fun content and with pubg having a 6+ month head start. It's a shame. Personally I think to keep the edge they should have made better map variety. Smaller maps allow them to be released quicker and cure the super boring middle part of a game. It's not hard tower of doom where floors catch fire but there are 25 or so exits to different floors. Underwater map where different domes crash and start to flood. It's based off of which domes get damaged more by bullets and explosions. So to save yourself you could shoot into another area to try and damage it more when the timer counts downGiant cliff side where eventually you need to work your way down to the bottom because of a volcano and instead of supply drops there spawns a safe area. If you manage to be the only team in it when lava takes over your team wins and retires. Why not have several winners for a map. still kill off like 80 people.See EZPZ I can't prove it but i literally came up with the second 2 just now. Here's another one a cave that fills up in segments with flammable gas but is only ""lost"" when it explodes. I feel like this new map isn't going to fix anything. It needs to provide where no one else does. Map VARIETY. How about a super small map with only 40 50 people. It's going to eventually flood but there are boats. Everyone starts in the center. Less about guns and more about getting a boat first.How about the first team to destroy something? Or the first team to mad max an exit everyone spawns with guns in cars (squad only) and have to drive to an exit. 25 cars all trying to outrun a tsunami. COME ON PUBG I COULD DO THIS ALL DAY.This is fun I'm going to keep editing this with ideasFloating islands to work your way down you have to find parachutes. And 30 seconds before the island blows up a big soft spot spawns that you can land without dieing. adds the delicious spice of betrayal as a squad with 3 parachutes and 4 people has one person who just wanted to survive more then the others.Giant Ball keeps rotating but gravity pulls you down to your death if it rotates too much. The rotation direction changes and speeds up each time interval.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Buildings fail to render in properly for me when i land which prevents me from gaining access to said buildings to obtain the loot for varied amounts of time. Now its an early access title at the time of writing this review so im still going to give it a positive review because optimization aside this game has a decent amount of content the guns ae fun to use.

I told myself that I'd just play it for a little then try to get a refund before I could get past 2 hours.But......this game...I dont know wtf it is about this game. It just works. After playing it for over 12 hours I still can barely figure out why I like it.I'm a big fan of very Short Loading Times as for this game I've yet to have a problem getting into a game in which case takes about 10 seconds total for matchmaking to start and I'm in a lobby.Performance wise FOR NOW I know it is CPU taxing. But it hasn't been optimized....YET! So anyone you see complaining about performance most likely does NOT understand anything about how early access can work (BTW I'm running a GTX 1060)If you're gonna buy this game and play it understand that You might need to run it on low settingHave patience it WILL be optimizedPlay with friends (that makes it more interesting)Loot Loot Loot Loot..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

However i am still imrpessed by this game being that its a 100man free for all on a big island. There seems to be some rampant aimbotters in some lobbies and i hope the DEVs will fix that in the next update. all in all this game is good its too early to tell how if it will be a massive hit but i will give credit where credit is due.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The sound is one area that needs some work but at the same time it is a big part of what makes the gameplay so good. I hope they do not change it too much.

Hit detection is way off you can punch someone 4 times in the back and they might only get hit once but you can be sure the guy running in a straight line towards ou will hit you and 1 shot you no matter how you dodge. your automatic weapon might suddenly stop firing through no fault of your own bullet spread is random as hell and seems higher if you weapon is on automataic regardless of how many shots you fire climbing a wall is a task shotguns are next to useless unless you're litterally shoving it up someones and firing.But all that could be wrote off as just early development problems it could get fixed and all would be forgiven if just the developer weren't such a money hungry asshat willing to ban anyone killing his popular streamers cause he cares more about sales than the actual people playing his games and should one of his precious streamers call ""stream sniping"" (even though he's the idiot broadcasting his location to everyone) you cna be sure said guy is gone within a few hours even if he had no idea who he killed and was actually playing legit.All in all poorly made cashgrab with microtransaction in early development devs and bad optimisation. spend your cash on spicy food instead that way you might atleast enjoy it a little before your get's ed",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

New features and maps are very slow to come out so the game gives a low value for the money in itself and especially compared to many other titles such as Rocket League or Overwatch to name a few.Add the creator's pathetic lawsuit against a similar game in an attempt to stifle competition by force rather than improving their own product and I don't see a long bright future for this game.3/10 would not recommend.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,177,True,Not Recommended,TL DR Simple game idea totally fine to kill some time with but lacks depth has huge graphics and server issues &amp the devs can't or don't want to fix anything even though they are rolling in cash. Therefore a thumbsdown. 100 people jump out of an airplane on an island last man standing wins. It's an easy game recipe and quite the fun to kill some time with but it lacks depth and has really annoying graphics issues (had to copy the game over from HDD to SDD game was pretty much unplayable otherwise). The server often go full potato as well sometimes with random lag spikes during games sometimes they won't even let you queue. Other than that there are plenty of other annoying things the main menu for example often resets your server choice to Asia for whatever reason doesn't register clicks (I usually can't cancel a queue) and is overall just awful.The game is alright for the given price however I still give it a thumbsdown it's one of the most played and most streamed games on Steam for quite some time now and yet there is still almost no improvement in terms of server performance and graphics performance and no major gameplay update either. At this point it's probably safe to say that this game suffers from the same fate as many other early access games on steam the devs just cash out on it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is not caused by low pupulation as it was working fine before the patch and currenlty refreshing the lobby every 30 seconds sometimes fixes it. So to fix this problem bluehole has scrapted OCE FPP DUO servers and claimed that the low population of the region is the problem where this is clearly a lie. Instead of fixing the problem they have released paid event passes for an already paid game.

2018-06-18,0,0,76,False,Not Recommended,So the game is not bad its okay at best. It was fun for a while but i can't recommend this game to anyone as there is one big issue which is that there are a lot of preformance issues (for me anyway). To try to combat these preformance issues i bought more RAM i went from 8 GB DDR3 to 16 GB. This helped a bit it improved my loading times and how quick things loaded in but i was still laging so i bought a hard drive just for PUBG which only improved my loading times a bit as i was not loading the game from my main hard drive. For my graphics im using a GTX 1060 6GB verson and for my CUP i have a core i5 4460 which could be accounted for a small portion of issues but not on the scale i was having. Also i was running the game at medium to low settings apart from draw distance wich i had on max (if anyone was wondering).Because of these issues i quit playing the game as it was not enjoyable also it became repetitive and boring.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-04,0,0,45,False,Not Recommended,Very interesting game but you might not enjoy it sometimes as match making is not established by experienced or skill by players. If you had purchased it and jumped in to play expect that you might be playing with a player that is above your level that can overplayed you. So it means that you might not be able to even pick up a gun and instantly you died. Very frustating in my experienced even changing the gun to fully automatic. Yes you need to press B to change it to either Burst or Fully Automatic but the default is Single shot so you might wonder why he has a better gun than yours.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,23,True,Recommended,This game is great. Huge map lost of kills and deaths. But for this price this is (for now) way too high. 25% of the time you will die by lag bug or connection lost to host. Which can be very frustrating because you always start back with nothing.I wish this easly access will fix thoses problems because they will lose a lot of players.Other than that the map is huge. You can play more than 100 times and never explore it all. Since the game always start at random place it makes it always random. Sometime you die fast other time you die at the end.Overall I love it. I just hope they can fix all bugs pretty soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,453,False,Not Recommended,What started as a promising and fun early access game with explosive player interest has been left to stagnate by the developer/publisher. They responded to the huge influx of players and cash from early access purchases by focusing on new ways of monetizing with paid crate purchases and now a battle pass scheme instead of fulfilling promises of improvements to the core game which still has many of the same issues plaguing it since early access. Repeated patch regressions and inability to address cheaters make it unclear if they even know how to address the problems if they focused on that instead of monetization.The player base is predictably dying out and it's easy to see why.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Get TABG instead.Used to be fun but all of the ing lootboxes and lack of optimisation killed it. Personally I never found an issue with hackers but it seems to be a big issue. Many people agree that the lootboxes are as bad as EA. Runs like /b&gt on even a decent computer.The Dev team do not seem to care about this game anymore. They are trying to sqeeze as much money as they can out of this even going as far as to sue Epic Games for copying their idea (which if it had been successful might have resulted in bluehole getting sued by H1Z1) instead of actually improving the game to compete.If you want a similar game pick up Totally Accurate Battlegrounds it is a ton more fun and pretty cheap ( 4) with NO INGAME PURCHASES OR LOOTBOXES.If you want a better game equally as realistic pick up Warface I hear they have a pretty good Battle Royale mode (free).If this is too mature for you don't pick up Fortnut It's a complete cancer fest.

2018-05-31,0,0,309,False,Recommended,A Third Person/First Person interchangable game where you can find joy excitement and disapointment all within the same minute. RNG is a factor in your success and failure when up against any number of opponents. With PUBGs taxing requirements your frames dropping if your rig isn't up to the standard will have those added on top of RNG. While not a bad game it just isn't the end all be all game. With teammates it becomes more so a scavenger hunt on who prefers what and who does what better. With attachments like scopes grips magazines stocks and muzzles guns can have increased stats more aligned to how you prefer to play though most times you will settle for what's there promoting adaption to situations as best as possible. There are vehicles which can be as much salvation as much as a death sentence where a motorcycle can flip over and cause your run to come to a sudden stop as soon as you hit the ground or being hit by a vehicle that you just got out of on a slope. There are many factors. As a game though it isn't bad lots of issues I have with it but it's still a good time.In short I recommend this game to people who just like seeing if they can make the best out of a situation.P.S.

FPS is all over the place even after optimization. Still see there is early game lag consistently this has been a recurring theme for about 12months now in and out of patches. Obviously the devs and management aren't interested in refining the fundamentals to ensure the game is playable. It's disgraceful to still see various audio bugs and yes I've invested in a high end headset.

My favorite aspect of this game is the breathtakingly realistic skyline almost creating a ""flat earth"" image which I believe in fully.Now the majority of this essay will be about my critiques all of them being PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Battlegrounds' terrible and I mean terrible foliage. My main and most game breaking concern relating to the vegetation in this game has to do with my graphics settings. Due to my economical and erratic mental state my GAMING PC is not as good as the others who play this game. This is good for me as I can see any and all players hiding in tall shrubbery but a major disadvantage for a bulk of the target ""gamers"".The verdure in the title needs much work especially on the desert map which is appalling compared to PUBG's main map Miramar. I know that a desert's contrast of colors is very minimal yet this is no excuse for the unpleasant and frankly ugly herbage in this world. I would love to meet the degenerates who refer to themselves ""map designers"" who are nothing but sweaty overweight and unhygienic mortals working for a hive mind developer known as ""Bluehole"".Now that I've let my bitter complains be heard I would like to recommend an idea to the ""map developers"" on this game. The underwater scene has to be improved for this application to succeed past its expiration date. The fact that there is no kelp growing from the seafloor drives me to the point of insanity. I have nearly lost mind diving into the realistic waters only to find the unrealistic herbal growth. I would not recommend this game to botanists or plant enthusiasts or if you have schizophrenia.

This fresh idea on BR is nice to play but at its current state I honestly cannot understand why there thought it was releases day ready. IT IS NOT.This version of BR is alot eaiser and when I say that I mean that as it puts everything on a plate for you Tells you your exact POS on the map. Gives you a line that actually directs you to the zone. So if your a OG like me and came from arma this is like playing agaisnt bots for us. It is soo easy forget the days of having to read map cords and trying to figure out where you were on the map. There is now a fat white arrow that you can just follow. The UI is lovely to use also! In the current state which includes Awful gun lag Ping lag Rubberbanding Hackers and awful hitboxes. I cannot recommend it.

2017-06-11,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Product received for free. IntroductionPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle royale 100 players open world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo duo and squad (3 4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward you hop off a plane loot weapons armors and equipments from buildings and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle royale game out there yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known PUBG has had a highly successful launch securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle royale PvP look no further. You've struck the gold.My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gatherinng as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. A learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. 7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.Cons1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very low fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. One of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood squirts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback I have to say that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally 1 or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid The controls are NOT reactive horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to driveConclusionDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!P.S I already addressed my low playtime hours issue in the comments section. Please kindly read all the comments if you believe my playtime hours is insufficient to write a review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-27,0,0,275,True,Recommended,Great game developers update the game constantly and there is much and you can play the game pretty much however you want. For example if you want to be sneaky and passive or aggresive and all in you can do that.*However* there are some issues and micro transactions you need to know about right now you can be straight up banned for killing a streamer doesnt matter if you actually stream snipe or not. When it comes to micro transactions there are on cosmetics and doesnt really give any unfair advantage (maybe the camo jackets will save you 1 in 100 games but thats about it) Lots of people complain about this system which i feel is unfair since you can also earn everything in game This game is also very frustrating in the beggining since you can die pretty much anytime (seeing enemies or not) so if you are getting tilted very easily you are probably better of playing something else.The game for me is easily one of my biggest obsesions in a really long time. I would give it atleast a 7/10 and most things that are problems most likely wont be in the near future because of the great developing team.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,514,False,Recommended,Battlegrounds é uma excelente mesclagem de um fps realista + survival + third person em um massivo mapa onde 100 jogadores batalham e somente um sai vivo (2 ou 4 se jogar com amigos). Conforme os números de vivos vão diminuindo a tensão e o medo de sobreviver até ao final aumentam proporcionalmente! As mecânicas de tiro são excelentes a mais realista que já esbarrei e devido ao grande tamanho do mapa entender conceitos como bullet drop zeroing comunicar citando a bússola passam a se tornar essências. Saber quando engajar em um combate ou quando deixar dois grupos se matarem faz com que cada decisão sua tenha um peso grande para a sua sobrevivência. PUBG tem sido umas das melhores experiências de online shooters que já tive quase toda partida parece única e mesmo com você perdendo tirar algum aprendizado e proveito dela é algo constante o que torna o gameplay bem engajante e convidativo para tentar diferentes táticas não ter medo de arriscar de vez enquando e saber a hora de ficar escondido ou atirar.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Foreseeable future for this all guns are unlockable but you gotta pay for burst firing mode and full auto firing mode. (great job devs)2 players are to pay for everything event pass? what is this?

2018-06-28,0,0,338,False,Not Recommended,This game had promise once. But completely inept developers a lead developer whose ego is far larger than it should be and terrible design have ruined it. Every few weeks there's some new announcement about some new stuff they're adding to the game which sounds great except that stuff is always ALWAYS locked in crates that you have to pay to open. The event pass is a complete joke on every level just more begging for money from the idiots in charge. All the while the game still runs like garbage and looks like it belongs in a game catalogue from ten years ago. If they would hand the game over to someone who actually knew what they were doing and quit trying to monetize every tiny little aspect of it it might become something again. But as it stands this game honestly cannot die fast enough. Get this terrible designer out of the business because he's a joke.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,482,True,Recommended,I absolutely love this game!What i like about this game is that you enter a game choose a location and go there.Sometimes there will be many players around your location and you will need to fight for the loot! DThe good thing is that it does not matter if you die but its about having fun killing people and its more fun if you play with your friends.We and some friends have some funny epic moments at times it may be some fail we do or good play )My computer run the game very well and i have a I5 4690k prosessor 16 gb ram and RX 480 grafic card. In average i think i have around 70 fps but it goes at times from 30 to 100.The game need more improvement but its on the way.I recommend this game for people that likes to jump into a game and start killing and having fun with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,Do not entertain this game in it's current state. (I Have warned you)I have a system that is over the minimum requirements yet I can not get the game to load before dying. After scrolling through the help forums and having to add refresh 144 maxMem 13000 malloc system force feature level 11 0 USEALLAVAILABLECORES sm4 lowmemory just in the startup properties tells everyone the game is far from optimised. Without going into specs and starting a debate I run SQUAD on max servers no issues and many other AAA games on High if not the highest of settings. I can not recommend a game that is impossible to play in this state. Basically if you dont have the highest specs of a system you will struggle to run the game. People are even telling the world in the disscussion area that they themselves have been out and upgraded parts of their systems just to get this to work. If a free game by a company that is known for ripping people off 'LAST MAN STANDING' can get the basics right as a f2p game I would expect an early access or not game to be optimized awaiting just more content to complete the game with a few tweeks here and there.I can not comment on the game play as it is completely unplayable. Though I did get in once and got to see that I am not the only player with issues as when the game did load there was 6 other players stood still waiting either to get in ot their client had crashed. Which I happly punched them to death to only get shot from somewhere else that was my 5 minutes of gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-21,0,0,81,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game barely functions as it is right now. I understand that this is early access and that players who buy the game now are agreeing to play an unfinished game but this game is miles away from just being unfinished. It really shouldn't have been released as it is right now.Lag and netcode are probably the biggest issues right now. You have to try 3 or 4 times to pick up items from the ground you'll be killed around walls you'll teleport and you'll see tons of people teleporting all over the place as they mow you down with shotguns.Lots of the mechanics of the game are pretty broken too. Driving sucks. Cars flip over or go sailing through the air after hitting the smallest bump in the ground. Grenades lag through the air at a few FPS giving you no indication they were from in the first place and when you are the one throwing them you're given this horrendous animation where your character holds out the grenade for about 5 seconds before actually throwing it. Movement is super clunky and the playable area is just poorly implemented. I get that these features may be improved upon as more updates come out but so much of the game is so broken that it was just a bad idea to release the game in any way in this state. I mean if you're in third person view the crosshairs aren't actually placed where you're gun is shooting.Look when the game is fun it's really fun but that's maybe 5% of the time. As for the rest 5% will be spent dealing with your game crashing and the other 90% of your play time will be divided evenly between really frustrating moments and long periods of sitting around doing absolutely nothing as you wait for the end game to start.As it is I strongely recommend against purchasing Playerunknown's Battleground.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-28,0,0,123,True,Not Recommended,The game itself isn't that bad. However with the lack of vaulting and jumping being an absolute joke moving around the map can be a chore. Opening doors picking up items and getting into vehicles is more unresponsive than AMD's Radeon software. Optimization is a joke for how the game looks it should not stutter and drop frames the way it does. The game looks okay but not good enough that you should need a top of the line GPU CPU and SSD to run it almost stutter free.Personally I'm waiting for optimization patches before I bother playing anymore.

The reward/gain system is lacking and i find it almost disapointing whenever i go the ""spend the points"" route . Hopefully they will work on the reward system and keep me motivated to pley.

I'd recommend this game 9/10!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-27,0,0,75,True,Recommended,"Was very skeptical about this game when I read about all the bugs and glitches and whatnot.But I decided to give it a shot after all because everyone seems to be playing it.I'm actually positively surprised never have I felt this kinda thrill in any other shooter before.The tension the excitement the fear of running into a flanker while going around that corner the satisfaction you feel when your squad successfully takes out another squad the way you strategize with your squad like you're an actual SWAT team on a battlefield.I play this game on 2560x1440 and default high at 70 80 fps and the game plays super mooth and at the same time looks amazing so personally don't understand the complaints of bad optimization.Also the sound Footsteps (which also sound different per surface) directional gunfire and explosions there's even a difference in sound between a bullet hitting 10 meters ahead of you right under your feet in your legs or in your face.So far the only issues I've had were that I sometimes can't interact anymore (can't open doors or pick up loot with F).Loot spawning halfway inside a wall and you can't pick it up either manually or in the inventory.Sometimes there's a bit of latency lag but I'm impressed by how well the servers seem to handle the load so far.And ... One time when I ended up in the last 3 players with my friend (so we were 2 of the 3) and we both got ""Network problem detected"" (we were still able to talk on Discord flawlessly so definitely not an issue on our side and we're from a different country so definitely not coincidence) on our screen as soon as we started shooting the other last player and then 10 seconds later it bumped us to the scoreboard saying we were #2/50 definitely something that needs to be looked at because I get the feeling this might be some sort of latency hack (or if it's the server itself still a gamebreaking issue but there was no lag at all that entire game until that moment).In the current state I give it a 7/10 would probably give it a 9/10 if they rooted out the issues I listed and when they add the vaulting and other mechanics (assuming they're properly functional).Definitely looking forward to see what more they'll do with this at this point it could only get better unless they really decide to mess it up for god knows what reason.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But between the swarm of high ping players(usually chinese) and the god aweful servers i simply cannot recommend this game to anyone. Region lock is a MUST not having it has ruined this game for me im sick of seeing 10+ shots spray blood yet buddy takes 0 damage because im shooting at someone with 500+ ping. i can handle horrid servers. i can handle high ping players from across the world that dont speak english. but when you combine the two you create one of the most horrible online experiences possible in a video game.1.0 my it was only pushed to release for those christmas sales.Edit i would like to further my stance as of the update in May 2018 involving new weapon balance this game has gone to utter i dont know what the they did but hit registery went out the window with this update. shotguns are literally useless at this point you have a better chance of hitting a dartboard blindfolded than killing with them ive hipfired people point blank with the shots just hit the wall behind them. dont ing waste your money some day a compentent company will step up and give us a good game just wait until that day because this games performance goes down with every update.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Pros Enjoyable game addictive solid gun play and a great premise.Cons Map gets repetitive Every house layout is similar if not the same Guns are VERY similar often only differing in ammo type and poor optimization make this game at times hard to play.Overall this game is quite excellent with a few exceptions for the price however i hope they add more to the base game instead of releasing overpriced DLC.

2017-05-10,0,0,493,True,Recommended,"This game is perfect mix between arma3 and h1z1. It takes imersion and movement of arma 3. It has the smooth h1z1 feeling and ofc the gamemode.Spawning is less random since everyone starts from the same CJ 130 and is free to jump out when they wish. This and better hitboxes paired with better netcode make this game more viable for eSports than h1z1. There is not a eSports scene yet but TSM sinced 2 players into a beched PUBG roster.The map is really good big and varied. Map is located in soviet russia.It has everything from military airbases and shooting ranges to large enterable schools and churches. Terrain does not have those big mountains h1z1 has but terrain feels all around more varried and dosnt have too many of these completly flat ""h1z1 blackberry"" fields. There is generaly less loot in the map when compared to h1z1 but the gas starts moving quicker at the start of the round. There is more vehicles in the map also.There is larger indoor areas than in h1z1. Map has underground tunnels there is castles and fields everywhere when h1z1 has same dang houses everywhere.You can customise your weapons with scopes grips stocks mags and muzzles. You can loot different level of gear from 1 3. For example lvl 1. vest is basic kevlar vest that every officer has in the car. lvl 2. vest is used by police specials forces like SWAT. lvl 3. vest is military vest used by army. There is also multiple weapons of same caliber wich makes getting ammo ezier. This game has more weapons than h1z1 for example it has 3 shotguns (pump saiga 12k and douple barrel)Games UI has more imformation that h1z1s UI. you can see your self in a map. There is also minimap in bottom right corner.PUBG has more vehicles than h1z1. you have UAZ motorcycle with side cart sandbuggys and motorboats.Vehicle physics are way more realistic. Cars dont break if you drive into a bush You cant jump out of a moving car.In conclusion this game is what h1z1 kotk should have been.only is performance but since this game just releaced and its running on unreal engine i belive that fps issues will be fixed. Please dont quote me on that.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-10,0,0,169,True,Recommended,Good game as is but if you expect silky smooth performance go elsewhere. This game is TERRIBLY optimized. Textures not loading cant heal teammates cant pick up guns and a lot more game breaking bugs. But once you get through those the game itself is a great game with solid foundations. With only monthly updates it might be ahwile before this game is fully optimized unfortunately. I would only reccomend this if you are patient enough to get through all its current bugs. The gameplay itself is fantastic though and can get quite intense when theres only a handful of people left.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,0,0,28,True,Recommended,This game is truly intense and as the body count rises the tension only increases. So far my best showing was finishing 6 out of 98 before getting my head blown off by a sniper.As a fan of the novel Battle Royale this is my bread and butter. An awesome experience. My one strong complaint is that sometimes it gets so choppy particularly when someone opens fire on me that it is impossible to do anything but die. Tap Z as fast as you want if you are unlucky you will be dead before you can even turn around and not because of a good shot on their part but because of performance issues. My PC isn't a potato either this is in serious need of some optimization.Also the reward crates are toooooooo expensive once you get a few under your belt. I understand the desire to increase replayability but some of us are adults who don't have hours upon hours every day to play a game to unlock a shirt. Paring the bundle cost down would be much appreciated.tl dr Buy this game enjoy the tension but be prepared for frustrating deaths from time to time.

If so you might get 1 or 2 kills early in the game on unlucky unarmed guys otherwise you die like them. if you've survived the first 5 minutes on the ground you gotta find a vehicle or the game turns into 'running simulator' for 2 miles. then you either die in a close range encounter where you'll immediately lose you or get shot at from who knows where while trying to get to cover.And then you do it again and again and again.

2017-08-04,0,0,97,False,Not Recommended,Updated ReviewBluehole has made millions off of PUBG but has refused to put any time or money into fixing very basic problems. As of writing the game is still extremely poorly optimized and riddled with bugs. This is acceptable for some amount of time but given how long this game has been out and the essentially unlimited budget that Bluehole has they have instead turned their attention towards paid cosmetics and multi platform release so that they can make even more money off this poorly coded mess.If you're still thinking about buying this game don't. Like so many other early access games PUBG was a fun fad for a short time but has been ultimately crippled by developers who don't give a Vote with your wallet and don't support s.Old ReviewIs it worth the $30 I spent on it?Hell Yes.Disclaimer This is an online only game and if you have a poor internet connection I do not reccommend purchasing.This is a game that chooses to do one thing very well Battle Royale. Besides that this game has loads of bugs. It is very poorly optimized. It is super smooth at times and super clunky at others. However the overall experience i've had with this game is very good because it's core mechanic is extremely fun whether you play alone or with friends.You like to play for fun? Play a match where you hilariously to run people down with cars instead of playing tactically with guns.You like to play to win? Do your best to be the last man standing in a 100 person free for all and feel your heart race as the clock ticks down and you realize you've made it to the top 10.The true greatness of this game is that you can play however you like and have fun regardless of your goal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,426,True,Recommended,PUBG literally just released onto Early Access and it's already in a better state than most the other BattleRoyal style clones. It has lots of varied weapons/attachments 3 tiers of equipment to find and lots of different clothing variations to find. The gun play is in a very good place right now. If you like this style of game this game won't disappoint you.Edit 05/10/2017We are now just about two months into Early Access release and the game continues to get weekly updates. They have been constantly fixing bugs and making server and client improvements. They have so far stuck to their statement of not adding in extra cosmetic features for money until after Early Access is over even with the immense publicity the game has receieved. At the rate they are going I fully expect them to be able to hit their 6 month full release window.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At first the game had somewhat of a realistic feel to it in terms of weapons and their attachments. But they removed nearly all realistic combinations and won't allow you to fit for example an 8x scope on a M416 or M16 while it should be able to fit since it has a picatinny rail ')..

And it's too much luck involved for my taste. Yes it's ea but it's not really enjoyable atm because of bad performance fps drops lags clunky aiming/movement bad hitreg ...If you really really want to play it like i did buy it it's ok. But I wouldn't pay 30$ again. Maybe when it's finished it will be worth it. I hope so the game has huge potential. And i hope i'll change my review. But i can't recommend it for that price atm.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-10,0,0,95,True,Recommended,Well.. I figured I would finally review this game. It can be so fun and frustrating at the same time... I know this is only early acess but I really hope the optimizing anti cheat is high up on the list of priority of the devs. In my humble opinion for a Early Access I give it...7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,0,0,217,True,Recommended,Im writting this review while this game is still in early access so bear that in mind.This game is by no means complete. Sketchy hit boxes common crashes and a hand full of bugs are still present in the game. But im ok with that the game is in early access and I've seen something happen in the past weeks what i havent seen in other early access games progress. The devs are working tirelessly to optimize the game and we are seeing pretty frequent updates. The team is dedicated and listens to the community something that is unfortunately rare with games today.Gameplay itself is fantastic there are moments where you are panicking as you scramble to find a weapon and there are moments where you hold in breath as enemies walk past you as you wait for the right moment to strike. Here a quick summary of a basic game you jump off a plane with 99 other players. You trying to either find a quiet spot to land and start looting or maybe you're feeling ballsy and decide to head for a major town and duke it out in hopes of getting great loot.Once looted you try to stay alive as possible while staying in the game zone going from compound to compound or by staying in the forest.End game is never the same. Sometimes itll be in a town sometimes itll be in a forest. But the one thing that is always the same is how you feel ing nervous lol. You go from cover to cover spotting and taking down enemies (or letting them kill each other) before going in for the final kill. Winning a game is honestly one of the most rewarding experiences its certainly more rewarding than winning in a game in say counter strike or BF1.Do I recommend the game? Yes but only if you have a mid tier gaming pc. Having the minimum specs seems to result in frequent crashes for now. The forums are active and also there is an active discord dedicated to helping players squad up and win some matches.https //discord.gg/pB2AygKFeel free to say hi to me in game and im always down to squad up or duo! (Darklord)Happy hunting folks.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-10,0,0,27,True,Recommended,When I heard about this game I thought it wouldnt be for me and boy was I wrong. The combat is gripping and fast paced the circle is terrifying and I think I get a legitimate adrenaline rush when I get into the top 15. The graphics are pretty good. A little bit of optimising would be nice I have a gtx 970 and it runs pretty meh but I cant complain for an early access game.BUY THIS GAME ITS GREAT,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-29,0,0,247,True,Recommended,Players Unknowns Battlegrounds...I played about 170h and still dont know how I abbreviate this.For Now on lets call it Players.Well first the game engine is like Arma 2 DayZ which results in performance issues performance issues performance issues.Its driving me insane that this game doesnt look like BF4 but runs with 50fps.Problem is everything runs squishy and vague therefore the competition is not between player skill but rather the PC components itself.So if you have a 1000 PC its really fun to play.The Gameplay allows diversity everytime you start and encourage you to play another round after you loose.All in all great game I rate 8/10 and its definitely worth the 25 bucks if you like survival combat shooter and looting.I hope it will hit ist final release in about 1 year and didnt get ed up like rust or so.PS props for the Players Unknown Team for keeping the game alive with new content updates,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The sound is abit messed up it was too quite before but now you can hear people crouching in the next building. One last thing parachutes need to be quicker.That's pretty much the only major improvements for me right now.Right the good stuff....Good It is action packed you constantly see people and can be hunting them for 5 minutes and wait to see if they get killed by other people or you shoot them the most amazing feeling is getting a headshot and downing/killing them with one bullet. The game is no where near as buggy as H1Z1 and the mechanics are alot better.

Don't spend the $30 if you don't have firends that want to play this game. The patches have fixed somethings but the patches bring up new problems and they don't really care to fix it as fast as they can.I have lost respect for the developers and PlayerUnknown himself as they seem they don't know what they are doing and prioritizing things they shouldn't be like making a new map when the current map isn't completely optimized and playable for some people.Thats my recommendation but its still your choice.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-20,0,0,564,False,Not Recommended,So I am just shy of hitting 500 hours of this game been playing it for over a year and what can I say about this game? It is extremely fun met my expectations when it first came out but why the concern and do I not recommend this game? Well besides the hackers and other things there is one thing that has become clear and why this game will slowly start to lose traction or until the developers give up on it. Lately they've made some huge changes to try and pump life back into the game. Nothing wrong with changing the meta but this is the issue. The frame rate drop makes the game unplayable at times and this use to never be an issue for me. I saw the comments of people complaining about the game not being optimized but now it has become clear that the game is a mess. There are times when I am playing I am running over a 100+ frames and then there are times for example during the event mode Desert Knights (I believe is the name) where at one point I was down to 9 frames. I believe that the pressure of Maverick coming to closed beta soon Call of Duty's Blackout mode coming in the fall and then potentially a Battlefield BR that the devs are starting to feel the pressure of keeping up. Right now they are taking risks because they feel they have to or they have the ability because they know that if their players would rather play Fortnite they would have already left (Personally the art style is the only reason why I don't play it over PUBG). My recommendation is if you haven't bought this game don't. There is more options coming to the market so save your money and see how PUBG responds because if they don't do something this game will be dead in a years time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Until then I can't recommend you get this game unless you want hours of your effort rewarded by problems that are out of your hands.(For reference I'm running this game off an SSD using a GTX 1070 so be warned even if you have very decent specs).EDIT The game is runnning significantly better at this point in time and although it does still crash now and again it is a much changed experience.

2017-05-12,0,0,294,True,Recommended,Ok let me summarize this for you as noobly as possible.You like H1z1 king of the kill? Yes? Then you will love this even more!This game offers a smoother game play and a much more diverse map and drop off points than H1z1 KOTK.Ok fine this game is much more expensive for an Early Access but it is definitely worth the price if not more!The aesthetics and feel are more realistic than any other Battle Royale type of game out there.From the sound of a gunshot from a distance away the sound of footsteps running towards and around you to the sound of the numerous vehicle available. The game also excels in keeping the game active throughout. It makes you want to camp out and be patient but at the same time it gives you the sense of urgency that you have to move or the electric field will devour you. The choice is yours. I must admit that I never had this feeling playing H1z1 KOTK.Ok you do get an occassional server issue like being disconnected midway through the game which is frustrating. But come on this game is still on Early Access and things WILL improve eventually I hope anyway. Overall this game is definitely worth the price tag and am glad that I purchased this on Early Access. TLDR? BEST BATTLE ROYALE GAME EVER!! YES BETTER THAN KOTK!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-12,0,0,576,True,Recommended,Out of the time I've invested in it which isn't a lot ( like 150 something hours) I can highly recommend this game.Out of a 10 I give it a fair 9.It's not a bad game nor is it the greatest thing to come out like sliced bread but it's good.It would be higher if it weren't for some bugs.Like the optimization issues and some shooting bugs.For example in order for me to avoid getting stuck on a building if I land on it or it being loaded well I set my graphics settings to low then after it loads and I get my gear and ready to roll I set it back to high.After that I have no issues through out the game this issues occurs when I land not in the lobby island.That's my only main issue I have in 98% of the time.But I have bin told it's because of the ram I have 8 gigs.So maybhe if I had more it would fix it and also bin told installing it ON a ssd might help too but I'll figure that out.But for the most part the game is fun and hella addictive well for me and friends.All bugs aside the game is pretty good so far.It is Early Acess after all so the game will improve with time.For me it's worth the time.It's best played with friends but solo is great to sharpen your skills.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-30,0,0,1002,True,Recommended,I have played for a while now 31.6 hours i have had the sneaking suspicion that this game could ruin a lot of other FPS games out there. The idea is awsome it takes a minute to switch thinking from those other brands out there. that being said this game will be incredible with different modes objectives i saw 111 000 (ish) players on one evening. great numbers when stacked against the other brands. the co opt game is alive and well in this game 2 and 4 player teams squads you will get the poop scared out of you at least every other game. There isn't a ton of difficult menues to deal with this game has a pretty easy learning curve but don't be fooled there is a current downside to this game besides the optimization issue which obviously this is pre release under construction if you will There is a exploitation issue...plainly the cheaters are starting to ruin the game.pro great price wonderful game concept one large map with many ways the fight can develope over a large vast area.con optimization and the typical cheater exploiter element.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-01,0,0,120,True,Recommended,Well either they had these updates stored away to be used after release or they are just really awesome Devs. Either way this game runs much better than other similar games and is a tonne of fun even by yourself. Yes it needs more content and it needs a first person only mode with adjustable FOV but I honestly feel like I've got most of my money's worth. It also has WAY LESS bugs than other titles like DayZ.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-01,0,0,821,True,Recommended,This game is so much fun. It still has its bugs (fair enough with early access) but none of them are debilitating. The gameplay is fantastic often with suspense and a heavy adreneline rush. Can't wait for the finished product. I got it a couple of days ago and have already put in about 12hrs.What I would like Ability to climb onto stacked crates/low roofs. Team chat ability in the lobby. An onscreen indicator indicating from which direction you were hit. More explosive weapons. Triggerable deployment items eg. Claymores. Mode Locked to 1st person view Mode Squad based random mixing with push to talk locked to broadcast to all so you can hear people communicating when you're close to them eg. when you're inside a house and can hear them preparing to breach.

2017-11-11,0,0,499,False,Not Recommended,"EDIT 6/13/18 Alright so I have now changed my review from Recommend to Do Not Recommend. As you can see below I wrote a pretty glowing review for PUBG at the time. Well I am getting quite tired of a game that makes progress in all the wrong ways. Since I wrote this review performance got better sometimes. And that is quite ridiculous. MY BIGGEST PROBLEM is the constant ""maintenance down times"" for the servers. Bluehole stresses this is to help back end performance but there is no other multiplayer game out there that has this many down times. It happens about 2 3 times a week for many hours around 10 PM Eastern Time which is a peak time for a large percentage of PUBG market. I play this when I got off work usually but now I get off work and ""HEY SERVERS ARE DOWN!"" Great thanks BlueHole. Thanks for the stupid crates you keep adding and those much needed Shroud and Dr. Disrespect Skins. I like this game so much and continue to play it but the annoyances have become something that makes me quite angry. I do not recommend this game because they are not going to fix any of these issues. Just flat out they are not. Don't buy unless you just absolutely feel left out or something. It is a fun game but the developers are completely incompetent now. OLD REVIEW FROM WHEN I HAD HOPE Wow I thoroughly have enjoyed this game. I was beginning to think I wouldn't find another multiplayer game that I genuinely rushed home from work every night to try and log on before my freinds did. I have currently enjoyed this game for 175+ hours and have no intentions of leaving it soon. PUBG has an element of simplicity I haven't been able to get from any other veryyy popular multiplayer shooter out there. PUBG doesn't take that long to get used to and within a few matches if you have common sense and have focus you may just become a great threat in the presence of good loot. You will lose many games but you will also love the rush of the FINAL 10 and finally winning your first chicken dinner. Game is great whether or not you play Solo Duo or Squads. Each one has an element of its own. Here are some pros and cons if you wish to see ____Pros_____ Very random no one can dominate EVERY round. Yes there are some people are exceptional at this game but even then the pros die to people in better situations. Sometimes you will drop in a city and find level 3 everything a billion scopes the best rifles and a suppressor from the get go with the circle going around you each time it shrinks and a sprinkle of Player Unknown's luck. OR You may have a game where you drop only to get no loot and be miles away from safety forcing you to drudge to safety. Somewhat stable I have many friends who tend to be elitist when it comes to game performance and visuals. But in my honest opinion if you play with the settings enough you'll find that perfect set up where the game runs fine. Yes it can get a tad laggy at the start if you land with 40 people but I believe thats a server problem. Nothing to fret. Multitude of guns Prefer shotguns? No problem. Prefer snipers? No problem. Prefer an SMG? You get the drift here. If you can find it there is a gun out there for everyone and if you play with a squad you all can switch guns to fit your playstyle. The game has a multitude of guns that will spur excitement when you come across one. Especially a rare gun in a supply drop. Simple PUBG is rather simple. There are modifications and attachments for every gun but I am known for being terrible with naming guns from past games like COD and Battlefield. I am always the guy having to explain what a gun looked like to my friends because I was lost in a sea of names and different options. PUBG doesn't overwhelm you with fancy options or fancy things to be distracted by. It is simple. And that is just what I need. Crates! Boy oh boy!! I usually play enough to buy 2 weekly crates and sell them immediately on the steam market for about $1 per week. After a while I was able to get Fallout 4 and Don't Starve Together for free just because of the crates in PUBG. I don't care about clothing in the game so I essentially got my $30 completely. Pretty awesome if you ask me.______CONSS______ Stability &amp bugs Alright I know I was bragging on stability earlier but I do need to note that there are times where I've simply lost a gun fight due to something that was out of my control such as server disconnect or something not loading on my screen. This is not a huge issue as it rarely happens. Sometimes bugs are funny too. So just have fun Hackers It gets to the point where I am experiencing one hacker each day. NOT EACH GAME I just mean each day. IF I play a few hours at night with friends. We most likely will see one hacker that night. It hasn't gotten out of hand yet but it is frustrating to get late game and then all of a sudden you are headshot in a windowless bathroom by some guy 3 miles away who totally had no way of seeing you. Or when you see some Barry Allen looking fella running entirely across the map in two seconds. Just be aware. They are out there Shadowplay doesn't work(at least for me) I used to love having the choice to keep some clips from a high kill game but it refuses to work for me now. I hate this so much. I don't really know what to do. I have it enabled in game and in GeForce Experience. Oh wellOVERALL I think it is a great game. If you need me to rate it I give it 8.5/10. This is better than I would give for Overwatch Battlefield 1 GTA V or any multiplayer game simply because it really hasn't lost its shine to me. I will keep playing and I hope to meet one of you out there one day....so I can loot your body lol",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-20,0,0,810,False,Not Recommended,"Got this game last summer when it was on early accessInitially guns have low recoil and fightings are fun and interesting like CSGOGave up on Overwatch and CSGO at that time considered this as was the best fps game. Eating chicken and winning games are the most satisfactory experience ever.Then more and more hackers are coming to the game and in every single match. Your so called ""optimizations"" are bringing more fps drops in game. Now absolutely every single game there's tons of hackers and leaving regular players absolutely no way to counter them and there are always people selling hacks in game and bluehole's not even trying to ban them. The recent patch was the WORST patch at all you bluehole's ""making game more competitive"" strategy deliberatly amplifies most in game gun shot coils which you guys in bluehole thought was a good strategy lol yeah a better way to help hackers/cheaters to get kills and win games. Also there's no more a thing called ""rank"" because in every single game I could see players that are incredibly ""professional"" or hackers rather than ranking different players in different games (which it SHOULD happen in most competitive games).The game is no longer fun and has more toxicity. Now everyone is hiding in somewhere only wishing to kill others by one shot because there's no way one can win the fight with hackers.In conclusion the experience I had in this game in general is bad and I have had no more fun than before. I am considering it as DEADGAME and not recommending them to my friends any more. Going back to play old fps games and will be trying PUBG mobile and Fortnite instead.

2017-09-03,0,0,874,True,Recommended,"Ok my original review called this game a steaming pile of garbage. I felt like I should edit that and explain.First off its a bit of a resource hog. My pc has enough legs to run it but it struggles. I feel like they should have bumped up the ""minimum req."" a bit as even at low settings there will be some issues. Mainly as you air drop in there will occasionally be significant texture lag where you are waiting for nearby buildings to load properly. Until this happens you cannot go into buildings and pick up gear. The solution to this is to deploy your chute earlier and hope that it loads on your way down sometimes it does. Or drop into less populated areas as you will be at a major handicap if you drop into the mansion with 3 other opponents and you cannot enter a building and they can. Basically youre insta dead. Land a little farther out scout some smaller towns first or hunker down behind a building and hide for a moment. Its manageable but if your pc isnt 30% more than the minimum req you will have to learn to deal with it.Now that being said this game is fun as hell. Its early release so Im going to assume that some physics glitches will be sorted out later. Ive crashed cars and barrel rolled them for seemingly no reason. Ive died going over the bars on a motorcycle in a smooth open field. Not often but occasionally you will just get killed by the game. I dont want this to sound all bad... just a buyer be aware review. This game is super fun and addictive. Graphics are pretty good albeit a bit resource intensive. The gun play is super well done vehicles are very fun to drive and have good physics (minus the occasional glitch) .

2017-06-01,0,0,194,True,Recommended,this is one of those games that has everything to be really successful but falls very short from it due to bad servers bad netcode and no antycheat its great fun with friends and if you don't take it too serious but the rage will come dying from 2 bullets when you are fully equiped with level 3 vest and armor when you run in to cover and die a few seconds later don't get me wrong i like the game but its soo frustrating and the updates they come very often but in my opinion and personal experience they have made the game worst an worst if i would recomend this game yes but be aware that its early access and things might take time to get better,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,"back down to 2 stars...Same old copy cat/cash out game with no real improvements.I am very disappointed. You have played this game before but just on a slightly different map and if you hope this will be that style of game minus the jankiness you will also be disappointed.Edit1 New update has helped the game a little and I am also playing more and getting more used to the game so I am upgrading my score just a little to 3 stars....but I can forsee this game now getting better and maybe one day soo changing my recommend to YES instead of no.Edit 2 I have played a lot more and have finally won my first game with also coming in top 10 quite a few times and I am enjoying the game much more. I am very close to changing my reccomendation to ""yes"" but I made the mistake and played some more Tom Clancy Ghost Recon wildlands again tonight.... that game has everything I want a game of this style to be.The graphics controls and sheer size and scope would be perfect for this style of game...maybe someday.Hope new patches will raise PUBG up one more notch but right now graphics and controls this game feels like it is from 1993 compared to Ghost Recon and Ghost Recon feels like it is from the future compared to PUBG.I would gladly pay 60$ for a top tier big budget battle royal game.New edit I am actually lowering the games score to 2 stars for the moment. It is not only NOT getting better quickly enough but it is getting worse because the of the sheer amount of cheaters in the game.Who really has the time to invest in a game where they carefully move along taking their time just to get wall hacked and aimboted? So much cheating in such a new game is a bad sign.The devs have promised to take action but I fear it may be too late and they may not have the resources to be up to the task.Sad.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-23,0,0,413,True,Recommended,The game is great except for 3 things. I have been continuously disconnecting mid game for no reason (it's happened 4 times today. Many times while carrying good loot) You MUST have a good pc to run it (like a 1070 minimum to run over 60fps at high on 1080). Also I HATE the main menu... If it was just a simple layout over a png I'd be happy it takes me like 30 seconds alone just to load the main menu. It's not a big deal but it's annoying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-19,0,0,133,True,Recommended,This game is early access with a dedicated team and lead. So many reviewers forget that this game is an early access working toward full release and not an early access scam. If you dont want a buggy game that is full of glitches and optimisation problems than wait until the game is officially released. This game is insanely fun and addicting. Also with a little internet research and work you can get the game running at a playable level on an i5 and gtx770.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,0,0,231,True,Recommended,Really great Battle Royal type game can be a quick fight or long journey depending on where you want to land which makes this game really easy to get into. My problem with many of these kinds of games is how long it can take to find a match or the long build up of finding equipment just to die in the first fight AND THEN having to find and wait for a new match! But with the surprisingly large player base this game has matches start very fast. Although this game has a ways to go with optimization and diversity of gear it IS still Early Access Hope the devs keep up the good work. Great game worth the money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-01,0,0,31,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Variety is lacking but what can you expect from a game still very much in development?Otherwise it's amazing fun. Drop in from a C 130 die a few times withing a couple minutes until you get the hang of what you're doing and then you will probably place middle of the pack for awhile. People can be bullet sponges at times which it shouldn't be like that. Honestly 6 7.62 rounds should not be required but eh they're working on balance so that's expected to change. I will update my review as the game gets changed.Oh I should mention PLAYERUNKNOWN is spear heading this himself and they actually listen to the community so it's great overall I have high hopes for this game which I didn't have with Rust.My specs are a FX 6120 4.2 GHz and a R9 270X and trust me this game runs like garbage unless you're on very low. Which I don't really understand because I can play Arma 3 on Ultra with more than playable frames. Maybe Unreal Engine 4 just sucks because I have the same issue with ARK and that game has been out for awhile too.Anyways do I recommend it?No not as of right now give it another month or two because servers are not at their best (5 second pauses are very common and freezes less so but still happen way more than I would consider reasonable) and also it crashes a lot too. My friend on a 4770K and 980ti crashes about once every 2 3 games which is a huge no for me. Though I would like to mention that my AMD system has no problems with crashing and in fact my game has yet to crash.Rating 7/10TL DR Wait a bit to get this if you're only here to play a game. Otherwise throw some dollars at it and support the development and play while it's made better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-01,0,0,938,True,Recommended,FIrst you are afraid of everything....even your own footsteps. Then after some hours into the game you are getting more comfortable with the fact that in order to see someoneelse you have to be exposed in some way. So you have to scan your sourroundings constantly listen for gunfire footsteps have a look on the map to know where the circle is etc. It is not a game where you wildly run around and shoot at everything that moves. The game is very exiciting because every step can be your last. In order to succeed you have to be very concentrated and be able to anticipate the movement of your fellow players. Besides all the caution involved when moving and looting the gunfights themselves are usually very quickly resolved wich makes for a really nice pacing during the matches.

2017-06-01,0,0,249,True,Recommended,The problem is that this is EARLY ACCESS. It is impossible to say exactly what will happen next with the game. Better or worse. But now you can say for sure that weak computers do not pull the game medium low FPS and frequent drawdowns (houses trees grass etc. absolutely do not load during the time from 30 seconds to 3 minutes (this is my personal problem)) Steep they have no problems basically. Because of this variation in the parameters it is sometimes unbearable to play.

Although the game is still in its early stages it still manages to keep me entertained for hours wether it's queing up with total strangers or with my friends. It runs quite well after tuning a few graphic settings on my aging mid range PC with constant 60 fps and drops to 15 30 very rarely which is expected from an unfinished product.TL DR The game is great wether you want to play it solo or with friends very competitive and constant updates make this a potential long term game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It seems like he is not interested in developing this game anymore and now thinks he is a good manager and has to press as much money out of the playerbase as possible.In my opinion they should never have gone that route with lootcrates especially if you think about the dropchance for the good items (1/10 000). Which means that you have to pay roughly 20k to get any item worth less than 1k.The Battlepass is the fairer route here but they still it up. At this stage I cannot recommend the game to someone this is mainly because I lost the trust in Brandon Greene as the head of the development team.

It is way better than H1Z1 feels more realistic amazing gunplay vehichles are good quality. The map is well crafted and feels like you have lots of options of wheere to begin. Playing with teams is great thanks to the ""downed"" system where you aren't killed immediately but are knocked into a wounded state where you can only crawl.

I'd definitely say you get your money's worth with the current version just mainly becasue of how much enjoyment you get from it. It is tense fast paced and you can get into the next game in little to no time at all. This is the definitive game for a battle royale styled experience.

2017-04-28,0,0,6,True,Recommended,"TL DR It's OK nothing more nothing less.This is a review for all who play sometimes (2 3hrs per week) besides family work social life. For adults over 30.I like to play shooter on and offline. Nowadays mostly BF1 and Rainbow Six Siege.I noticed this big hype around PUBG a couple of weeks ago and never played any battle royale game. Because most of them are in in a early access state and seem to stay that way.But then I thought let's give it a try PUBG for me is kind of trashy but in a good way most of the time. The graphics are decent the performance underwhelming but still playabale and the gameplay kind of fun. Why just ""kind of""? Because most of the time you just looting that you never are gonna use because when you get in a gunfight most of the time they are very quick. Either you win or not. And if you lose you start from the beginning. And yeah I know that is the concept of the game and it has charm and thrills sometimes but sometimes it is just frustrating. And motivation wise hmm I still don't know why to keep playing this game. As I wrote in the beginning I spent most of the time for other things than games therefore I also do not need big progression systems cosmetic items etc. I am too old for this and do not have enough time. But PUBG is kind of underwhelming.So for everyone who has a similar ""access"" to games and time I will put it that way If you do not have to worry about money and you want just to try something different in the shooter genre you can try it out. I guess you will have a couple of hours fun.Is it worth 30 bucks?Not really. But then I had some fun and do not really care about this amount of money especially for a early access game. 15 for early access and 30 for the finished game would be better (fair) imho.And because perfomance is a huge topic here are my specs which are enough to run the game playable 95% of the time i5 650016GB RAMGTX 107027"" 144Hz 1440p ( &gt with G Sync which is a bonus for such games with unconsistent frame rates) InGame settings medium to high",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have found out that micro transactions are in the tube for this game and I hope it does not turn into another PTW game ? This game is a little hard to figure out at first and is alot better to play in a group for back up reasons. The guns need tweaking big time and alot of the game is in desprate need of optimization and yes before anyone asks yes there are cheats already avail. for it.

2018-06-24,0,0,147,False,Not Recommended,Okay so as far as I understand PUBG Corporation decided to add a paid progression system to the game and more microtransactions. And if you spend money money to buy it about 30% of your items you got while leveling up will expire within few weeks. You are limited to gaining experience. If you haven't played this game for 5 days and finally have time to play at weekend unfortunately it is not possible to make that up because you can only earn 80 XP per day and nothing more. But you can buy levels for 5 dollars. Keep it in mind that PUBG Corporation is a company who earned billions of dollars they could easily made it all for free because 1. this game is already paid and 2. millions of players bought it for 30 dollars (hackers probably even few times).Fortnite is free and does it much better.

2018-06-24,0,0,390,False,Recommended,"Lot of haters out there. I'm always enjoying myself in this game and honestly when playing a game isn't that the only thing that matters?Cons Sure it's got bugs. But a lot of what I see people complaining about seems to be recycled problems from Jan/Feb that as far as I'm experiencing have been fixed. Perhaps it's just me but my issues with FPS drops de synch and occasional freezing/stuttering when using nades went away months ago. Hackers? Where? It was a huge problem back then I'll agree completely but I can say I've only seen one or two in the last month entirely. Only real issues I still have are the occasional vehicle flipping like it's in a blender and about 1 match in 20 my chute will catch on something dumb and having to wait like 5 seconds before I can cut it. A five second delay when hot dropping is usually a death sentence. Now I just do my best to avoid dropping into weird crevices.Pros The replay value here is practically infinite because every match is unique. Some matches I'm dead 10 seconds after hitting the ground...no gun in this house while my neighbor comes busting out with an UMP. Others I'm dining on some fine chicken atop some corpses. Hell my first solo chicken dinner was due to some fool being stuck at the bottom of a cliff when the final circle was on top of the Radio Tower hill on Erangel. It was too steep for him to climb and the only paths up were well into the blue. When it finally shrank to the smallest one he was stuck out of it. Bad call friend. But I'll never forget that because of how interesting it was. Perhaps I'm a little biased as I'm a big fan of Battle Royale. Read the book seen the movie read the manga. All great. I've been waiting for something like this for a while. Fortnight and the others are foolish cartoony and don't have the realism and urgency this game has. You're tossed down with nothing and forced to run fight and survive. Hard to feel the same pressure when you can instantly build walls and stairs or wtfever that crap is in Fortnight. Makes no sense to me. And the colors too....ugh. They still only have one map?I love this game. Is it in my top 10 best designed games? No. Is it in my top 10 most enjoyable games? Absolutely. Top 5 for that matter. Up there with Jagged Alliance 2 the original Legend of Zelda and BF1942.So when it all boils down to it I love this game. I'm optimistic about the changes in the pipeline. I've been down this road before. I've been involved with games at this stage in the development and this is not uncommon. MWO finished up its open beta 'launched' and for about a year people were still ing up storms and claiming the game was still in beta due to performance and balance issues. ""Why are you adding a new mech/map when LRMs are still broken?!"" Sound familiar? Growing pains. It took longer than PGI claimed it would and much longer than us players wanted but eventually got fixed. New 'mech pack/hero mech money grabs ended up turning into performance and balance upgrades/work. People still though...because why wouldn't they?So don't listen to the haters. Give it a shot. Drop and get killed drop and get killed drop and get killed again. Then drop and start killing once you've gotten the hang of it. See you on the island.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-24,0,0,156,False,Not Recommended,Here's my ReviewLike many other's I stumbled accross PUBG via YouTube and watching Twitch Streamers. Initially when I first bought it I hated it. I just needed to come to terms with something this game is all about luck. You can land in a zone score a SCAR and a level 3 vest with no one in sight. Leaving you free to loot and prepare for later zones. Or you can land in a zone with 12 other players raid 3 buildings and get a pistol. This randomness is part of the games system. Each match you don't know what could happen.This game isn't without its faults regardless of what others have said. This game most definetly is not for low mid range gaming rigs. It's already poorly optimized for some of the best hardware on the market. Running an older rig is like tying one hand behind your back. I run a 1080ti and an 8700k and even I set everything to high just to get some decent FPS.The player base is unforgiving to beginners you'll lose and lose and slowly become frustrated after either playing matches where you're playing a running simulator for 25mins or a new session every 5mins because a twitch streamer is pub stomping. Pun intended. Now lets be clear this game has improved greatly. But for what it is I'd say it could be better.PUBG was an innovator the first true PC battle royal game. But the innovation ended as other developers looked on in awe and jealousy as this titan put a choke hold on the PC gaming genre. I for one am sick of Battle Royale. But I'm excited for who will take the genre to the next level. Game's like Islands of Nyne or Escape from Tarkov. If you have little time to actually game a few hours a night or a lower end PC I'd avoid this game. It'll just squash the expectations you had.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To start ""PLAYERUNKOWN"" (an alias that tells you the developer is either 13 or 30) is a complete and thinks he invented the battle royale style of gameplay. Avoid this boy.The server lag and game itself are both kind of unbearable. Servers aren't reliable so no matter how much it looks like you're shooting someone if they have a better connection than you you're dead. The GUI and code in general is broken. In the early days of the game my client would crash any time a stun grenade was used. I think this went for other people too which made it a great weapon. Kill your enemy by just straight up crashing their game.Lastly the playerbase is depressing. Almost every player is a wannabe streamer and if not that they're the most hardcore of gamers.

I've never had a problem with the fact that China isn't region locked. I've actually played on asian servers and still did not lag. I don't get frame drops almost ever. Glitches are rare and pretty much only happen with vehicles. Hit detection is good for the most part. Don't let these things keep you from playing I think there is a lot of exageration in the communityAside from these common complaints the game is very good. In my opinion it is the best battle royale game out right now. The gunplay is amazing and rewarding. Fortnite is more fast paced but I prefer the strategic approach that PUBG takes.

I have seen them use it at cafes by multiple people at several cafes. Server can be laggy so could do SERVER UPGRADES!! Glitches with rendering is common and people found abuses for it.I suggest More maps (smaller maps and bigger maps) Bigger maps obviously more player limit. More variety and selection in squading up. (6 for bigger friends group since 4 is just ehh 10 for clans) Bigger player limit instead of 100 Weather! More weapons (bamboo darts throwing knives ninja stars Tear Gas guns etc.) Rocket Launchers (1 bullet at time and low bullet capacity like 5 max) kinda like Granade but more distance and bigger exlosion radius. Can strategy with big scopes as 8x+ isnt much needed currently) More vehicles and such (6 seat bus but 4 player teams?) Possibly tanks (Sorta like rocket launcher but armored transportation and can blow up cars. Need ammo and 1 bullet at time) Possibly planes (just for transport faster transport easier to shoot down)Overall great game loads of fun especially with a group of cooperating team mates!8/10 but can definitely get 10/10 with a few big updates,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I chilled on it a while deleted the bad review and vowed to start again a fresh start. What i realise now is the problem isnt hackers (although there are some) the game itself is out to get you with its hit registration. I studied every death in my playback folder to try and improve my game and every other death was just what the hell! Blood flying on my screen but a miss on theirs bullets hitting a different spot from where my crosshair is during CQC other players spraying and praying at me and the one and only bullet that hits is a headshot. This also isnt a one sided thing after watching some of my kills in slow motion i could clearly see that i actually missed when i fired but the enemy was hit. This needs fixing ASAP as every enemy you meet is either ungodly good or absolute garbage depending on how the netcode is treating them.All that said its a fun game and will (eventually) be awesome.

Bluehole needs to get sense knocked into them because they aren't going to get more money and players by just adding MORE payed items. What fortnite does right is it added payed items but the game is free noone wants to pay 30 bucks for the game then spend another 30 or more for ingame items. This game was good and understandable with all its glitches back then in early access and with my 900 hours yes I played it at the time of its early access but when it came out as a full game with so many bugs still that's one way they messed up they also didn't add a progression system until now which got players bored and have no point of playing which is what alot of people loved about fortnite.

2017-11-23,0,0,494,False,Not Recommended,It's ok I guess. They need to bring back the weather effects. Fog meant that the game was no longer the better shot and depended on pacients and listening. Rain did the opposit limiting the players hearing meant the player had to have a keen attention to detail. Dynamic gameplay kept the game from becoming the rinse and repeat shoot em' up that all other battle royals currently have. It's still better than Fortnight.Edit adding a battle pass... Just play Fortnight. Also 50 000 players on means the servers are too busy yet this game can yield 2 million players. PlayerUknown you cheap sack of need to shell out the dough for those servers. Don't play this game if you want to have fun. It costs too much and hasn't imroved as far as gameplay since summer 2017. The new map has promis but probably won't keep me playing.Edit 2 WTF bluehole your award system ing sucks absolute It only awards you the points for whatever achevment if you don't die in the first ten minutes of the game. How the am I supposed to unlock the I also paid for the BattlePass which is a total rip off. For a 700+ million dollar company you'd think they'd take the time to iron out the t. The game feels more and more like a mobile game than an EA game at tis point. The next update will prbably make it so in game airdrops cost actual money to unlock. I am VERY upset at the way this game has gone and for a game that at heart I like I don't think it is worth the time and money I have put into it.

He just wanted to work on this awesome game. He told me more about how awesome it would be. I told him it was a complete waste of time. He asked ""Why? Why is an original completely unique game a complete waste of time?""I told him if you have no experience about how to make a game and put all your sweat tears and sleepless nights into it then announce it to the world here is what is going to happen.... Someone with a whole boatload more money than you is going to see what you are doing and even though it took you two years to make this epic unique one of a kind game they are going to come along and make the exact same game as you over a weekend and profit off it 20 times over what you put two years into creating. So your game might as well not even have existed. He said ""Jeesh I had never thought of that."" I said ""That's why they have lawyers. Lawyers always get paid.""

2018-06-23,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,I been waiting till the release of the new map Sanhok to write this review because I thought it would save this game from the things I don't like about it. As much as I want to write a positive review for this game I unfortunately cannot. I have 200 hours on this game as of now and it is my most played game on Steam however fun this game may be at times it is outweighed by negatives that ultimately made me come to write a negative review. The Good PUBG can be very fun at times it has some of the most intense situations I've seen in a video game and playing with friends is an abosolute blast. The guns are probably one of the coolest things about this game allowing you to customize them with various attachements to suit your playstyle which completely trumps the weapons in Fortnite. If you're looking for a more realistic battle royale game this is probably the closest you can get (unfortunately). The Bad This game is often nicknamed 'The Walking Simulator' for good reasons the two maps (not Sanhok) are way too large at 8x8km this game is often filled with a whole lot of nothing and oftentimes it's hard to find vehicles so you can end up having to walk across the map only to be sniped as soon as you make it. Unfortunately about 95% of the deaths in this game feel unfair and like you never had a chance on top of that there's way too many glitches that are extremely frustrating and end up with you dying. As everyone else has stated before me this game is riddled with hackers. whether it's aim walls or any other type of hacks you can find them here. The Ugly The devs for this game are some of the worst I've seen for such a popular game tending to work backwards instead of forwards in most cases. Instead of making the crate system better by adding more crates that you can open up for free they decide to keep on adding more crates that you need to pay $2.50. Which I can ignore because cosmetics are not important at all. But they also decided to remove weather (like rain and fog) from the game which just made the game feel more bland. Optimization in this game has plagued its existence since launch and I personally haven't had too many issues till recently with the new map where I'm lucky to be getting 60fps+ on lowest settings and the only way to make it run slightly better is to play on 3rd person for me but there seems to be even more hackers on that mode so there's really no winning. As of now it just feels like the devs don't care too much about their audience and would rather introduce new ways for you to spend your money on a broken game. So even though I might continue to play this game every once in a while I would strongly advise against supporting these devs until they actually work on fixing their game and adding new content consitently.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Initially I though the game lacked content to warrant the 27 price tag but the more I played... the more I was addicted.. looking for that 1st win! Since the games release there have been some great updates and bug fixes which is very encouraging. I actually recommend this game to FPS players that have a love for survival games as it really caters for survival and aggressive game styles.

There are games that I ""pop off"" in but those are only happen 1/20 games and are usually followed by a swift death outside the zone or to the hands of professional sniper leaving the majority of my expeience in PUBG both hollow and full of failure after failure after failure with no full sembalence of growth after each failed attempt no matter what aspect I change. Ive noticed that the ""gunplay"" is nothing more than a bucket of ship with a ""realism"" label on the side. Im all for realism but there is a fine line between realistic(ARMA) and idealised(CoD) that will make a gaming experience both fun to play and realistic to a degree (Wildlands) Pubg however leans slightly to far to the realistic side by design which makes the prosess of ""lining up a shot and pulling the trigger"" incredibly infuriating in short/med ranges and borderline impossible at long range(for me). On the other side of the barrel while being shot at 95% of times you cant even tell where the shooter is as there are no tracers to indicate positioning and even when you are hit there is no indication of the direction you were just hit from to even give you a chance at turning on them before your inevitable demise... so alot of the hardcore community are probably are going to say that ""im just bad"" or ""why dont you get better"" well id love too but I cant get better at the game if im having my head taken off while hiding behind a rock from a direction i cant even begin to aprehend. PUBG is incredibly hard takes alot of skill detication and luck. most likely to the point where the so called ""cheaters"" or ""Hackers"" from america are probably whats left of the casual comunity... and boy howdy do i want to join em.

But today I roll my eyes if someone asks me to play a round. But why?The Game has become stale it seems like the developer doesn't care about you. It isn't getting the support the game needs. What updates have we received since it released over a year ago?MiramarVaultingNew Scopes and GripsUhm... did I miss anything?Back when there were so many asian cheaters and people were crying out to region lock china to fix most of the problem instantly instead of fixing the game we were all called xenophobes. There is still a lot of lagg in the beginning of the game picking up items is still a chore (How do you f*** this up. The game is literally BUILT around picking up stuff!) Cars are a mess. They don't behave like a normal car would. Strange for a game that ""tries"" for realism.The circle will you up on a daily basis. They had a better solution for the circle in the lategame but scratched that because ... the do I know.And the most spicy part of it In case you were living beneath a rock for the last 6 months Entertainment is suing EPIC the company providing THE GAME ENGINE OF PUBG for ""copyright infringement"" like 100 people dropping from some sort of flying thing. The placement I am not kidding you of the MINIMAP (WHAT THE F!?!?) and other hilarious reasons. Essentially Blueballs is salty because Fortnite is more successfull than PUBG. This is entirely the fault of Bluehole. They are now instead of fixing the game and making people come back spending their money they should use on fixing the damn game on frivolous lawsuits. A you to the community if I've ever seen one. Hey Blueballs!The fist car in a videogame was Grand Prix. 1969. SONY should sue you!The first Ego Shooter was Maze War. 1973. Steve Colley should sue you!The first Game to feature a mini map was DEFENDER. 1981. Williams Electronics should sue you!The first game with Loot Boxes was Team Fortress 2. 2010. Valve should sue you!Seriously Entertainment?! Suing EPIC is the most greedy and the dumbest thing to ever do. There once was a companty called silicon knights. They sued EPIC to gain money. They lost and had to pay if I remember correctly around 6 million USD. Silicon Knights no longer exists.F**k you PUBG. F**K you. You POPULARIZED the genre not invented it! And your game is so f**king generic there is no way you can sue anyone. Most of your assets are BOUGHT from the UNREAL STORE which is you guessed it OWNED BY EPIC GAMES!The developers forgot how to talk they only know ""money"". They are worse than EA. They are working against the gaming industy and against what lead gaming to the height it is today. The Good They managed to deal with the cheating epidemic. I think. The one battle royale game that is closest to a ""real"" setting (Not that hard if your main competitor is a cartoonish game)OLD REVIEW with now added snarky comments to my old review ""Just one more round.""

2017-12-27,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,"Winner winner chicken dinner?You guys know what changed between test servers and launch day? The game runs worse now.I'm torn on rating because this still feels like early access yet I've invested over 100 hours with no end in sight and for the $29.99 I paid back when it launched (the first time not this ""1.0"" version) I guess it's worth it.Still needs work on lag early round rubberbanding hackers/aimbots etc. but the potential for great fun exists. I crash a lot too sometimes as often as 3 times per round but barring anyone shooting me in the face while I'm frantically rebooting the game I'm usually able to resume where I left off. I'd prefer that this didn't happen but at least I can rejoin a match in progress.Edit 12/29/17 Rubberbanding was improved in a patch last night. Still some connectivity issues servers too busy etc.Edit 1/4/18 In place of rubberbanding there is now just a fairly large item pick up delay at the start of matches. Visually less annoying but annoying nonetheless. This is also the only game that causes my system to CTD or blue screen even. (Windows you suck for putting a frown face emoji on that screen)Edit 5/13/18 I have a love/hate relationship with this game. I stopped playing for 3 months because my system would CTD or flat out BSoD. I've had this rig for 4 years and this is the ONLY game to cause BSoD. I reinstalled the game on my SSD and have to run my fan full throttle to prevent my system from overheating even with lowered graphics. I am by no means running a potato and recently doubled my memory to 32gb and popped in a GTX 1080. There are 2 maps now which is nice but fog and rain are now gone. A 3rd map is en route but I miss playing in thunderstorms. Cheating? Still bad. Anti cheat patches are sometimes worse than the cheating.Still I play and I have moments of crazy fun. I'm teetering in the edge of a thumb's down because content is starting to be removed. Also I am very angry about the crate system and the $2.50 keys required to open most of them. C'mon guys at least leave a 100% free option to buy with in game BP rather than a random chance of getting a free crate but more likely a crate that requires a paid key to open. This seems greedy for a game that sold so many units. I think I am going to give that thumb's down afterall. BRING BACK MY RAINSTORMS!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is very fun with friends competetive or casual and its just fun to pass time with. But over 500 hrs i can confirm that the game is getting stail very slowly. The lack of new updates and new guns makes you wanna punch buthole in the face. I mean yes there has been a new gun tweak and a DMR but it doesnt add on to the variety. There are ton of guns in the game but it seems like there are few that can still function right. Unlike fortnite PUBG puts in guns very rearly and tries to tweak them instead of removing which I dont know if is bad or good. Overall i tottaly recomend the game to have fun with friends but competetive gampelay is still stupid and dumb.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This has a lot of potential and the premise of the game is the only reason I purchased it but even with a mid level gaming laptop on the lowest graphic settings it's unplayable half of the time sheerly because of lag and a poor server connection.

2017-09-02,0,0,399,True,Recommended,This game makes me feel like I have bi polar disease. Why? Allow me to explain.You load into a game thrown into an airplane with 99 other users forming a 100 player battle royale game. Each player hoping to achieve the same thing Be the last one alive. But as you can tell you have a nasty 1/100 chance of winning a game (solo mode) the percentage goes up dramatically if you factor in everybody's skill level within a game total wins etc however I'm not Einstein so I'll leave that for a later date.Anyway back to my point. This game makes me feel like I have bi polar because you can either be in 1 of 3 moods Angry Dying straight away to someone who lands on an Assault Rifle whilst you land on a pair of safety goggles.Happy Landing on an Assault Rifle whilst your opponent lands on a pair of safety goggles.Dissapointed Getting a tommy gun from an airdrop.However most of the time I am alive until late game and end up dying to the final person to a crossbow getting 2nd place. Which is ing stupid.Anyway as for the community and the development team. They are very communicative. Developers listen to the community the community give constant feedback which is great. But then they add ing crates.Let's not talk about crates as I will get triggered.I have 117 hours and I can say I have enjoyed about 80% of these hours. The other 20% of my hours consists of stupid deaths stupid team mates RNG loot RNG Circles and just about everything else that doesn't go my way.The game is also very fun if you have friends to play with. My personal favourite mode is DUO and I would recommend it to anyone if you have friends who own the game however if you don't. Just don't. Play Duo. Don't do it. Just. Trust me just don't do it. If you do you will get matched with somebody who either doesn't have a microphone or is incapable of communicating effectively thus resulting in you getting a bullet to the head from a Kar98K.Squads is fun too you can often random queue squads but it's a hit or miss on whether or not you're in for a good game.Finally let's talk about the system requirements.Running on my old system I would average around 45 frames per second in Georgopol (a big city) I'll be using georgopol as it is a very large city with lots of loot and players scattered around and my specs were as so OS Windows 10/64BitRAM 16GBGFX GTX 750 tiCPU i5 6600k 3.5GHzSSD 1TBAnd on my new specs (upgrades graphics card) I get about 130 fps constant in Georgopol.OS Windows10/64BitRAM 16GBGFX GTX 1060 6GBCPU i5 6600k 3.5GHzSSD 1TBYou need a good graphics card and CPU to run this game for recording and streaming maybe better.Thanks for reading my Novel on PUBG now steam.

2018-05-14,0,0,290,False,Recommended,"Hands down THE Battle RoyaleLove the game. A lot of tweaking needs to be done but overall the game plays great. Optimization is a big issue. If the game was optimized better there would be less rubber banding and and glitching.(If you caught the intended double ""and"" then you get the point)Also to be fair ballistics in the game really do not make much sense. **Considering this is a game and not to rely on real world physics of bullet weight vs. environmental afflictions ballistics are not as important as the play ability.** Buuuuuuttttt..........In general a 5.56 round will drop more than a 7.62 round. The 7.62 has more mass behind it and delivers a higher energy transfer than the 5.56. The 5.56 is a lighter bullet with a significant drop over distance as compared to the 7.62 due to the fact that the 7.62 has a higher grain count behind the bullet. That's not even considering barrel length bullet coefficient temperature barrel temperature and so on and so forth. But there's no point in arguing semantics. Besides the God awful ballistics in the game it plays quite well.I should also note that rendering definitely needs to be improved but I feel once the game reaches a better optimization that will fall right into place. All in all I love the game. The close moments the feeling you get when you're in the final ten that absolute rush when you make the final kill......there's hardly anything that can virtually replicate the feeling. plus it makes for good time I get to spend with my son and that right there is more important than any other negative factors of the game.

I would like to see some new maps though it's gets a bit boring after playing a lot of the same. Last but not least the performance. Since I first played it the game ran kinda good most of the time but there were major fps drops at times especialy being close to the red zone and jumping out of a plane. So props to the team for some optimization tweaks. It's still far from running perfect but all in all it's a good game well deserved top spot on steam charts.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-04,0,0,347,True,Recommended,I pretty much have nothing bad to say about this game. I have experienced a few graphical glitches like a black box that bleeps around my crosshairs and a few color glitches but nothing that has taken away from the gaming experience or shooting people. Out of the many early access games I have purchased this is by far my favorite. If this game was left as is right now I would be completely satisfied with my purchase. I'd say some more optimaztion can be done to make the game run smoother or maybe I just need a better computer (Intel X5650 with AMD R9 390). Running the game on ultra I was hovering between 20 35 FPS depending on the environment. I turned all the graphics down to low except textures (medium) and viewing distance (ultra) and I feel like it didn't take much away from the environment it also doubled my FPS. You can solo or do teams duo or squad (3 or 4). Never had any issues starting with a team never had any issues waiting for a game Maybe 2 3 minutes max. Overall completely satisfied. Air high five delelopers keep it up! Excited for what new stuff will be coming out. Many more hours of gameplay to come.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Great ideas directly stolen from other fun games they desperately need to hire some network engineers and serious back end developers. Having 1 tick servers and net lags make this game terrible. People can lagg through doors you can use cars to run over people who are hiding on the other side of walls just ram the wall full speed.

2017-04-16,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"After playing a handful of round I have to say I'm hooked. Every round can have an entirely different style of gameplay. What I mean by this is that if you land your parachute too far away from the ""final battle spot"" you'll be spending most of the round on the move hopping from building to field and will probably amass a good selection of firearms and higher level gear. On the other hand you may have landed in a location well within the radius of the final play area and you are more focussed on defending your ""base"". Solo play is terrifying but rewarding. I've made it to the top 10 a few times best was #5. I recommend playing with a friend in the Duo or Squad modes.As it is in alpha it does have a bit of bugs including some lag and FPS issues. I'm hoping future patches are implemented to correct these. Apparently there is a cheater problem but I have yet to encounter a blatent hacker. There is a weird graphical issue when inside a building where you'll see a black haze effect when your camera hits certain angles. Again I expect these to iron out as time goes on.

2017-04-16,0,0,272,True,Not Recommended,This game is fun...the concepet is fantastic...that being said it needs alot of work.The latency is god awfull and that doesn't mix well with a hardcore shooter. Mesh optimization is terrible even if you have a top of the line card you will find yourself turning settings down to medium to get something resembling decent proformance. Audio needs alot of adjustment. Pretty much across the board the game is lacking polish. From what I have seen however the devs are updating often and working on things.If you are fine paying for a work in progress this game is fun as hell when the servers not lagging otherwise I would advise giving it some time.I will thumbs up when latency issues are fixed,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,208,True,Not Recommended,While this game has a lot of potential to be amazing in its current state it's not a good buy.In just over 80 mins of playing I have managed to get about 10 15 mins of actual playing time the rest of it being spent on loading into games to only be instantly disconnected. Had major issues regarding key binding. Tried to change a few keys around to suit my playstyle more and every key instantly unbinded and could not be reset which meant I had to go into the app data settings for the game to completely reset them.Character customisation is very restrictive (which isn't a major issue) but the limited choices available bug out constantly and the character you choose to look like isn't what you end up as. Ultimately if this game was bug free and ran smoothly then you could potentially justify its 26.99 price tage for a game that is essentially a free mod on Rust a much more optimised game that costs half the price. Would not recommend this to anyone in it's current state as 26.99 for an early access game is absolutely crazy given its current state. DO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-16,0,0,362,True,Recommended,There is a lot good about this game. The weapons the map character movement the way you enter the map and many others. In short when considering game balance PU Battlegrounds is easily the best BR game out there right now. The one MASSIVE problem is the speed the servers are running at. Which at the moment seems to be 20 tps. Which is bad. It makes luck a much bigger factor in every engagement than it should be. If I had known I probably would have waited a couple months before buying. It is still fun. And will continue to get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-16,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,Probably should wait on this one until they start working on the anti cheat system which they are starting now. It's a great game but if they don't get the cheating in hand really quickly it will die. Games like these must use extraordinary care to stop cheaters and as of this moment they have no anti cheat at all.Latest patch notes says anti cheat is coming but until then save your money.Besides this game is a ton of fun to watch but as of now not so much fun to actually play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,282,True,Recommended,Early Access released at a good standard unlike DayZ or other early access titles that are released with poor content. Weapons are nice and fairly balanced from what I can tell from my playtime. Clothing options and layering of clothing system is very nice it is possible to create some really good looking characters. The map is very nice lots of areas with plenty of cover where some areas are flat and exposed. The buildings are spaced quite nicely too. Overall much better than H1Z1. The two cons that I have noticed when playing are that the game needs a lot of optimization (I feel the devs have this under control and will fix this issue) and second of all the game suffers from rubber banding in some games sessions. yet again I feel that this issue will become very easy to fix. However I would recommend this game in its current state great fun intense and a very fun multiplayer experience to play with friends!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-29,0,0,103,True,Recommended,"It's ""The Culling"" but with guns and any incentive to play it whatsoever. After getting burnt out on Culling's sub optimal melee system which is a heavy focus of its gameplay I've been looking for a different Battle Royale style game. ARMA's not optimized quite enough and other games just don't seem to do it right.PUBG is an interesting new take combining elements from other games into a coherent stream of gameplay. It offers you plenty of chance for success or failure and the shooting mechanics are fair enough for you to quickly know what you're doing.However while gunplay is skill based and relatively fair the entire rest of the game is luck and RNG which almost guarantees a loss for me. I realize the chances of winning a game are almost literally 1% in solo play but I've walked into a large number of buildings with only weapon attachments and non useful clothing in them which usually culminates in me being shot ten seconds after dropping in by someone who found an M16 in the next house over.There are some minor insconsistencies in the shooting I should note. I distinctly remember firing the double barreled shotgun at an enemy only 10 feet away and the shot completely missed when it clearly shouldn't've. Oh well. Game's okay.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,348,True,Recommended,So Everyone compares this to H1Z1. Stop it. Just stop it immediately. H1Z1 is a Battle Royale yes and H1Z1 Let's you fall with to the ground with a parachute yes.... After that it stops being similar. In PugB first off you get attachments that you can find through the world for your weapons. These attachments include surpressors compensators stocks foregrips c mags and scopes galore. H1Z1 never offered any sort of attachments.Secondly the gunplay So in H1Z1 when you fire an m16 your gun sways to the right and up... (because recoil does that on all weapons..)... In PubG the weapon kicks at an 181 degree angle as weapons actually fire. So in short it's infinitely more realistic. Thirdly Hitboxes.... H1Z1 can kiss my whole with their hitboxes after Years of development when PubG can release an unoptimized early access game and capture the attention of the world with correctly placed hitboxes..... I could continue to express the significant differences between H1Z1 compared to PugB... But Know This.PugB (the guy who made a mod for Arma that SOE stole the idea from to make a video game) made a video game. He did it right. You should buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-06,0,0,1121,True,Recommended,What DayZ gameplay wished it could be. The Game is 50% Luck 5% Skill and 45% having a good computer. The optimization isnt as good as it could be so everything has to run on low or very low unless you have pretty good computer specs atm (5/6/17). 40% of the time when i land into the world the fps is so low that i cant enter any houses because theyre literally just giant blobs. Other than that and then hyper op shotguns this game is pretty set and really fun. The shooting isnt to hard to grasp and the game is basic enough to were you only need to play a few games to understand it. If the devs fix optimization and loading screens and crashes this game is a solid 7 maybe 7.5/10. 8.5/10 wif friends,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-08,0,0,201,True,Not Recommended,Game essentially comes down to luck and has given me more frustration and annoyance than enjoyment.There are good aspects about the game but I don't think it's worth the current price.The most fun I got out of the game was squadding up with a bunch of random people and chatting over VOIP and we went on to win the round. But most of the time people don't have mics won't stay together and will die leaving you wanting to quit and find another match. You also can't add people on steam via the game so you have to ask them over VOIP which is a hassle and usually doesn't work.Watching streamers play the game is a lot more enjoyable than playing it yourself.There are other FPS games where dying doesn't annoy me at all because you feel like you could have stood a chance if you played better. But a lot of times in this game it's unpreventable someone shooting you in the back from a mile away or someone camping in a bush waiting for you to show up or the game lagging out or getting stuck in a doorway jumping out of a car going 10km/h etc. Also the devs are terrible and shouldn't be supported.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-24,0,0,143,False,Not Recommended,24/05/2017 Done just under 2 hours on this and to be fair for my first battle royale game its quite a good start the gameplay could do with some more work as it can be buggy at times but with this being currently in early access i can look past it as one of the things that happen in game development the matchmaking process is very difficult as i try to get into team lobbies and find that its taking ages to do so so id stick to solo if i was you and it also feels a lot more scary as you are basically on your own until a guy comes to blow your head off.the gameplay is very reminiscant of films like The Codemned and hunger games minus the t drama which to be fair is good for a game like this no narrative or expansive choices just raw gameplay.as long as there are no microtransactions to the point where its pay to win then this is a solid game thus far.29/05/2017Done about 12 14 hours and safe to say i am very much enjoying the game btu there are still some gripes that the game still has not fixed the game has a big problem with network lag which at times moves your charcater in awkward positions which at times can mean life or death the game has an upgrade system in place for weapons so you will come across attachments to fit certain weapons the UI for this is still in the works but the overall pros and cons of each attachment are stated but again spending time look at an upgrade and not watching your own back can mean life or deathThe really good thing i have found about this game is sound and its usefullness in the game as your walking or running you will come across other players in the game for sure but the one thing that can save your life in this game is to listen to your surroundings one instance of this was i was in an old police station looting for some ammo as i did not have much to start with and in the distance i heard a car coming closer so i ducked into one of the reception rooms and went prone just for a minute or so so that the sound passed a few seconds after i thought the coast was clear i heard quick steps getting closer and eventually i saw someone come in the building look around and ran towards the stairs a mere 5 feet from where i was and all that was stopping from him seeing me was the small hole in the wall that was used to greet people and a slight turn of his camera so definate close call eventually i manged to follow him upstairs using an ac130 overhead as cover for the running sounds i would make and eventually had to utlilise slow walking to get closer to where he possibly was which was the roof which allowed good viewing spots for a sniper eventually i managed to find him and blow him away with one shot of a shotgun.so yeah safe to say that sound in this game is top notch . . .04/07/2017Done just over 40 hours on this and the game has gotten a lot better since the recent bug update and weapon update the game is running a lot smoother and the landings when the game starts are much better. there are still some bugs in the game but nowhere near as much as there were which is fantastic.This is a brilliant game to play with freinds but when playing solo the tension rises so much faster and gets to the point of splitting hairs especially as youve only got your own eyes and not 2/4 others to see other players about and even when playing 2/4 players it is very best to be as cooperative as possible and not going gun ho on your own.Specific communication is key so calling bearings when seeing players with the ingame compass helps. Sharing bullets med kits energy drinks painkillers etc. is a must when coming in as with everyone on equal terms will help you get that chicken dinner (That is literally what it is called if you win). Having certain attachments for weapons will give you the edge when it comes to combat shotguns for CQC or rifles and even DMR's each can give you a certain playstyle to run with and some can give you an edge that will mean winning outright but its not just weapons that will mean winning Situational awareness is something that will help big time with winning especially as it comes down to the final circle13/07/2017played just under 100 games and won 4 games thus far and to be honest im still enjoying it the game has had some updates very recently featuring 2 new guns and some new weather variations the game runs a bit smoother but still has some crashes from time to time. the overall gameplay is very smmoth to run but on older PC setups it is still a cause for concern i have a gtx 1080 strix with a i7 6800K with an overclock to 4.0GHz and get steady 60FPS when theres plenty of players on the screen but when looking to horizons easy 100 FPS.overall there is still a lot to do with the gamebut at this moment its taking a lot of my spare time lol,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-02,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,Yet another edit I love this game I really do. But the fact is that this game isn't free with a paid pass for missions and (IMO) pretty lackluster rewards makes it blatantly obvious that it's a cashgrab. There are still many issues with this game that have yet to be fixed and it's incredibly disappointing that a large update like this introduces a mechanic you can't even use without the event pass. (The missions and XP system.)I like missions I like to be able to aim for something while I'm playing that's what makes this update good but the fact I have to pay 9.99 for a limited item is ing riduculous and judging by the review bombs I know I'm not the only one with this opinion.I love this game but for love of god FIX.

2017-03-27,0,0,365,True,Recommended,After hours on H1Z1 and the precursors to the genre in Arma 2 3 and DayZ this game excites me. A perfect balance between tactical gunplay movement and gameplay with some faster paced battle royale elements. This game can be played seriously with victory in mind or just to grab some friends and screw around. Currently Early Access is far beyond my expectations the only thing lacking is the optimization which is the primary focus of the Early Access. As of now it is one of the only main title early access titles with a set plan to be released within 2 quarters. Support the devs and throw 30 USD their way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Maybe a new mode where the aim is to survive for many hours having ultra length games where weather and exposure are just as dangerous as bullets and cars and frying pans.

2017-05-23,0,0,60,True,Recommended,I was skeptical about this game for a while. I had guys in my discord channel talk about it guys at work talk about it and still I wasn't convinced. ARMA 3 isnt appealing to me and the same crowd that likes that raved about this. I decided to take a chance this past weekend and try it out. Turns out they were all right. This game is incredibly addicting. You probably already know how its formatted start in a plane jump out on an island last one alive wins. But boy is there a lot in between. While playing solo is fine playing with friends with headsets is an absolute blast. Diving out of the plane and landing far from everyone else looting houses and arming up then everyone gets in a vehicle or if your'e lucky you have two vehicles and roaming for kills. We were lucky and found two jeeps one round. Two guys to a jeep moving like a caravan it felt like something from a movie. Everyone armed to the teeth rolling up to a town where we heard a lot of gunfire. Slide the jeeps sideways for cover and get out and as a group move slowly through checking corners. Its fun. Its addicting. And I say this as someone who was highly speculative its well worth $30,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

At cons there are so many guys that cheats there are so many bugs and so many glitches still that ruins the most part of fun. I recommend this game but hardly because of all these stuff that the developers should fix. Developers hear the plea of all the players and fix the damn bugs lags glitches cheaters or you will lose the community base the regular players.""That was my first review of the game with a possitive recommendation. After 200 hours of playing this game more and a couple of patches released I have to change my review. Developers are possibly blind to all the requests of the players. They prefer to farm money indroducing high priced boxes and skins than trying to make the game better. They fixed 0 things in aspects that matters. Let me say some of them 1) How much time it takes you to take a breath? In game it's almost 10 seconds... You press shift in game in order to save your breath and shoot without breath target loss and after 2 seconds that you can hold it (the regular time in real life is 20+ seconds) it takes 10+ seconds to refill your lungs... Really?2) Bikes are UNDRIVABLE. If you take a bike and you go with 100+ km/h you are deralled and most of time dead... Like real life... Everyone who goes with more than 100km/h is dead... Really?3) Guns are unbalanced still. They made SMG's and DMR's to make more damage. That's a right thing but.. why all 5.56 weapons are doing so little damage? As a man that works in the army I know that it should have a difference in damage but not so much. 4) Can you do something for the hackers? If not shut the game down. Same thing for other games too.5) Last 10 days I have been kicked from the game around 27 times... Verify your installation bad module e.t.c. DO SOMETHING!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I get scared I hide when I have to I shoot horribly at other people I make choices that lead to me dying a lot.I love it. I have reached the top 10 a few times already 3rd being the highest and once I didn't even kill anyone to get there. It's about survival. (However extra points are awarded for killing ofcourse).It's a 40 minute DayZ without zombies that with more updates I am sure will get better.You should get it. EDIT Follows A few wins under the belt now woooo.The game is still fun 89 hours in. The optimisation is fixing a lot of faults that I was experiencing at first but still with the occassional freeze or crash. Freezing I put down to Australian NBN quality however.Looking forward to the zombies update but hoping it doesn't get too much attention and it only goes in to the custom games not on to the official servers.Would love to see the 100 players broken down in to 10 person squads to see how tactical the game could be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-06,0,0,100,True,Recommended,This game is loads of fun. It takes all the best elements of survival games like Day z and strips out the hours of monotinous grind and skips you up to the best parts of PvP survival/action games. It also oddly enough reminds a lot of the old Socom games for PS2 (which i adored) as far as the tense 3rd person combat (also can right click for first person). Really the idea of this game is just genious. Take a massive map randomly fly an airplane full of 100 players over the map and allow them to parachute to any city. The players then run around looting houses ala dayz and get guns (like 20+) all sorts of mods for guns armor healing items and then you just run around capping fools. There are vehicles to make it not so borning running from town to town. It all comes down to the last man standing and to eliminate camping the map constantly shrinks forcing all players to run around to the same areas or take damage until they get there. It can be played every man for himself teams of 2 or teams of 4. All matches play out totally different especially going from solo to team play. Other then a few bugs and some slight performance issues i really just do not get why people give this game a bad wrap. Its first of its kind executed very well and is casual enough to hop in and play a few rounds or hardcore enough to play for hours and hours and develop mad tactics to win. I give it a 9/10.Must buy. It will only get better and have more modes as time goes on. a ing RIOT to play with buddies.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can try your luck with solo mode or you can team up with the a random squad. Either way you are in for a nervous and most importantly intense ride.

2017-09-16,0,0,600,True,Recommended,Very enjoyable game and runs so much smoother after the most recent update. I notice a marked improvement with each update that makes the game that much better. Pro Every match you play is a completely unique experience even though it's the same map. There's no grind to get better gear or to improve stats each game is based on how well you play. Even if you're not an expert marksman you can still find a way to make it to the top. The RNG can be irritating. However sometimes it works in your favor and feels great when you beat the odds. No other game have I felt so pumped when pulling off a win. Con Early access status can sometimes linger and leave you wondering if the product is going to be finished or if it's just an excuse for bugs. Though I have never experienced it myself there is a lot of talk about the dev team being a little too quick to ban players for unfounded accusations. Personally I find it better than them ignoring the problem and cheaters running wild. However stream sniping is extremely hard to prove and it's a system that appears to be getting abused. The RNG on loot spawns seems to be really out of sorts right now. I've gone through large cities by myself several times and come out with not very much to show for it. Dropping in with multiple enemies can be extremely frustrating because it comes down to the off chance that you find a gun before they do (yes high risk high reward but with a little tweaking to the loot spawns and I'll be satisfied.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-07,0,0,1146,True,Recommended,This is a revamp of my orignial review. As of today I can give this game a thumbs up they have improved all of my complaints and I feel this is truely a game worth the $40. Original review below. But again almost everything has been fixed. At the time of this review I have played over 330 hours on this game. But after everything I still cannot suggest someone (new) purchasing this game. The core concept is what sells this game (and the gene) and by far this is the best of the Battleroyal games out there. That is saying a lot because there are at least 3 other titles it blows away and not much at all since no (AAA) studio has stepped into the frey yet. It is still way to rough around the edges with way to glarying defects to bait someone else into paying money for it.Do I reget the money I spent No. Will I stop playing it no. Does it need substantial work to be a truly finished game Yes Yes Hell Yes.Pro Hands down best BR game out right now. Strikes the right balance between cartoon/arcade (H1Z1) and boring realism (Arma).Responsive Developer.Weekly Updates with more massive monthly updates.Confirmed future updates look very promising.Con Servers are run on potatoes powered by mice on wheels. Seriously they are bad. (Fixed)Vsyn and hitbox issues are huge. Youtube and enjoy the laughts. (Fixed)Hackers are real and you will run into them. Even with BattleEye they are still in game. (Fixed...mostly)Horrible way to report hackers it is no less than a 6 step process and you cannot upload video evidence. (Fixed)Quality of life updates kill cams HC servers weapon balance are all way out of wack but Devs say it will be fix over time. (Mostly Fixed)If you can deal with the horrible servers pathetic Vsync and hitboxes and play a game that heavily favors house camping due to 3rd person view. Than this is the game for you. If you feel the frustration of the BS and the hackers will put you off with all the other issues both large and small and too numerous to rehatch here then buy the game.Once this game leave Alpha (If it ever does.)(Confirmed it will here soon.) It promises to be a very good and enjoyable game. I only hope it polishes out the horribly rough edges before someone like EA steps in and makes a AAA Battleroyal.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-02,0,0,1819,False,Recommended,I liked this game a lot and it still has potential but it's going to die unless Bluehole can figure out how to prevent the cheaters and hackers. I still play a few games a day but I find myself enjoying it less and less. Those saying the cheating/hacking is not a problem are the ones sick of buying a new copy every time they get banned. If you haven't purchased the game wait until Bluehole elevates their standards.Edit 02/15/18 Hackers/cheaters are still in about 80% of the games I play. I truly do not think PUBG Corp / Bluehole care about securing their environment and giving the players a fair space in which to play. I understand it's not an overnight fix but it has not gotten better since leaving early access anyone who says otherwise is a fool. Hoping Islands of Nyne can prevent cheaters and I can get myself off this hackathon game.Edit 05/28/18 Hackers/Cheaters almost non existent in recent games. Changing review to recommend. There are still some optimization issues that PUBG Corp and Bluehole need to work on but overall the game feels the best since 1.0 launched. Only real issues I have currently are the SMG meta AUG in a crate and a seemingly lack of vehicles. As of now SMG's in particular the UMP will win against any AR with exception of the Groza. Additionally the AUG is still worse than M4 / SCAR skip it if you find it. Finally the extreme changes in safe zone should warrant more vehicle spawns on the map. I can't tell you how many times I drop Prison / Mansion and have to run to military island or Georgie because there are no vehicles along the roads.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,602,False,Recommended,Overall fun unique and addictive game. Initially had a fair share of bugs/laggyness but a whole lot of that has been fixed. High replay value as you will rarely ever have the same exact game each round. My favorite is squad first person perspective not quite Counter Strike teamwork but close considering it is quite a different sub genre (first person shooter Battle Royale with vehicles) within FPS (I don't ever play the third person mode). Some fine tuning still needed but overall huge improvement from initial early access. No other game has a similar blend of gameplay.

The ing rewards system!!! great game play reward for it lol. you earn money to unlock ""loot crates"" but after oponing close to 10 crates iv ended up with grey shoes bright red ball cap and my most recent ""reward"" was a ""Dirty White tank top"" serously...........i played 20 matches for a dirty white tank top. you guys. but thats the only real problem with the game right now. grab a friend and get to dropping bodies.

2017-04-12,0,0,93,True,Recommended,Firstly let me just say this game is fun or at least it can be fun. Just so we're clear I've never played H1Z1's version of this game but I have watched a good amount of it on twitch so when everyone started hyping over Battlegrounds I thought its probably time to give the game style a go myself. Gameplay wise this is a little dryer a little grittier than H1Z1 but otherwise offer mostly this same game again Playerunkown's third iteration of the same game and that is in where it's biggest faults lie there's very little new offered in this version the map's a little more populated and vehicles a bit more varied though if your big into your character customization then your best sticking to H1Z1 Battlegrounds offers little on that front. Bugs wise its the standard shacky start to any early release game though optimization is worse than a lot of other early access game keep the graphics low and you should be fine. Gameplay wise this game like all its counter parts has difficultly dealing with campers often the game would come down to whomever got the luckiest on getting the best camping spot inside the ever deteriorating circle making it difficult for any players heading into the circle ( just so we're clear I've won using this luck so I'm not being a sore loser) it is however sucking a lot of the gameplay out of what can at times be a great game. The best moments come from battles for the most defensive spots as the player numbers reach there 20s and lower the circle is quite small it becomes a competition for space these moments make the earlier grind worth it. Battlegrounds brings nothing new to genre but it does offer moments of intense fun. If they can add something new points for not camping better circle optimization (better optimization in general) more customization (if you're so inclined) or any number of other ideas then it could be the genre refresh it needs. Those thinking of switching I wouldn't not yet anyway these game are all still in early access though so let's hope they actually use that time to do something differant something new.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-22,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Reading through some of the reviews i am surprised how many people have that opinion that this is just a rip off from the arma 2 mod but hello?! ofc it is since it's developed by the same guy who made the arma 2 mod this is a great game. Yes it has it flaws some glitches and freezes from time to time but the game itself is great and the progress being made in these few months is more than H1Z1 has done in all its existence so if you are thinking about buying this game dont be scared to do so cause with the current progress this game will be amazing in just a few months and it is already so enjoyable..!Also the game developers are daily working on improving their servers every week they send out an update to fix bugs and make performance improvements and every month they send a big update out with new content and balance updates. So if you see a week or 2 weeks old reveiw about a bug that bug might not even be in the game anymore.As alot of people say this game has potential but at its current state 30 aint worth it but there i have to disagree with its current potential the price has to be somehow high not 50 60 like call of duty or any big game but still in the higher end the more we pay and the more we support the devs the easier they can support us with updates and improvements the game is already going in the right direction and i believe it will keep going that way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,143,True,Recommended,"Great game. Purchased in early access on 11/04/2017. Pros Fantastic shooting element of the game hitboxes feel rewarding and due to blood spatter from bodies when hit you can tell when you hit someone even from long range. Stealth and strategy aspect of this game is really rewarding playing like an idiot will not get you too far. Playing with squads is extremely fun trying to loot as much as you can before the clock ticks down is great then moving into the ""war zone"" makes it feel like you've prepared for battle. If you make it to around the last 20 things start to get really sweaty dying at this point feels bad but going further feels really exciting! Excellent positive/negative reinforcement.Cons Performance is seriously lack luster at point of writing although the game looks good at low settings my pc ( i7 4790k GTX 970 16GB RAM) should be able to max this game out I feel at 30 40FPS +. Crashed out of the game more than once and lack of being able to rejoin a game you were in is a bit sketchy hope the developers implement that in the future but i can go find a new game instantly so not bad.Wait times at the beginning of the game start are a bit long understandable that this is to let people join though so not a major gripe.7.5/10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,233,True,Recommended,I don't play multiplayer games they have never appealed to me however I saw people streaming BATTLEGROUNDS and couldn't escape how much fun it looked even in its Early Access unpolished state. So I took the plunge and it might be the best money I have spent on Steam. I say this even though I am so so bad and rarely get close to winning a round. My Kill/Death ratio is embarrassing.For the uninitiated BATTLEGROUNDS is a Battle Royale game where 100 people jump out of a plane decide where to land loot for gear and then try to kill each other until 1 person duo or team of 4 remains. To keep gameplay moving there are random zones that steadily reduce in size forcing surviving players closer together so they have to engage. Other game modes will arrive in the future My previous limited experience of multiplayer games is waiting around (looking at you GTAV) and then getting killed here you are never 2 minutes away from the next game. My average round time is 14 minutes the longest was 31 minutes reaching the top 3. All this means I can dive into a game anytime I want something that won't last for too long.The map available at the moment is varied and well designed. It is a game that is easy to play but very difficult to master especially when coming from playing against AI opponents but that makes any success so rewarding. I am constantly being killed and keep coming back for more.A week ago I had no idea who PLAYERUNKNOWN is now I do and feel confident he will guide this game onto better things.

Such moments include running through a field while getting lit up from every direction or taking refuge in a bathroom while a full enemy squad searches your house.Some people say the looting portion of the game is too slow and boring but in reality it really intensifies each match by building up the engagements with other players.

2017-10-07,0,0,102,True,Recommended,"Summary A bit glitchy but fun and addictive even if your bad! (like me)8/10This complex battle royale style game is the kind of game that gives you that heart pumping feeling. It's that feeling of I just grinded 20 minutes of getting loot and now im running in an open field try to get to the next circle risking everything. It is extremely tactical with many different aproaches or playstyles camping moving looting killing ""snaking"" aka crawling and many more. Every gun feels different and the graghics feel great although just looking at them they dont look out standing. The updates are frequent and acctually change a lot. Every update adds some stuff like guns mellee weapons changes to the map and more. Although I have never won a game and have a solo kd of 0.73 I still lovce this game you dont have to be a pro to enjoy it!This game is glitchy. Very glitchy. Some games are totally lagged out and if you have a slow internet connection like me it can be extremely infuriating to be ""network lagged"" in the middle of a gun fight. Bad servers and being unfriendly to slow internet are prettyy annoying. However sometimes this game makes me soooooo upset. For example you wanl into an unlooted house and you start looting then open one door and get shotgunned by a naked camping in a bathtub. Also vechiles are buggy (haha a vechile in the game is a buggy get it haha) so you frequently die to bull car accidents hwoever mastering the motorcycle can be very satisffying when you pull of some sick jumps. Anyone who enjoys first person shooters and competive games like Call Of Duty or CSGO should definently pick this up on a steam sale!

2018-06-26,0,0,233,False,Not Recommended,Bluehole released the game before it was a completed product.Bugs and poor implementation of features(inconsistent).The new map is great unless you happen to explore the cliffs in which case you will find upon jumping down a level all the walls will be just out of climb height and the only way out is death. All maps have places where you can get stuck in a moderately sized area and have to wait to be killed by a random the zone or your self.Also a lot of environmental assets across all maps are not properly touching the ground and so you can see under them and through the world.Scummy business practices that Bluehole participates in * Locked loot boxes in a full price game(which they allow you to play hours to earn the ability to buy a key to open)* Paywalled content(see event pass)I love playing this game on the rare occasion that I don't experience bugs crashes disconnects or have the fact that Blueholes decision makers are bad people shoved down my throat yet again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-24,0,0,443,False,Not Recommended,I gotta say I loved this game at the start when I got it. It had great potential to become something fun and competitive like CSGO/Overwatch and actually the performance back then before the 1.0 update was decent sure it had bugs but it was playable and the new map they added was what I've been waiting for after the awful running simulator map (mirmar) which they kept forcing us to play.But the awful performance of the game is crazy stupid it's so clunky it's unbearable I thought of jumping back in once the new map was added but after playing it it's not worth the effort not for the desing (which is actually good btw) but because of the performace. And with the way pubg is going it's not going to change since all they care about is money which is clear from the amount of loot crates/keys and now a season pass which is just like fortnites. After complaining how fortnite copied them now their doing the same thing which is just funny in my opinion they're trying to rival the amount of money they gain compared to fortnite rather than focusing on the performance and drawing in the audience with a good quality game.So to summaries if you are a gamer that cares about getting better at the game and improving your skill I do NOT recommend this game in the slighest as you will definitely be disappointed. However if you play casually for laughs then you won't be much affected since the concept is fun. Personally i've given up on this game as I really don't see them fixing the performance issue at all. But i'm going to keep playing from time to time because you can save a decent amount of steam funds from selling crates so you can buy other games xD (I've basically bought the game back with the amount of i got from selling the crates which were like 2 at the beginning when they first came out but that's over a long period of time),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is completely meaningless to play game for let's say 20 minutes collecting items getting pumped for battle playing with a decent tactics and then boom you walk carefully and the guy 5 kilometers away decides to do a thing and you're dead in a minute. Headshot. It happened to me two times in row disgusting.Second it is very hard to move across the map as the amount of vehicles are small and the map size is very large.And the last if you are expecting fun and arcade game with a lot of action and euphoria as you get into a certain ""killing spree"" this is not a game for you.

It released only a month ago and is already running smoother than H1Z1 is after 2 years. So far there are only a few issues i've noticed. Team chat. There isnt any form of it from what i can tell. i was trying to communicate with my team of randoms during a fire fight only for someone on the other team to say "" Y'know we can hear you right?"" This is definitely a game that needs private team communication but im sure that will be implemented at some point down the road. Weapon spawns. Sometimes you land and find the best guns armor and equipment. Others you land and are lucky to find a frying pan to defend yourself with. Again im sure this will be adjusted later on but its an issue for now. Lack of optimization. Again this is most likely a temporary issue but if you are on a weak computer or have a failing graphics card expect low frame rate as well as tons of lag. Im really excited to see where this game will go as it continues through development and will hopefully be one of the few Early Access success stories.

Its a garbage cash grab game that once the developers made their money theyre bailing out of it like rats off a sinking ship.

2017-09-19,0,0,591,True,Recommended,First review I've left on a game. Hopefully this helps other people.For context I mostly play this game with friends not on my own.I've also never played any other Battle Royale game.Context Over.I'm absolutely addicted to this game.It is the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time.It has it's problems a bunch of bugs but usually we just laugh them off and continue. The devs seem to be working on them and regularly push updates. New content comes somewhat regularly new map is coming in the future and new movement mechanics. They post their updates on twitter and Discord (that I know of).The best parts about this game are the very beginning and the very end.There is nothing quite like running around trying to find a gun before your enemies listening for footsteps grouping up with your mates and running train on the enemy.And there is also nothing that will give you the adrenaline rush that the last minute of the game gives you. When you are on the verge of getting a chicken dinner and finally nail that last shot for the win... Nothing like it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I haven't gotten that chicken dinner yet but I won't stop playing after I do. The devs are working on this game nonstop. They want this game to be as great as it possibly can. The bugs are being worked on they communicate with the community they're working on better optimization... 10/10. Biggest up coming game for a reason. If you haven't played this you're missing out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-24,0,0,899,True,Recommended,I didn't want to buy this game. I thought it was another group of developers rushing to make a quick buck off of this genre much like H1Z1. But my boss suggested I pick it up and play it with him. So for the sake of my future paychecks I complied.Ho Lee F*** was I wrong about this game. I have had more fun playing this game than anyother game I have in my library. The replayablity factor is where this game really shines. Each game is different and the playzone and how it shrinks is completely random every game. On top of that you are rewarded with points which you can use to purchase loot crates which drop COMPLETELY COSMETIC items for your character. Which is fantastic for not giving an unfair advantage to players.You should be aware this game is remarkably more fun with people to play it with. But it can get remarkably frustrating when you join the matchmaking queues and you get in a squad who either have no mic's or are in a ts together or something. To fix this I would heavily recommend you check out the subreddit for this game and hop on the discord to join squads. It adds so much fun to the game.Anyhow 10/10.

2017-04-24,0,0,57,True,Recommended,"The atmosphere and tension that this game invokes bears the weight of a thousand graveyards embedded in an arctic glacier quite reminiscent actually of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in a slightly more arcade y and pleasantly fast paced way. Once you get used to the controls which isn't difficult to do you're set for a rogue esque survival of the fittest death race adventure that's different every time you experience it. I was blown away... &lt fade to flashback&gt The rain pitter patters all around you occasionally interrupted by the distant murmuring of thunder in the vast endless grey void of the sky. You are struggling to outrun the ever encroaching exclusion zone after an unsuccessful looting following your boots hitting the ground. Armed with a revolver with only six bullets and four quickdraw mags (but only for assault rifles) your motorcycle helmeted brow pokes over the tire you've madly scurried over to after a sudden ""psching THUK!!"" caused you to immediately find cover in this otherwise barren field you find yourself in. You frantically glance back and forth at every crevice object scanning the stooping boreal trees towering throughout the fog shrouded mountainous horizon for any glimmer of movement any change of a pixel's color ""SCHFEOOOW!!!"" 'mosquitoes' loudly a centimeter from your ear THERE! POKING OUT BEHIND A CONCRETE BLOCK!! A GAS MASK AND A MUZZLE FLASH!!

In the span of a second you aim down your sight and see a small red cloud where the gas mask was a moment before after firing off your second round. Thrilled by the appearance of a ""1"" in the top right of your HUD and the adrenaline high you've had bleed into yourself you storm to your attacker's location the iron price has been paid after all and fate has provided you with her favor. There! The box containing your fallen foe's items just a few more feet and ""SHTUNK!!"" your screen blackens as your corpse pirouettes gracefully into a ditch before being obscured by a large yellow eleven taunting you and beckoning you to try it all again.

If you are a shooter gamer or just like to have very intense moments either with friends or without this game is completely worth the $30 price tag.

2018-06-21,0,0,121,False,Not Recommended,"PUBG was a fun experience I think I got my 30 bucks out of it with the 120 hours I've gotten out of it. However notice how I said I paid 30 bucks for it? What that implies is that I'm going to have most of a full game experience maybe I have to earn some things maybe I have some luck to unlock others. Maybe there will be some premium content on top of that I could pay for if I really wanted something that looked cool that I didn't want to randomly roll for (look at most other FTP games). Notice how I just referenced Free to Play Games and the game isn't free to play?So if the game is 30 dollars and it has sold 10s of MILLIONS of copies you think they would focus on making the best game possible? Getting stuff out the door ASAP trying to solidify that player base with new free content stabilizing what is already there? Well kinda. But certainly not as quickly as a company that has made so much money should be able to do. The company prides itself on taking itself seriously why doesn't it take it's content customers or game quality seriously? Seems to focus more on suing competitors and protecting its image...both would be moot if their product was better.Lets compare this to another game such as Vermintide 2 also a modest success (with significantly less copies than PUBG sold). What did they do? They charged 30 dollars and you can have 3 other friends play with you (similar in two ways to PUBG) and have a complete game experience where I get unlocks (still randomly) but I feel fulfilled with the constant draw of rewards that it provides. It also doesn't have ANY OPTION to charge for additional content you just gotta earn it (this is great and I would be fine if they offered short cut costs to get the gear you wanted if it was guaranteed).Most games should have some kind of earned reward feeling to effort (it is a GAME after all) and I sit there after a hard earned win with my buds we appreciate everything we had to do to win but to be honest that kind of feeling can be generated from any amount of hard work....such as building as shed or painting a room in my house. On lost games..there can be some appreciation but I rarely have ""fun"" with it (and for a game where winning is 1/100 chance this can happen a lot).But at least I can use those hard earned points during the game to unlock something shiny get something for even my loss. Some kind of progression maybe I'll get a cool new pair of shoes YAY! .......ohh wait. even the free boxes mostly require keys to unlock which cost 2.50 a box....so I'm playing a game to earn the right to get random boxes to pay more money to unlock something completely random..which you can also get duplicates of?I will still probably play once in a while because my friends still play it and because I already own it. But for suggestions for people to buy it fresh? I would say you shouldn't buy this game . Definitely Not until the company starts changing their policies and appreciating the one thing that has made them so successful their passionate player base. Right now they are little more than a resource to exploit in the effort to make more money. You will get that from some large companies like EA PUBG is the same thing but at least with EA they (generally ...still mad about Andromeda) give you a polished product that attempts to take your money.If you want to play a game with friends pick up Vermintide 2. Its a good time and requires a bunch of skill for harder levels and if they release paid DLC I would be very inclined to buy it! If you want to play a game like this pick up Fortnite (its better for your wallet generally and you WANT to support them because they appreciate their players). I'm also suggesting Fortnite because of other people's recommendations I have actually never played the game but it is...Free.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-21,0,0,26,True,Recommended,Finally a game of the Battle Royal concept that is genuinely good. Everything just feels really polished smooth and well balanced (for an early access online multiplayer game). The developers actually seem to listen to the community and act upon request therefrom. Very few bugs and/or glitches and a great balance of anything from spawnrates and itemstats to gamepace (through stuff like the decreasing size of playarea and general size of map in relation to the amount of players) and time to get into a new game.It's satisfying and exciting without ever getting tedeous and only occasionally a bit frustrating but that's only because I'm fairly competitive in games likes these and getting #2 can induce a slight form of frustration eventhough it is only due to my own competences or rather lack thereof..The only major thing I feel like this game needs is better optimization and I feel like that is definitely something that will be addressed in future updates as it is still in early access. I have a 1080ti with a similar level to the rest of my PC specs so I run it on Ultra graphics with an absolute minimum of 60fps however I rarely reach over 100 and feel like that should be the case for a game like this in 2017 (granted the stuff I mentioned above I am fully aware of the game still being in early access and just mention this in case people are wondering if they should get it within the near future).Also the price is less than half of AAA titles which I feel is more than reasonable! Considering the fact that you have come here and read so far into a random review of the game I recommend you try it out for a match or two and if you don't like it you can always return it within 2 hours(?) via Steam for a full refund.9.5/10 from me!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-18,0,0,557,False,Not Recommended,"**** SEE MY EDIT TO THE REVIEW AT THE BOTTOM ****Barebones and bugs galore BUT MAN IF IT'S NOT THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME I personally hate the Early Access system but this is one of the rare games from it that I'd say is well worth it. Even if the devs stopped development today I'd still have gotten my $30 worth out of it as I've almost sunk 80 hours into it already. The core game loop is fun Start with nothingLootShootDieDo it all again.Sometimes you die right off the bat and sometimes you make it to the top 5 only to get shot from who knows where. But even after getting so close to the end only to die I'm still eager to get right back into another game. Man this reminds me of everything I loved about games like the DayZ mod back when it came out. Feeling vunerable looking for weapons and even after getting fully geared still feeling those ""OH CRAP""moments like when you're forced to cross and open field because of the how the next circle fell. So much fun now and so much potential as it develops.(NEW REVIEW)This is by far my most played game in my steam library with well over 500 hours invested. It's still one of the most amazing games I've ever playedBUT.......Wow did they go wrong with their monitization methods. Their business practices are just plain bad. As in bad against your own consumers kinda bad. As in right up there with EA and ACTIVISION kinda bad. It's like a free to play money scam in your full priced game. You play to get Battle Points. Battle points are worthless. You save them up to buy a crate. And that crate that you just saved up for is random. Not only in what item you get out of it random BUT IT MIGHT ALSO BE A LOCKED CRATE THAT YOU HAVE SPEND REAL MONEY ON TO GET A KEY TO EVEN OPEN IT. Nothing like playing all week only to get locked crates or just crates full of duplicates. For a PAID title I personally feel that they should have made an in game store front to BUY EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT. With the option to also purchase items with real money which would support the devs and give gamers who don't have alot of time to play and save up the Battle Points some cool looking gear. This would be fair to PUBG's gamers and generate some income for the devs. As it stands now though the current system punishes you for not spending more on the game you already paid for as you can get crates that you cannot unlock until you've given them more money. It would be sooooo much more satisfying to save up your battlepoints to buy that super cool weapon skin for your favorite gun. Or get that spiffy new pair of pants you've been wanting. This would have made playing the game all that much more fun because even when you die you're still working towards something that is a reward. Not just random garbage and locked crates. All in all this is still a one of a kind game that is immensely satisfying to play. It's just got a really bad monitization system at the heart of it between rounds / And even though I've played it and gotten my $30 out of it I still feel cheated by their system.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I never had any real interest in it but figured what the hell it s something fun to play right ? I'm truly baffled by the amount of time I ve put into this game considering how mundane it is. I like arena and battle royale style shooters but I just do not care much for this game. It s very bland in my opinion.

2017-04-16,0,0,111,True,Recommended,So I got this game about 2 days ago and put 7 hours into the game Anyone talking about price of the game is stupid they are charging full game price for early access that is the risk you take.This is the first time I have played this type of game and half the time i get really annoyed because of team killing you can't assume everyone is a team player. Not all of us can play with friends and not all of us want to play on our own. You need to consider that when you are making a game. You also need to consider regular updates and basic bugs to be fixed. I cant just go back to the lobby and start a new game my game keeps freezing(i have a high end pc) i have to force close the game wait 20 seconds and restarrt. I also have been having a mic issue this is a huge problem because it is the only way to communicate.Look I understand it is early access but it has been on early access for a while and some of these bugs really put me off I would also like you to consider some of these idiots that I have joined a squad with. 2 of them shot me and the other squad member down Why? I have not got a damn clue. why would you want a team of 2 vs 20 x team of 4s espeicially when there is a duel team mode. You need to find a way to fix that maybe some sort of punishment or even banned from a ranked mode.

Then you will think that you are an amazing player. For the next 5 rounds you will die in the very beggining but you will just think of those as a unlucky streak and still think you are an amazing player. After playing the game for a few weeks without getting up to eat or sleep you will start to consider the fact that you might be good. Then you play another game and get your first kill and you begin to believe you're a good player agian. You might want to play with your friends that are good at everything so they can help carry you and your squad but you will take all the credit for helping. This game will take your attributes that make ou human and replace them with desperate attempts to be the last survivor. Overall this game is too easy for an expert player like me but it's always fun to rek some noobs. 10/10 IGN,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS you'll have to find loot such as weapons and healing stuff all over the map. The map is a huge square at 8km x 8km and the true survivor has the capability of moving around at the map in loads of ways such as swimming running boats driving cars and of course simply just running around. You can either pick the game mode solo duo or a full squad with currently a max of 4 men in a single squad.

2018-06-23,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,Really can't recommend the game right now it's a god damn mess.Cheaters are pretty common in servers and it's so damn buggy. One minute I can be riding a bike and the next the screen shows that I died because the bike somehow flew into the air and exploded.

2017-09-23,0,0,18,True,Not Recommended,For the generation that grew up with a cell phone in their hand and never stop fiddling with it. All others need not apply! Seriously the only way to spot enemy movement is to be able to notice a three pixel change on your screen. Just to make that point clear that's .00000144% that changes at which point you know to shoot at it.I have serious respect for people who play this well. They are all getting 20k plus subs on Twitch and they deserve it. For people who grew up with games like Battlefield 1942 I can promise you that you will not enjoy this game.You spend the first ten minutes praying to Steve and the Sound Guy that the rooms will populate the kind of weapons that should give you a decent shot at actually shooting something if you happen to see them. Then you spend the next ten minutes running to a circle that is ever shrinking the playing field. Only if you happen to make it to the thing chances are someone else was already there waiting and they shoot you before you get a chance to learn how to spot anyone. There seriously needs to be a learning curve mode for newb sauce players so as not to make them angry enough to write spiteful reviews. Only as an alpha/beta game that necessary mode is not available yet. Prepare to be frustrated beyond belief for the first twenty hours of game play or thereabouts.My suggestion is wait for them to release the game in a non early access format wherein they may have training available.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I was able to mitigate this issue at first by uninstalling and then reinstalling unfortunately that has ceased as a work around. I just started experiencing the crashing issue plaguing many players today suffering from three seperate crashes mid game.

Best to be played with friendsCan get boring alone but has a lot of replay valueFairly poor loot system but I can only expect more to come as it continues developmentI would reccomend this game and has a extreemely large amount of modding I could see done to it from players.

2017-04-08,0,0,260,True,Recommended,"This is the current top tier king of the hill style experience in my opinion. It beats out H1Z1 and ARK's similar mode and scratches the itch well for solo duo and group survival deathmatch. PU BG carries the large map feel of other survival titles like Day Z or H1Z1 but keeps a solid liquid smooth shooting system with competent controls realistic weapons and attachments and useful but not overpowered vehicles and equipment. A match can last anywhere from 2 or 3 minutes to 25 or so minutes for a given player and once killed you can jump directly into another match no long lines or queues as of yet despite the popularity of this game.It feels great in 3rd person and instantly swaps to first person when you want to aim down a scope or hovers over shoulder for a shouldered/quickly aimed weapon... in a perfect system. Each round is innately fair with no way for a hacky progression or skill system or ""unlocks"" to cut an edge for another player and it's not uncommon for a player to place top 10 (of 100) in one of their first few rounds... something much more rare in progression enabled shooters or ability based combat games.I am happy with my purchase of this game and wouldn't be offended if very few changes were made as the formula has provided plenty of fun hours of gameplay as is. I look forward to the further development of this game and hope that it enjoys plenty of support and becomes a widely acknowledged e sport.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-08,0,0,157,True,Not Recommended,This game has promise but in it's current state it is not fun to play. A combination of factors make the experience quite frustrating to play. The gunplay is okay but suffers from some issues relating to colliders and hitboxes. It is all too common to fire 30 bullets out of a window only to discover you've been hitting the wall the entire time. (If you can see down the sight you think that would mean you have a clear shot?)As for the progression I opened 3 cosmetic crates and recieved 3 identical fingerless gloves. I'm not sure why the developers decided to double the crate cost each time... it really does crush the feeling of linear progression.I recommend scaling down the number of players until the netcode can actually support 100 concurrent players. The first 20 players to die experience severe rubberbanding and other lag issues.While the Battle Royale premise is great it still has a long way to go. I recommend saving your money until this game has more polish and addresses the underlying technical issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Masterpiece Beautiful Good Decent Will do Bad Awful Paint.exe Gameplay Great shooting mechanic but can be considerably clunky when it comes to first person view.Please note that the game is a battle royale meaning that it has a playable area which spawns randomly in the world so it has a certain amount of luck involved. Try not to get addicted Very good Good Nothing special Ehh Bad Just dont Audio Hard to hear any difference when getting shot from your back or front. Considering that this discernment is of great importance so you can properly cover in the middle of the fight I'll have to give the audio a low grade.Besides that the audio is quite good since I could properly distinguish enemys above/below me and it's also very simple to distinguish the distance the bullet was fired.

PAST (please stay there...) The recent patch/es with the weapon nerfs buffs fixes and the 'new' HRTF audio and all the things they've done/are doing with their servers and the awful anticheat just made the game so much worse that I'm afraid I'm not playing the game much or at all anymore.

(That is the plane takes you from point A to point B without any turns so you're still free to decide where you wanna be at in between those points)5)Vehicle Handling is far superior to that of its competitor.Overall gameplay is very satisfying than that of its competitor.Cons 1) Optimization is just as neutral as its competitors...However unlike its competitors the devs have already revealed that there will be an optimization patch at april 14th which should allow the game to use your gpus full potential and hence give you the best experience.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,17,True,Recommended,I m going to be honest from the outset here I m not very good at PU s Battlegrounds. Being new to the Battle Royale genre combined with my ability to miss a shot on a target even if they re basically standing still is not a good mix. The sheer joy and satisfaction that comes with being an unstoppable killing machine with endless victories (Or indeed any victory at all) Well it s kind of lost on me. You see Battlegrounds is a pretty heartless and vindictive game. You can spend a good 20 minutes of a match scavenging for supplies and formulating a battle plan only to suddenly drop over dead from a single shot from a player you never ever saw. It s a title that s slow and methodical punishing your mistakes without mercy if you re looking for instant gratification or non stop action therefore it s safe to say this really isn t the game for you. Sudden death is something you just have to rapidly get used to in this world and when such deaths happen over multiple games and believe me they will especially when you first start out there will be moments where you really begin to ask the question as to why you re wasting large chunks of time on something that always leads to the same disheartening result. Yet as much as such things can drag the fun levels down a fair bit in many ways they work in the game s favour so much more. The knowledge that death is always nearby laces everything you do with an incredible sense of tension leading you to question all you see and do Is that house you re about to wander into actually occupied? Where were these shots coming from? Was that movement in the trees? So it goes on and as the play area closes in and the remaining survivors are forced together the tension only mounts even further. It s honestly draining to play at points simply because you re so alert to everything that s going on all the time it s an intense experience. Additionally the difficulties that come with surviving only make the kills you achieve feel so much sweeter. There s a sense with every kill that it s an achievement that your strategy and skill have paid off with noticeable reward. It also says something when the details of each kill remain etched in your brain for a long while after they ve occurred. I myself distinctly remember the guy I patiently observed through a window for an eternity before finally making my move or the one where a recently acquired shotgun proved highly effective mere seconds after I ve obtained it. Every player will doubtless have their own moments to share around the water cooler their own little victories and it s these moments that make the struggle beforehand all worthwhile. Group play is also available and this itself changes things up in new and exciting ways. Gather a team of your friends or just grab a bunch of willing volunteers and you ll instantly generate a sense of camaraderie each of you well aware that teamwork is the only way you re ever going to get out alive. It mixes up the gameplay dynamics quite thoroughly as well alone one person might be easy to take out. Team them up with three others however and the decision as to whether to engage becomes a difficult one... Can you really kill everyone? This can lead to tense standoffs each team knowing the other is there but holding tight and waiting for the right moment to finally start all out warfare. It s another thrilling layer of depth. Of course there s a great big elephant in the room yet to be discussed and that is the moniker of early access and all the baggage that term carries with it. Personally I ve been fortunate enough not to come across too many problems but by no means have I escaped. My main issue has been with lag and server connection issues the most noticeable example seeing me running alongside my squad on my screen only for them to suddenly question a minute or so later as to why I d ran out into the middle of the ocean and started swimming in circles. I ve seen a couple of gameplay crashes and freezes as well but they ve been in the minority for the most part my time on the battlegrounds has been a smooth one. It s difficult to saw however how exactly the experience might pan out for you. Take a look around other reviews or just the internet in general and you ll find hundreds of different difficulties and frustrations for every player out there. You may pick up the game and never see anything go awry you might start playing and see every attempt to find a stable match just become a sheer pit of misery. Put simply caution is advised. Updates should quell some of the pain in the future but a healthy dose of scepticism as to their effectiveness and frequency has to be adopted there s simply no way of telling yet how things will pan out in the future. In the end though there s plenty here that may annoy but when things get into high gear and everything starts going you way there s nothing out there that can match the experience that is on offer here. If this sounds like your sort of game and early access doesn t scare you off... Well see you on the Battlegrounds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-06,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"Really good game.However i'm going to make a list of bugs and issues that will be fixed in the future if not they should be so if the developers at bluehole are reading this pay attention.Bugs and issues 1. ""The infinite fall"" the reason why i have named a bug/issues this it's because when you or your character falls off small objects you will actually continue to fall and get stuck in the position of falling.2. HITBOXES... hitboxes are too big way to big... they are HUGE. You can tell this when getting shot through tiny hills and barracks when you can clearly see that you're not visible to the person you're shooting at.3. The UMP has a broken hit registration also the damage of it should be increased because its really weak weaker than a pistol if you will.4. General optimization issues that basically every new game has.5. This has bugged me for the past week but how SLOW does it take to pickup loot open doors and even get in and out of vechiles. I first concluded that it might of been just lag from playing on AS servers but once OC came out it was still SLOW. 6. There are already hacks for this game which is really sad i've been killed many times by people using ESP or wallhacks and they must be feel really embarrassed when playing.Overall not too bad considering it's in its early developing stage.Glad this game is killing H1Z1 the developers of H1 should now learn not to waste their times with skins.Keep up the good work BlueholeRecommend/10#KillH1Z1",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just alot of small things that can add up to some really crappy experiences for alot of players. the Chinese. I get team killed by them often enough that I want to stop playing this game and I can't defend myself because then I'd be reported for Team Killing and get banned. Seriously the comments saying Region Lock China? I finally have tipped over on to their side. I've gotten to the point where I hear a person speaking Chinese (I'm Vietnamese myself so I'm not being biased towards Asians) that I just want to leave because I don't trust them as a teammate. It's not all of them it's just enough of them causing trouble that I don't want them ruining my game as I slay bodies for the glorious Chicken Dinner. I'd say this game is a solid 4/5.

2017-07-18,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,After over 250 hours sunk into PUBG my review of this game must change. PUBG is a game that suffers from an identity crisis a big one. The crisis isn't that it isn't sure what it wants to be but doesn't know how to be it. It wants to be the best Battle Royale on the market and that's a fair goal... But its developers don't know how to do it or just don't care to do it correctly.This long after the release the game should be well optimized more content and very few cheaters. None of these ring true for PUB as optimization is still just OK content is drip fed and usually not very substantial and cheaters are everywhere. On top of that predatory monetization schemes just keep getting introduced instead of actually improving the game. The final nail in the coffin though is how they treat their competition. To be frank BlueHole is petty and isn't afraid to swing their ever increasingly small around. While they renigged their lawsuit against Epic Games the fact that they still filed it in the first place speaks volumes about how petty they are. The suit was over stealing copyrighted material and gameplay mechanics. The irony? Bluehole's ripped off Fortnite's Battle Pass concept quite blatently but worse... Because they're positively pathetic at this point.Don't support Bluehole because they won't support you. How the mighty have fallen.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,0,0,464,True,Recommended,The game is a early release so I know their is work being done but overall so far it's a good game and great concept. If the game continues on this present development course it will be a great finished product,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-11,0,0,75,True,Recommended,The game itself it pretty damn awesome but there are several issues because it is a early acess. I have actually never felt any issues myself because of I started playing it a little late or of another reason. There is just one thing I want them to fix and that is V Sync. I have a G Sync monitor and it s still a little wavy.The game is just like H1Z1 but the only difference is that H1Z1 is a little bit tactically or strategic and PlayersUnknown s BattleGrounds is more realistic. I am running PUBG on low/med graphics and it s still looks amazing. I am playing on a Msi Gt72 laptop with a 980m graphics card with 4 gb VRAM and Intel core 4720K and my pc can handle many advanced games with high quality so you need a pretty damn computer to run this game smoothly and with best performance. The game is based on surviving and have a few things equal to The Hungergames. It s based on the same reason on how they play but PUBG has guns wich HG didn t have. Is it worth it? YES!!! The game doesn t even cost much either and when you buy it you can get your money back if you don t like it and can refund it from steam after owning the game more than 14 days and have played the game less 3 hours so it should be 2/ 2 and 59 minutes to try the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Games need to stop going to Early Access when it's not even playable though. Looting is obviously super important but when I cant even do that because the doors to the houses look like a ing 5 year olds crayon drawing that their abusive father lit on fire and on what I'm trying to say that I can't walk through the doors into houses to loot and it's annoying.

2017-04-11,0,0,303,True,Recommended,Now I've gotta say for an early access game that has been out for 2 and a half weeks this game has less bugs than most games at their 1 year anniversary. You can tell how thoughtfull and well made it is from the sheer amount of features that it has while still maintaining full playability. Since a lot of people compare this game to H1Z1 KOTK as someone who's played and enjoyed both lets compare the two. H1Z1 PUBG as COD BattlefieldWhile both are similar in a lot of ways PUGBis undeniably more filled with features and has more realistic features than H1.Think of it like this game is a median between Arma and KOTK. It took the principle and basics of KOTK and the design choices of Arma to make a more hardcore and realistic BR game. (not to say that realism is exactly better)The reason the game feels so good to play is how polished it feels over most games that have been out for long periods of time. Instead of 3 guns that are viable to have in your hotbar there are 10+. Instead of a couple armor and helmet choices there are 9. Instead of lots of major bugs crashes etc. there are near to none.The only big problem with the game right now is the optimization. Luckilly this is said by the devs to be their top priority right now so that should be fixed in the near feature.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-04,0,0,44,True,Recommended,For a game in early access its really good. Its just like king of the kill but the devs are actually fixing the problems that the game has. I will say that the latency is a bit lack luster for a $30 title but the devs are working to fix this issue and are in communication with the community quite often. Would recommend if you like any battle royale style of game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-04,0,0,128,True,Recommended,"I don't have a whole lot of hours on BGs but I have quite a lot in h1z1 battle royale back before it split into ""king of the kill "" so I have quite the exposure to this kind of game. First and foremost BGs is a HUGE improvement over h1z1's Battle Royale. There are more weapons weapon customization and the clothing/attire looks way cooler. (none of that colorful t people wore in H1Z1) except I have to admit the pants in BGs does look a bit too...""hipster ish""The map is much more detailed and offers a wide variety of interior/exterior designs so buildings don't feel repetitive. The sound effects are probably the best part of the game. Every gun has a great sound effect that feels satisfying when you shoot even the pistols feel quite powerful and intimidating. BGs seem slower than h1z1 in the sense there's more room to be ""tactical."" I don't feel very rushed as I did in h1z1 which is great because I like games that allow for slower paced tactical strategies rather than constant holding shift and run n gun type crap. Being early access the game does suffer a bit from stability and optimization issues but I still feel this game is much more put together and more improved on h1z1's Battle Royale. The price is a bit steep I'd say $20 seems like a more fair deal imo but an extra $10 was a safe bargain since it turned out better than I expected. In the long run this game is a great buy it's fun engaging easy to get in and out of and still offers enough slow paced/tactical gameplay which I prefer. Overall I give it an 8.5/10 mostly because of the fact that it definitely scratches that ""battle royale"" itch a lot better than h1z1 did however the $30 pricetag might be a bit on the steep side considering early access/server stability/optimization issues but these are likely to be fixed soon.If you like h1z1 battle royale at all or are looking for a battle royale experience get Battlegrounds it's definitely a lot of fun.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They have unable to optimize the game without severely reducing graphics quality. Game play is stale because they won't/can't add more maps and game modes. Instead the devs focus on fixing things that takes months like vehicles only to have them still buggy. When they add something to the game it's not asked for eg. 3x and 6x sciope.

That was over an entire year ago. So of course I bought the game in early access thinking that it would be awesome to support the company. Guess that was a mistake because I just uninstalled the game after the recent news that before they could invest their time or millions of dollars of revenue from this game into fixing it or making it better they decided to add a new map and the best part? They also launched an paid ""event pass"" to unlock new cosmetics because the thousands of dollars worth of crate keys people were purchasing apparently wasn't cutting it.

2017-03-23,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,After playing for 24 hours since launch I can definitely tell this game is wasted potential. The first day everything was perfect loot rate where the plane dropped you etc was balanced fine. Now the circle will kill you in seconds if you take a single fight promoting hiding as a means to win. I looted an entire 5 building town and found only pants and fingerless gloves had a bombing zone spawn on me 3 times in a row so I couldn't leave to run for the new zone safely. The connection on the game is poor randomly I shot a player 30 times fully automatic he shot me 30 times and I died but he was barely scratched not to mention I shot first and got 10 rounds in before he even shot. The constant getting shot behind cover like trees and walls when you were in cover for 1 second but the game doesn't care. This is the biggest disappointment of 2017 thus far. If I could I'd refund it at this point.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-20,0,0,231,True,Not Recommended,you're better off playing the mod still. It's got more to do and more maps to play on. Battlegrounds is a fad that got out of hand and gives players little actual incentive to play the game aside from the player themselves wanting to play it. I've in my 200ish hours played this game of my own choice. Every single hour that i've put in this game has been with friends who asked me to play. I've never played a single match playing solo (or matching with random peoplle) It's not worth the time you put in. No reward for winning aside from some mild satisfaction and in game currency that goes to cosmetics only but it also doesn't provide you with a consistent amount of the currency to make grinding out for customizations worth it.and since they've implemented the steam marketplace into the cosmetics system the boxes you can get with the in game currency aren't worth grinding for since the better items are in cases you have to purchase like CSGO crates.The games popularity has done nothing but inflate the developers ego to the point where they're now squeezing the player base for everything they can despite having the most popular game on steam.They promise things months in advance with no real talks with the community about how or when these things will be implemented into the game and in all honesty they've become one of the worst companies in the gaming industry simply due to their overmassive egos.Don't waste your money on this game go get fortnite.Fortnites gameplay is more concentrated and more accessible. The game runs better and gives players more feedback on what they should be picking up when they come across items.Fortnite is objectively a better game and i'm most upset by the fact that i didn't return this game when i purchased it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,214,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I had quit this game about five months ago. The novelty had worn off for me. I had won some chicken dinners and lost interest in spending twenty minutes mashing F and then pitching a tent until the last few people remain. The only joy I found was in the Dacia sliding around corners and racking up high kill games by ploughing through crowds of geared tryhards. Eventually I lost interest in this as well. The new car physics at the time didn't help either as vehicles became mudane and stale for the players who valued going prone in a bush more than bouncing sideways through a field. I had to take a break.Fast forward to December and the pickup truck is released on the test server. It felt light and nimble but not unlike a truck. It slid around corners like a manual S14 and sped through the desert with the grace of a rocket powered helium elephant. It was everything I had hoped for in PUBG. A reason to come back. A few days of roadkill and motorized joy later Brendan hammered the final nail into this game's coffin for me. A small update launched on the test server making the truck steer like a crippled cruise ship and have equal weight to that of a neutron star. Sure it was technically faster but it didn't feel faster. It felt just like the majority of other cars in the game slow unresponsive and mundane. It felt as if it was merely a means for transportation. My primary weapon had little more than a vessel for full geared people to travel closer to the inner circle. And with that micro patch that stealth change that 90% of the playerbase will never notice I have put this game back onto its metaphorical shelf until the next vehicle content is released.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,296,True,Recommended,I agree with most negative reviews on this game the game could be optimized better and the servers can be god awful terrible at times. However I think this game deserves some credit. They have already fixed some issues I had with the initial release and are working quickly to fix others. As with any early access game it does have it's problems however compared to other early access games and even some full release games these problems are very minor and should be fixed. This game includes a huge variety of weapons and vehicles while also not giving to many useless weapons. In my opinion if the creater keeps up with the bugs and fixes them he has a solid 10/10 game as for now though I would give it an 8/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-31,0,0,25,True,Recommended,You will laugh cry and scream maybe all in one match. If you like Arma and the original mod it's based on you'll love this. Duo and Squad teams make it super fun. Be warned it's an EARLY ACCESS aka STILL IN DEVELOPMENT game so it's not optimized and has bugs. If you are prone to tantrums when something crashes or your FPS goes below 40 you may want to wait until it matures. But the devs seem really into the game and it's getting weekly updates so playing it while it matures has been interesting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,301,True,Recommended,Great fun can be had here. We all know the game is early access and that means you deal with the issues that come along with it. As far as my experence goes I have had a few issues with it being buggy. You get stuck in tight areas or on obstacles occasionally. Typacal server lag but honestly it hasn't been all that bad. For playing on Ultra settings I did expect more but I'm confident this will change as time passes.My biggest issue First off I have to say this because it's an issues with me. Games these days with the Pre release early access deal is crazy to me. If the game is a alpha beta whatever that's fine but trying to make money off a product that is not complete rubs me the wrong way. I get it this is the way games seem to go these days but personally its a $15 game (IF) it's to be released in this format. $30 is high to me. Maybe I'm wrong its just my opinion. I would say the same for a AAA title being droped as well. Again this is only my own issues with company's these days and doesn't reflect on this games playability or performance.Jumping in this game is ATROCIOUS! Edging and generally maneuvering over objects is a pain the the A$$. It can be the end of the match for you if you are not extreamly carful. I'm sure this will be adressed as updates contune to drop and its not a deal breaker just annoying.Framerates are up and down but never unplayable (for me atleast). I'm usually in the 60's.Plenty to do (for the moment) to keep you busy and screaming wondering where you got shot from!I would like to see more weapons in the game and interesting ways to kill. Maybe being able to setup traps with the environment or somthing would be fun or deployable traps to snag players chasing you.I think this is a fun game and with friends it makes the replay value high.My setup i7 6700k stock 4.0 clockAsus Progaming Z170GTX 1080Windows 10 Regular 7200 rpm HDD,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-21,0,0,104,False,Not Recommended,Despite the fact that game is buggy (for now) I recommend it! The biggest problem I've had is with the video settings causing rendering glitches. I'm guessing that will be fixed later and it doesn't ruin the overall experience just a problem where the map has large texture glitches that stretch over big areas and block vision. I'm sure other people have had the same (or different) problems. Glad to know though that the developer has a lot planned for this game!I would say its a functional title now even at 30 dollars its worth a try for the fun. The added on content will be a great bonus to this!EDIT Post early access edit 5/3/18. I would just like to state briefly that the pacing of this game is awful. Loot ten minutes and get headshot from 200m with an M16 a tale as old as time. Over and over and over. Then watch killcams and see that the guy gets nothing but headshots even on people who have JUST started to peek around corners. Very frustrating game would not recommend due to the grating pacing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Their support team told me I had a processor but it never reached more than 70% preformance when the game crashed because 'the processor reached max prefromance and could not handle it.' And my CPU was within the minimum spec list so clearly that's not why the game crashes. It's because PUBG have a completely support team and development team who keep on updating the game only to create more problems than they fix.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Literally crap equipment everywhere and once you are able to find good equipment you get ambushed by people who were able to find the best weapons in 3 minutes of beginning the match. And IF youre lucky enough to find good equipment the play zone shrinks on you and kills you before you can find anyone. They literally need to off with the gigantic amount of damage the play zone causes its frequency of reduction and the speed that it moves. All in all it has a long long way to go before being enjoyable. Also remove the instant death jumping out of a barely moving vehicle.Also they want to sue the developers of ""Fortnite"" for copying a game mechanic when this is clearly a wanabe H1Z1.

2018-05-01,0,0,605,False,Recommended,Honest Review This is a BR game as everybody knows. Queue to start a game is 1 second. The Gunplay of this game is something that kept me come back even if I didnt like FPS. There is bullet drop bullet velocity that makes it challenge and rewarding to hit people in some hard situation.So from here we can say that the skillcap is kind of high but still isnt necessary to be the best at shooting in order to play this game and this was another thing that kept me coming.At start I would hide more and still I was able to achieve some win this made me continue playing till I decided to start go in the middle of every fight and learn how to shoot better.The game is playable from single player to 4 players in team. There is some bug here and there nothing really gamebreaking.Now since this is an FPS ONLINE it is important to understand the server situation which is not bad at all but the problem is something related with the Unreal Engine which means that every time a new game start and there is 100 people the THICKRATE of the server could be something like 10!The Thickrate is that thing that make you feel like somebody has shoot you while you were already behind a corner for example.During the game while people die the thickrate will raise according to the number of player remaning. So let's say the game is really playable when there is 50 people alive. I mean isnt like you cannot play it before but the server is just less reliable in some situation.So is PUBG a game to buy?In my humble opinion it is but is important that you understand that in order to learn this game is required several hours of playing I'm at 500hrs atm and still I know that I can improve a lot more. I never played seriously an fps game before so at start it was really hard for me with my very low shooting skill. About cheaters well I used to play in EU server and before happens to me sometimes but in 500hrs I could count it in my hands. Now instead blueball developed some anticheat stuff and is working cause isnt happening to me anymore.About future development and patch the game is pretty match always updated with patch and fixes I saw it just improved during the time maybe slower than I would but it shouldnt be easy task to manage a game with so many users playing it.I whish you a lot of chicken dinners!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,27,True,Recommended,So this game is very fun (minus the begining when people just yell in their mics /) but it has its fair share of bugs and plenty of crashes. I kind gent told me it was just a drefragment error defraged my hard drive but crashes are persistant may hardwear should be able to run it but I think that's the problem (AMD support?). The second you start this game they tell you its in development and they will update and optimize monthly I've played early access games may times before and its all on the devs to make their promises true. This game seems to be on the right track currently but in its current state its very hard to play (eg I was in the middle of a game with 30/100 people alive and oh crashed. You always get the option to send in in a report and I do everytime). I still recommend people pick it up for later update if you wait your still not missing out on much.

I know the DEV's are working on it but holy cow the first few minutes which are crucial i either cant go in a building because it looks like a tent and hasn't loaded yet or i'm walking into walls as a result of the lag then bang i'm dead because i didn't either see the other guy who came in the room and or i couldn't pick up a weapon due to the above mentioned. The couple of match's played in duos and squad are great!!! The people i've played with on my team have been awesome in explaiining thigs i didn't know yet so thats been great!! will prob only play duos or squad going forward as it results in a better game play IMO and eventually when i get a few buds playing that will be great as well. Looking forward to the next patches and the LAG issue being fixed might give it a break untill these get sorted out like i'm sure a lot of other people.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game had so much potential but the developers keep finding new ways to screw it up worse than it already was prior to their updates. I gave this game so many chances. I paid $30 dollars for your poorly optimized buggy game and then instead of fixing it your new updates make it worse. The netcode is absolute trash. On my screen I shoot a guy in the face 10 times and on server side he won't take damage. The countless bugs can be annoying or game breaking making you lose to something that isn't your fault. Instead of fixing their netcode separating players based off of good ping and developing a structured game Bluehole does the opposite. Their ""Fix PUBG"" campaign is worthless and seems to be creating more problems than actually mediating the preexisting ones. I really wanted this to be a good game I was a huge fan for the longest time but it's just not good. COD BO4 and BFV will most likely blow this game out of the water.

Please keep up the good work.*Edit*I'm getting pretty close to throwing in the towel on this game. I'm extremely fed up with campers who are so lacking in skill they will sit in a house refusing to move an inch until you walk into their gun reticle. This is a royal pain in the with 3rd person. Nothing much they can do about it. Pansies need to go back to Overwatch baby game. I am also sick of shooting people and it just doesn't work some games. I am assuming it is lag related. Sometimes guns work and sometimes they don't even register a hit.Update 2Now switched to thumbs down. Every game ends with me checking my shadowplay footage and watching as I rail into people and get blood splashes and just insta die when they turn around and press the button. No idea why this constantly happens and no longer care. Netcode and server issues should be #1 on their priorites and no one should even own this game yet if this is how it ""works"".

2017-03-24,0,0,103,True,Recommended,"After I was refunded someone else purchased the game for me and said ""Just give squads a shot..."" and I did. It changed my entire opinion of the game. Granted most of my former review stands there's nothing overly innovative about this title but the squad gameplay is much more fun.I can't give testament to the random match squads or the community though. I can tell you that it's a game like Call of Duty when it comes to mics. The game has open microphones (that you can change in the setting) for everyone in the starting area (lobby) and the plane before the drop. If someone wants to be heard they can be. That being said my settings have been changed to where I can only hear my squad since day 1. I don't feel like ear contributes anything to this game. There are kids that feel it necessary to scream or make obnoxious noises. It's the internet.Off my soap box tl dr Squad queues are what made me give this game a chance. It's something that's been there since day one I just didn't partake. PREVIOUS THUMBS DOWN REVIEW There's nothing innovative about this game. It's basically the Arma version pushed into Unreal Engine and given a leaderboard. As for the videos of ghillied snipers with a full loadout you have to have the best luck in the world for that. You're lucky to find an optic at all let alone a decent one. And if you find an optic you probably won't find a weapon suitable. It's the nature of the beast. You don't get an hour to go loot around before starting a fight. This isn't a sandbox survival game.And when I say Arma version I mean they took the choppiness and everything of Arma pre 64x Release and put it in Unreal Engine. I experienced frame drops with a 4.84GHz processor and GTX 970. Arma runs smoother for me than this.As for looting it's not super intuitive. I only played two rounds. Of those two rounds I probably spent half the game looking for a yellow sheen on things I could pick up. Then I had to find the perfect angle to be able to interact with it. And when you're looting something such as a supply crate there's no ""Oh crap"" button that lets you instantly control your character again. I don't know what ""balancing"" issues dev's think there is with that but if you can drop what you're doing in real life in an instant I don't see why making a half second delay is important.

You then take your car to where the circle gets small and the gas pushes the play to a tighter area upon the map.. leave it and wait for desperate gas injured souls to be reaped one mouse click at a time. Also using injured opponents as bait for their team. D If that sort of play doesn't excite you.. and someone sniping you when you have faught your way through 90+ opponents.. and if not being able to find a weapon to only have a person down you with a shotgun blast.. then this game is not for you this game requires patience and planning.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,301,True,Recommended,I was going to buy Dayz standalone but went for this instead. So glad that i did. Although I'm only about 12 hours into the game i can get enough of it. Great balance between being too long and too short matches. The initial rush to find a gun before you encounter someone makes it all the more intense. Usually by the time you find a few bits its time to set a course of travel as the zones are begining to get smaller. This change of zones along with the red zone (airstrike zone) ensures players arn't all waiting for each other to make a move in a long drawn out AFK fest. It forces players to keep moving and in most cases have to plan ahead and think about cover from point A to B. Overall great game and considering its only just been released and theres a lot more updates and optimisation to come i can say you will have a blast. Specs for comparison.i5 6600rx480 4gb8gb ramgetting 55 74 FPS on High settings. most of the time in low 60's(Note that if you are worried about running this game they are in the process of making this game more optimised so i should run a little smoother for you),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Their needs a ranking system in ((( P.U.B.G))) that awards special gear per class for the ability to lead a team to victory being a support class medic or sniper 9 not implying that they should start off with weapons but just have better odds of finding class specific gear based on your rank. vehicles need more things to get them to start up like dayz or arma but i understand its a more fluid game but atleast make the tires blow depending on the incoming shots or hit a fuel tank and lose fuel rapidly. Maybe set up booby traps along the road via spike strips or (nails) you can find in those tiny shacks along the roads or sabatage a vehicle like cutting the break lines and watch everyone have to try and jump out ""safely!""

2018-06-19,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,After 1.0 the game completely tanked. The in game purchases were completely unnecesary to the games longevity and functionality. They decided they just wanted more money at the expense of rewarding their faithful players. Still has a decent player base but honestly don't buy this. You shouldn't reward bad practice. They took what could've been amazing and decided to let it all go to Optimization is STILL questionable. Hackers are STILL in the game. Loot boxes are STILL being pumped out despite these problems. And the developers are STILL not adding anything to the game that makes players WANT to keep playing. As funny as the statement sounds the only reason to keep playing is if you're having fun with it. Power to you if that's the case. But frankly it seems awfully unfair to the many who have poured hours into this game and only be rewarded with a lootbox system that gives you a chance to PAY to open it.If you REALLY want to play this game sure buy it. But I would honestly and whole heartedly direct you to other alternatives. Yes even Fortnite. The game isn't bad to be honest. But it has bad practices which we shouldn't reward.

It kind of forces you to play as though you were actually on an island in a mass game of manhunt. You have to always assume some is behind a door in a house or watching you. It forces you to work tactically and is honestly a lot of fun. I really enjoyed DayZ but that has just turned into a kill on sight game anyway. I think the optimizations are pretty good at this point (I'm a software engineer) especially for early access. I have a pretty good gaming setup but nothing fantastical. Therefore I think a large percentage of you Steam folk have setups that can handle this game easily. I play it on the 'High' settings and am pretty sure I could get away with ""Ultra"" if I wanted to. The only 'Con' is that on the odd occasion a server 'drops' but that's somewhat rare and is obviously only going to improve!I'd definitely recommend you pickup this game and give it a try at least for 5 rounds.

2017-05-14,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,"Rolling TL DR This game doesn't deserve the following it has. It's fun sure but it's early access as all hell and isn't receiving updates fast enough to explain what they're doing with the money they've received. Not impressed so not recommended. You should wait for more content and/or a Steam sale. Update Summer 2018 sale I would not buy it for $20 Read on for my ongoing thoughts about this early access experience including my first impressions in the review toward the bottom. More recent updates are posted above older ones so start at the bottom if you want to read chronologically. Blue text indicates the beginning of each new entry.UPDATE 2 (October 2017)Ratings on this review are being reset as I'm again changing to Not Recommended.FOV slider applies to first person perspective only (leaving a lot to be desired with 3rd person). Not sure how they think a 3rd person slider would imbalance the game (read it wouldnt they're idiots) so I deduct a serious number of points for this one. They obviously already acknowledge some players prefer wider FOVs (as well as the lack of effect this has on balance) hence the implementation of the slider so they're only sticking it up us by not allowing third person FOV changes.Game has received significant performance and networking updates all good things. Picking up items and interacting with doors and vehicles is still laggy (upwards of 500ms at times) and has room for major improvement. The time I spend standing there waiting for an item to enter my inventory is infuriating at times moreso when I have to click an item multiple times to get it to actually pick up. In a game entirely revolved around picking up loot this should be a top priority.The main menu options and ingame interface all need further work. Party system is still half baked often have to have members of your party refresh the UI in order for them to be able to ready up.Weapons still do not always hit where the optic's crosshair is aimed. Firing rapidly on semi auto is detrimental as clicking too fast can simply cause the gun to recoil outside of the scope even though the scope should be physically attached to the gun visualizing the exact recoil you need to correct for. Pro tip Either fire one shot per second at long range or automatic fire from the hip at short range.Content updates in the way of weapons and maps are trickling in. Can't really complain they're not a big team... Though for their ridiculous revenue from this game so far I also don't understand why things haven't sped up substantially.I continue to play the game on and off because I have friends who enjoy it and would probably play regardless of my participation. That does in no way mean I am satisfied with the state of the game especially with the honestly undeserved following which it has.UPDATE 1 (June 2017)Changing recommendation from negative to postitive. The game has received updates to improve performance and the gameplay has turned out quite entertaining. I dread the day first person only modes pop up because all my mates will be up for that yet I won't be able to play due to the FOV. C'mon devs you disabled the FOV workaround yet still haven't implemented a slider...ORIGINAL REVIEW (May 2017)In a nutshellThe game seems solid but needs some more work before I can recommend buying it at this price ($30). I understand fans of the genre might want to support development by prepurchasing a game for a premium price but the average gamer would expect a little more polish.The game feels good I don't want to detract from that. * o/*Emphasis.* o/* I may even change this recommendation to a positive one once I have more hours of good experiences to outweigh the negatives. I'll talk more about my positive experiences in it when I have some more experience playing. The following represents my first experiences playing and the most disappointing things I encountered. I'm also identifying the individual issues seperately so that the devs can act on or respond to each.There is no FOV slider (yet)Despite it being planned this should be a high priority for any FPS. I am among an admitted minority of players whom get migraines while playing low FOV games. It took me years to diagnose the cause but it prevents me from playing without mods a large number of games including World of Warcraft. I have also had no luck editing .ini files to ""lock"" the FOV (locked to what I do not know no one explaining how to edit the file seems to know what the script even does).Seriously fix this or I will not be playing much longer.Key mapping doesn't workRebinding keys in the options menu seems to have no effect. I rebound them reopened the game to find them reset. Rebound them again got in a match and found them once again reset. Rebound a third time while still in that match opened and closed the options menu to find that what was bound did not reflect what I was seeing in game the text fields change but the binds do not. I ended up reaching 8th place on my first match then died because of the keybinds (I stood up instead of going prone). &lt now fixed&gt Friends list requires manual refreshWhy? No other game does this. This item was a suggestion by one of the guys I play with I haven't noticed it yet namely because I don't organise the party. &lt still a problem&gt Offline players in partyI haven't seen this but my mates explained to me that quitting the game does not quit me from the party. Wut? &lt still a problem&gt PerformanceThis one's way down the bottom because it's understandable for a game of this type to suffer from an early access performance hit. It doesn't really bother me aside from a noticably higher than usual input lag on my mouse. I hope that they work on this ASAP as poor framerates can hurt the longevity of a game despite how fun it is. I can only imagine what people with lower end hardware are experiencing. &lt ongoing&gt More content will be added as I encounter it be that positive or negative experiences.

Even in same modes the path of the plane varies equipment and vehicle spawns vary and where other players choose to land varies. The circle is unpredictable and makes every match feel different from the last. There are many ways to play be it agressive or stealthily and it keeps me wanting to come back for more. With only one of 100 players coming on top the 99% chance of defeat is fun to challenge and the chicken dinners are great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-03,0,0,390,True,Recommended,Battlegrounds is a last man standing game where death means you have to search for a new gameI wasn't a fan of the game mode until played battlegrounds. This game is amazing! The map is huge but is completely filled with gear guns and ammo. You start of by skydiving off a plane that's on fire and lands g wherever you guide the parachute toUpon landing that's when you start surviving. Of course with a huge maps even 99 other players can be hard to find so the developers remedy to this is to have a forcefield start corraling players into a circle that gets smaller and smaller as time goes on until the game endsShould you catch yourself outside of the force field it will slowly drain away your health. Not an insane pace but a person with full health has about only a minute to get into the designated circle before dying Not only do you have the threat or other players and the incoming force field to deal with but if you get caught in a red circle RUN! Because random parts of the island start getting carpet bombed and the only indication of what area is about to be bombed is a red circle on your map. Rounds wise it all depends how long you live. I had one match where it took longer to load up the map than I stayed aliveI had another where I was in the top 10 died at about the 18 minute mark. Finding a match is quick as a lot of people are playing I take an average of 30 45 seconds to find a full 90 100 people server Optimizeation could be better but I'm not complaining the only real lagging or glitches I see are in the pregame lobby where all 100 people are in the same vicinity. With my gtx 1060 desktop I get about 75fps on ultra with my gtx 1050 laptop I get about 50fps on mediumPros Lots and lots and lots of weapon varietyLots of attachmentsQuick match timesGetting a kill is so satisfyingrealistic but not Arma realisticConsVehicles can be really hard to controlLoad times can vary wildlySometimes characters won't pick up ammo even though they bend over for itDoors take a second to open after the button is pressed which had led to a couple of deaths.

2017-10-07,0,0,203,True,Not Recommended,The game is a great concept but I would keep looking at other games with similar concepts until this game at least leaves early access. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RAGE INDUCER!!! There are still several things in the game that are easily exploited by other players the most noticeable I've seen is lag exploitation. This game has terrible lag compensation and it tends to somehow make players move ahead of where they actually are. I've even noticed this happen to me (I would skip further ahead in a run or when I tried to run into a doorway at an angle I would skip to the otherside of the doorway and get stuck in the animation that makes me move my momentum in the other direction. Also doors don't always seem to want to open. I have an excellent connection and have seen this problem on multiple connections besides my own). I've noticed several players who seem to use that to their advantage to make it much harder to track their movements while aiming or if in the beginning of the game make them run faster than you while you're both at a dead run with fists out (had a guy back up while reloading a weapon faster than I could run at him holding shift. It's ridiculous how much of an advantage this is and how easy it is to get). I've looked up how to do this and it seems a lag switch in this game is much more effective than in other games.They have several other technical issues such as the third person aiming not being accurate (it pulls slightly to the left of where the reticule actually is)On top of all of that they have a knack for banning people based on the say so of whiny adult sized children (I mean a bunch of streamers). So yeah save yourself a headache and wait on this game it is not worth it at this point. Maybe it will be fine at some point in its life but right now it's a nightmare.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,912,True,Recommended,Personally I think the game is fantastic but I know that my opinion doesn't reflect the same as ya'll motha a's. So I will list some pros/cons for you. Pros 1. If you want realism I would say this game has hit a good amount of realism but not to the point of something like Sims combined with Arma 3 it has a great ability of balancing realism and non realism.2. The game will most definitely hit you with a HUGE amount of adrenaline ESPECIALLY if you're in the top 5 10. It becomes so in tents. (like camping). Idk about you but personally I love me some adrenaline. 3. It has REALLY REALLY nice gunplay. I.E. Realistic gun sound bullet sounds on impact and very nice fluid weapon mechanics.4. The games pace is a nice balance between Dayz and the BF series. It has those nice Dayz moments where you'll just be setting around talking about how your sister slept with your cousin and your dog ate your and then BOOM shots are flying and gone from 0 to High school virgin about to get laid on prom night. 13/10 would play again.5. The devs seem to be very proactive so far pushing out updates and letting all of it's fan base know what it's planning/going to do during the future/next updates.Cons 1. Now one of the biggest and I do mean biggest because it seems to be a huge issue is the amount of crashes I've had or have witnessed on a daily basis. There are at least 5 12 players every game who's clients crash. The devs have been diligently working on this issue (according to them.). I think that a nice temporary band aid for this issue would be to possibly add in a re join feature that lets you re join a game that you have dc'd from in the last 3 4 mins.2. It's a game of campers. If you're a camper you can get to late game very easily. I feel like the game needs to have some sort of counterplay to the amount of campers there actually are in this game. I believe that they should focus on implenting a First Person Only mode right away rather than adding new guns/cars/maps.3. Appart from your first few wins winning doesn't feel very good. I think they should give you some sort of medal that goes on your clothing or maybe even a special kind of clothing piece. (or weapon skin.) for every win that you get. I.E. 1 win gives you a bronze stripe on your clothing and 2 gives you 2 stripes or maybe a tick mark on your gun for every win. Then 5 wins gives you a silver stripe and then gold etc...4. It would be pretty cool if they could extend the times of circles by maybe 30 seconds. Because right now you really have to hurry up and find items then gtfo of where you are. (unless you get lucky and end up in the center so you can just camp.)5. Late game feels like mostly more RNG circle luck than actual skill. You're going to either be able to have the enemy leave their cover to run to you because you're in the circle or you're going to leave your cover to run to them. (also there would be counterplay to this if they removed/added a first person mode.)Anyway TL DR if Steam let you rate with stars I'd give this game 4.1/5,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-28,0,0,61,True,Recommended,Simple design with nuances that keep you coming back for more.Yes this game is buggy. There are delays when picking up items getting into and out of vehicles and the water physics are a mess. So you could say the major problems with this game stem from the polish rather than any core design flaw. Having the players choose where they land the randomness of equipment drops and the shooting feel wonderful are why I come back to this game over and over again. Have I or will I ever tast the chicken dinner? No. Do I still have fun playing it? Absolutely.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,92,True,Recommended,"I never thought anyone would balance this concept so well. The game runs smoothly with graphics maxed. The game style itself is unique and enjoyable in many ways. From gathering what you need for battle in hopes no one finds you before you have anything worth toting around. The character customization Which I've barely scratched and it's pretty good compared to most mass multiplayer games with survival like aspects. The vehicles you can find in game move smoothly as your character does and the mechanic or function for controlling the vehicles kicks that of any GTA game or any game claiming to be ""realistic"". The map itself is not only huge but it is covered in detailed architecture. There are very few reused prefabs compared to other games. The only serious complaints outside of the obvious are few. The number of points to get a ""reward box"" with a random item in it costs a bit too much and doubles in cost each time you get one. This wouldn't be such an annoyance if it wasn't for the fact that you don't know what you're getting. I got 3 dirty white wife beaters in a row and gave up on the reward box. There should be an item that you can find that alerts you to a general direction when someone is around because more often than not people are being shot in the back while trying to have a showdown with another player with no way to see it coming. Maybe a very vague radar with a short distance sensor. To the obvious problems. Even though the items are very customizable the character itself you choose from is very limited in customization. I'm sure that's on the list of things the creators will change. The one thing that irks me the most is with all the capability they have there is no training or goof around game mode where you can get a grip on the game. You're thrown right into the 9/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-02,0,0,420,True,Recommended,What is this Game? Playerunknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG for short is an online multiplayer battle royale game where you either alone or with a squad of others fight to be the last one(s) standing in this tactical game of survival combat. You can choose to go at it alone or pair up with 1 3 other players where the aim of the game is literally to kill or be killed. You will be air dropped onto an abandoned island where you will need to scavenge for weapons ammunition equipment and medical supplies all while encountering other hostile players and avoiding the deadly forcefield. Your mission is to equip yourself to survive combat with other players while also making your way to each safe zone in order to survive the ever restricting play zone. The longer you survive and the more players you kill the better the placement you will recieive which will yield a greater currency payout and better personal stats. In PUBG you have access to a wide assortment of weapons and equipment as well as a variety of vehicles to help you survive the various locations in the map. A Bit of Background When I first heard about this game it was back before the game went into closed alpha and my mates and I were still on the H1Z1 King of the Kill jams. Already being fans of the battle royale genre we were pretty keen for PUBG as we expected it to be the next big thing and thought it would be everything H1Z1 was and more.When the game went into closed beta and it became available to pre order with a beta key I took one for the team and pre ordered the deluxe version to see if it was everything we had hoped. Off the bat I was really impressed with the higher level of detail compared to H1Z1 and the game world felt a lot more real. I still remember that one of the things that impressed me most was the gun play the weapons felt powerful and sounded amazing. The more realistic approach to bullet drop and travel as well as the real to life audio mechanics of trying to find where a shot was coming from really appealed to me. Even if I was missing shots or shooting at nothing at all the gun play was enough to keep me having fun.PUBG also expanded on H1Z1 by having things we had always hoped for like weapon attachments a minimap no bleeding after taking damage alternate firing modes a leaning function and that's only to name a few. The game wasn't without its issues though as servers were incredibly unstable and laggy at times and game breaking bugs could cause your match to come to an abrupt end. A lot of these issues carried through to early access release but there were enough great features and mechanics there to keep you playing. The Game Today As of writing this review the game is now three months into its early access release having sold over four million copies. In comparison the population of my home country New Zealand is 4.4 million so that's pretty damn impressive. Today the game has never been better as Playerunkown and his fantastic team have worked incredibly hard to keep the game regularly updated with performance patches and new content. A lot of games go into Steam Early Access but in my opinion no other game has done early access as well as PUBG has. Not only is the game itself brilliant but the awesome team behind it has strived to deliver what they promised with regular updates that actually noticeably improve the game. Each week there is a new performance update to improve the servers and gameplay experience while each month there is a new large content update that brings even more fixes alongside new content such as weapons vehicles and new gameplay mechanics. With a game that at its core is so fun to play coupled with a large player base and hard working developers PUBG is a great gaming experience. In Conclusion... Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is an awesome game out of all of the games I have purchased since I bought my PC it is probably my favourite and is the one game I keep coming back to no matter what. With a dedicated team that keeps the game regularly updated with performance fixes and new content I'd say it has a bright future and is well worth the early access price. In the months to come we can expect even more new weapons including some more high caliber firearms as well as total building destructibility and new maps and gamemodes. I am defnitely keen to see the game grow even more than it already has. One note that I'd make is that although the game is fully playable as a solo player it is definitely more fun with friends but there is an in game option that allows you to pair up with other players too. 9/10 would Chicken Dinner again. Great gameplay great visuals and audio great devs just a great game. Can't go wrong with PUBG.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,147,True,Recommended,"So from what I've played so far it's a pretty nice game. I like the whole Battle Royale theme and how everything to a point is balanced out. You could land on a scythe (a low end melee) just as easily as you could land on an M4 and level 2 body armor. The game is fast paced as a whole ending at around the 20 minute mark but has enough gaps and slow pacing to even it out.Some downsides however are the performance and the speed of looking around in first person. Now I have a high end computer but changing from max to minimum graphics settings got me almost no performance boost (not that I necessarily needed one) but I can see how it would affect lower end computers. The looking around in first person has a small ""delay"" which isnt hardware acceleration or any kind of input lag. It's similar to DayZ or GTA V where first person has a bit of slowness to looking around. The FOV can't be changed as well which affects me as looking around quickly looking at a narrow view and sitting like a foot from my monitor combine and strain my eyes but I guess thats more on me than it is the game.Overall if you like Battle Royale gamemodes or mods and want a decent one (this isnt a mod this is its own game) that has a lot of players quick entry to matches (matches easily get 96 players and start within 2 minutes) don't mind the performance and have the $30 to spare I would recommend it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,148,True,Recommended,I feel that I can actually recommend this game it's really fun to play both alone one friend or many friends. You can simply say you drop from an airplane with 100 players with nothing but the cloth or no cloth you have on you. And it's your mission to find weapons armor health packs and so on to survive and kill your enemies until you are the last one standing or team standing. While you try to survive you also have like safe zones that you need to be in with a force feeld that comes closer all the time are you outside the safe zone you will lose health with time. You can easy say that the game force you on the map closer to other players so you can't just camp all the time. It's random also where the safe zone will be so every game will be different where the battle will be on that big island. You can win in different ways also some people like to stealth and simply avoid the battle and let other players kill each other or you can try to kill other people as much as you can but it's risky. The state of the game right now is not the best performance but the devs have been working on it and trying to fix it. It have been an update to fix some of it and it have been better. In such a short time they have been updating weary much and I hope they will continue on that and improve the game. But even at this state I have been enjoying the hell out of this game and think it's easy worth 29 99 .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,505,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. Quick break down to a very fun game.You'll start in a lobby where you can join a squad go solo or a duo modify your characters clothes check your stat's check other players stats check a leader board and keep tabs on points you're earned during gameplay. You'll use those points to collect rewards which so far just appearal to customize your characters appreance. I haven't seen any benifit to ""armor"" but camo wise it's something to think about.Once you've decided how you want to play (ie solo duo or squad) you'll check the ready button and you'll find yourself on an island of the Immortals. 100 players in total will load into this island where you can run around for an alotted time usually a minute. Although there are guns and such on this island which you can practice shooting players and such it's also a time for a bunch of immature players to yell racial points of view or hassle one another babbling. Because of this you can hide underwater you can't hear any of it. Admittingly though I've seen some cool stuff people forming prone snakes or people spread out into a milliary formation doing exercises with one player yelling at them to work harder.. but it's still not enough to get to get me out of the water.. So after the Minute is Up...Everyone from the island is packed into a jumbo jet and that jet fly's over a HUGE island. You jump out whenever you feel like it and parachute to whatever location you can reach. Again sadly though.. all the hat's are aboard this flight.. so you'll have to endure their immaturity once again... So... once you jump...You'll hit the ground and have only a bit of time to gather guns gear and if possible a vehicle. The map will tell you where you need to be as far as ""in bounds"" is concerned. It's a circle you need to be inside of or you'll take damage and eventually die from. The game will do this about five times making the ""in bound"" circle smaller and smaller and being out of bounds will take more life from you the smaller the ""in bound"" circle gets. This is a good measure to prevent campers and lazy players affraid to engage players. So the game will help you find Ballz you never knew you had... isn't that something!You'll be able to see how many players are left in the match at all times. You'll want to be the Land Man Standing or Squad. Great fun and with vehicles the strategies of game play... just makes for a great game all around. Really looking forward to the Beta.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-09,0,0,163,True,Recommended,Great game but needs FPS/Rendering issues to be fixed asap. Sometimes it takes 1minute to resolve but other times it can last 4 minutes and the games last roughly 30mins to an hour depending on the players. Also there are some server lag spiking issues as well especially at the start of the game. I know this will all be fixed by then and thats great. For the pioneer crates that you can buy though can take a long time to gather so I hope they place another prize option that will be cheaper. Every game I've played so far provides 100 200 points and the first pioneer crate is 700 points. After gathering that first one they just keep doubling the price making it more of a grind to get a crate that has nothing but crap in them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

During the early access stage I was more forgiving when I encountered a bug that would either A) break the game or B) cause a minor inconvinience because well it is in E.A. I took a big ol break from the game a few months after miramar came out because I started to get bored of it which is no worry because I can take a break and come back to it later. Thus my return I am welcomed by the full release of the game which I appreciate because it has been in early access for a min. The keys and crates dont bother me because it's only cosmetics so i jump in with some buds. First game it takes forever for me to load into the game which would always happen first match no biggie i die pretty quick first game and then onto the next one. Game crashes. HUH?? I thought by now they would have patched that preload crash i guess not. somewhere into my 4th game I die while behind a wall...................... poor netcode... after countless updates and ""patches"" their netcode is still garbage... Shots dont hit and getting shot behind walls is still a thing. I was expecting a polished game (dont get me wrong it has improved) but i get the same mess as before.

2018-04-28,0,0,87,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely great and i recommand it to you guys the devs are doing a lot for this judging by the new update and always bring new content!Still this game isn't perfect Vehicle physics are ed performance issues in building the game would need some sort of progression system (missions for BP...) Considering that the price of boxes you buy with in game currency goes up every time you buy one (up to 3000 or more if i'm correct)(reset every week) and that a usual game (if you are not a pro player like me) will get you 100 200 BP (in game currency) i think that the boxes's price should be lowered a bit. Every automatic weapons you pick will be by default in single fire mode which is gonna make you awkwardly lose a lot of close range duels if you are in a rush. I think these weapons should begin as auto fire mode since it is in auto you will not be annoyed at close or long range because you can spry or tap but when in single you will only be able to tap which is better for long medium range and defenitly not in close range.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Things I would change if I could WING SUIT! So many times I've wished I could get just over there only to land way short... then either a) change plans b) steal ""acquire"" a vehicle or c) the game becomes ""Running Simulator/Please Shoot Me Simulator V1.2"" (version 1.1 is BF1 on Sinai).Hitbox on the vehicles could use some work juking a dune buggy resulted in me being ""run over"" as the dune buggy passed 15 feet to my left (though that could be a latency issue). Attempting to run someone else over resulted in them standing on the hood of my truck for about a mile and a half.Game needs a ""climb"" mechanic. So many places to explore but no way to get there unless you parachute on top.More boats. Would love to get to a couple of the bigger islands but there are not many boats. By the time one is stolen ""acquired"" the circle is shrinking and here comes the Blue Wall of Pain.Vehicle mounted weapons? Maybe not. Then you'd just end up with people camping the circle center and creaming anyone stupid enough to poke their head up.Motorcycles. Or bicycles. Or even a pair of roller skates ANYTHING but (more) running... Some kind of randomizing mechanic so EVERYONE doesn't bum rush the same spots over and over (see military base control tower the tunnels just to the west of the sunken buildings at the map center etc). Move stuff around some.Different maps? Doesn't have to be on a fixed rotation... just something different... Just my two cents... it's not a bad game.

2018-03-26,0,0,44,False,Not Recommended,"Was doing GREAT in the middle of a match. Found a SCAR killed a guy and took his 8x range scope to slap on it map started closing in so I started moving because I was sure there weren't any ""edge of the map"" players around to shoot me in the and then I get hit with a ""server lag"" and then by the time the issue was fixed I was well behind the circle and then ended up dying because of it. Keep in mind my internet here is good and I have NEVER dealt with lag issues with any game I play. I was in the top 15 of the match and stood a GOOD change to at least make top 5. I refuse to review this game on a number scale but apparently they are still having the server issues I've heard about before. Yeah you deal with cheaters and also t deaths but it's easier to get top 10 than you think. I've had situations where people magically knew where I was despite not moving or anything. The game is just an unfixed piece of trash. However I still like looting houses and getting the gear I need and then ninja killing people. My FAVORITE thing to do is out play the players who hug the edge of the map the entire match. Best update they did was to make the cirlce move in faster and increase its speed at the beginning. It makes it much harder to hug the edge of the map when you can't outrun the circle. You'll have fun you'll hate it and sometimes you'll hate yourself for having fun on this game.

2017-06-03,0,0,48,True,Not Recommended,Do I think the actual gameplay itself is bad? No its fun and very competitive.Do i think its worth buying in its current state? Not whatsoever.Im going to list off some things that need to change before I can reccomend it.1. Lag problems There are some big server problems with lag. Once you land on the ground from the airplance sometimes the buildings wont even load in and if you even manage to get inside everything is invisible and there is no ground to walk on.2. Loading screen freezing Now there was a solution for this on the forums but it no longer works for me when loading into a game the loading screen will freeze or it wont disapear meaning you can hear the game in the background going on but you cant see anythnig because the loading screen is in the way.3. Cheating This is a pretty big problem. People can mod the game so that you can see through buildings add a player radar and some other stuff. The devlopers also dont aknowlage this stuff either.This game needs some major improvements before i can reccomend,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-05,0,0,114,True,Recommended,"Just recently hit 90+ hours on this game and decided it was about time that I right a review for the game and here it is. The game is a battle royale game similar to games such as H1Z1 Last Man Standing and Islands Of Nyne. This game is definitely the most sophisticated of them all despite it being in early access. It runs fairly well if you have a moderate computer (I average 40 fps on medium settings on a $1 200 laptop) and is optimized pretty okay especially after the new update which answered the communities cries for improved optimization. The development team seems to be involved with the player base and is always trying to improve their game for their players. Although I have almost 100 hours on the game and frequently play it I would confidently say this is not my favorite game on Steam. In my opinion the game can get stale rather quick if you are playing the game by yourself which detracts from the possible fun of playing duos or squads with a group of friends. The ""auto match"" system is a good feature but it's a pretty polarizing feature. Getting one game with auto match where you get placed with a group of 3 that just kill the odd one out can put a sour tast in your mouth for sure. I suggest if you are to get this game get it along with friends so you have someone to play with even if it's just a duo partner. The $30 price is an acceptable price for a seemingly fleshed out early access game such as this. Speaking of money recently there were microtransactions added into the game which was said not to be added until the game was released as a full game. Many people complain but if you really don't like the decision you don't have to buy them anyways. And this was most likely done to get some extra funding for the development team so they can keep bringing good changes to the game. With all this said how do I rate it?Dev team 8/10 Early access progress 8/10Overall gameplay 7/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-14,0,0,62,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a really fun and challenging game. Its not been out for long but it takes a massive dump all over H1Z1. Suprisingly there are no game breaking bugs (that ive came across). The game is very realistic as in you sometimes don't have a clue where you are being shot from and theres no kill cam so you dont know where you got killed from. The game punishes you if you are lackadaisical. It can be frustrating at times but its very rewarding and one hell of an adrenaline rush once you build a chain of kills in a match. Its hard hitting as all your effort can go down the crapper in an instant which leaves you frustrated and annoyed which makes you want to put your hand through your monitor and rip your keyboard in half. Good game thoroughly recommend it especially if you have a few friends who also have the game as squad play makes it even funner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Played all modes the worst by far is random squad 9 times out of 10 I got a team that did not communicate and many of them just went awol while I ended up facing a whole squad myself many times. If your playing solo solo fpp is probably the best mode. The maps are just too big what I have realized is that to reduce the game being a ""walking simulator"" many just straight up drop in to the hot zones and fight out for the best equipment. I found out the game tends to be a lot more fun then makes it a lot more tense quickly scavenging for material while trying to survive with other players few feet away can get your heart really racing.The controls seem floaty not very smooth or responsive depite maintaining a constant 60 fps. Its extremely fun with friends since communication is key. Overall I would say this game is meh...I mean the frequency of weapons and equipment is completely RNG which bothers me I someitmes end up in a popular area rush to a house and there is absolutely nothing (the house was not even raided before) maybe just a pathetic pistol. Sometimes I would end up landing on a house with levle 2 3 armor and high powered weapons so not all games are consistent which can be frustrating at times.Would reccomend if you have a consistent group of friends to play with would also reccomend it for solo only if you play with the style of always landing in the hot zones rather than in the outskirts where the game turns into a walking simulator and your biggest enemy is the big wall that is trying to kill you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,560,True,Recommended,"Hey there!I am writing to express my overall review of the Player Unknown's BattleGrounds! To be honest I am overly impressed by both the gameplay and the graphics including the weapons textures and maps.As a quick reminder for the following text this is early access which means that the game is under making/creating and by that it is acceptable to have bugs and crashes so keep up until it reaches the official release.My main points are based on gameplay crashes and bugs which I may reveal for you to help fixing them There are several hitbox failures around the map (for example at the abandoned castle near Rozhok) where the players can easily stuck behind a crate or any props. Also there is a movment section which appears when something fails e.g. getting stuck on the top of a car. The game ""Doesn't like Alt+tabs"" which literally means that it crashes or fails to load again on Alt tab ing. This may not be an official problem but I thought I must have a few words on the item spread. There are a lot of players who want to camp which might could be a reason for the items on the map to contain more sniper rifles or an alternate category of weapons which ranges between the faded line of sniper rifles and assault rifles. In the first minute before the game starts usually the players can't be seen but their hitbox are alive. The parachuting movment is a bit strange both in control and animation extremely at the end. There is a glitch where players burning effect isn't over after getting into the plane which shows a little red trail (sometimes 2) which is funny in fact but I believe it isn't ment to be ). When you are selecting your character's appearance the bald hairstyle shows a red hairstyle which isn't bald. I would recommend to place the play button on a more specific place or highlight it more because a lot of times while playing with a crew we are not able to see the ready to play button. In extreme circumstances I would prefer a bit of a ringing sound or a bell sound to hear the sound (even when Alt+tabbed)After all I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to everyone especially who likes FPS/TPS/Multiplayer/Shooting/Action/Open World games. I hope that my letter catches the developers attentions and hoping for a reply. Thanks for making this awesome game.Yours Faithfully Laddze",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,121,True,Recommended,Playing this game as Early Access and yeah it's Early Access IT has bugs the framerate dips making FPS Twitch play impossible sometimes. The melee combat feels like whiffle bat jousting blindfolded. There are graphical issues and it is one game type.BUT!It's fun man it's tense on solo hiding and hunting other players. Scavenging for loot and sniping fools who cross your path. Or in my case being shot in the back of the head.Team games are action packed as 4 of you drive your UAV around assaulting anyone who gets spotted machine gun combat avenging a friend and being the last man standing as your squad cheers you on.I love it.I would love to see optimisation but thats their plan... remember its EARLY ACCESS!!!Id also like to see a play area stay large for a slower hunting sniping mode maybe with more air strike drops.I think they will make crates a pay to win thing but as they only get starting gear that is cosmetic or minor upgrades i.e. Helmet Gas Mask it's still balanced.If people start getting assault rifles in crates as starting gear thats going to cause balancing issues.But... We will see High Hopes for this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Much more variation in weapons a larger map more support and an easier time picking up (easier gunplay easy to use vehicles) make this game much better.

2017-06-04,0,0,27,True,Recommended,"No other game in my life has ever made me feel the same way as PUBG. I've seen it a handful of times on Kotaku and a few ""Best of"" videos for and giggle but I've never actually played it because I'm not that huge of a PVP person. But I decided to say to hell with it and give it a 2 Hour Trial (you can refund games on Steam if played for less then 2 hours).Round 1 Died while wondering why my assault rifle wasn't on auto.Round 2 Got Falcon Punched about 30min in. Didn't even fire a bullet.Round 3 Laid prone in the shadow of a bail of hay for a solid 10min with a car as bait in front of me. Saw a dude flip over a motorcycle and die at #19. I should have been recording. Made it to NUMBER 2!!!!Round 4 yeah hiding in a bathroom till there was only one person left and they opened the door while you're prone on the floor.Seriously I've been feeling in a rut about games for a long LONG time (only really play WoW at this point and that's more because I can pay for the subscription with in game gold). Prey was a nice diversion recently but nothing super ground breaking or engaging there (I do enjoy Bioshock esq games). But PUBG has rekindled a dying feeling inside me that sense of pure adrenaline of actual fear and thrill that comes with it. I cannot endorse this game enough.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-16,0,0,573,True,Recommended,All right after pledging never to buy an Early Access Title again ofc i bought PUBG and i got to say so far its been a good decision. The Gameplay is a lot of fun (especially in groups of 2 or more players)You can play this in 2vs2*49 or 4vs4*24 you can even play with 3vs4*49 if you dont wont to fill up your teamwith a random player.The Game seems in a pretty far state already. Nevertheless there are some technical issues. My game crashes from time to time. (i7 6700k + 16GB RAM + R9 480x 8GB) But mostly i just start another game.Due to the popularity atm matchmaking is almost instant.Common issues atm are the mentioned crashes some player experience and performance issues. i get around 60fps average in 1440p.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You should add 'loud foot step marking' when enemy sprint or run /'gun fire marking' on map for low budget/disabled users who dont want to buy virtual surrounding head set(my hearing is poor since I have been working in factory environment). Keyboard and mouse should be enough to play. Add pinging for different servers.( I think 50ms is playable with my internet when i ping ' http //pubg.disquse.ru/en ' but the delay is horrible in game.

2017-05-29,0,0,21,True,Recommended,I am having so much fun with this game! At first it was very daunting to go online in a battle royale type game against 99 other people. I didn't know much but there is plenty to learn along the way. There is no tutorial its just you and your wits. After playing about 1 15 games I went from being #97 to #8. There is something so intense about going into a house and finding somebody else after you've heard their footsteps. Its you versus them and only one of you is going to live. If you survive you get to do it again in the same match. The graphics have gotten better since I have started. The sound is amazing. You get all the ambient sounds as well as the intensity of the footsteps in the grass or on the hardwood floors. The game runs smoother too. The matchmaking is pretty fast and there has not been any real lag in the games. I haven't really been into PC games that much lately but this game has brought me back.Now onto the loot system. It is extremely random but at least wherever you find a weapon you will find ammo for it. Some houses you go into you will find nothing but melee weapons and attachments. Right clicking on loot is the fastest way to add it to your inventory instead of dragging it. Dragging it will just waste precious time that you do not have. Run around until you find something because chances are that people who parachuted in your proximity know your approximate whereabouts and they are coming for you. The crate drops happen in random locations so whenever you see or hear a plane fly over that is where they come from. People will be trying to get those because sometimes you can get an awesome sniper rifle. One problem I have had with this game are memory leaks for my particular GPU. I have a 980 ti reference card. I get crashes that tell me that the game runs out of texture memory. From forums I have seen that others have had this problem.If this happens to you. just restart the game because that seems like the workaround until they acutally fix the issue.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,318,True,Recommended,Very good game has a ways to go though. Core gameplay is quite good right now but melee weapons have quite a delay when hitting something. Cars are......ok. The cars have the suspension of an iron rod small elevations in terrain are ridiculous even at medium speeds but other than that they are pretty good.The map takes a very long time to load at the start on very low for me but I have an FX 8350 and an rx 480.7/10 right now,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-13,0,0,556,True,Recommended,This game is the perfect mix of Arma/DayZ and something more casual. The gameplay is really clean and enjoyable and the rounds feel like they're the perfect length. The gunplay is near perfected and is the perfect balance of skill versus realism. I know for the Arma engine (which this uses) it's extremely hard to get it optimized but it does an amazing job and this is basically what I wanted DayZ to play like.Also they actually intend to get it out of Early Access in 6 months unlike many games that enter Early Access Purgatory. This game is incredibly playable for Early Access and even if they only made minor adjustments it'd still be worth buying in my opinion.IF YOU HAVE A BAD COMPUTER BE PREPARED TO RUN IT ON VERY LOW. Even with a good computer it's still a game that uses the ARMA engine so it won't be completely optimized yet.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-10,0,0,170,True,Not Recommended,Once the footstep and directional sounds works this game will be a 100% must have for all FPS KOH players I have no regrets buying this game in early accessbut for its current price and the frustration cause by the well known sound issues I cannot recommend this game. I do not mind latency I do not mind getting stuck in wall or in floors in early access games. I cannot however forgive not being able to hear other players open doors or their footsteps over my own footsteps or environment sounds (DayZ all over again). Will keep playing cause the game is very enjoyable but my advice for other people interested in this game is wait till the game is either on sale or reviews start saying sound has been patched....,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-29,0,0,160,True,Not Recommended,Played this game for over 60 hours now and I loved the first 50. I don't know what happened but the last 14 hours have sucked. Maybe an update nerfed the play but it feels like someone came up with a wall hack that is rampant. I am fairly proficient a fps games the BF series CS ARMA Division and such. In the first 50 hours of this game I could hold my own and even got a few chicken dinners however in the last 14 hours I have had a total of only 5 kills. I die in the first 50 from headshot out of know where... even when I see someone and get the jump I get headshotted. It is ridiculous something is fishy and wrong. I have 100s of hours in fps games and I can tell when the game play is unbalanced for whatever reason. So unless it gets fixed I won't be playing this game much more. I routinely play with about 8 other people most that are far better than I aand they feel the same way. It is 5/29/2017 and if the game reamins in its current early access state I can't recommend it. If it doesn't change well it is just a quick fad that the developers forget about and walk away with millions of dollars.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So I give it a thumbs up and remember it's only in alpha.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,143,True,Recommended,One of the best adrenaline fueled games I have played in a long time nothing I've played over the years gives me the same feeling but for an extended period of time. The gunplay mechanics are pretty realistic feeling. Every weapon and its type of ammunition serves a purpose. Theres a huge island to work with you have to parachute down faster than the other guys and running to find weapons before the other guy who just landed too is pretty scary. What I enjoy is you can play the game however you want however the blue circle makes EVERYONE have to change/adjust their plans .Dont worry if its early access this game has provided me with nonstop fun just in solo queue alone with friends the game just eats away hours of the day.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG is a great concept so much so that other people/devs have been constantly trying to rip off their gameplay. However the recent changes (aka no trading) have ruined the over game play and style of PUBG. PUBG is supposed to be a highly customizable game which includes the characters weapons and skins/clothing. It feels like bluehole has gotten away from this conecept with their last gameplay update.Bluehole should be focusing on improving game mechanics hitboxes and optimization. Instead of focusing on these issues Bluehole has decided to focus on earning as much money as possible in a cash grab monopoly on skins and customizeables. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD Bluehole focus on banning cheaters and updating the graphics/optimization. Who the cares if someone buys a skin from a thirdparty vendor....

2017-05-02,0,0,68,True,Not Recommended,UPDATE So after having this game for over a year and being part of the journey I am so disappointed where we ended up. The sheer greed of this game is beyond comprehension. Everything costs money every dirty nickel and diming trick is being used. I am done with PUBG they simply don't care for their fanbase or have any love for their product. See my original review below I am a new comer to the 'battle royale' genre and PUBG is the first one I've played in it. I did a bit of research and this seems to be the more recommended game even though its in early access. I haven't played games much in the last 12 months but this game has me back hooked playing for hours each night. Such a great concept undertaken very well by PU. So far this is my GOTY. There are some minor issues being that it is in early access but they are easily overlooked by the great gameplay. If this game continues to get updated refined and hopefully see graphical improvements (the game is not very good looking.. at all) This could hit the mainstream and be the 'next big thing'.

But there is a fundamental problem with it that pisses me off beyond reason and could seriously be a dealbreaker for me if it goes unaddressed for too long.Being able to crank down visual settings and all but remove details like shadows and foliage is not a ""competitive edge"" as some like to call it. It's basically developer condoned hacking. What an absolute load of that you have to choose between playing a game that looks good and takes genuine skill or one that you can actually win because it looks like and you can see where everyone's hiding.I've always preferred online gaming on PC over consoles but goddamn does this ever highlight a glaring problem with PC's customization.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-01,0,0,198,True,Recommended,Great game a lot of fun and variety everytime you load into a game. Expected bugs may occur from an early release. Biggest concern I personally have with this game is the cheating and hacking other players seem to use. Numerous times now I've gotten to the final 20 or 10 and just fall over from a shotgun headshot that sounds like a sniper shot from across the map. Even behind cover or in a building I have just fallen to a hacker. I'm not one who shoots for number 1 on the leader boards in games I enjoy playing this game every day the frustration comes when another player ruins any chance I have at successfully winning. Overall great game and would recommend it to any player looking for something new and refreshing just be warned that there are some hacks in this game that may turn other players off.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is a lot of fun and runs smoothly. There are no game breaking bugs or overly frustrating lag/freezing (no more than your normal online game). The Devs have delivered on everything promised and they continue to quickly respond to issues and release updates (unlike he who must not be named *cough/No Man's Sky/cough*).

They can heal w/o waiting 5 secs for medkit usage. They can even kill you through the walls. Okay they could in the previous version (till dec 17 I guess). PUBG Corp TM/R/other proud need a year for fixin geodata ignore. An incredible achievment for the most profitable p2p game of 2017. And the new anticheat system which they introduced recently lasted for about a week. And don't forget about brilliant optimization. The best review I read about this game is ""a right game from the wrong company"" and I so much agree with it. I've tried to keep with the game for 270 hours but I am done. Playing for 20 30 minutes and being killed in the end of the match by a cheater is so frustrating. And it happens every second/third match.

2017-04-07,0,0,1214,True,Recommended,The game is clearly alpha and there are many roads to cross before getting into the realms of a polished game however the gameplay is fun which gives you the opportunity to test your skills in a solo duo or 4 man group to see if you have what it takes to win a round. Screams og H1Z1 and Arma but I've played both and it doesn't have the polish of Arma3 but plays as well as H1Z1 in it's current state so can only get better. It's a filler not a main game. I can see our gropup messing around in it whilst playing other games more seriously. Either way it's a game which gives the fun factor I was looking for. Price wise it's an expensive alpha so look out for a really expensive released version or maybe BlueHole will have made the killing required to retire and drop the price for the masses.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-13,0,0,185,True,Recommended,My original review is below after they had wrecked the FOV for the game to a tiny window that made me motion sick (a common complaint which has since been fixed) and still had issues with rubberbanding allowing people to sprint into a room kill you while lagging then safely rubber band back out of the room. The server issues have mostly been fixed and those that have not are being worked on consistently. The patches are good and the new content/weapons have been a good addition all in all it's a solid game that's fun with friends. The 1 2 and 3/4 man queues are a great idea and work well. The gunplay is a little wonky and people eat bullets but its a cool game. OLD I enjoy this game and it's good fun to play but since the patch to prevent wider FOV's we're locked in at the horrid low FOV numbers consoles use unfortunately the low FOV numbers make me motion sick and they are preventing these from being edited with no plans to provide the option in 3pp. If you get motion sickness or feel queasy in low FOV or if you find it annoying I'd skip this one sadly. The game is pretty good though!Some issues with lag and rubberbanding but these seem to be improving with each patch. Sometimes bullets dont feel as if they are doing damage which is frustrating and the gunplay is a little dated but works. FOV killing me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They then came out of Early Access released a sub par second map failed to fix well known bugs failed to expand their servers to meet player growth continued to let cheaters run rampant and overall just ignored requests from the community. I mean it took them months to add the ability to choose your map. Now they are going all out to milk as much money out of their remaining player base via loot boxes and battle passes and it's become painfully clear that they don't care about the players or the future of their title.

I preordered the game with expectation of something good. Its a big satisfaction seeing how the game develops but here nothing changes for good. We have 2 maps (one incoming) Erangel (which was my fav) and Miramar this would be pleasant if they've added MAP SELECTION. If you are a gamer that likes beautifull graphics stay away. There is only one gamemode ACCESSABLE for normal players. If you think that i might be wrong let me explain. Yes there is a CUSTOM game but mostly organised by twitch or youtube members. You need password for them. So you can't play war/zombie mode easily. Optimization sucks also the movement. Physics are not in this game. This could be a very good game.

2017-04-04,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,"PUBG has the best charicter movement and combat feel. It takes the best from popular games like Arma h1z1 Dayz so the game feels intense and realistic like DayZ but without the clunky complicated controls and it also has a dash of fun while not being rediculously over the top like h1z1 KOK.Why the bad review?I want the developers to know that they created a game that mechanic wise had me wanting more. I guess I'm trying to say that the mechanics are too good for a BA only game! I sincearly hope they add servers to survive on where you can travel all over and respawn if you die.I issued a refund because I was frusterated that I could not explore the game. It doesnt feel like a cheap shoot em up BA game everything you find and explore has weight to it and feels valuble the charicter models are good and I wanted to take my time and invest in the game! It felt better than Dayz/Arma/h1z1 it feels fluid while still having that slow solid feel and intensity you get from Arma/Dayz.They did a great job and I think they made the best shooter survival game mechanic wise Im just dissapointed I cant appreciate it due to the BA only game mode you basically have to hit the ground runing chasing circles on the map and you're booted off the server if you die. No time to appreciate or experence anything!Make a normal mode Bluehole! This game desserves more than 12 year old doritto finger mayhem you call ""Battle Royal""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-15,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,So. I'm sat wanting to try this genre having an old H1Z1 from initial alpha (king of the kill unplayed) and this on the store.I downloaded both tried this then refunded. To be blunt as someone new to both games and not sucked up in the fanboi/resentment politics from my perspective H1Z1 is (understandably) in a far more polished state at the moment and the better game to play. But still ludicrously rough around the edges it should be added.There are legitimate arguments Gamebreak have semi abandoned H1Z1 or consider it 'done' and a cash cow. There are also legitimate arguments this is led by the guy responsible for the original concept and has far more potential. Currently though this is unrealised potential and needs to be proven. I'd imagine they're already in the common early access situation of deciding whether to cut and run with nominal updates or invest everything and gamble on future success.That said I refunded not because this is a very buggy feature minimal early access. I refunded as the main question to me is whether anyone can get stable good netcode on this scale. This seems absolutely crucial when a dodgy hit reg is made so meaningful by the design concept. SOE/Gamebreak have years of proprietary IP and experience in creating MMOs and still H1Z1 is more than slightly laggy. Battlegrounds is ridiculously laggy. I see the team as having ticked the trivial Unreal Engine boxes large generic open world decent character animations etc. but still falling down on the hard part making the game work in the current constraints of multiplayer tech UE or otherwise.I'm not convinced they'll pull this off. They might have a great (and from the off putting name of the game and promotion something of an egocentric) lead but they need leading edge netcode programmers and tech otherwise this early access &gt beta &gt product cycle will repeat that of so many open world survival games content additions acting as bandaids to a broken concept technology can't quite yet support properly. Or they need to dramatically rethink design under pragmatic constraints rather than conceptual ideals.I hope they'll nail it as the concept if you ignore or better still solve the problems brought about by these technical constraints is a great one. The main concern with this as an EA is not that there's lacking content the odd crash or balance tuning needed because that can be worked on. The main concern is that multiplayer tech is still really not ready to nail this type of experience properly and fixing that may well be beyond the skills of the team or lie beyond it in the actual hardware and network infrastructure.In short and on the basis the reader is choosing between the two H1Z1 despite the flak ignoring future visions and all else discarded seems the better game at the moment. This may well have more potential but taking both off the shelf at the moment as someone without a commitment or frustration with either this simply isn't quite there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-15,0,0,753,True,Recommended,There is a reason this game has done so well in the last few months. The developer cares about this game and getting it released and it shows. Tactile mechanics and fun play style make for a great game in PUBG,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-29,0,0,478,True,Recommended,My PC is of some middling level performance and aside from the starter lobby where all 100 players are faffing about the rest of the game runs rather smoothly.The gameplay itself feels intense and there's a learning curve that takes a few hours of play to get used to.It's challenging killing you off for poor positioning and lack of caution. You have to stay in cover and move with purpose building to building wall to wall placing your car near the entrance for a quick getaway. You run around aimlessly or park too far you get gunned down... BUT when you finally turn into the kind of person who can FIGHT BACK and has learned to play right you'll see people make those same mistakes you once did and you'll punish them for it.It's a game that rewards you for learning from your mistakes. And though the rewards system is a bit harsh on the cosmetic side the sense of victory you'll achieve when you make it far is phenomenal.I do have to gripe about the rewards system though. You'll earn points to earn reward packages and they're capable of BREAKING when you open them (how does this even happen?) and the disappointment you get when the points you rack up vanish and all you have is an empty crate might seem like a total let down... but it's all cosmetics and you'll sooner end up customizing yourself on the field anyway. Also the cost to buy a crate increases each time a let down but again it's just cosmetic.You get this game only if you enjoy that thrill ride as there is no sense of progression other than the cosmetics (it's early access it has room to breathe still). And if you have friends the experience could be endlessly enjoyable regardless. Win or lose you'll still earn points for lasting a while or even so much as HITTING someone so you always walk away with something.In summary it's an incredible experience so far. It has some real potential to really stand out on the Battle Royale scene. For now on the adrenaline rush alone I recommend it. But if you're impatient and refuse to get with the learning curve it isn't for you. But still if you're impatient AND have friends then squad up and give it a go cause when you have people to watch your back in a game like this you'll have tons of fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So much went into the development of this game such as loots spawns RNG bullet drop and lead weapon consistency and much more and they really did an awesome job with all the new updates. Way better than ARMA and H1Z1 in my opinion. HOWEVER one big issue I would like to bring to attention is the stun grenades. My game along with many others crash as soon as a stun grenade is thrown at me or even remotely close to where I am. It could be buildings away just the slightest of it and my game jsut crashes and it's very frustrating.

Loot is plentiful and you can gear up usually within a house or three (longest streak ive went with no gear besides melee is 12 housesand about 5 10 min of play time). Aiming down sights is like Arma (not a fan) Early Access Issues Constant Server lag with bouts of rubberbanding Major sound issues at times it cuts in and out completely which makes it impossible to tell where your getting shot at from or what side someone just passed you by. For some reason the game eats your CPU and wants more Graphics are extremly wonky for my AMD card (big black pixels and boxes every which way i look. Doesnt matter how i change settings can literally get you killed as it has done to me multiple times) I've also asked multiple people when in groups some have the issue the same or even worse. Parachuting is horrid when landing animation is buggy and freezes when landing for split second. Doors are a complete pain in the as some times if not all the time you have to double tap the ""F"" key to open and if you shut it while your in the doors radius it bugs out and teleports you back outside the door.

Weapons need balanced quick.I keep finding myself queueing right back in though so thats a positive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,215,True,Recommended,A breath of fresh air in a market flooded with battle royal style games. Aside from latency issues the game is quite fun. I have only a handful of complaints some of which include the interface and inventory system being a bit confusing for first time players. There is also a slight delay when entering and exiting the player inventory. It's as though the game unrenders textures in the enviroment when opening your inventory and reloads them when you exit. Not sure if everyone has that issue but I seem to despite running a 6GB 1060 and 16GB RAM at the time of writing this review. Also have a wierd distortion in the audio for loud noises during explosions when using a system with 7.1 surround and Tiamat Elite headphones. Nothing that truely breaks the game just minor quibs. Otherwise a great game and hours of good times with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Simple as that.And one more thing this game is NOT for pve champs and salty crybabies who blame everyone else but their skill.This is pure pvp action.So if you are into it go give it a try.If you are not PUBG is not for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-08-29,0,0,340,False,Not Recommended,You can only 'hope' for so long until it is just too little too late. That perfectly explains my feedback on this game. I played since EA and saw nothing but potential. Did it release with bugs and issues sure but what game doesn't nowadays? Was it a little bland with one map? Of course but it was EA so I didn't expect much more than that. Were there hackers and cheats taking place? You bet but nothing I haven't experienced in game during early release that eventually is dealt with at some point. But to have such issues after all this time is just disappointing. I wanted and expected more but in comparison to other games out this just doesn't cut it anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-03,0,0,353,True,Recommended,Ive Only played 30 hours of this game but honestly I would recommend to anybody to give it a try the only downfall is the lag at the beggining of the game but when 10 people die it fixes itself. Its realistic minimal bugs and I cant put this game down and often reciting in my head 1 more game and 4 hours later im still saying it.Overall its amazing and the people that are complaining about micro transactions are dumb because its for cosmetics not any advantages in the actual game so Its really your choice to buy it or not.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-08-29,0,0,28,False,Recommended,"Games like these are games that make me wish steam had a ""so so"" setting for reviews. As someone that's played every platform of PUBG I really love this game. There's nothing like it honestly. You can add attachments to weapons during the round which I've wanted in a game like this for what felt like forever and it has a certain degree of challenge and a learning curve that comes with it. Trying to find what attachments are the best with what guns. Also the maps are all pretty big and take a while to explore. While this game is really fun and is worth 30 dollars it is still pretty buggy for a full release and still isn't optimized like it should be. I understand that the maps are all huge and take a lot to handle them with the graphics but it seems like time after time especially on the new Sanhok map random fps drops happen that cost me a kill or the entire round of the game itself. Like a totally perfect loadout and about to get an awesome headshot but then the game freezes and the guy i shot at just lasers me. It really is a shame that this happens frequently but it seems like the devs are working hard to fix that. Anyways that was my 2 cents on PUBG I don't hate it nor do I want it 24/7 but it is a solid BR option.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,1629,False,Not Recommended,"So... obviously the game is good. I have 1100+ hours on PUBG. Very fun to play with friends. It has its share of glitches still and every now and then you encounter a hacker. The hacking situation has gotten wayyyy better than it used to be. However BlueHole/PUBG Corporation doesn't seem to care too much about its consumers. For starters... you have to pay to buy the game. You would think that should give you access to everything within the game... but you're wrong. Apparently paying for things up front is not enough anymore. Everything seems to have microtransactions. You earn credits by winning games only to obtain crates that require you to spend $2.50 to buy a key to unlock it. If you thought that was bad... that $2.50 you spent may not even get you an item that you want. The crates are like gambling. They have anything from super rare items to absolute ones that nobody wants. So... if I'm paying money to get an item... I should be getting the item I want. So they finally acknowledged that a little bit and said ""Hey you don't wanna gamble on our goods? Here's this!!!"" Now they offer crates where you know exactly what you're getting. Yay! WRONG! The new crates cost $10. Holy As of 1 A.M. this morning (6/22/2018) PUBG released their new map leveling system and of course... a season's pass. A season last one month in PUBG and a pass costs $10. What do you get from this pass? A CHANCE to earn you can buy in crates. The new leveling system is also based off this new season's pass. You get missions that once you complete you can only redeem if you are a season's pass holder. Stupid.Now. I have only myself to blame (and FortNite users) to show that people are willing to pay for this stupid because you bet your I am going to buy this season's pass. I play this game too much to not get the full benefit of it. I am super at how much money they are trying to milk from us. For these reasons I can not recommend this game even though I undoubtedly love it. If these things don't bother you. Buy the game.

2017-03-27,0,0,730,False,Recommended,Changing my review back to positive. They've done a great job blocking the hackers Bravo!This review is coming from someone with 750 hours in Arma IIIs version of this game and 330 hours of PUBG who ranked up to 140th place on the NA 3rd Person servers. I left this game with a 4 5% win ratio (that's good BTW).This game is infested with hackers.At least every other game you invest 30 40 minutes looting and prepping just to get mowed down by a hacker who's half a mile away with an 8x scope hitting you with every shot while you're zipping along at 130 KPH in a dune buggy. I loved playing this game but it's a total waste right now and they're doing nothing about it. Uninstalled it over a week ago and haven't looked back. I'll be back if they fix the hacker problem but that's it unless something major changes. Sad. First some Background BR on Arma III I love BR on Arma III I probably have around 700 hours on it.I like the varied terrain I like the looting and how you have to put together a good kit to win the gameI like the tactical aspects of picking a good route to the circle.I like the fact that there are some very good players in the game it's very challengingI don't like the close combat shot registrationI don't like the close combat movement mechanics as they feel a bit clumsy.I don't like the long waits to start a game.I don't like that this game has a small following due to it's complexity It's a key binding nightmare for a first time user.H1Z1 I hated H1Z1 and refunded it. I maybe played 40 minutes of H1Z1 and couldn't handle the shot registration (the first 5 minutes into the game I hit a guy with a shotgun who was at least a quarter mile away he looked like two pixels and there was no way I could hit him with a shotgun except in the world of H1Z1)I don't like how the map is built on an obvious grid the smashing a car into a rock with no damage the jumping out of a car at 50 MPH and jumping around like an idiot to shoot in the general direction of one's enemy hoping you get the random shot.Couldn't understand why people liked that game. On to Battlegrounds I really like this game. It's very polished for Early AccessThe shot registration seems to be really goodClose quarter combat is more like CS GO than Arma IIIThe map is beautiful lots of detail and obviously different areas with different building typesThis is more of a shooter than Arma III BR as the tactical aspect isn't there you don't have to plan and decide as much you just find the biggest gun and equip a scope and hope you see them before they see you.If you die you can start a stopwatch and before the watch hits two minutes you are back under your canopy flying towards the ground.It'd be nice if there were more crevices and varied terrain to hide in but no biggie.I'm running i5 8GB RAM all SSD drives980Ti &lt The version I have is on the higher end of the performance spectrum of the 980Ti'sI have literally no issues running this game don't know how many FPS I'm getting but it's smooth and there are no issues.Seeing how my system is on the lower end with the exception of the video card it's possible that anything below 980Ti might give you issues until the game is optimized.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The loot drop which changes quite often still seems unbalanced. The guns although they've started working on them still feel unbalanced.The game is fun... when you're lucky. Nowadays 80% of the games are incredibly frustrating.

2017-12-04,0,0,394,True,Not Recommended,This game has so much potential!I like the battle royale gamemode since every match feels different from the others. The fact that a random factor such as the safe zone's position is in the game is at the same time good and bad. RNG can destroy competitivity but it also adds some spice to the gameplay.The gameplay feels very rewarding when approaching the game by learning the map guns accessories and whatever there is to learn.It is less rewarding when optimization problems and connectivity issues pop up but the development roadmap and the fact that it still is in Early Access actually lets you close an eye on this.I would like the developers to improve EU servers since there is a notable difference between them and the US servers.EDIT This game is out of early access but is getting worse and worse. Every patch makes it a little bit less playable and makes the performance worse. Right now you will die or get damage behind cover so often that you will realize that the only way to go at it is to just get good at aiming and pretty much crouchshooting everybody you see without even making use of the cover available. The new recoil making you shoot at the sky after just a few bullets isn't really helping the already missing flexibility of the gameplay no crouching or no accessories mean you better stop using ARs. The actual meta lies in getting airdrops and sniper rifles to just one shot headshot everybody since Level 3 Helmets have become impossible to find outside of airdrops.I keep getting stuck with my parachute I keep having FPS problems even though I have good specs and I keep dying to unexplainable shots.I reached the Top 1000 many times but I feel like right now I need to learn to play at a whole new game and honestly you can bite me Blueballs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-31,0,0,127,False,Not Recommended,Its so sad to see a game being ruined by its own community this game is a heavy game hard to run but then the idiotic kids with a PC without a graphics card start crying saying the game is badly optimized then they removed 1st person in the plane weapons at the lobby weather and other features which made this game unique and fun. Furthermore the Devs arent helping it used to be fun to play this game win loose and get battlepoints where you could open crates and get cool cosmetic items. But then they had to ruin it all by adding different types of crates which require keys to open that is one of the most annoying features this game currently has most recently weapons skins have been added to the game if they had added proper skins such as tan woodland ETC... and made it so you can get it without having to spend your money on them it would be OK. But no they decided to make some nerf looking skins (not all of them). to summ it up Dont buy this game if your PC cant run it properly and have patience with the stupid decisions made by the Devs. hopefully some of the removed features will be added to this game once again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs have added new guns fug fixes and etc. and in the near future there is a lot more that will be going into this game and i cant wait.

2018-03-31,0,0,265,False,Recommended,PUBG took me a while too get into mainly because ive never played any game like it and the more realistic styled mechanics are something i really wasnt used the only other high skilled shooters ive played are Gears of war and CSGO both of which are nothing like PUBG. However after playing it on and off for about 30 hours i started to get better with the shooting mechanics and my tactical decisions. Although PUBG takes alot of skill it also has a lot of luck to it in terms of the equipment you find and what the circles force you to do. This makes pretty much every match different so it gives it good replay ability. Going forward id like to see better optimisation for the game as sometimes i get massive frame drops which leads to me getting killed in some fights and also the game crashes a bit. In terms of content id like to see more weapons added to pick up (not in supply crates) especially some older guns and some more LMGs.Pros Good shooting mechanics that are a lot more realistic then the majority of shooters out there A Lot of weapons Overall fun and tense gameplayCons The reliance on luck to win can be annoying especially when you get bad circles at the end A Lot of weapons get added to supply drops which you hardly ever get Doesn't have a mode where you can practice Vehicles are glitchy,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I come back to check out new patches every once in a while but half the time i play I end up dying to someone who I can't see or hear. The sound design is jarring. I can hear a teammates footsteps nearly 20 feet away but someone is sitting on top of me and I have no sound of them whatsoever. I bought this game in early access expecting fixes and changes over time. But Im more dissapointed now than I ever have been before. If you're thinking about buying this game save the money and play fortnite FOR FREE. It's really sad that they offer a better game for 0 cost. I was hopeful for PUBG. Not anymore.

Large variety that are all impactful in different scenarios.Game Tempo A great mix between downtime/intense ramp up and blood boiling firefights. Sound Great sound design! Learn to pay attention to receiving and making sound from footsteps gunfire vehicles etc.Tactics/Strategy Decision Making at every turn. Hint Its different every time!Co op Unrivaled team play! Team up with a friend or 3 for some good times.CONSEarly Access Expect lower FPS server lag random bugs.Pistols Near useless except for the first minute of the game.Cheaters Not game breaking since the games are relatively short (5 20 mins). But they're there.Luck of the Draw This isn't CS GO. You can go into it with a pro mindset only making the most logical decisions and still die to random scenarios like a vehicle clipping through a rock to kill you.There's much more to this game than initially meets the eye. It almost feels like a roguelike in that you learn something new almost every playthrough. 400+ hours in and having reached top 50 in solos and duos but I still have a lot to learn.TLDR You can wait for the full release to try and avoid dealing with early access issues but you'll surely encounter them anyway after a major patch. Its the nature of an online game. Just pick it up and enjoy it with your friends while the hype is there you wont regret it!If you've read this entire review good on you! Heres a little secret the game's 3D sound is wonky. Even if you have it through a sound card or a nice headset w/ software just turn it to stereo. It'll work wonders for you.

It takes countless minutes to even launch the game if you get past the countless times it says ""Servers are too busy at the moment"". Which brings me to the big selling point of PBUG the bugs. The bugs make and literally break the game. Though it is funny to have your buggy crash randomly and spin 7 times in the air the bugs also make you lose countless games which you wouldve lost anyway to hackers.

2017-10-15,0,0,169,False,Not Recommended,Overall an okay game 3/5 stars(My Opinion)I think the game is alright. I haven't played in a little while but from when I used to play a lot there were a pretty large base of asian hackers/cheaters (On NA Servers) To me the game doesn't feel very consistent especially shotguns you can end up shooting people in the chest but your bullets just disappear or don't get registered (not just shottys) The game also has really long matches so it's really devastating when you die to BS after you just searched around and looted for 22 minutes. I would recommend this game only to some people I would say buy it and try it out and jus see if you like it and just return it if you don't also miramar is a bad map in my opinion so at the time of this review 6/29/18 there is only two maps. TL DRGame is okay for some people try it and return it not many good maps in consistent damage hits large base of cheaters long matches and dying after looting for 15+ minutes,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-06,0,0,630,False,Recommended,This game is fantastic and could very well qualify for a game of the year only reason it is Negative or Mixed is mainly due to cheaters microtransactions are fine all cosmetics. The new event pass gives players incentives to play different and weird playstyles. The maps are phenomenal and they are currently working on a snow map. PUBG listens to their playerbase and do their best against cheaters no one gives them credit for banning a lot of hackers. Hackers only roam freely due to the sheer amount of them. Gunplay and mechanics are very well done and polished compared to the early accessMost of the negative reviews are complaining about microtransactions/cases when the solution is quite simple JUST DONT BUY THEM they offer no advantage and you dont need to look cool the only thing worth buying in this game is the event pass with cool challenges that are very fun to do with your friends,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-01,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,Abhorrent. Probably the best word to describe this game. Don't fall into the hype or be pressured by friends to buy this game. Simply put it's awful. Terrible controls terrible gunplay poorly optimised buggy as hell. The loot system is horrible too yes the whole point in it being Battle Royale is the randomised loot and the uncertainty of doing well but far too many games have awful drops leading to me fighting with a pistol against those that are fully equipped. The mid game is awful everything happens within the first/last 5 minutes of gameplay. It all depends on when you depart the plane. There are plenty of connection issues at least in my experience. The hitreg seems off too plenty of shots I've taken never seem to hit the target it could take an entire mag to kill an enemy even if you have decent aim. Time To Kill seems off as well as stated before you can unload an entire mag into someone and not kill them OR you can 2 shot someone which to me is inconsistent leading to an awful experience playing the game.TL DR don't waste your money on this game and purchase something else.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have seen constant updates with game connectivity issues and overall FPS performance. We have seen multiple new guns as well as new footage of up and coming character jump and abilities. The downsides to PubG at this time is definitely the slight learning curve some players run into. One example that comes to mind is switching from 3rd person to 1st person and when to use it to your advantage in a fight. Other is team work unless you're in Solo this is a communication game.Overall this game is everything I would want to see from an ""Early Access"" game.

2017-07-02,0,0,658,True,Recommended,The game is overall a great survival/battleroyale. I've spent alot time working on tactics how to survive in this game the longest and the best one is stealth and trigger dicipline. You can basically win this game playing snake mode and only kill if nesescary. After some time I started testing different weapons and how they work on different situations and seems to be that shotguns are the most powerfull at very close range smgs are great at surprise attacks close range. Assault rifles are pretty equal long range and sniper rifles well.. they're sniper rifles so pretty damn op long range. The only major issues with this game are hitboxes and hit registering. I know early access game but the developers have had alot time to fix stuff so don't care about early access t. Some times you come to situation when you enter 1v1 with an enemy manage to shoot him first around 10 rounds with 5 6 hits that should already down/kill the enemy but surprise surprise mothafuk* he fires 3 rounds and you're dead and he leaves the situation like nothing ever happened. That's the only ttery you have to deal with this game rest of it is pretty neat and worthy of a purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-22,0,0,78,True,Recommended,Bought game jumped in played a few games got decent at game it's a simple concept fun with groups.Pros Game is geniunely fun in the beginner and intermediate stages.Squad up with friends! Have a blast. Squad up with strangers if you want. (not recommended)Decent selection of Assualt rifles and add ons if you are lucky enough to find them.Shotguns are good in this game just like real life.If you get blasted as soon as you land you can join another game right away. (salt removal factor)Decent amount of cars on the map so that if you're hard up for a vehicle because of the area closing in there is usually some salvation.I like that there are consequences to firing randomly firing at others driving a car around.I like that your play style can be utilized however you see fit. (30/100people becomes camp central.) &lt that's fair.Cons This game has plenty of bugs I or some of my friends have experienced that have ruined multiple games.Car physics are absolute trash. Ex Hit a small rock car will flip as if cars on this ambigueously slavic/russian/croatian island don't come installed with shocks.No selection of guns except Shotguns and Assult rifles everything else will pretty much get you killed unless you are literally within skin rubbing distance.Not fun when you get sniped by a submachine gun from 800 yards away on a bridge far far away from anyone. Aimbotters will ruin this game unless something can be done.Latency isn't terrible but it can be gamebreaking at times.Community is something to be desired you will be shot by teammates if you have gear they want and decide you don't need it anymore.Every other problem I have can be chalked up to alpha. (excuses I know) This game needs some polish for sure but it aint asking for 60$ either.Giving this a Yes for now. It's Alpha I feel it's worth your time especially if you have ever played a battle royal game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If I land at Kameshki and the zone is placed over Military Base my only option is to pray a vehicle is spawned in the compound leave immediately with no loot and hope I find a vehicle along the way or just leave the game because there isn't any chance I'll even come close to making it to the zone.

2018-09-05,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I didnt get to play the game as I wanted the lack of triple monitor (Nvidia Surround) and the fact that your progress from PUBG Mobile could be transfered to the PC was a complte let down (something I wasn't aware). While the game itself show a wide area almost 180 degrees view the inteface itself is another story. The menu inteface was there but all I could see from my character was his mid section all crotch and there was no way to fix that but to change the resolution to use one monitor. After I switched and managed to customize my character I started a round I was very disappointed by the washed out look of the graphics even settings on ultra and two 1080 ti in SLI mode. Its really sad since I was looking foward to play on PC since playing on my S9+ put a lot of strain on my eyes after a few rounds. I guess im going to stick with Fornite and maybe get a tablet and play PUBG mobile on it from now on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-10,0,0,84,True,Recommended,"In all realness the idea and foundation of this game is absolutely amazing and ik it's dumb as to say region lock any game but this game needs it people join Us servers from other countries to explot the ping Also there truly are a ridiculousy high number of hackers in game Now this isn't just speculation this is fact. there are people who exploit the ping and also people who just legit hack Invis hack 1 shot pistol kill hacks And some people going so far as to use the Ethernet cable D/C trick that many other FPS shooters on PC fail to recognize and it's one of the reasons games like this in particular tend to die out in due time In account of everything said I'd recommend this game for somone who doesn't just legitimently mind dying to absolutely nothing at times or being killed by hackers who cannot kill people without doing so. It's kind of sad my impressions on this game when i first started playing were astounding and sound. It's always been genuinely fun to play. Even at the note that there could or just WILL be the enevidability of a hacker taking their course on the innocent bystandards that genuinely enjoy Shooter genre games. And legit teamwork. This game souly revolves around team work and communication and twitch reflexes even. And it's why i think so many people are encouraged to find any explot or just straight up turn to aim bot or hacks. Because they cannot keep up. This i do not blame you for I blame souly the individuals who bought the game legitly just to hack and troll people and lets be fair 99% of hackers hack to troll. I hate saying hacking this hacking that but i've played the game long enough to know the chance of running into one is quite high i've seen everything from speed hacks with falling from the plane to people actually unplugging their internet cable punching people in the starting countdown then reconnecting the ethernet cable and getting the kills to people just ultimately using aim bot or damage hacks for instance having a lvl 3 helmet should ensure your safety from and projectile to the face. Meaning even the highest of dmg weapons cannot 1shot you. And i see people get one shot by a 9mm pistol. So this is definately a problem. I souly think it comes down to wheather you can stomach being hacked against cause you're better than them. Lol Anyways this is my review. i hope i didn't steer too many people away but this seriously needs to be fixed. It's quite sad to see such an amazing concept get wasted by people who cannot enjoy a good made game this is the first game i've ever played and continued playing without the abcense of hackers.

In this one they actually come out of the barrel of your gun. this is optimal to reduce headpeaking but it causes such clunky encounters when you fight from inside a building. even if you are ads in first person the game just feels really bad up close. even when ads from behind cover your bullets hit your cover more often then what youre aiming at.

2017-05-24,0,0,308,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I want to start out by saying that this game is extremely fun and addicting when you have a full group of friends to play with. I personally love this game hands down the best free game I have ever gotten. I however cannot reccomend this game at the 30 dollar price tag right now. Even though I have put almost 100 hours into it there just is not enough content there to justify the price. There is one map and one game type with three different modes ( Solo Duo and Squad. Death match is the only game type.) and one map. There's also the usual Early Access ( or paid beta if you want to be honest about it) issues. Most noticable would be the issues with player to player interaction lag that can sometimes lead to you being killed after you have hit cover and the game straight up freezing for a few seconds when you try to loot items. Also driving is absolutely horrendous you hit one tiny bump in a field and all of a sudden your vehicle is in the air flipping around only to briefly land on the roof causing you to take a fair amount of damage and then keep rolling over onto the wheels again. The circle is another very frustrating issue with the damage it does and the speed it moves but that will most likely be tweaked very soon so I won't complain about it here. All in All though if the price drops or a significant amount of content gets added I would definitely start telling more friends to buy this game there is a ton of fun to be had even if you don't get that chicken dinner and there is a lot of potential here. If you don't mind dropping 30 bucks on an unfinished product you will enjoy the absolute hell out of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Looting You expect to press the F key once to pick up an item but when I have to press it seven times to pick something up it gets annoying.

I would like to start out saying that I was very skeptical of this game and while I haven't spent a whole lot of time in it it is enough to say that it does get your adrenaline pumping. There is a different kind of feel to a game where you know you only have one life and a large map. Sometimes you can hear your enemy. Sometimes if you're lucky you can see them. Most of the time you've already been sized up by your opponent and they're only moving in because they're certain it'll be a clean kill. This game totally gets into your head.

2017-04-26,0,0,55,True,Recommended,"Set in what I consider to be a rural suburban hills setting with a post apocalyptic ""where the heck is everyone?"" feel Player Unknown's Battle Grounds is worth the early access purchase! Although the game is in its early stages and with it comes the occasional unpolished gameplay the game comes into its own when it presents as a ""Last Man Standing"" 3rd Person Shooter with a sort of military style ""Hunger Games"" flair. Picture being 15 minutes into a game your crouched behind a wall of an abandoned building peering in through the window waiting for player number 23 of what seemded like 200 to step outside and face your uzi which you stole off the last player in a mexican stand off with a crowbar and a gas mask all whilst you avoided being run over by another player in a tandem motorcycle. And just as they burst out the door the game engine reduces the map size so you quickly fire off a couple of rounds at them while you sprint in the other direction towards the safe zone to avoid the impending death that awaits you on the other side of the forcefield that is closing in on you...If camping is your style of FPS game strategy then this game isn't for you but if you love the idea of a game that forces you to constantly look over your shoulder for another enemy player and to actively search every room of every building you come across to find guns ammo clothing and an energy drink then this game is for you.I give this game an 8 out of 10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-02,0,0,87,True,Recommended,Really fun game. Though my computer has been having problems when I play this game especially at the beginning of the game. I can barely move due to lag and the buildings look like they are made of playdough. After a minute or two everything finally loads in and I can play (but of course that's not due to the game it has to do with some computer problems. Though it also doesn't help that the game is quite fully optimized). I fight through the lag though because it's a really great game keep in mind it's still early development so bugs and glitches are prone to happen but even with that it's addicting to play. In my opinion it's much better than H1Z1 as they are very very similar games. Pretty much exactly the same since the creator of this game made the original Arma mod then licensed the idea to H1Z1. So this game is by the original creator. Super fun absolutely love the gameplay. Gun customization wide range of weapons large map unique gameplay and even with there being only one map the game always ends differently.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-31,0,0,21,True,Recommended,"Coming from an Co op Arma Wasteland Breaking Point Dayz background I can definitely recommend this game and I believe it solves many of the ""issues"" I've had with previous survival/battle royale games. Namely in the sense of frustration and time investment to character and ultimately death.The game is setup in matches of 100 players you have the option to go solo duo or a squad of up to 3 other friends (sometimes you're placed in a squad of 3 other times 4). Each match lasts on average 10 30 minutes depending on how long you survive. Each match starts with the entire map unlocked and concurrent circular rings that start to shrink at different times forcing players closer and closer together till there is a last player/squad standing. There is an interesting gear/customization mechanic where you earn in game currency each match depending on your performance that allows to you unlock loot crates which definitely gives you something to strive for. The loot crates allow you to spawn with additional items of clothing that from what I can tell are mainly cosmetic. The gun play itself for the game is fun and doesn't seem at all arcady but I believe has a low enough barrier to entry that it's not overwhelming as say Arma is to some folks.If you've got a few friends that enjoy the other battle royale type of shooters you will certainly get some enjoyment from this. It is very plug and play intuitive and all in all a grand time especially if you like playing in some bouts before moving on to something else and coming back.I do have a few cons to the game that aren't necessarily game breaking but things that I hope will be fixed or a different direction is considered from the developers. Several of these or Early Early Access woes that I have no doubt will be changed while others are more game design direction. Graphics/Sound Optimization Could be better but the game JUST came out. This is usually something that's fixed very quickly and I've already seen work being done so not too concerned. Minor bugs Buildings not loading in right away graphical bugs two different super imposed reticles etc. Again Early Alpha woes. Content/Consumption of Content In the current state of release the game is lots of fun. But I can see this getting bland relatively quickly. I hope more content/different maps/more guns/just more stuff is in the pipe. OR the consumption of said content decreased some. In the current state you don't have long before the first circle of starts closing in on the map. I'd like to see the early match extended a little by another 5 minutes or so. Some of my favorite playtime so far has been the initial scramble of weapons and positions. I hope we could get more time to get able to explore more of the map. Hit Registry/Player bullet sponges Although there isn't a hit marker in the game (nor do I wish for there to be one) there might as well be. When you hit a player a gigantic dense bright cloud of red puffs up around them. In my opinion it just seems a little jarring and kind of out of place maybe I'm the only one. But more importantly it's the amount of rounds it takes to bring someone down without the glorified headshot even if they are ""naked"". I think the overall bullets to knockout needs to be decreased by 1 or 2 rounds across the board. Current ""naked"" vitality makes sense when you've picked up the level 2/3 body armor but people running around with a t shirt or underwear shouldn't take 3 4 rounds of 5.56 to the chest/arms whilst still sprinting at full speed before going down. State of Weapons and choice Although there is a small plethora of weapons in the game whether it is a mixture of play style preference time to knockout or balance by the end of the match (20 30 people alive) just about every player is running around with either an M16 or an AKM with a 4x/8x scope. Even in the beginning of the game some weapons because of their time to kill barely seem viable. Then because the beginning of the game (first 10 minutes) moves by so quickly you don't really get a chance to utilize the ""lesser"" guns anyway.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can run this game on a potato and get the same frames as on a multiple thousand dollar PC which is weird but whatever works. I have been playing nonstop with friends and alone and have had unlimited fun. Do not compare this game to H1Z1 it is nothing alike it is much more realistic. There is not those people who drive around hop out going 90 miles an hour and kill you like in H1Z1. This game is more like a hybrid of Arma 2 and 3 and DayZ.

2017-03-30,0,0,344,True,Recommended,While the game definitely needs some optimization (Coming in just a few weeks per the developers) it is an absolute RIOT. I haven't had this much fun with a shooter in a long time. IMO this game takes everything H1Z1 KOTK does to the next level.Pros+Gunplay is awesome. ADS is a real thing.. Your hits are registered clientside and the registration feels really good.+Intensity is great. You can't beat the adrenaline when you're surrounded or when that circle is closing in on you fast.+Feel. The slightly more tactical feel/pace of this game is just so superior to KOTK imo. It just feels right. +Guns... All of them feel like they have a place and can get kills. Theres many different guns too.. unlike KOTK where you have 2 AR's 1 Hunting Rifle and a Shotgun. Off the top of my head there are 4 AR's 4 Sniper Rifles 3 Shotguns and several pistols. They all are good in their own areas.+Gun Mods... Gun mods offer a bit of customization in the game. You'll find different sights (red dot holographic 4x acog 8x scope 15x scope) and other things such as Extended Mags Stocks Compensators and even Silencers. And let me tell you... unless you are really close to someone with a silencer you won't have a damn clue where you're getting shot from. They work FANTASTIC and add another aspect to the game that causes you to play even more tactical.+Leaderboards... They exist.... and they work really well!+Crates... Completely bought by in game currency that at this time cannot be purchased (at least not that i've found). Items are purely cosmetic. You do not need to buy a key to open the crates.+Map... I like the map! It has all kinds of diversity when it comes to different areas to play in. Obviously you're constrained a bit to where the circles end up but learning the spots that you like fighting in best makes the begging jump that much better.+Jumping From Plane... Skydiver simulator 2017 is well done. You have good control over your parachute and you get to decide when you jump.+Devs... Devs are actively patching all the time. They have been very responsive and have outlined future patch plans. Optimization is their biggest focus right now.Cons Like I said the game needs to be better optimized. That being said I get 70 110 FPS on low unless im in a very large city (then I usually see around 30). It's definitely playable but the game looks gorgeous on the higher graphics settings. It would be awesome to play on those settings and get good performance. Optimization is coming a couple weeks into April so I'm excited for that. Server Lag/Desync. It happens. Fairly often. That being said its usually at the very beginning of a game (and not every game. I'd say probably half). After a chunk of people have died its usually pretty smooth for the rest of the game. They have been making updates to this on a very regular basis and I am confident they will get it resolved. It does ruin a game every once in a while but for the most part the fun of this game far outweighs this issue.If you have a decent computer and can handle running the game on the lowest settings right now get the game. Its a BLAST. If that doesn't sound like you wait until mid april until they have some of the big FPS optimizations in and then pick it up. WARNING.... this games super addicting. Forcing myself to go to bed at night has become a tough task. Thats the sign of a great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-30,0,0,137,True,Recommended,(i copied my arguement from the forums where they tried to compare pubg to h1 and i feel i expressed my opinion enough)after playing 20+ hours this passed weekend i tried playing h1 while the servers were down for a bit a few days ago my first game i died and just exited because i had absolutely 0 fun its just not as good as pubg AT ALL imho. one of the huge throwoffs is the nearly 3rd person only gameplay. spawning in pubg you can choose where you land (you can yourself whereas h1 will you without you being able to choose where to go). this so far is a selling point for me but ill keep going. you dont have car parts that you have to stop and steal every car you see. while im on the car topic you cannot just jump out of your car while going 50mph just to shoot somebody in the head with a shotgun like an idiot. you actually have to stop the car to be able to get out to shoot somebody... one last and probably the biggest WEAPON ATTATCHMENTS in pubg you can pickup and put attatchments on your gun which is another huge selling point compared to h1 where you have to look at a tiny head thats 70m away and take shots hoping to land them. the amount of pros outweigh the cons even for an early access game it feels more developed than h1 the biggest throwoff is performance but if you have a decent computer you should be fine with some tweaks and that problem will be fixed soon. sorry for the wall of text but i like to compare. oh and if you want to call pubg a clone of h1 then h1 is a clone of arma br mod but they are all based off the same thing.(sorry for any spelling errors i didnt care to reread and correct them),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-30,0,0,287,True,Recommended,I have only played H1Z1 for maybe 15 hours but I must say I do think I like this one a little better. H1 has its perks but this just has the groundwork to be better overall. Pros 1. If you enjoy sniping and camping you should enjoy this game2. Less cartoonish than H1Z1 3. Fairly realistic gunfire 4. You can still get that adrenline rush5. you can heal peopleCons 1. No crafting2. A little slower on the action side3. Lots of campers 4. Vehicles a little iffy and very easy to hurt yourself in them and with them.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-21,0,0,628,False,Recommended,"EDIT (9 7 18) I am leaving what I had reviewed a few months ago from this date. Most of my complaints for the game have changed. Issues I found are being fixed or have been fixed. I feel very encouraged for the direction Blue Hole has taken to get this game where it needs to be and where it should have been. The game right now finally feels like a full release compared to Nov 2017. I will leave my old review up for people to see what I was complaining about. Some of that stuff still seems to be an issue. Like desync their loot system and their vehicle physics. But it feels like they are going to get past those issues with future patches. OLD REVIEW I have been playing since long before the ""full release"". And I am sick of no progress towards becoming a complete game. They have focused on loots crates more than their optimization. I have an RX580 8gb and a Ryzen 5 1600 with 16gb of RAM and I need to play this with setting very low to get a good FPS. Look I really love to play this game but it is discouraging that I haven't seen real performance progression.To the people that are considering to purchase this game I write this for you PROS Addictive gun play Survival Strategy Nice variety of weapons The maps make it great for strategy and competionCONS Hackers/Exploiters/Cheaters Not Optimized Desync during gun fights The maps are not made well. You can be driving along and collide with terrain that shouldn't have cause collision Pay $30 for the game and then receive a random loot crate that can be free to open or spend an extra $2.50 to open a lock chest you might not have wanted. Get a patch that is one step forward and then takes two steps backwardsOne part of me says to ""Buy this game"" if you can put up with bullcrap for as long as I have. But the sensible part says please don't buy this game until Bluehole actually uses their money to improve their issues with gameplay and optimization.

2017-11-01,0,0,435,True,Not Recommended,This game is popular becuase it has no real competition H1Z1 is even worse just want to say in my opinion. Think about if you heard about a game that was in early access that had one map that wasn't even finished and had errors on it like jagged edges in random spots and fields. The game had problems with hit detection and at the start of the game was so laggy to the point when you open a door it takes 3 seconds to open after you hit F. When you shoot someone some times takes seconds after you shot them for them to go down. Also have the game crash sometimes and for the lobby system to get messed up and to make it better to be honest seems like with every update it gets worse. Then they say in December we will be leaving early access. They also need to add optimizations to the game and fix the hacker problem. So all this needs to be fixed before December. They also say we will be working on the game after early access which I do think is true but to say a game is 1.0 and out of early access means you feel that game is good to ship today to a store and be 100% ready to play. Like the old days when you bought a game and it was done no updates the game was just the way it is. Even if all the things I said were fixed and they added vaulting and a new map is 2 maps one game mode and 21 main weapons (as of 9/14/17) a full game? Then if yes get the game. (By the way I play this game because I have not seen anything out there that grabs my attention fortnite is fun but not really into the art style.This is the only choice so I play this),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-18,0,0,80,False,Recommended,Love that it combines the Battle Royal type survival scenario with FPS MMO and co op. The landscapes are beautiful and fun to explore. Within a single game multiple different mini games unfold. Many player choose to drop into hot zones and battle it out immediately. Others opt to land in the fringe and slowly make their way through the game to the end game. It can be frustrating for a newbie to pick up the skills to survive in gunfights against seasoned vets but the sneaking aspects of the game allow for even the newest of players to get some kills. I recommend watching some Youtube and Twich content to pick up useful tactics and strategies.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-01,0,0,104,True,Recommended,This game is truly the more immersive joyful and alive version of H1Z1. It is an early access game so expect some lag glitches and running into players who themselves have no idea what they're doing. Once you enter a lobby you wait for about a minute to enter the battlefield then it cuts to a birdseye view of a large plane carrying everybody participating in the match. You fly over the map until you decide to free fall out of the plane (with a parachute duhh). Unfortunately until you decide to drop out of the plane you can still hear everyone talking so this leads to somewhat of a toxic moment created by toxic players in the match but thankfully it doesn't last long. Once you drop your objective is to rush into houses and any nearby buildings to acquire guns ammunition body armor clothes and medicine. Much like H1Z1 you are given a time limit until the playable areas in the map start to shrink by a force field rather than toxic gas. If you don't acquire essentials quickly in a populated area chances are you're dead as someone probably looted close to you and hit the jackpot in comparison. Dropping in an unpopulated area has it's advantages as you can loot more of an area that may be smaller in comparison yet take a gamble on what items and essentials may or may not be located in that particular area. Overall I highly recommend this game if you are big into survival hunger game esque games that require focus get your heart racing in intense fire fights and have a stong desire to be the last man or woman standing. Also if you don't easily get off when you die in 30 seconds from someone in the building next to you who picked up an AK47 and slaughters you and your teammate with it you'll love this game ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You start as a ""naked"" character (no guns/melee weapons only cosmetic clothes on no armor) and you need to find your gear and weapons with ammo for it and a lot of gadgets for each type of weapon (scopes mags red dots you name it). No PvE type of encounters are present which is another great thing.The game is pretty fast (it lasts for about 40 mins tops in case you'll make it to top5) and with no need to craft anything it keeps you focused on your whereabouts and the gameplay itself. You don't hover over countless menus you don't spend time with meaningless micromanagement (like feeding yourself and looking for some warm clothes) you just play fast paced engaging battle royale match and go for another one.

Do not pay any attention to its minimal requirements just keep upgrading everything till you can get near a decent framerate one day it'll probably have accurate requirements but right now its a guessing game. The game itself is unforgiving and terrifying at first then later its unforgiving and terrifying. Team games can range from infuriating as two of your friends die immidiatly to downright hilarious as you spring your slow rolling jeep bridge roadblock and watch a confused car full of 4 enemies hit a jeep and flip into the air emptying clips into where you think their heads might be then desperatrly running from the barrier you forgot was coming as you were too busy laughing at the one guy who flew off the bridge and somewhere into the water 50 feet away.

2017-08-16,0,0,467,False,Not Recommended,Alright time for a revision to my previous review. With more hours under my belt and plenty more matches played I can give a more accurate take on my opinion of the game. Overall it is a fun game to play when you want to feel pressure and stress or have fun if you play with friends. The gunplay can be good except recently I find that some guns seem unreliable in the departments of damage accuracy and actually being counted when you hit your target. When you play on the new map make sure to pick up the QBZ as soon as you find it it boosts your chances of winning tenfold. Miramar is still the worst map. Server ticks seem better than before with a few hiccups here and there. This season pass they've added is a huge attempt at cash grabbing don't buy it if you have even the slightest amount of common sense. There was a fit involving their anti cheat where innocent people got perma banned myself included. I was well compensated with in game currency. The crates that have the best loot are still locked away behind a pay wall which is another attempt at cash grabbing. The 7.62 revolver oddly still requires three to four body shots to drop an unarmoured opponent even when the first shot deals nearly half health with the follow up dealing half that amount of damage. This was tested among some friends of mine recently so I do have some evidence to back the claim. All together the game still needs work still needs to not just be a cash grab when the game costs thirty dollars more than its largest competitor of which has a name nearly identical to the term used for a period of two weeks. I don't recommend this game because as the consumer base we need to take charge of developers. We have the power to conform them to what we want not the other way around. This does not mean the game isn't fun I just think we need to help the devs understand that we are the ones with the true power. Only then will true change that can improve the longevity and the experience in game can occur. (Also Miramar),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-09,0,0,117,True,Recommended,"Very addictive. Unfair in places due to lag and desync but even if it was the ""full game"" it's still not nearly enough to call it a serious issue at this point especially in todays mmo climate. Maybe not as survival based as one would hope but it's still harcore enough to keep you coming back... aaand back hahaha. Casuals beware this might be one of the easiest games of its type as far as battling the elements and getting copious amounts of loot... but that's where the gravy train ENDS you will be hunted down fast with little more than a footstep giving away your exact location so it's not noob friendly at all. If you are knew to mmo battle royale keep out the way in the woods till you are 10 games deep and dont puff your pants when someone aproaches is the best advice for newcomers. Learn your nades fast as the stuns and smoke will help you more than anything. Be wary of takinnng advice from youtubers saying punch oor shoot windows out while the bomber flies by etc... as if I see a broken window and a house full of closed doors then there will be a cooked nade cooming through the window and rolling between yoour legs. My looting skills are terrible and this game punishes that. The entire UI and looting system is made to be seamless and rapid but I'm getting caught out looting due to not playing enough of these games recently. I'm looking to get super fast on the looting side on this game so its with me on all future games that's not a gripe or a negative in my book but just so you know it will severly punish slow looters if you parachute in at a base or high loot area.

While I definitly reccomend buying it here's what I question the most. 1. ""WHERE ARE WE GETTING SHOT FROM??!!""2. *Shoots person point blank with shotgun* They survive 360 noscope 420 blaze it and kill me instantly with a P1911.3. Jump punches remind me of Mike Tyson's ""Punch Out"". You will die if it actually connects.4. *Bails out of car moving 5mph Blood covers the screen and nearly die.*5. Motorcycles are a trap hitting an ant at 70mph will cause the bike to flip several times and spontaneously combust.6. It takes nearly the same amount of time to pop a few painkillers than it does to inject yourself with whatever is in a med kit.7. Trying to shoot someone through a window? Your AR willl have no effect on the the windows little trim thats always in the way.Don't let any of that stop you from buying this game ( it's usually what makes me laugh most ). It's best played with friends IMO.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-26,0,0,58,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a great concept game. Mixing survival/scavanging with team elimination combat makes for excellent gameplay. There are still bugs in the early release which causes lag and glitches in the early match. When you start with 99 players what do you expect?

2017-06-09,0,0,49,True,Recommended,I don't review many games. But here is my review This game has been very fun you start out on this small starter island at first you may realize a lot of players talk a lot of junk. You can go around and test out weapons and the controls before the match begins each match will start with 90 100 players on a plane and each one gets to chose a spot to land in order to loot different guns and equipment to stay alive. The game outlines a white circle shortly after landing that you need to be in otherwise you die so depending where you landed. It could be a make or break situation desperate scramble to find a vehicle to get inside the white circle. The time begins to count down and a blue circles comes in and rounds up players into the white circle after that the circle gets smaller and smaller until you are the last one standing. So now you know the gist of the game is it worth it to you? To me it kinda is the game does lack in features although must give it that it is a early access game. In reality there aren't that many weapons and equipment to chose from there really isn't much. As far as vehicles go there isn't much of a variety there are only things you can drive not things you can fly. As far as modes go you get to choose either solo duo or squad. There are no different types of games only the one unless you try custom. The map. The map is great... only for a while. You get sick of it they only give you one map when this game could do so much more with more variety. Optimization you've gotta know if you get this game you should really get a solid state drive and make sure your computer is beefy on my computer i can run almost anything at medium settings but this game with simple graphics? I need to run all low settings. The game can glitch a bit sometimes and give you unreliable speeds depending on your system again this is early access and they need time to fix that all up. Overall this game is good fun I do actually like this game you can be sneaky stealthy and hide really well or be aggressive however you want but in terms of features we are very limited at the moment there honestly isn't that much at all. At this stage we have no idea whether new modes or items will be implemented within the game. This game is worth the purchase but its for sure still in develoupment.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-09,0,0,866,True,Recommended,The game is very addictive there is a different scenario for every game you play never being repetitive. The developers are optimising the game and making new maps for the community of PUBG to enjoy. So yeah i strongly recommend 3,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-28,0,0,49,True,Recommended,There should be a warning on the splash screen for this game. *WARNING ITS ADDICTIVE**JUST ONE MORE GO IS A LIE*PUBG pits 100 ish players against each other on a small island and the last man standing is the winner. Its a simple concept but so well orchestrated that it does have you going back for more and more.You start the game in a plane before parachuting out and steering yourself to a position on the map. I love this bit where you can watch people just tumble out of the plane... everyone of them looking around them at the other skydivers and thinking about the fact that every one of those other people is a player who is out to kill you on this small island. As soon as you hit the ground you go scrambling for equipment. Now this can be frustrating as sometimes you will end up super equipped with no other players in your vicinity before you go out hunting or there are times you land with a group of enemy circling and find yourself not with the 8x Scope sniper rifle but with a frying pan and a pair of fingerless gloves.People say the game is repetitive but personally I find every play to be completely different and equally rivetting!You can play the game as a single player duo or squad and it is great to team up with your friends and go into battle co ordinating your jump and landings to be near each other. You also get the option to play the game in either 3rd person or first person perspective. The 3rd person perspective has the option of switching to FPP if you so wish.All in all a good game with a strong following. Give it a go and you wont be disappointed.. unless you find yourself sporting a frying pan instead of that SCAR L.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-28,0,0,1011,True,Recommended,PREVIOUS REVIEWUnfortunately even as an early access game this wasn't ready. It is basically unplayable. There is a very common glitch where the world won't load and you can't move or interact using your character. I ran into this in every game I tried to queue for and I have really high specs on my computer and I can't get it to load the world. Poorly optimized and not worth the money yet. I will check back in the future however because the game LOOKS cool it's just unplayable. Others are reporting terrible crashing and lagging issues if they can even play the game. I understand that this game is early access but this is way too much.P.S. Loading the world takes 2.5 GB of usable RAM at the best of times and 4.5 at the worst.NEW REVIEW Since the game has been optomized significantly better I am comfortable saying that I will recommend this game. It is fun and addicting (and also frustrating).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-11,0,0,877,True,Not Recommended,The game is some of the funnest I have had in several years and I really enjoy playing it specially when you have friends running in a duo or squad. The game itself is making strides into fixing the lag issues that arise while it's fustrating it's still playable and the lag only jumps in randomly. There are glitches that are steadily being fixed by the developers which I appreciate. The one map that is always played is becoming a little boring but because nothing is ever the same it keeps the game interesting with these notes I give the game a 4.5 star.Now comes the part of the review that makes this game a lackluster 2 star review. The cheating has gotten extremely bad head shots with shotguns from 4 5 houses over people jumping from vehicles and headshotting entire squads and nothing is being done about these cheaters. Hopefully the developers are going to run an anti cheat very soon and all those players get perma banned. If not this game will die as fast as it was made.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-11,0,0,128,True,Recommended,I think this game is pretty great. I hear claims of hackers from other players but I don't see many of them. I've probably ran into one once probably. Aside from that it's really just players being good at the game. As for an actual review The game has a good sense of balance with the tiered weapons and armor and playing with friends makes for a more tactical game. There's not much to the game aside from the one map and options to either play with friends or by yourself. However because of the large scale of the map and the procedural generation of the weapon spawns each playthrough is different. Definitely a game worth 30 dollars especially if more content is on the way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Low skilled players love this game because of 3rd person and the luck of items. Even a highly skilled person can find themselves occasionally with every item except a gun.Like spending 10 minutes gathering just top get shot in the back?Unless you really enjoy slow slow paced third person combat I would not reccomend.

This is a particularly lazy way of preventing exploits in the game. At least implement this band aid against cheats by seeing if VM's are actually running on the system and only then kick. That way at least legitimate players can stop their VMs when playing rather than getting kicked.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-07,0,0,413,True,Recommended,tl dr China numba one!The game has been released in early access for few months so i really don't get all the complaining reviews about server stability and big/glitches if you want a stable game buy it when it's finished and use the forums or something else to point out the probles you had so they can fix.The dev team i have to say it has been very responsive and updating the game constantly.Overall i'm pretty happy with this game hopefully this will be the 1st game of this genre to be fully released?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-06,0,0,286,True,Not Recommended,In it's current state the game is fun but overall I must recommend waiting until some of the obligatory early access cancer is cured.Firstly the game runs terribly on lower mid range hardware. I have a Computer from 2013 that is not a modern horse but it's not bad and I constantly get micro stutters and freezes in mid combat that make the game unplayable. I cannot explain the number of times my screen has just froze after the first shot I've fired in CQC situations only to show the death screen a half a second later.Also in 3 out of 5 matches the game is unbearably laggy and stuttery for the first 15 seconds 2.5 minutes of each match. The buildings sometimes completely fail to render in. I can't chalk this up to my 15 megabit internet connection. Other games run flawlessly. I'd also estimate that 3 out of 20 games just freeze and crash the game completely. The loading screen times are abysmally long and often I can hear the game going on around me but have a loading screen plastered in my face for 15 30 more seconds.Relevant Specs i7 4770 GTX 760 2GB 8 GB RAM 1TB 5400rpm HDDNow that I've ragged on the game for its early access buggy flaws I'll rag on it for some very awful game design choices that have nothing to do with the early access status.1. The squad knockout mechanic This mechanic is absolutely game breaking at times. Killing lone players outright but giving squad players the chance to revive their teamates infinitely without any healing items is moronic game design. I cannot explain the number of times I've gotten in a firefight with two people in a building and knocked the two of them out a combined total of 4 or 5 times. This mechanic makes ranged combat a joke. It should be removed outright. 2. 3rd person camera This mechanic introduces a problem that is nothing new to 3rd person shooters PERISCOPING. With the abundance of buildings rocks trees and cover a person can hide completely out of sight and use his 3rd person camera to look around corners windows walls and gain extremely unfair advantages. In dense urban settings the game really turns into a periscoping cess pool.3. Adamantium Body Armor Body armor is ridiculously overpowered to the point of allowing someone to survive multiple sniper shots to the torso without consequence. Just get behind cover use a medkit and you're ready to survive another two shots to the chest. Body armor should only be able to reduce the damage of at MOST intermediate Assault rifle cartridges like 5.56x45 and 7.62x39. I've had people take two shots to the chest with .300 win mag from the AWM just by healing in between shots. Again this makes ranged combat pointless in many situations.Conclusion With all this being said I have had a plethora of fun times in the game. I've found myself being frustrated too much by all the things mentioned above to keep playing it. Maybe in the future it will improve but for now I cannot recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-02,0,0,194,False,Recommended,Personally I think it is a good game or it could become a good game. For example something I think would be good to have is a server for the newbies so that they won't go against pro players as they won't have enough experience to compete with them. To know on which server to play you could set the wins as a factor of knowing who is able to play on this server. For example if you have less than 5 wins you can play in that server but when you get 5 wins you go on the normal server. Also other things like d sync is ruining the game but I know you are going to fix it in FIX PUBG so I am going to wait until then.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I know this game is still in Alpha but I have figured out a few things that I would like to see in the final version of the game. 1. More maps but figure that is going to come. 2. A spectator mode after you die option. 3. An ability to split Casual vs Ranked (experienced) players. I know most of this will probably be included in the game. Just my two cents.

2017-04-02,0,0,99,True,Recommended,h1z1 is still fun but i like how this game is still different from h1z1 and not a clone. The guy who was the lead maker of PUBG made the battle royal mod for arma and helped make h1z1. So this is probably the best battle royal that has been made (that I have played at least). The map is AMAZING! h1z1 has a pretty flat map with all land. PUBG has a verticle and flat island but its not just one island... ITS MULTIPLE ISLANDS! Which is very refreshing to play on. I absolutly recomend this game to ANYONE whomst hasnt bought this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game doesn't run that well but I've been able to stay above 60FPS by dropping the settings down so it is definitely playable on a weaker system (I've got an RX 470) and will only get better as time goes on. This game sets a great example for what early access games should be. The devs listen to the community and are updating the game frequently with new content and optimizations. Check out some youtube vids and streams if you're on the edge but I'm sure you'll love it. I can't stop playing!

After spending huge amounts of my time on this game to get my first pioneer crate for 700 coins I finally was ready to open said crate. I was surprised when an error appeared that said ""Failed to open crate"" I thought that this was simply due to lack of connection but when i went to click on the crate again i found that it had dissapeared completley. After accepting this loss I then put in more time and attempted to get the second pioneer crate for 1400 coins. When I tried to open this crate it also dissappeared. I understand that the game is in very early stages and there are bugs and glitches to be expected but this was extremely annoying as i put in a large amount of time to get the crates.

The movement is still god awful...trying to do anything with any precision is like a monkey trying to do a rhinoceros.The new battle pass is a disaster as well. It s impossible to get anything without pouring hours and hours in and just when you think you actually got one of the challenges done it doesn t go through anyways so F you.(This was from before...not sure how much it applies now but it probably does somewhat)Brendan Greene is ruining the game in order to rake in money from China where they just so happen to cheat more so it must be okay for them to do it and screw everyone else.

2018-06-26,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,While being one of the OG's of the battleground hype PUBG fails to complete their promises. We paid 30 euros to support the game in development yet when they launched officially nearly all of the bugs that were there in the past were still present. This only means one thing. They are in for the quick buck and will do everything as possible to get the most money out of a poor game. Including an event pass just to jump on the trend wagon (like other free to play games are doing the fact is they are free from the get go) just only confirms that train of thought.As I said to my friends the first time I started this game this game will be alpha forever.

2017-05-08,0,0,375,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the sweet spot on the spectrum of arcade ish to competitive.I give it a good 9.9* out of 10.*Number may vary depending on how long they stay in early access and on how much they update and optimize.* These are the things that told me that this purchase was worth it. It's competitive aspect due to its relative realism and good physics. You can press shift to move faster while crouching or prone. i/ At first the game being unplayable in a very short time has moved to playable. You can't jump out of a car at 80 mph and shoot someone with a shotgun and take no damage. Even though I have a 750ti the minimum being a 660ti the game has run really well and looks beautifulMy hopes for the game. Optimizations netcode improvements that don't stop coming till they can shrink the minimum sprec to a gt 720. That this game gets out of Early Access before Half life Three comes out..

2018-06-14,0,0,199,False,Recommended,This game has many bugs optimization problems and cheaters. Plus new battle royale games are coming out consantly and they all do the things that PUBG wasn't ablle to achieve. And with Call of Duty and Battlefield battle royales coming out later this year it is going to be a lost cause for Bluehole to try and compete with these huge companies. However there are two things that PUBG does better than every other royale game tension and friend play. When I play Fortnite or Realm Royale with my friends it doesn't feel like we are actually fighting for the win together and it instead feels like we are competing for kills. It also feels like we are solely pushing for the win and we forget to have fun altogether. In PUBG there is nothing better than sittign in a room with your friends listening out for footsteps while having a fun casual chat in the meantime. Unlike the other games there is just something about PUBG where I just want to chill out and talk with my friends. Secondly the tension in PUBG is unlike any other game. In other games ou feel like its okay to die because you can respawn with new people and pick up from where you left off. In PUBG all the kills and loot that you've acquired makes you want to win so itr doesn't all go to waste. I can literally feel my heart pounding and my fingers numbing when it gets down to two teams. If you're looking for a game that delivers strategy tension and good times with friends than this is for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,167,True,Recommended,In my opinion this game is awesome for the time it came out. I just played 19hs and i felt really inmersed apart that the game has only 3 months and a half from release. When it comes to Pros i would say that the Unreal Engine is used really well the animations are really complete no bugs when picking objects shooting ( only when opening doors) constant feedback from the developers from the community an 8x8 map with vehicles and the incredible feeling of being a loser when u are 2nd. Last but not least it is really fun so enjoy and lets hope the developers dont the game.10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,263,True,Recommended,"It may be in early release have some hillarious bugs but its addictive and a relatively ""complete"" game. Lets get the initial bad out of the way. I've got 10 hours in and only a few obvious things that jump out. Movement glitches and bugs you have to ""jump"" over ankle high fences and walls. If you time it wrong you're jumping on the spot and probably about to die to the guy aiming to kill you. Car/Bike mechanics drive too fast hit a minor bump and your car is going to do a barrel role. Grenades... oh how many times I hit a wall that is NOT where the red line is saying its going to go. Bullet Drop? I've yet to fully figure out how the mechanics of ADS are suppose to work with zeroing distance. Sometimes I'll get a headshot other times it feels like the bullet lands at his feet. Shrugs I'm marking this as a bug as it doesn't 'feel' consistent.Now onto the good.BATTLE ROAYLE! That is all. Seriously go watch some Twitch Clips of good moments.If you jump out the plane at the start go for the main building on your planes route and land with about 10 other people. Unless you are the lucky guy who gets the gun instantly the armour and all the ammo you are going to die. Very fast. Alternatively you're gonna get some kills and have a frantic start to some thats fun.I've found a bit of strategy and some basic tactics go a long way in this game. My reaction times have gone down hill over the last decade I'm no longer the cometative gamer who can out AWP 99% the player base on Dust2 in CS 1.6 / Source. But I still have map awareness movement use of cover and in this game. It pays off in in the bucketload.Yes there is still luck involved in what you find in the houses you first raid. There is also luck in wether you choose the right/wrong time to come out of a building if someone else is nearby with a better gun/scope/ability to aim.But thats the fun of it. I've played about 20 games now solo. Thats not a lot but i've got a 20% top 10 finish and 1 win under my belt so I'm doing ok in my book!I still haven't bothered to figure out what guns best for what occasion what part of the maps have good cover/los. How long it takes to run across a grid reference full pelt etc.. the stuff that differentiates me from the great players. But with time I think anyone can get into this game. With more time you'll learn the above and inherently get better at the game. The best bit You can't ""CAMP"" and win. You can Camp early on and get a kill or two but the second the 'zone' appears you gotta start moving. It forces you to move unless you are insanely lucky with your initial drop. It pushes you together and then the funstressy times begin.Final Thoughts.The Frying Pan is the best body armour ever https //clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulPeacefulPassionfruitDBstyle",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,451,True,Recommended,This is game is loads of fun. Playing in squads or duos have provided some of the most intense gamin moments of my life. Unfortunately this game was bought on my primary account and I was able to play it on this one. However they updated the game to stop people from scamming the family share system. I did not get this game for free and from what I understand in that patch people who did family share it were suppose to be allowed to keep the game. Not quite sure why I was not allowed to do so but all the same I will probably buy this game on this account just so I can play it. The devs keep up with the community and this game will definitely become more and more popular if the progress for this game continues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,0,0,764,True,Recommended,I have a love hate relationship with this game. Its very intense and super fun. Solo playing is fun but i think It's way better playing with friends. The cool thing is that if you dont have a group of friends you can team up with random people. This is fun sometimes but there are trolls(team killers) that will kill you as soon as your done looting. They need to work on that because its annoying. I also think they should add a report buttom in game to make it easier for people to report losers killing their own teammates or take friendlyfire off. p.s. be ready to hear losers screaming in mic at the start of everygame. You can switch it to hear only your teammates which i would reccomend,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-19,0,0,74,True,Not Recommended,SPECS I7 4790K GTX970 16gb ram Z97 MB Average FPS 58 Low FPS in high density/laggy areas 24 Highest FPS 76 (In other words here you should probably have a beefy PC that isnt barely cutting it) CURRENT STATUS OF THE GAME Overall PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is very much in early access. This game has been in development for some time but it is still VERY early.Pros Better than H1Z1. Even in its somewhat laggy and new state it is still more fun to play than H1Z1 KOTK.Very fluid and good movement. Inventory makes SO MUCH SENSE THANK YOU. You will find yourself used to most controls etc. within 5 games which is insanely nice. Also the gun mechanics are very familiar and forgiving and the game treats players who use first person with respect since third person aiming is a bit off.Map is well rounded and is a great size.Cons LAGGY. Dont expect to play a single game without a bit of lag courtesy of slowish servers and player load. Also the optimization in highly detailed areas is pretty awful. The red zones will lag up your PC very hard so not only should you avoid them (but theyre random) you also happen to lag inside of them... Fun stuff.If you have a controller plugged in it will vibrate when you get hit or die etc. If you unplug your controller mid game to stop this it will pause your entire game and screw you over. Currently there is no off button in the game options menu to turn off controller nor is there a controls menu for the controller which doesnt make sense. (I use mouse+keyboard but use a controller for other games that require/are better with a controller)NO HITMARKERS. This is a huge problem since at longer distances or in darker areas you cannot tell if you hit someone since it only spills dark blood.The sounds in this game are AWFUL. I mean they are the WORST. I have a 7.1 surround sound HyperX Cloud II headset and there is NO specific up or down sound whatsoever. AT ALL. You wont even be able to tell what story a person is running on the sounds are so bad. The sound distances of weapon fire are also horrible.Vehicle Jump and Bump physics are basically Battlefield 4 but the vehicles will always tilt in akward directions and flip over. This is a bad thing if you want to try and escape a red zone because you wont be able to go full speed on any surface (even the roads have some bumps that can screw you over).Welp. As of 5/8/17 I can very clearly say I cannot recommend this game to ANY solo players really at all unless you want to rage until your head explodes. You may win one game... out of 20... if you get lucky enough to not have any glitches or lag or crazy car flipping happen to you before then. This game is a TERRIBLE solo queue game right now and the lag along with bad hitboxes make this game frustrating to play. Want to win a solo game? Just hide in a shed for 20 minutes and you will be all set...Also what the actual hell... You cant hit people in water its ridiculous. Ive played two matches now where I have seen someone swimming and have not been able to hit them in the water even when my shots make the water right above them splash. This is a stupid thing and NEEDS TO BE FIXED NOW. There are CRATES that DROP in the WATER and you CANT hit people swimming. It sucks. Current state of game 3/10 Solo Queue (High Likelyhood of glitches lag and terrible sounds make solo queueing a nightmare even for people who have good headphones)5/10 Duo Queue (Better with a partner to cover your back but still not a fun experience when one person dies)6/10 Squad Queue (Best game mode for this game your squad will have sights in all directions making those bad sounds insignificant. As well more action per gunfight and higher risk in cities)5/8/17 Re Review (I just cant recommend anyone looking to solo queue without some friends to be able to play with to get this game) For this game to be fun (and funny when it glitches or you die in stupid ways) you need some friends to play with. Otherwise the SOLO queue aspect is absolutely GARBAGE.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Whether you play with a freind a group of friends or solo you are still bound to have a good time. This is a perfect example of a battle royale stlye game done right. The adrenaline rush you get from being in the top ten is unrivaled by any other game I have yet to play. Other than being a perfect example of a battle royale game done right this is also a perfect example of an early access game done right. Unlike every other early access game this one has competent game devs updates that actually fix problems in game and developers who listen to the community! For example the community says they don't like the current jumping mechanic in response to that the game devs show us their progress on the new vaulting and climbing mechanics. It's so rare to not only find game devs that genuinely care about the players and the community but that actually listen and implement their feedback into their game too. Overall for a 30 dollar price tag this game is a bargain and I definetly suggest you pick it up if you are able to. Thank you,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,396,True,Recommended,Worthwhile investment good development cycle with one majour update a month adding new weapons and features currently as of (11th of July) there is some bugs that I and a few of my friends have run into but nothing to majour.1. My game 4 time out of 10 when loading into a match will crash on the splash screen2. Random crashes out of no reason in game3. General performance issues (this is much better now after recent updates though)4. My freind was constantly getting a crash every time he would exit out of a matchAppart from that its a very good game it is definatly the best and most fun of all these battle royal games. Gunplay feels smooth and has some meat behind it loot for the most part feels consistent ( a few minor cases of bad loot spawns). Would recomend to anyone looking to get it if they can look past the current bugs that are in the game because of early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not actualy thronw so you can choose where you land. Then you run around looking for anything that shoots in worse case scenario you try to avoid or beat to death other players before THEY can find any weapon.After this part random part skill based start you check map wheater you have to run fastest as you can to the safe area or you chose well and dont have to move at all. In first case you run or drive if lucky or other players where so kind and did not shoot thru every car wheel they saw before they left. If you are already in the safe zone its even worse. There are probably more people than just you and they all want more loot same as you. You are before a dilemma leave your safe spot looking for loot risking being shot at or stay there and being shot a little later.You deside to leave and cear up. You find something you really like and feel invincible.. at least for a few secs. Then you realise a lot of people did the same. Your ears and eyes are you biggest friends atm you look for a slightest movement or sound. You scare yourself a few times but thats expected. You continues to smaller circle. You happen to see someone having the same strategy as you but left his building just moments before you. You shot him into his back. He falls and dies instantly. You feel good you sadist. You grab his stuff and continues on your jouney into the white.Thats it only you and several other people. You chose a spot for camping and if you are lucky you wont have to move until the end. You have to move in the next minute. You have to decide once again if you will move immediatly or wait and risk not being in time but having nobody in your back.. most probably at least. You decide to wait. After few moment you decide not to wait and move forward.Thats it you moved and now its you and only few more people you scout the area but see noone. You hear shots constantly. You are ready with your upgraded weapon. You see an enemy. He is shooting. Somebody dies and he hides behind a tree. You aim and wiht three quick shots you kill him. You feel great. You hear shots. And you are dead. You feel sad. Just two trees next to you was somebody hidden. You finished 3rd.You are proud but disapointed that you made mistake.You try again and you also die in first minutes you try again and again. All attemts worse than your first one.But you keep trying until you get to the last 3 people again....... and then you get shot again.Solid 5/7 would try again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-11,0,0,74,True,Recommended,I waited for far too long to buy this game. In summary it does everything about right. For my part I didn't buy because of the reports of poor performance and in game cheating. I can now attest that it works fine on my bootcamped Mac and I have seen no evidence of hacking. I have been killed a lot in circumstances that seemed a little to quick but I am sure that was because of my lack of ability at FPS and not cheating. The game is much more strategic than you might think. The best players only need to kill one or two players per game to win. I have got to the top four and am gradually getting better. The game really rewards careful play and practice. If your rig is up to it go for it and enjoy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-26,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Tons of fun insanely immersive. One of the few games to actually make me jump when I was shot. I could easily reccomend this to anybody with the system to run it. The optimization isn't the greatest at the moment however it does seem to be getting better as time goes on. Quick note make sure your directx and visual c++ 2015 is updated correctly. It could cause you a nightmare to deal with if it isn't. There's a host of bugs and a memory leak that could make some systems crash. The devs are very aware of this and are vocal with what they're fixing in their patches. Remember if you see the argument about paid crates don't let it worry you. Most people dive onto the island wearing almost nothing and trying to scavenge their camo just like they do with their weapons for the added immersion. Paid crates will help generate new money for things such as tournaments and esports broadcasting. Just look at how well Dota2 and LoL are performing. Pitting 100 of the best players against eachother in a match would be quite the spectacle,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Squad is a lot more fun and more challenging when it comes to sound ques and etc. But if i want points I can somtimes just play solo and go afk in a bathroom getting double the points and I have come across people just afk in certain hiding holes and thats something to me that needs to be atleast adjusted,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,34,True,Recommended,Very much worth the investment.For those of you who play DayZ this game should help you stomach the bitter taste in your mouths left over by that ridiculously underdeveloped mess.PLAYER UNKNOWN while at first can be very difficult to get into you will quickly become hooked and discover that the combat and organic gameplay is very rewarding.The gameplay structure goes as follows Jump out of a plane land loot as fast as possible kill whoever is nearest by loot more find a car escape the gas head to the centre dieWhile the game is addictively fun and puts an engaging spin on the modern survival shooter there are some major issues the Devs need to address1 The plane is far too loud people cannot hear eachother's mics when waiting to drop2 The gas cloud is far too quick it moves at approximately double the running speed therefore if you get stuck in it and cannot find a car you can pretty much be certain the rest of your playtime will be chasing the safe zone and using up all your health supplies just to die when it moves again. SLOW THAT SH!T DOWN3 Bullet damage feels a little unbalanced It seems like 10 quick fire rounds to the chest with an Uzi simply allows the other player to line up a headshot without so much as a stagger (Aka the game is rather unforgiving in expecting accuracy but hey some people love that)4 More loot sure the weapons are well balanced but a larger variety in assault weapons explosives and clothing would be nice5 Car physics even Princess Diana would say the vehicles in this game are deathtraps6 OPTIMISATION it runs like mud through a sandbag even on all lowest settingsOverall PLAYERUNKNOWN is well worth the investment.

They also just decided to sue the guys behind fortnite Epic Games developers who update frequently and make new and meaningful additions to their games. I don't even like Fortnite it's not my style of a game. Bluehole has been pretty open about their dislike of fortnite because of it's similarities and Bluehole can't seem to grasp that they can't have the sandbox to themselves. (Kind of ironic since pubg started off as a free mod like DayZ)The game is fun with friends but a lot of things can be fun with friends. Stuff is still wonky shooting is entirely random and physics bugs are still around and rampant with vehicles. It is a fun multiplayer experience and I prefer the gameplay over fortnite's but Bluehole is terrible.It really is a shame that Bluehole and to a lesser extent Brendan Greene had to be the ones in control of pubg.

Second of all I would like to say it is a very fun and addicting game with fairly good graphics (if you can run them on medium ultra). I recommend this game for people who like first person shooters (even though it is technically a third person shooter you can still choose fps before starting a match.) Wait till it's on sale please right now a bit too expensive but other than that great game!

2017-03-27,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,I have had to change my review from positive to negative. When I first got this game it was a lot of fun. Simple mechanics some minor problems and a lot to look foward to. Today there has been very little to show for progress. Yes there are two maps and one more on the way but second map they added was garbage and the third I have yet to play. It seems the devs spite their overwhelming success with the games launch and the amount of profit made from it they have decided that the loot crate system was more important to monetize than focus on the games lack of content.Although I have yet to play Fortnite the devs have shown more dedication to making their games experience a priority than PUBG even with a similar cosmetic system as PUBG. It really doesn't help when PUBG is suing EPIC GAMES over Fortnite over the fact that Fortnite was more successful than PUBG. Yes Fortnite is a ripoff or PUBG but PUBG is a ripoff of Battle Royale the movie and you don't see them activily going out of the way asking for royalties for their product from everyone else.There was time when this game was fun and great but the devs have become nothing more than profit driven and love to hate hate on people who copy them because sticking people inside an area and hiding weapons on the map and making them fight to the death was their original idea and Hunger Games and Battle Royale totally didn't have this idea first. In anyway I think Fortnite will eventually overrun this genre of games and eventually the entire genre will blow over in about a year when the next fad comes out. It is sad to see a small humble dev team become like almost every tripple A dev team out there and money has become more important than the passion of making their game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-21,0,0,73,True,Recommended,PUBG is overall a fun game but is has some problems in its current state poorly optimized performance buggy animations and server issues come to mind. But if you can make your way through all of that what you'll find is a highly suspenseful and rewarding battle royale shooter where each kill feels like you've earned it and each victory makes you feel like a god.The way I see it there are two ways to play PUBG Going for the win and going for kills. If you try for one it's not likely you're going to achieve the other. In my opinion going for kills is much more fun as you spend less time camping and more time in gunfights. Yes your games may be shorter and you aren't as likely to win but killing another player and taking his loot is extremely satisfying. There are some players (mostly Twitch gods) who are just beastly at the game and rack up kills and wins. But that is a very difficult thing to do for the average gamer since you give away your position every time you shoot.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Releasing on Xbox is a mistake though.Fortnite is quite a diffrent game I like PUBG and Fortnite equally.Fortnite is more a game I would play when I was bored and not trying to focus on just the game itself.PUBG can be very intense and the rounds are a bit longer then Fortnites when playing PUBG you must have to focus on only the game and watch your surroundings carefully. PUBG is harder to learn and more tactical then Fornite.Updates for PUBG make me want to keep playing and I look forward for all the fun updates to come but they must focus CHEATERS. They should have server admins in the lobbies and maybe should even create their own cheating system to detect hackers and report hackers more efficiently.

However the game is plagued by cheaters (especially 3rd person dont even bother playing it plus third person camera takes away the fun) poor performance net code can let you down and leave you feeling cheated and the mid game is so so boring.

2017-08-02,0,0,216,True,Recommended,This is an absolutely amazing game. After playing H1Z1 for hours I can conclude that this game is much better and a big upgrade.. This game delivers hours and hours of fun despite being somewhat simple. Many reviews are negative due to micro transactions being introduced however they're only for cosmetic items therefore don't change the actual game in any way. I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters or co op games with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,206,True,Recommended,So this review is as of 8/2/2017So as of now pubg is in update month 4 and the new update is about to come out and it is going to be adding fov sliders first person only servers and crates.1. Crates so people are starting to get a little mad about the micro transactions that are coming with the crates so what I heard is the keys are going to be 3 bucks or someting but that is only for some of the crates there are going to be free crates also and all thats in the crates are cosmetic items and they saidi they want to use the money for esports and I think I would be happy paying them some money for that and dont forget they are patching it every week and adding new content every month so I think people should really stop complaining 2. The current state of the game Ok so as of now there 4 snipers 1 map 3 Helmets 3 Vests 3 Backpacks 4 ARS 4 MGs 3 Shotguns 4 PistolsAnd lots of attachments,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-02,0,0,233,True,Recommended,It's a nice game although there are some problems when loading the map texture maybe because it's still early access. Overall i say it's a good game to play either alone or with your friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-02,0,0,474,True,Recommended,I am writing this review as a formal resignation from PUBG. My very last match I drifted a Dacia into the front of an oncoming enemy Jeep. Bullets flew cars flew bodies flew. The end screen had me with three kills from the enemy squad in the Jeep and my body flying accross the map. I have decided that the previous events are where I will peak in PUBG and since there is no possible way I can improve I shall have to stop and move on to improve my skills again. I am fully satisfied with my time in the game and feel that playing any longer would be almost robbing the world of my time. There is no conceivable way for me to enjoy this game any more than I just did and would like to personally thank the developers for the heart attacks cereberal edemas headaches laughs cries break ups and all other events inspired from this game. Seriously. I broke up with a girl playing this. How much more value can you get from a game. Bluehole Thank you,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-25,0,0,893,True,Not Recommended,At the beginning I'd have given this game 5/5 because the Devs were hyped for their own game there were patches that blew up performance from 50 100fps so that you could this game properly. But after the latest Patches the FPS went down and cheaters took over the game. Not a single day without a cheater. Like literally every day a close to win game gets ez pz fullsprayed over the circle by an Ak 47 which is not even close to you.

2017-05-07,0,0,199,True,Recommended,This game is really fun but oh boy is it buggy. As this is an 'early access' game this is expected however a number of these bugs are not only game breaking. But just logic flaws by the devs allowing very easy cheating.But how!? There is anti cheat?Well for example today my client failed to load the modules for the houses. Allowing me to tell my teammates exactly where weapons are and other players. (I disconnected ofcourse as I want a fair game) but when a normal bug can trigger this it means that everything is drawn even when behind walls. Allowing wall hacks etc. This is extreemly poor for a game in '17 (devs read up on ray casting). Same with the foliage turn them to low so other players can hardly hide..Then again the game is fun and I really hope they adress these issues for now I'd give it five out of seven!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-30,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This is an excellent battle royale game. It may need some work to address cheaters which is apparently rampant. Though Personally Ive only experienced this a few times. This game is best enjoyed with friends. Do I reccomend this game to play by yourself like an absolute loser? Absolutely not.

It will have bugs and glitches and crashes but rest assured this game is regularly updated and will be getting new content in the future.8.75/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Multiple game modes for team play is a welcome bonus changes the game entirely to have some friends have your back. Devs are doing a great job with fixes. Final product should be a block buster.

Also the loot spawn is really you either get a gun and have the enemies didnt find a weapon or you didnt even find a gun so you are forced to punch your way out or just exit saves time. Whenever the loot and the mechanics of the game seem to be working its a very fun game.Just waiting for ceratin mechanics of the game to be fixed since it is still in beta. 8/8 would play again,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-30,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,This game gained it's fame from streamers and not so much the actual compotence of the game itself. It'd be fun to play with friends when you're drunk and can ignore the infininity and beyond problems that the game has Pros *Lots of guns*Tiers of armor and weapons*Vehicles that feel pretty good to drive*Armor in this game has a noticeable advantage*Firefights aren't too long and they aren't too short. They offer response time.Cons *The game is very unstable. When I first bought the game I wouldn't even be able to load in before being parachuted down to a bunch of other people who had the same problem as me. No PC problems it was a game problem. Cool. Seems to stop after an hours worth of trying.*FPS Drops like nobodies business for absolutely no reason guess you should restart 20 minutes of progress because you couldn't react in 1 fps (another game problem Ark and GTA don't even have these problems for me.)*They seem to be very money hungry. Instead of fixing the game up they expand onto mobile and release new content this is paired up with content that can only be bought. These keys are more expensive than a FTP game like LoL in which a key can cost $1.25 but these losers want $2.50. I wasn't even interested in it when I noticed something interesting . . .*As a newcomer you can be easily tricked into wasting credits. You don't unlock clothes normally they want you to unlock it with RNG so you look like a ing disaster until you're a veteran or have spent money. (FTP system.) Special boxes that you unlock with credits can't even be opened without wasting $2.50 or so with absolutely NO disclaimer. I don't want to spend money on a game that I've already spent money on.*They are using FTP techniques in a game that you had to buy in the first place.The problems with the game are just so overshadowing that It's difficult to say I'd play longer than an hour. It's frustrating and the devs have no intention to fix what isn't making them money it appears to be.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But lately it's has been game breaking bugs like disconnects game crashes and the likes.What finally made me delete this game was the anti cheat service BattleEye.I'm playing on a machine that I work on also.

I will now have to disable my VMWare services everytime I want to play or uninstall VMWare completely. Not going to happen.

You just need to realize that there are cheaters in every game and it's something that needs to be done by PUBG with its anti cheating system. And it's not every time you die you die because of cheaters. Just admit that your skills are still not there yet not to mention a lot of people out there (including my squad) have killed cheaters before. There are losers cheating and swearing in every server regardless of nationality. Racists are as bad as the cheaters and both deserve to be killed in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-30,0,0,334,False,Recommended,The game on its own is acceptable for 30 dollars assuming your PC doesn't turn into a personal heater. The gun play has some rough parts but nothing that ruins the overall experience. Luck and RNG definitly exists as they will always play a large role in Battle Royal games but there is still a high skill cap and the better player will win most fights. Lootboxe$ do exist but they don't affect gameplay and can be sold in the market. There are also extremely few games that can even approach the levels of stress and exitement that come with being in the top ten survivors. The game is just an overall enjoyable experience that gets amplified with friends.My main complaint is that the company that made PUBG just seems lost and childish. After all the money they've made developement is still slow and emphasis seems to be placed on squeezing the most money they can out of their players before the game dies. Also sueing another company for creating a more succesful clone is like a child getting angry at an adult who was influenced by one of their 1st grade macaroni arts and crafts to create a massivly successful art piece. If they truely wanted to be THE battle royal game they should have created a masterpiece that everyone played and stayed ahead of the competition not relying on lawsuits to get their way.TLDR Game is good company is bad,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is fun but it's not worth spending even more than the initial cost price for microtransactions in an early Is just pittiful.

2018-06-23,0,0,456,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR PUBG was once a good game now it's worse and it's only going to go downhill because their priorities are in wrong areas.During the beginning the game was amazing. It was what H1Z1 hoped for. Good gameplay an okay optimization and the fair amount of bugs. Being that this was an early access game and it was a W.I.P. me and my friends expected these bugs. We played this game thinking it would only get better and we would love it. That is clearly what is not happening. It's been almost a year since they released their early access game. Has much changed in terms of connectivity gameplay mechanics and optimization? Yes. But let me say not all of them are in a good way. I'll start with the good things. The optimization has gotten fairly better I achieved a decent 60 70 frames pre release and 100 110 post release on my 1060 on medium settings. However the connectivity has gotten worse. Early access I would maybe lag out once every couple days while my friend for the other part lagged out once every 10ish games (We got through maybe 40 games per session yeah we have no life.... we both got 400 hours in 2 months... even while playing other games). But it wasn't to a point where it's intolerable. Now I lag out once every 4 or 5 games while he sometimes can not even load into the game. The point is the latency issues have worsened. The same can be said for gameplay mechanics. The hit registration and driving mechanics are just plainly put horrible. From personal experience I have rage quitted from headshotting people with level 1 2 or even no helmet with a kar98 and they survive. The driving mechanics are just as bad. Driving along the road could get you killed now. Sometimes just out of nowhere you will flip your vehichle and send you flying into the air and landing in an explosion. Instead of fixing all these issues you know what PUBG decides to do? Put in more crates put in an ""event pass"" which is a straight copy from the battle pass. Which makes absolutely NO sense. They're sueing Fortnite for copying them while they go and do this? I don't understand Bluehole right now. I absolutely loved PUBG at one point. I hope they realize what they're doing is going to hurt them in the long run and focus on actually fixing the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The only thing they fix is shooting through the fences. I'm sorry to say but this game is not finished. It should be still Alpha. They only lied to the consumers that it is completed because they wanted sells on December on for multiple consoles. Even though i appreciate of the making of this game but I'm going to have to thumb it down now the game is not finished. It's still Alpha and they need to let the consumers know.Old review ( Jan 2017) Still a great game. They just ban 1.5 million hackers. Which that is really great but they still got hackers every once game out of 20 games. New map is okay..... it's buggy and you can't shoot through the fences. Hopfully they will patch it soon..... and also adding the climbing skills made this game even better but some odd reason they removed the weather effect map's from the original map. I feel like this game should be published as ""Alpha"" and not fully released. I will say wait for it on sell or you wanna show the developers some love get it.Old review ( Dec 2017) Great game only problem hackers and the game is still being develop because of funds I assume.

2017-05-31,0,0,921,True,Recommended,I love this game. It has its problems but to me the pros outweigh the cons and the developers seem to be passionate about fixing the problems. I have a pretty good conputer and don't have issues with FPS. My only annoyance is the server lag (sometimes). Some games I get in and takes like 2 seconds to open a door. This game definitely is an adrenalin rush though. Can also be very frustrating at times. A lot of the frustration comes mostly from me being new to PC and will occasionally do stuff like hit R to reload instead of E to switch my over the shoulder view that has gotten me killed numerous times. Overall good game that I recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,479,True,Recommended,I haven't played too many hours in this game just like majority if not all early access games its got its issues to do some bugs and some t moments. However i can see that there are updates every month which to me it looks like the devs want to continue making the game better.Now the recent micro transaction seems to be a problem to many. They have released creates that need keys to open i can see the worry behind it as H1Z1 seems to fcked up their game cause of it but the devs have said that the money raised through the creates and keys will go towards events etc. Which in my opinion is a good idea.I personally dont care about the current micro transation as it is only clothing that can be obtained however i would not like to see this game having strange fcked up skins for guns that glow.In the end i would recommend this game i find it fun and i feel like with the constant updates you are unlikely to get burned out.But thats just my opinion agree or disagree with my thats your call.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,88,True,Recommended,Game is a lot of fun even in early access in all 3 modes (Solo Duo Squads) Addicting in my opinion. The recent update with microtransaction is a non issue. I don't care about mircrotransactions as they do not affect gameplay in the slightest.I'll keep playing this and will be purchasing it on the Xbox to play with other friends. Based on the forums they have some ideas on gameplay elements to add and other features that seem promising.Looking forward to the progression of this game as it comes out for full release sometime in the near future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-03,0,0,280,True,Not Recommended,The game itself although buggy can be fun.The developer has made some really shaddy decisions lately and if I could get a refund I would.Selling cosmetic items in early alpha / beta even though they said they wouldn't is one thing. It's just a lie or a broken promisse. What's scary is their stance on bending over for twitch / streamers. They can ban you (and have done so) based on a report made by a popular enough streamer. All it takes is for the streamer to tell his viewers to report you and you're gone (it's nearly impossible to prove stream sniping so developer resonose on submiting proof before a ban is yet another lie).No other developer EA BLizzard not even LoL has that stance.

It seems every thing we complain about in the game seems to get a patch fix every few weeks. There will be little things we wish were there or not there ... and poof ___an update starts ___ bam!! half of our complaints gone ... these guys are listening to thier audience and are doing a great job!!______________________________________________________Original Post This game is solid ... most pre access games leave me in terribley buggy situations. This game in general is very stable and very playable! The feel is like DayZ but with a much faster constant combat playstyle. The controls are easy and smooth and combat is very satisfying. People are saying framerates are low and unoptimaized what people are complaing about I can relate to (mildly) I have a GTX 1060 im running the game 55 70 fps on ultra where as my little brother is running this on a old CPU and gtx 1050 and still gets 55 70 fps on medium to high. Sure its not running 120fps like my other games do but this is what you get for a 30$ game made by an unknown company in early access.Pro's Play solo duo or squads of 4 no pay to win mechanics fast paced strategic minor customization!Con's/ Things that need fixing Grenades are clunky and take way too long to utilize in most situations especially for thier low aoe damage when playing in duo/squad helping kill other players with your team gives little to no assistance points Overall I am very pleased with where the game is at right now. Just a little bit of cleanup and polishing and I think its in a good place!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,19,True,Recommended,very fun/addictive gameplay lack of a quick requeue option at this time can make death sometimes frustrating. But matchmaking is pretty fast.This is still early developement and there are various performance issues affecting lots of users. Personally i find myself having to wait a while (up to a few minutes) after first dropping into an area or after a burst of fast travel particularly as of the latest patch not doing so means lots of brief stutters in gameplay interupting otherwise smooth fps. However optimisations are ongoing and devs seem to maintain good contact with their playerbase so this doesn't affect my review much to be expected in the early days.Do buy this if you want a well populated shooter with solid core mechanics (gunplay movement and looting mechanics are well implemented thus far). Don't buy this if you want release quality performance with a GTX 980 i7 6700k 24gb ram and on an SSD I only consider the game playable after the first few minutes loading time and this is only with graphical settings relatively low (very low or low except view distance which is on high)Hope to see vastly improved performance before release with that exception I'm pretty happy with this $30usd purchase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For people who complain about the ""skins"" which you can buy they aren't mandatory h*ll almost none of my friends buy them and even I don't. So if you are going to knock this game because of the micro transactions maybe you should learn how to spend your money better. As for streamers being all powerful? I can't say for positive if that's true or not. But overall I would rate this game at least and 8/10 there are some bug issues in the game but they are constantly working on fixing them when they get reported.

Other than that I see a very bright future for this game and would certainly reccommend even at it's current state.Pros Smooth movement Graphics are georgous Gun mechanics are realistic Easy to pick up control scheme at least for someone exposed to PVP games Have had a 90% positive experience with the communityCons The audio is sometimes misleading Random frame drops (I usually have 60 90 sometimes it drops to the 30's) Occassional lag and you don't get to choose your server You won't get much sleep because you're still playing this game ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Good game (so far) horrible developers.They've also stated that in the full release of the game free cosmetics are going away completely even the free crates that are already implemented and will be replaced with crates that need keys that you can purchase for $2.50 (single use).

I have played it for 4 days now and even though I am not as good as those who have been playing for a while I have been able to win 2 times. I have read many other reviews and have read about many people getting banned from forums for speaking their minds and even the game itself for breaking the no stream sniping rule. I will continue to support this game until I am banned for stream sniping as getting banned for this without proof seems to be a common thing. If I am banned for that then I will most likey update my review but so far I love the game and I am excited to see where they take the game.

Pathetic. One of the worst sounds ive experienced in a shooter game. And im talking about the direction you get shot from to where people are moving its the worst ive seen a dude two houses away from you on the second floor sounds exactly the same as a guy on the same floor in your house. Someone shooting at you DIRECTLY from infront of you can and often sounds like its coming from behind or side or quite literally from the sky its just that bad its the worst of the worst in any fps ive played the last 10 years. Shooting is kind of precise so thats actually sort of well done good for you. Kind of fun with friends absolute trash alone. Better with beer.

The new map is complete t with broken mechanics unfindable door t unbalanced weapons and no care put into graphic design while my computer has to work fulltime to render it all. there is 0 optimisation whatsoever. im really considering to uninstall until this game goes off of the money hungering path the developers have taken.Obviously this game needs a lot of patching and developing. In my experience this game almost runs on your harddrive alone. it was spinning full speed and nothin in the game was loading. if you wanne be able to play this with decent FPS buy an ssd or you'll be having a bad time. furthermore as you probably read in all the other reviews there's alot of streamers that report and ban paople without reason and there have been a bunch of hackers lately.

Shooting is made realistic and fun and the 3 level gear system adds to the overall experience. Suprisingly looting is not a boring process allowing a player to get prepared for the upcoming firefights.

2017-08-25,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Its a fun game but you spend most of your time walking around getting gear to only get killed 10minutes later without even shooting your gun.... Played four hours so far and I was only able to shoot at 3 people other times I don't even see who killed me. I've only played squads so in solos its probably 5x as worse there. And theres only 1 map so it gets very repetitive or you drop near the edge of the map to realize the zone is on the other side and you can't find any vechicles. If you have a friend it probably will be a better experiance but when I hop in with a random squad most of the time only one of them has a mic.

2018-03-02,0,0,325,False,Recommended,I love this game so of course I will recommend it. With that being said I've been a gamer my whole life and I have some opinions/Ideas. First a slight increase in BP won. I play a lot and generally do very well but it takes forever to earn it. Second if we're going for realism (and I know this won't happen) but bullet penetration would be a big plus in my eyes. Third MORE GUNS!! Lol I feel so limitied and it gets boring after a while seeing the same thing over and over weapon wise. I have a bunch of other ideas so Ill edit this over time with more. AMAZING GAME &lt 3 KEEP UP THE HARDWORK AND DEVELOPMENT!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-26,0,0,335,True,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is currently my all time favorite survival shooter game. Now it is in early access so there's still a ton of bugs to fix. On my PC the first few games once I load in I have issues loading textures e.g. buildings. Which is irritating but that could be my computer. So I suggest having a rig that can handle this game because it's graphically demanding. Game crashes every once in a while but the game makes up by being a lot of fun. Crazy things do happen and every game is different which is why it is so unique. I suggest the developers try to optimize this game before adding any other features so everyone has a fair shot at winning.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,433,False,Not Recommended,While this game began as first of its kind and held a lot of promise it has unfortunately become a cash cow for those in charge.

2018-06-22,0,0,548,False,Not Recommended,I haven't played this game for a while now about 2 months to be clear. When I played it today I've been greeted with enormous sized mini map which took about 1/4 of my screen. Constant fps drops on 1080ti rig. Laughable recoil system which makes the gun in your hands act like your character has an epileptic seizure. The reality of this game is that if u shoot any number of bullets higher than 3 shot bursts u wouldn't hit a stationary target on 10m range since recoil system in this marvelous game is random. This and numerous netcode/ping related issues make this game a pure 'masterpiece'. Even joining the game is painful u are greeted with stutters opening the main menu and the loading screen. Seriously this game makes my head itch after just 5 minutes of starting it. Don't get me wrong previous version of the game had the same issues and I've enjoyed it a lot to be fair it was expected from the early access game. The implementation of in game transactions and constant flow of updates which include maps and new guns without the major bug fixes are killing its player base.Edit WTH is wrong with the sounds even after setting it on max it didnt' change in decibel.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,365,True,Not Recommended,It was a good game for the first couple of months. But there are some major problems with the game after a long time of the 'Updates' that they have rolled out.1. Hackers are still abusing the game and runing the fun. Simple wall hacks and aimbots are being used to destory the game and those people gain money from hacking the game from this way.2. Updates. After all of the updates the game has had PlayerUnknowns has lost its most important concepts and also destroyed its origionality. These updates sure have made the game looked better but by doing this makes the game somewhat unplayeable in most circumstances.3. Viariety. There is no other alternatives in the game. Yes they are releasing a desert map but other than that what else is there? Same old weapons same old map same old game type. No diffrence.4. Logic. There seems to be none of this. Driving your car through a flat and open field suddenly lose half your health due to a small lip in the ground which could make no diffrence but sends your car up in the air and explodes on impact. Really?Im not ultimatly slamming this game and or attempting to destory its integrity but it is a very boring game after a long time of playing the same thing over and over again. It does have some good qualities on the other hand.1. Unique. This is a one of a kind styled game when it came out and has some very well done parts in the game. The area is detailed greatly and the weapons made and calculated in a really good mannor.2. flexibility. It is great for multiple ways to play and land with friends. Many options are made and the assortments of challenges that you can do with friends is immense.Although it is a fun game i would not reccomend buying it until the programmers have fixed the issues with minor details that can flip people of and fix the reporting system as many hackers are out there and in lobbies destroying the integrity of the game. PlayerUnkowns BattleGrounds is virtually unplayable with the immense amount of hackers that exist in the game and they will ruin the fun that you could be having.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-08,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Pubg you've probably heard all about it and you should be hearing about it. This game is FUN on lots of people complain about optimization but I have no trouble my pc is on the cheaper side but I can run 1080p high settings 60fps smoothly in the normal game (unless there's network lag). In the test servers its not nearly as clean rubberbanding is common at the beggining of each match and the game crashes once or twice every five hours HOWEVER the desert map is fantastic and a blast to play and explore. I would say playing it with a friend is what really makes the experience worth it so try to squad up with people you know but if you can't the randos aren't awful and the community is less cancerous than most.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It controls like a wet sponge sluggish and barely responsive. It's ugly as sin. I spend more time sitting in lobbies waiting for games to start than I do playing the actual game.

2017-08-27,0,0,383,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a great game the most fun I've had in years on a certain game. There are a few set backs though (as expected it is an early access game) but there are even more pros to getting this game.The servers at the moment are terrible I gotta be honest with the ones wondering if they're going to buy the game or not.It isn't the best optimized game but has gotten better over the past couple of patches.The amount of fun you get from playing this game is unreal it can also be really emotional as well. The sudden gun fights will put you on edge. The adrenaline when you're in the top 10. The happiness when you get greeted with that Winner Winner Chicken Dinner! Or the anger/sadness when you're the one being killed in the last 2 remaining.The graphics are really good for this game but do take a beefy computer to run them.Overall this is an amazing game and I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to buy the game and are unsure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The optimization was abysmal for the longest time but I tried it recently it's been fixed. However unfortunately it's the same gameplay you'd expect from a battle royale.I can see why it's popular though... If you manage to get a good position find some good gear and have a competent team you can absolutely ROAST other players. Usually you just shoot them and they can't even fight back. But that happens so infrequently that usually you're just chasing the dragon.Finally after sometimes hiding 15 20 minutes in the same spot with no action the radiation circle moves in and you have to move closer to the center where one of two things will happen 1) you will be killed and never know where you were shot from2) nothing at all...The game has varied gun types scopes magazine and other attachments frying pans (for some reason?) grenades vehicles and different graded gear.

2017-08-27,0,0,433,True,Recommended,Very good game. I have been playing this game since the first couple months it came out for early access. It was good at the start and has only gotten better since. The addition of the First person only mode added a new level of difficulty to master but it has also made the game more fair for players who do not like to play in third person mode. Developers are constantly fixing the bugs as they arise usally providing quick patches every week I also like that they keep adding new weapons and other content to the game.

Googled around and found a fix which included changing my GPU settings alongside with turning off anti aliasing and post processing. Unfortunately this is unacceptable for me can live with some bugs but game was unplayeble until i fiddled with things i should not be forced to fiddle with.

2017-12-25,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Durring its development phases this game was a bit glitchy and very laggy with poor optimization. Now that it has been fully released within one update almost all of my problems vanished. I wasn't experiencing a huge ammount of lag or fram drops though a few times it did crash but not for long. I gotta say I am not a huge player of Battle Royale games but man let me tell you this is one hell of a fun game if you don't play like a wuss. Though that is a draw back to this game if you want to have fun you probably aren't going to win very much. though if you want to win you probably won't have much fun unless you like to hide around for 15 minutes waiting for something to happen.

Usually within 2 days max they clear these stuff from their servers.Also despite they had a huge success and had a lot of sales a lot of new content is on the horizon I am looking forward to which means they takeing care about the game.Glitches are getting fixed continously. This is important as some people seem to overreact this part on their reviews and not taking into consideration that the game is early access.Overall it is a great game with great experience.

2017-12-26,0,0,1003,False,Not Recommended,Has promise but until Brendan Greene gets his finger and wallet out of his and focuses on improving performance the game will soon die once a better funded more experienced studio gets to grips with the genre. Pure lag for the first 60 seconds of a game makes the initial fights which should be most fun and exiciting utter pot luck. Not even close to being ready for official release yet they ported to Xbox just in time for Xmas funny that isn't it.

2018-01-08,0,0,1214,False,Not Recommended,I was hesitant to buy this game 3 months ago but quickly fell in love with it. There are tons of great concepts about this game and with each patch it gets improved. Even the short amount of time ive been playing its night and day to how to the game preforms since when I first started. It has a very steep learning curve and is extremely hard in the begining. No aim assist each gun performs different love the ability to have different play styles (rambo or more strategic) finally getting your first chicken dinner is an amazing feeling. Watching yourself improve throughout the weeks feels awesome. Yes it still has a lot of tweaking to do as it has its glitches and annoyingly loud bombs every 5 secs but its just an awesome game with so much room for improvement still. Over the last 2 weeks my love for this game has ended its just not playable anymore. Tonight after about an 6 hour session ive finally had enough. The game is just full of hackers now. over the last 2 4 weeks ive seen suspicious shots on me that i brushed off as luck or crazy skill. getting headshot from 2 400 meters away by an AR that was shooting at fully auto. It happened a couple times but tyically not more than once a night. I shrugged it off and kept grinding. The last 2 nights of playing tonight specifically it has gone from the occasional macro abuser to just blantant hacking. getting shot by people through walls through trees i mean they arnt even pretending anymore. The game allows replays it has deathcams it shows them just standing in building and auto fireing through the wall then bam player has killed me with a headshot. 99% of these hackers and macro recoil users all have chinese names too. its not a coincidence. The asian invasion on NA servers are just too much especially if most of them are hacking. out of the 6 hours i put in tonight about 20 games total. I was wall hacked by 6 people. auto macro'd another 7 times. I have all the recordings. Its absolutely ridiculous to play this game anymore. hackers will always find a way but when its to this extreme where literally 4 5 players in each game are hacking its just no good.

Unplayable performance and the jungle seems more like a cartoon. The colours are literally utter Every green colour looks like it was made with neon green spraycans which makes enemy spotting almost impossible.As i see it BlueHole was like "" Well we get so much hate for popping out so many lootboxes how about we make a map to shut them all up?

I apparently cannot find reason to put this game down despite enjoying other games right now I all ways find myself throwing at least one session into PUBG yet I simply cannot recommend this game right now. If you are craving a battlegrounds game then yes this game will scratch that itch and then some. But currently this game has let me down too many times and has disapointed beyond belief at times that to say ""Yes i recommend you buy this' would be a p*ss take imo.It has it's fun moments.

2018-02-04,0,0,266,False,Not Recommended,Very fun to play especially with friends. That's what i said when i buyed it but many things have changed. The developers now only care about money they introduced a ton of crates that can only be opened with keys and also these crates have the highest chance of dropping. To make the matters worse if before a key could've open every type of crate now there are 3 types of keys and with the same price 2.5 euros. Also the game is going to worse because the game still even after almost a year out of early access it isn't optimized. BLUEHOLE FIX YOUR DAMN GAME AND AFTER THAT I'LL CONSIDER GIVING YOU MONEY TO BUY SKINS. They also have put a new map SAHNKOK and at least in my opinion it is a very bad map it also quite resembles the FORTNITE map. And don't get me started about the ing lag on the new map. The game was better with only those 2 maps it had before MIRAMAR and ERANGEL 2 maps that were preety stable and now with the new map the game feels again like in early access. I really hope that the devs will pull their toghether cause i like this game more than i like other BR games but i am afraid that this game will die and all the money and progress me amd other players will vanish only because BLUEHOLE is in my perspective AN INCOMPETENT COMPANY THAT S IN FOR THE MONEY INSTEAD OF DOING THIS LET OTHER COMPANIES TAKE OVER YOU INCOMPETENT PIECES OF,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-12,0,0,41,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. It has great graphics it's fast paced gameplay(if you land in populated areas) as well as fun to play with friends.But there are a few downsides the game is quite glitchy which makes for frustrating deaths. Ex. you think you're in cover but than it glitches/lags and moves you out of it. I know it's still EA but its quite annoying dying like that in top 10 20.The game needs to be improved some what in closed range combat as well shots that should be hitting don't even at point blank range. Even if you have a shotgun it really doesnt matter usually the first to land the first shot wins.Other than minor things like glitches and close range combat the game is amazing. I enjoy it even with those frustrating deaths I would highly recommend the game to anyone.Anyways have fun and I'll cya in the BATTLEGROUNDS!

2017-08-12,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,"The gameplay can be solid for sure. The drive to finally win a game is quite compelling to be honest. It took me around 40 hours to finally win a game. After that though I still haven't played a single game. It just felt like after trying for so long and finally winning you lose some of the motivation to keep playing. I had high hopes for this game but seeing that now they plan to remove any way of aquiring cosmetics for free upon full release is absurd. I understand if there is one crate that costs money to support a tournament or whatever but at the same time there should be multiple free alternatives to spend in game currency on. I would absolutely hate to see this game go in the direction of CSGO (a game that has a ""loot"" system that I absolutely despise). With only 1 actual gamemode currently there won't be any feeling of ""progress"" or ""reward"" for your time investment if you can't obtain any cosmetic items without spending real $$$.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There was no better rush than being one last few survivors trying to pick each other off as the blue zone closed in around you. Sadly PUBG has chosen to stagnate with poor optimization terrible servers infuriating bugs and hackers galore. Instead of addressing these issues the devs have decided to cash in with lootboxes and keys and finally the moldy cherry on top of the sundae Bluehole's delusion that they own the battle royale genre and litigious tendencies towards anyone who violates their 'copyright' are disgusting.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-10,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,It showed potential in early access to be one of the best battle royale games. Now unless they optimize the game and fix the reacurring problems (hackers bugs directional sound issues etc) then save your money for now. It's not a bad game but as of right now I wouldn't even justify the 30$ price tag until they fix their for once. They are happy to sell cosmetics but ignore that base core of the game is broken and problematic the battle royale part.It's a solid shooter but from the RNG places where the guns will spawn resulting you in getting shot by a person that simply killed you because they had a better landing. While a highly technical shooter that requires a lot of skill to be good at there are parts of the game where it feels like you have been cheated and it has felt this way since early access. If you're thinking about getting this game hold off until they actually fix the core of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My previous review was positive and so will this review. Since the latest update cheating has been at an all time low but chinese still have yet to be region locked. Which is sad those are the most toxic players in the world and it seems kinda agenda pushing to force us to play with human beings because this is a ""united world"" and that ""were all racist"" according to Brenden Greene the who is bending over for Tencent.Hopefully one day they wake up and actually take steps to protect us from these disgusting selfish lesser than human beings that infest our servers. If one group of people make up more than 90% of the cheaters than I have every right to say what i'm saying. the Chinese it is not racist it is a fact.This issue may never be fixed considering Brenden Greene is the same guy who started crying when DrDisrespect joked about jump kicking him.

Pros 1) Long sometimes stressful gunfights2) Multiple weapons + many attachments and random drops3) Teammates are generally reliable and responsive4) Realistic aiming + bullet drop5) Decent graphicsCons 1) Servers disconnect often and lagging + glitches still occur on initial parachute jump. (Started several matches stuck 1 000 feet in the air and I had to fall to my death each time...)2) The game auto starts you connected to AU or EU servers instead of A) The region you play in most or B) The region you reside in.3) Occasional hackers take the fun out of gameplay.4) The blue zone moves a tad too fast especially if you're far out. (Constant movement is key!!)5) ADS system is wonky and difficult to pinpoint a target and due to realistic bullet drop and gun physics it makes long range sniping near impossible without an incredibly steady hand.Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Overall ...

2017-08-12,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I bought PU's Battlegrounds today after hearing about a lot of the hype around the game and watching streamers play the game so I decided to check it out since I've always been a fan of shooters. Going in I knew that there was a survivalist aspect to the game but I don't think I completely understood that survivalist effect on the gameplay. In the few matches I played I would often times run forever to the play area spend most of my time picking up items see small bursts of combat to get maybe 2 or 3 kills and then get killed myself and have to start all over. I understand that this is just personal preference but if you're a fan of shooters it doesn't mean you'll necessarily be a fan of PU's Battlegrounds.Also I like to play my shooters with an Xbox One controller (I know I know M + K vs gamepad but I do fine with a gamepad) and I found that this game didn't really work well with controllers. Even when I could figure out the key mappings for my controller in the Steam gamepad configurations it still was not excellent.Maybe I haven't played enough of the game but I requested a refund because I just don't enjoy the survivalist aspect of the game. I enjoy shooters in general but just not this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-18,0,0,520,False,Not Recommended,"Rating is now Negative due to various reasons which I may eventually outline but honestly I probably won't because I really don't want to spend any more effort on this game anymore.Old (Positive) review below (January 2018) It's been a little while since I first posted my review and some things have changed. First off the game ""released"" in December. While there's still very legitimate arguments to the game not being ready for it's 1.0 release I believe it's quite close to feature complete. There's still bugs to iron out more optimization to be done and only 2 maps (made even less by the removal of the weather effects) but the underlying systems are functionally complete enough for me to argue for this game's status as 1.0.On the topic of optimization GREAT strides have been made since my last review. The 1.0 update brought with it months of optimizations which immediately boosted me to triple digit framerates in some parts of the maps and usually a steady 60 even in the most trying locations. With a Pentium G4560 Dual Core CPU and a GeForce 960 that's as good as I can hope for in a newer game.The hackers which I previously said was what hinged my decision on recommended/not recommended have been significantly reduced since I made my original review. Don't let this fool you completely there are still hackers. But I only get maybe a couple per week as opposed to the one every match back during the time of my original review. I still feel that it's a bit too high for my liking but it's definitely made great strides. The upcoming ping lock that they are planning on introducing should offer another large burst of hackers disappearing at least for NA/EU considering that many of the hackers were located in Asia usually belonging to crate farmers looking to farm BP from wins to get the lucky expensive item drops. There are still NA/EU hackers but they are a minority I feel.The ping lock is also nice because of it's primary function as well removing large ping differences between players. Extremely high pings can be very detrimental to the player who has said high ping but they can also affect other players' ability to take down that person which results in you getting shot around a corner you ran around 5 seconds ago or your own shots not registering on them resulting in them having extra time to take you down.As for the servers they definitely increased the capacity in order to handle the numbers they're now reaching (which has recently hit 3 million concurrent users nearly a million more than at the time of my old review and around 2 million more than the old servers could handle). There's far less connection drops and all around lag though the first minute or two of matches still often have delayed item pickup times which can be frustrating at best and deadly at worst.I think overall the game is still incredibly rough around the edges and could perhaps use a little more in the way of different maps or different environments on the current maps and needs networking improvements but overall it's in far better shape than it was previously and is currently highly playable. My current review stands at Recommended but I still say that with caution.Old review (October 18 2017) PREFACE The game is fantastic and I absolutely recommend it. It is the best Battle Royale on the market as far as the actual game goes. HOWEVER It has huge problems.First off The servers were not designed to handle over 1 million people. Which would be fine if we hadn't broken 2 million recently. The servers are hot garbage and the game severely suffers from that alone.Next up the main menu party system and general working ness of the game gets worse with every update. I don't know how but every patch they release makes the main menu more buggy and fail often requiring constant refreshing of the main menu (That that's an option at all already says things both good and bad) and making even getting into a game a complete hassle. Sounds are also extremely bad. Vehicles make no noise sometimes but other times run full volume while idling. In fact vehicles are just a host of new problems all on their own as they have difficulty navigating the map their one true purpose without hitting invisible walls and bad geometry ending up with you dead or vulnerable.But the biggest problem by far are the loot boxes. The funny thing is they're actually very consumer friendly so much so that they're actually too consumer friendly. Because of the ability to earn loot crates through simple playing of the game the fact that you earn more points by winning and getting more kills the fact that you can open said crates for free and the recent killing of AFK farming all combines to mean that there is a massive abundance of hackers all abusing various hacks to win games and earn a ton of points all for the purpose of loot crate farming for real world money. It doesn't help that it seems like hackers rarely get banned.The game is fantastic and I probably won't stop playing it for a long time (unless it somehow gets even more broken) but the servers severe bugs and massive hacker issues mean that it's rarely an enjoyable experience for long.This review will change to positive when at least the hackers are addressed even if the other two issues are still present as the hackers are by far the largest issue.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For the Beta PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS would definitely have to be a meh but I miss some of the old issues but for the game that is now after the 1.0#2 PC launch it's definitely a thumbs up now 1.0 was very laggy and the #2 update solved most of these issues. Framerate (fixed depends on what settings) Lag /Update 2 (Doesn't seem to be an issue now) Graphics (improved) Optimized map (terrain texture sea world effects UI elements) Decreased terrain loading time (Some issues with the Distance view still) Redesigned lobby background (it looks far better than before in my opinion but could do with an off option) Your last 20 matches can be saved and viewed from every angle you want (On update #2 can report hackers with out going to the forums) The second map its added (Miramar) with also 2 weather types (clear &amp sunrise but they have removed mist!) Vaulting it's added officialy and it feels really smooth (one of the most important steps still some glitches.) Off road driving is alot different (Now!) from on road driving which adds a more realistic feeling to the game and means roads are useful. Deathcam feature (Again great for getting the hackers!) More weapon balance/damage balance with the VSS welll.... Still yeah... Projectiles fired from firearms are affected by air drag and bullets now penetrate water (Best weapon is a pistol!) Improved mini map (First I hated and has grown on me along with squad directions! WOW!) Redesigned HUD (New #3 will make it even better!) and many more features coming and in the works like a SNOW map! I hope they add all new guns for that map only!. With the 1.0/#2 update this game is worth the money and will give you hours of fun with friend! (Ohhh Bullet proof pan also!).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That is ok though Daybreak needed a kick in the because H1Z1 is literally a hellhole now. Brendan Greene returns to the BR scene with this title that literally has more players than the 3 games below it in steam charts COMBINED(per time of this review being written). Granted I will cut reigning lords of Steam Charts CSGO and Dota 2 some slack where slack is needed. The majority of this playerbase is of course CHINESE. Gameplay First off you spawn in kind of a lobby waiting area both are different depending if you get Miramar or whatever the hell they call the Russian map these days. Old lobby has guns new does not but whatever that isn't a big deal considering you are only in the lobby for minutes at a time.Next you are spawned into the plane where only 1 side of your headset is activated through VOIP and you either hear A REALLY LOUD Chinese who are in internet cafes B People playing their music over their mic or C North Americans retaliating against the Chinese Insurgence using profanity and racial slurs all the live long while.After losing hearing in 1 ear you may choose a place to land you either drop somewhere where there is absolutely nobody and no loot or you drop somewhere where loot IS and hope you come out on top in that area against 10+ other players. You will die no doubt unless you have 50+ hours in the game. If you somehow make it to the top 10 congratulations because you will die anyways because when it comes to final 10 EVERYONE just lays down in the grass and waits for someone else to screw up good luck. You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain or in PUBG's case die anyways to a Chinese more than probable hacker Pros and Cons Pros Probably the best BR game on the market as of right now 1.0 makes the game not feel like a clunky desyncy or just unpolished. Friendly UI now thanks to 1.0 1.0 literally SAVED this game Nice weapon modding system and OK inventory UI Gameplay is really intense especially with friends.Cons No region lock Hackers are becoming a HUGE problem 1.5 million or so accounts banned as I write this Game feels unpolished to some extent Miramar is literally running and waiting simulator No option to change name Microtransactions showing its ugly face in this now Takes hard work and determination to get to top 10 and not die Learning curve is a bit steep but do a ble Bluehole tried to sue Epic Games for ""copying their idea"" bluehole actually shut the up pleaseIn my closure PUBG has made me racist against the Chinese thanks Brendan.

2017-06-04,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,"TL DRI'm not saying that PUBG is a bad game I don't think it is. However at the moment there are so many ""features which would work really well if the game was finished"" that I think it's time to address this as a warning to anyone who's willing to chip in for the EA. I originally gave this game a positive review under the condition that you bear in mind the downsides of early access and the fact that the whole concept is very frustrating. I changed my mind since lately the game seems to be running worse in some aspects.For one if you're not running this on an SSD it's outright unplayble. The huge map comes at a big loading cost and well if you're unlucky the match will start 5 10 mins before you finished loading. If you happen to get loaded any earlier you still get ed over because the buildings are not rendered properly so you may not enter so your better rigged opponents get about a 30 second head start so you get shot by those opponents after those 30 seconds. You can also get the holy grail in this which is not even the basic building placeholders render in which case you are guaranteed xray vision and bullets. This is just something you should know before buying in.Another story is sometimes not rendering said opponents. I have vast experience with flying into places with no other parachutes visible for at least 500 meters and getting shot by someone just seconds after landing. This can technically be mitigated by spawning in less populated (less loot rich) areas which in the long run is more frustrating than joining the meatgrinder because then you don't even get to shoot at anyone for the most of the game.Speaking of shooting there has been an extensive research done by player base on the weapon damage TTK and armor effectivity which you can learn from and utilize to your tactical advantage. This all goes down the drain in practice because the game often doesn't register the armor you're wearing or inversely the hits you land. I've seen blood splats coming out of my body even though no damage was taken. People kill guys with headshots and then take their level 3 helmets in pristine condition. There have been discussions about client side bullet trajectory calculation and I think it's currently the biggest open wound this game has.Another thing to consider is the sound design. There are people reporting they feel like they're cheating with a 7.1 headset for knowing exactly where enemies are based literally on footsteps and there are also guys (myself included) who have to turn 7.1 off because it's more confusing than helping. In flight simulators I can find a bomber hidden in clouds solely based on sound. Here I can't tell if a car is driving in front of me or behind me. Sometimes I get shot from the opposite direction than which the sound is coming from. (this actually seems much better now)On the acceptable end of the EA spectrum are bulletproof railing gaps wooden window bars and glitch stuck holes. Forgivable for gameplay once you get used to it. What's also forgivable but much more frustrating is the inability to peek over cover rendering most windows useless as a firing position. The absence of usable cover is complemented by the fact that there is essentially zero loss of weapon control/accuracy and player movement speed while sidestepping during ADS. This leads to close medium range encounters looking like a silly Quake match and not a tactical shooter. Only combat mechanic which particularly succeeds in this field is long range encounter which you will more often than not enjoy from the view of the sniped party since you are more likely to find oil than a decent scope...",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-25,0,0,79,False,Recommended,It's hugely popular and for many reasons. Most deserving of note is that the developers are capable of improving the game they really turned the game performance around close to launch (this might be due to the engine makers and not the game devs) and doubled the games content by adding a new map with its own vehicles and weapons. Similarly they added a custom vaulting system which works great and was an undeniable upgrade to the games flow. Outside of the improvements the game had a winning formula from the start. Rather than a shooter where you're in a little arena and death only matters to a scoreboard your life is precious and you don't have anything to defend yourself with as you are thrown from a plane. The play space is so large that scopes are game changers if you have one you can confidently kill at a distance if you don't have a scope you have to play sneakier or just be an aim wizard. Equipment matters sometimes good loot falls into your lap and sometimes you have to take down larger prey to pry it from their cold dead hands. No matter how you get it it feels good to have it I started as nothing and now I am a verified killing machine and that chicken dinner is gonna be mine.Where you decide to drop determines the pace of the match. Go to a popular area and you are gonna be in a slug fest that 90% of people die in. Go sailing off to the far reaches of the world and you won't see a soul for the first 20 minutes and the first you see will be fully kitted and no chump.There's also the confusing elements called luck and game sense and I can't tell the difference between them atleast in my gameplay. Some games I get 6 kills and win and it's because every enemy i ever shot was in their back because I just so happened to walk up behind every single one of them. Some games I shot in the head from an enemy I never knew existed. Some games you walk into 5 different firefights and you get a new level of ptsd from each one and then the god of war is the final boss and you lose all faith in your skill.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-26,0,0,378,True,Not Recommended,update i friggin love this game but the dev's are being to brutal. theres bugs theres lag theres toxic players running around trolling and slinging racist slurs. fine ill put up with all that but im done with the brutal crap the devs put in the game because they think its funny or something. jump punches gotta go. what a nightmare. happens very rare but still we dont need this crap a punch is a punch no matter if you jump. let the players duke it out like men and women. People rarely go down in one punch and if they do its luck. Sure there is a lot of one punch youtube videos but thats luck. Its so annoying getting in a fist fight with some one and they jump up punch take your entire health bar to zero. yeah no. k. whats with the invisable bumps on motorcycles causeing falling damage. I could understand wrecking and being severly hurt but nope instant death player died from falling damage but I can jump off 3 story builds no problem. I literally just hit an invisable bump and died on the faintest slope of a hill wearing a level 3 helmet. I know the helmet means nothing while driving its just ironic. come on guys i know its the ultimate life and death game and all that but give us a break give us a chance. the majority of us in real life can survive 40 mile and hour motorcycle crashes on dirt and take a punch to the face with out dying. So make it realistic. thanks. yes im salty. fix it please. i have an awesome idea for this game that would be so much fun and easy to implement into reality. 50 vs 50 battleeveryone starts with m16 60 rounds?teams would have to be different colors?control points / or flags spawn if game doesnt end in a certain amount of time? not nessecary but a flag would be fun.do we jump from plane still or spawn together? both would be cool plane would be easier for the devs im sure.get this idea out there! itd be so fun right?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-06,0,0,860,False,Not Recommended,I gave this game a fair chance. I really did. At one point the game was really playable really good and really fun. At 800+ hours and 170 wins i have given this game a solid run and i feel im qualified to say its just a dissapointment that is slowly devolving into a cash grab.1.) Hackers. Since the inception of this game there has been a non stop plague of hackers from speedhackers wallhackers and aimbots after a year between beta and full release they are unable to stop this. Why is it that every other massive online game such as dota 2 CSGO WOW Runescape has managed to eradicate hackers almost completely but this game company simply just cant? PROTIP Its because preventing hackers earns them less money than banning them and letting them buy the game again.2.) Garbage netcode garbage servers and garbage internet integration in general. Since day one the game has been plagued by server issues servers disconnecting half the server for no reason planes force dropping all 100 players at once. Hit registration is notorious trash in this game ive shot at people standing completely still with 0% chance to miss at all and missed meanwhile ive shot at people who i KNEW i was missing when i shot at them and still somehow hit them. Ive seen people with no helmet get shot in the head with an AK and live with the bullet blood hitmarker directly on their eyeball (i have a screenshot of this). Looting still hasnt been fixed after a year of this game being out. Some games you can land and instantly pick items up while some games you can stand on an item and press f inventory drag or inventory right click and still cant pick the item up after 10+ looting animations. Theres also a bug that makes you parachute vector off in a completely different direction than where you are leaning like some giant hand grabbed you from behind and sucked you into the distance.3.) Awful gameplay. Around november of last year this game was at its peak. The game was running its original build the guns were balanced the hitmodels were standard the directional sound was amazing and it was overall a fun experience and i enjoyed the game at that point. Since then they have overhauled the entire shooting system making certain guns complete lasers of destruction and making others basically worthless. The ump is the most popular primary at this point simply because it has almost no recoil i have used it myself with a 4x scope to full auto people who are running 50 100 meters away only missing a couple rounds ON FULL AUTO. The 5.56 rifles take 4 6 shots to take a player down but can take a player down with 1 headshot and 1 bodyshot which is just completely a waste. They can no longer be used to take a player out at any sort of distance because landing 6 shots at someone who is 200+ yards out moving and getting in cover is impossible. Your only other option is the SKS which still takes 3 4 shots to kill a target and its now harder to land the shots and you have less ammo. I dont mention the SLR because its rarity is a complete joke and the bolt actions KAR98 still takes 3 body shots to kill a target. The damage models are a complete waste of time. Weapons do a specific amount of damage and that will be scaled down depending on body part with max damage being done to the upper chest and a bonus to headshots the game also has weapon classes smg ar sniper etc which get different body part bonuses. IMPORTANT PART Pre 1.0 the game had fair damage models you can shoot a player in the head and get headshot damage or shoot them in the body to do body damage but if you hit their vest you would do less damage. Now the game is the same with vests but if you hit someone in the feet???? NAH SON YOU DO 10 DAMAGE WITH AN ASSAULT RIFLE. How is it worth your time to shoot at someone but if you hit their feet that shot is basically wasted because youre only doing 10 damage? How is a gunfight fair where if you full auto someone center of mass but hit their hands or arms you only do half the damage youre supposed to? Imagine you both fire at each other at the same time. You shoot their center of mass like youre supposed to with a firearm but since their hands are in front of them you hit their hands 3x. The other player hits your chest and arms 3x. You did 35 damage but they killed you instantly. You really expect players to be compensating for hitting body parts in the middle of a close range gunfight? 4.) Microtransactions. I dont have a problem with these. I really dont. I bought skins myself ETC. What i DO have a problem with is their box/opening system is ing broken and its been broken for 6 months. When you open a crate you have 2 options a.) the crate will open and you will get your itemb.) the crate will sit on your screen with a loading icon for 30+ seconds essentially freezing your game and then tell you item delivery is being delayed right now. Then you have to refresh the lobby and go through your items individually to try to detect which one is the one you got.What kind of stupid s cant even get a microtransaction system to work properly? The above bug applies for buying your daily crates ETC. The entire main menu UI is such a joke you cant even switch skins properly without spamming the button 20 times until it actually clicks the button.5.) Dumbed down gameplay. I mentioned earlier about the overhauls to gunplay and sound and damage and damage models. What these have done is severely dumbed down the entire game from what it was at its peak. The guns used to take skill to handle skill to shoot at people effectively and take people out at range. Now they are all just laser sticks where you just need to pull down a bit on full auto and they were made this way because the guns dont do enough ing damage. 5 6 shots with an ASSAULT RIFLE? God damn fortnite doesnt even require that many. Sound was dumbed down and reworked so plebs with no headset can play the game 10% better but still end up dying every game because it still doesnt work on speakers.6.) Awful skill incentives. The game is basically call of duty now you can pick up any gun no attachments but a red dot armor and a helmet and win a game without even trying. The guns dont feel realistic anymore they take comical amounts of shot to kill they are pushing new respawn modes heavily which are essentially TDM modes like call of duty adding weapon skins vehicles are basically armored blockade runners that take TWO TO THREE SHOTS to pop a tire. The main meta to gaining rating right now is to get a car get to a building in the center of the circle and just camp there until the circle moves and then drive to the next building. 7.) Garbage rating system. Since the game uses an ELO rating system (easy to find on wikipedia about how an ELO system works) basically instead of being rewarded for YOUR performance in the game you are rewarded for who you beat ( who you outlasted) per game. I can get 25 kills and die early and i will get less rating increase than someone who did literally nothing but lived to 2nd place because they are also getting rewarded for outlasting those 25 players THAT I KILLED. What this does is makes it so getting out there and using your skill to get ahead kill players and get top 10 is useless because you can just hide until 2nd place and get the same results.8.) No incentive to keep playing. You won a game? Ok i guess go play another. There is no trophies achievements were only added extremely recently and were too easy to earn no daily/weekly challenges nothing. Nothing you can earn from grinding out the same thing over and over again. The only the game ever added that was good was map selection.This game had great potential it really did but was ruined by literally just making all the decisions who couldnt even fix problems the game had since day one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,270,True,Not Recommended,"Really fun game. You can sink hours into this game and still have fun the only problem with that is that you'll always want to do one more game. The game looks decent could be better but could definitely be worse. The Dev's keep in touch with the community about what's to be expected this or the next month what they're working on letting us know about unexpected server problems etc. Your first few dozen hours of gameplay is adrenaline rushing until you learn more about the game.The game starts off with 100 people parachuting out of a cargo plane to a location of your choice. The better the spot for loot the more people are going to drop. When you land you'll see people dying left and right but the real game hasn't started yet it's more of a ""loot phase."" Once it gets to around 50 people it gets more intense and you should have decent equipment by then and it turns into a ""caution phase."" You've made it to 20 people left now it becomes the ""Stealth phase"" try not to be seen as your play area is becoming much more limited much more quickly. You've manage to make it to the last 15? Now the real game begins everyone but you (because that's how games work) is going to have the best equipment so you're going to have to out do them by sneaking up on them or letting them kill everyone else but you. If you make it to last 5 no matter how many times you've gotten this far your adrenaline will kick in and it will feel so good once you win.I'll try to make a decent Pros/Cons list of the game now Pros Decent graphicsMassive area mapEvery situation is differentCompletely random loot even if you land in the same spot game after gameIt's hard for the game to get old because of the random lootCons Playable area while starts off reasonable it gets WAY too aggressiveMap may be massive but it seems lacking at times tooPeople seem to be able to turn down the grass rendering to easily see people who hide in the grass (should be a fixed value to prevent this)Normally I would've recommended this game but however Playerunkown said that he wouldn't release microtransactions until the game is out of early access it's purley cosmetic so it's whatever. However during this latest patch (as I type this 8/4/17) a new ""loot crate"" was released needing a key to open as you would in CS GO and TF2 and KF2. It's said to ""test the system"" but why would a system that's been used in other games need testing? Why not test it when the game is out of early access? A promise was broken so I cannot recommend the game. Over 6 000 000 copies of this game have been sold so far (check steamspy if you don't believe me) so they aren't hurting for money anytime soon. So take back the promise and release microtransactions early is a move",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They lack the ability to follow through with an optimized game that can actually run on mid level gaming computers. Lag (be it FPS or server related) is a common complaint and it has yet to be addressed effectively. The developers have had plenty of time to work on the common issue's and at least attempt to fix them. It seems that the game dev's are not focused on these issue's. I'm running a GTX 1060 FTW 6Gb GPU and the game is unplayable at all graphics settings.5/26/2018 Update. The game is still laggy. Dev's have spent their time putting in new gun accessories rather than working on the core of the game.

Hackers. The game at the moment is riddled with hackers and they devs dont seem to be doing as much as they can to try and stop them It is very annoying when you are in top 30 with your friend with 2 m24's and randomly get shot once and die from a guy all the way at the spawn island 2. Glitch Spots There is a very large amount of holes and spots you can get stuck in on both maps and this is one of the number one things that makes me want to be done for the day. 3 Diversity of weapons In my opinion I think that they should add a lot more guns and not only into the crates like they have been. If they took half of the guns currently in crates Gave them a nerf and shoved them onto the ground of both maps it would make it so much better. Overall though there has been a lot of improvment since early acsess and this is and will continue to be a great game,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Progession is quick as you learn how to be more efficient as you die in a massive 100 person battle to the death. Servers for me have always been stable with zero D/C's and minimal lag. Graphically the game is built for everyone but shines for some. Draw distance and reflections are impressive for what the game is. Even in EA ""bugs"" are few and far between. The servers were hit with some aimbots early but dealt with fairly swiftly. PUBG could use a kill cam to show player v. hacker improvements. Avoid if you are expecting a finished and final product understand that many EA projects never come to light. This game has also been successfully refunded via Steams Refund policy.Recently the game added the ability to buy Loot Crates (aka the dreaded microtransaction).

2017-11-23,0,0,494,False,Recommended,"Where do I start off?Here If you had experience with first person shooters like Counter Strike or Overwatch or Call of Duty this game shouldn't feel like playing on a VR for the first time. I'm sure many of you all are familiar with the ""battle royale"" genre that has been popular among gamers. (especially the Chinese) The first battle royale game on steam that many took notice of is H1Z1 and now you might be wondering why H1Z1 isn't on the top 10 played steam games... H1Z1's developers ed up the community and the game overall thus destroying its popularity among gamers and when PUBG became the next big battle royale game people that wanted a battle royale based game immediately started hopping on to this game. Well the people that could actually afford the game that is... The main difference between the popularity of H1Z1 and PUBG is that PUBG's developers and publishers are not money hungry and seems to listen to the community. The growing popularity led to streamers on twitch streaming this game and further helping the game evolve. PUBG's developers saw streamers as VIPs and started to listen to streamers' opinions and thoughts more than the community's. When streamer said that one individual was ""stream sniping"" him/her Bluehole the game's publishers would ban that certain player from playing the game. This often led to streamers growing too big of an ego *cough* *cough* Grimmmz. Another issue I would like to address before I move on to the Pros is that the state of this game right now is riddled with cheaters using cheats such as aimbot wallhacks speedhacks etc. Many of these cheaters seem to be of a Chinese background and the community has openly stated that. This is one of the biggest problems and if it were to be fixed the reviews on this game would likely go from a Mixed to a Very Positive. Other problems include bugs lag and the fact that this game is not region locked. This game is beautiful the scenery the weapons the vehicles etc. The gameplay is fair (except the fact there are cheaters) if you have bad equipment you'll likely be dying an early death if you have skill you'll likely be living longer... The mechanics are not confusing and the game is easy to learn. If I could give this game a rating it would recieve a 7/10. If the cheating stops the rating may change )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-24,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,This game has numerous UI bugs that make it unplayable. Specifically if you play this game with a game pad connected to the back of your PC the game will not function while the pad is connected. KB/mouse won't work right and the game pad won't work right either. You won't have a mouse in menus access during game play including the leave lobby game. This means you must crash out of the entire game after a match is over and you can't change any settings in the menu. You also will be treated to all of the key hnts being wrong and constantly glitching out. When you press a keyboard key the hints go away (rather than change to keyboard binds) and then as soon as you let go of a keyboard button the hints for game pad come back.You also can't remove or disable (or even rebind) the game pad hints. So when you want to open a door or pick up an item the game tells you PRESS X. When you press x on your keyboard you put your gun away. This is because X is interact on the game pad and x is unarm yourself on the keyboard. What a ing joke.

2017-10-03,0,0,238,True,Not Recommended,"Not going to lie Battle Royale is a really fun game mode. This game will provide some entertainment. However once you get passed the sheen of playing a new game you will start seeing gamebreaking issues more and more. That is if you have a great computer. Otherwise you'll be getting a unoptimized crapshoot from the get go. I consider my computer decent Ryzen 1600 and a 1070 however I still get insane framedrops fairly consistently. Textures not loading are fairly common and sometimes buildings do not load in at all. I guess a SSD is a requirement to play this game. Now this may sound petty considering the ""Early Access"" designation the game still has. However at this point in development it is quite clear that this game is not progressing in any sort of an healthy manner. Instead of focusing on the plethora of game breaking issues water invincibility jumping through windows horrendous netcode leading to at least 1/5 of my deaths being due to desync terrible optimization vehicle physics melee item hurtboxes seemingly being non existant bullets completely bypassing armor textures/buildings randomly not loading shotguns in general etc (there are probably many more if I was willing to spend more time thinking of everything wrong with this game) but what do they do instead? Host an esports tournament with one of the biggest prize pools in any recent memory Working on adding a new map (now 2?) working on a new vehicle adding fog (requiring them to force post processing just to have it run correctly) added a new gamebreaking gun (Mini 14) threatening lawsuits against their main competitor (Fortnite) and now partnering with a VPN company and advertising it in game for Chinese players. Like the game or hate it I don't really care. This is absolutely unacceptable and unforgivable. They have made over half a BILLION dollars on this game and just added in game ads. Think about it the leaders at Bluehole clearly only care about money. I honestly don't see this game ever being near a state where a ""full release"" would be acceptable considering the monumentous work ahead of them. Since there is already a free alternative with AAA companies sure to follow suit soon just save your money and DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I really see them abandoning this game after these companies step up to the plate. Even if they don't you will be stuck playing a vastly inferior game to whatever comes out in the next few months. Just play Fortnite BR until then and spend your money on a game with decent leadership/devs.TL DR Battle Royale is really fun PubG is a hot piece of garbage ran by people with Martin Shrkeli levels of greed. Fortnite already exists for free/runs better overall. If Fortnite doesn't satisfy your needs wait until a real game dev company makes a BR game.

2017-08-06,0,0,163,True,Recommended,Product received for free. Now...Is this game good? Yes yes it is.I played Arma3 and DayZ. I'm not a stranger to battle royale games so when a friend bought me this I went into it expecting much of the same. I even waited a week before I even bothered installing it.Boy do I wish I'd given it a shot earlier.The game is all around fun. It's quick intense gameplay that keeps you on your toes 24/7. You never know when a guy with a shotgun is gonna come bashing through your front door while you wait for the limit line to reach you so you can move on.GAMEPLAYGameplay is pretty straight forward. You jump out of an airplane to choose your own spawn point. This is the make or break moment as it's far more likely to die early on if you drop in a frequently dropped in zone where like 30 people are on a 1 sq mile block with 3 houses of loot in it. Things get hairy and 29/30 are most likely going to die in that place. In this game getting kills is not the Priority name of the game. Survival is. Staying alive until you're the last man standing is the ultimate goal so it's important to differentiate between fights worth picking and to just stay low and let the convoy of friends pass you by rather than hope you can pick them off one by one without them seeing you. You'll find progressively better gear as the battleground shrinks in on itself and sometimes if you're lucky you'll drop in a place that's smack dab where the game is gonna end leaving you with a playground full of epic loot that'll leave you stacked and ready before anyone else.There are 3 versions of the game(Not counting custom) which are solo duo and squad(4). GRAPHICSGraphics are not exactly something to cheer about. They're 'adequate' but definitely could be a lot better. Due to it being an early access game sadly this also means that there are bugs and texture glitches relatively often but unless you literally get PTSD attacks or something from seeing slightly faulty graphics and serrated edges on building corners from time to time it won't bother you at all.PROS A mediocre community(Why is this a pro you might ask? Because voice chat is entirely optional and there is no such thing as text chatlog) Intense fast paced combat that'll have you sweating bullets for hours. Fair hit boxes and no wall clipping(Can't shoot through walls in certain situations etc.) Outrageously fun with friends. Goes up at least 5 stars extra if played with friends! Smooth clear voice chat built into the game(And of course there's perimeter conversation as well) No game breaking bugs that I've seen thus far. Highly customizable weapons and clothing for a personal 'build'. MASSIVE map with up to 100 players in it. Low price ($30) for a really damned good game! Fast and simple entrance to games. The longest I've ever waited from queue to joining was 3 seconds. Over 5 million copies sold and an extremely active game with an average of 280 000 people playing on the regular and over 450 000 at peak hours(Source Steam Charts)CONS Poor sub standard graphics Infrequent but catastrophic server connection losses Very rude and obnoxious community(Well at least it seems that way. I guess the trolls and idiots spamming slurping noises are more vocal and active than the more serious and mature gamer) Developer promised no microtransactions till the game is done which was honestly a pure 24 karat s*** nugget of lies. Loot is RNG based. (You might land at a building with no weapons in it at all while the guy next door comes over to say hello neighbor with an AK47 a pump action shotgun and a level 2 police vest.)FINAL WORDLike I said above is the game good? Yes yes it is but it has some definite issues which is not really the game itself that's the problem but the slightly unscrupulous developers. Go down the negative(and even some of the positive) reviews and you'll see the lies coming from the devs mentioned over and over and over again specifically the whole lie about microtransactions not happening till after the game was finished and released. The devs also claim that they want to use the money from the microtransactions to fund an Esports event for the game except the game revenue that they earned on it is so high they could easily fund a massive esports event to rival Riot Games' League of Legends championships with the utmost ease(An estimated $100mi was earned on the game so far).I recommend the GAME itself definitely but if the devs do not clean up their act and stop spewing lies to try and convince people to buy their game with empty promises? I'm going to rapidly change this review to a negative.It's so unfortunate too. The game is simply astonishingly fantastic.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,353,True,Recommended,So in my original review I expressed my frustration with trying to get the game to work on Windows 7. After spending many hours on troubleshooting I finally gave up on trying to fix it.If you're still running Windows 7 I would still recommend waiting until it's out of early access to try it out. There are still a lot of bugs and glitches and for that I would say wait.However I got the game to work on Windows 10. I don't like the fact that the only way I could get it to work was to upgrade but it works for me now so that's water under the bridge now.If you do have Windows 10 and a good system I would recommend trying it out. It is a lot of fun when it works and there's a ton of good times to be had playing with friends.Don't expect too much from this title though as I said before there are still a lot of bugs and glitches. You could be doing really well and the game will screw you over anyway by crashing or getting your character stuck in some weird position.

Sure it's definitely irritating that game ending bugs and exploits still exist but i rarely encounter serious issues in gameplay. No better game to binge on for hours with several friends. Aspects of stealth realistic and arcade style shooting action a huge open world a big challenge with a huge skill cap and endless replayability make this game highly recommended in my book.

2017-03-28,0,0,111,False,Not Recommended,"Based on the Arma mod ""Battle Royale"" the premise of Battlegrounds is simple. 100 players parachute onto a massive island and duke it out until the last man (or team) stands. During this process players scavenge farmhouses industrial areas forests and towns for weapons body armor and vehicles. Sounds simple right? The catch is the playable radius of the map is decreasing at certain intervals. As you can imagine 100 players scavenging while moving into a smaller playable area eventually leads to contact and firefights. You can either play solo 2 man teams or 4 man squads. If you play with friends it may quickly become one of the best teamwork oriented experiences you've had (as it was for me). If you play solo the direness of the situation quickly becomes apparent and you will find yourself in fight or flight situations. Either way there is an excellent time to be had.Sound plays a big role in Battlegrounds. You will hear footsteps or vehicles of other players nearby causing you to literally freeze in your tracks and quietly listen. If unarmed you may feel yourself become nervous and even hide praying you are not found as the sound of footsteps swarm the floor below you. I have never played a game where at times I feel like I am being hunted. It's very intense and leads to some amusing situations such as stealing your persuers vehicle ). Gunplay is thankfully tactical and slow paced in Battlegrounds but weapon damage can be a bit hit or miss. Let me remind you again this game is in EA so there are many issues. Weapon damage a desperate need for a hardcore mode and sound issues to just name a few. The game is also not well optimized and server lag rears its ugly head every so often. Even with its current issues Battlegrounds shines as the new king of Battle Royale. It's really an exciting game and stands out in a genre filled with mods and weaker contenders I'm truly excited for the upcoming fixes patches and content.EDIT Once region lock or ping lock is implemented I will change my review back to thumbs up.

However after this game came out of early access and Miramar was released the game has just been going down hill because of the incompetant developers who don't give a single flying about this game any more they just out in frequent updates that change the game in ways that absolutely no one asked for. The developers have made thier money off this game and have no reason to continue development (unless adding more lootboxes counts as ""new content""). Real shame to see a game with such fantastic potential ruined by inept devs . Maybe this game will be good in a years time but I wouldn't count on it don't bye this game because of the promise that ""the game will get better with future updates!""

The game was fun at first but since it reached 1.0 I began to see that the game will not fix a lot of its bugs. A small company it seems cant properly create a game like this. I never thought i would be excited for a call of duty title until now. save your money dont buy this game they literally made way more then they should have on this game. I do respect shroud and his love for the game but we really need a game backed by a well known developer. They do rework a lot of the crappy mechanics like throwables but it is not enough I would also have to blame a bit of this on the community. They constantly bash on the game and criticize asking for skins new guns new content when they really needed to refine what they had. They have the money to hire engineers. I do hope that one day they get thier stuff together. it was fun while it lasted but ended up with a lot more frustration then anything.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Server tickrate used to be 8 (EU FPP) at the start of a match now after a fix it's still 12.2. Rubberbanding and desyncs e.g. action delay (looting doors grenade throwing) unregistered shots dying after you already went to a safe spot.3. Sometimes when you land loot hasn't rendered yet.4. Long standing parachute bug ruining landings with forced hook to the right or left.5.

Don't get it if you can't stand stuff like these. Oh and they broke their promise and pretty much don't have respect for the comunity.Previous Well My bro got me this game because I was skeptic about it at first didn't want to ""waste"" 30$ on a game that is in early access (ahm DayZ ahm) because of other experiences. But damn man even though it's not finished and it has it's set of bugs and glitches it is very enjoyable as long as you play it with a squad or duo. as for the game Graphics 7/10It's not the most beautiful game on the market but it has good graphics the design is pleasent on the eye and well not every PC can run it (requiers Optimization).Gameplay 9/10This is key. The gameplay is what makes this game great the guns work well the sound system is fantastic (too loud sometimes) you have to use headphones in order to have an advantage on your opponents and you have to be careful in each step you make. Very Strategic you have to think fast and act swiftly otherwise you're dead. There is not delay the game is very competitive and it ain't pay to win.Technical issues Well it is still in alpha (or beta) stages which means the game is not complete so you expect to experience some bugs and glitches from time to time. So far I've managed to find a fix around them lowering my Graphical options and avoiding memory leaks by restarting the game after 1 or 2 games (requiered when you have 8GB of ram) from time to time the game may lag and freeze but it usually happens in the beggining and stops after a minute or so.Updates and Dev involvment The Devs are very responsive to the community they look after what people say and they really put their heart and soul in the game they seek to perfect it in the end and that's what you look in a game like this. Constant development and updates which keep things fresh and fun. They fix bugs regulary and add content from time to time which makes it very exciting they plan for more gamemodes and new maps which is what will keep the game going hopefuly.TL DR8/10 (early access)Worth the money get some friends to play thank me later!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You can play it however you want Go full retard with your friends and try stupid things and you can try to win the chicken dinner.PROS The devs are really listening to the community.It's so intense if you play it for the win (last 10 20 people)At a reasonable price 30 EUR other games like Overwatch or GTA V cost 60 EURA very big communityYou can also make some money with the crates if you sell them for about 0.30 EUR or you can open them and have the chance to open a 7 EUR T Shirt or a 200 EUR Skirt.CONS The servers are bad but that's because the huge amount of players out there.Yea..it has some bugs but they are like 1/10 matches.There are hackers out there but not as many as CS GO for example.In conlcusion The experience with the game is great...new updates funny community.Pretty much the kind of game you want to play to have fun and also be competitive.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Probably to render a lot more than it has to but whatever. A GTX 1050 Ti will still have to chug along just to play normally. GRAPHICS Glowing missing textures are preferable to stare at wear glasses to protect your eyes bad OK good eye candy (low to medium) masterpiece (high and up)Explination ARMA 3 tier graphics but the performance like you're trying to play GTA V ENB enchancer on a low end computer.

DIFFICULTY I should be insulted easy medium easy to learn hard to master hard dark souls it exists to spite you Explination PUBG is pretty straightforward. More or less point and shoot while compensating for recoil. Well that's assuming that you're not shredded before the other person kills you. Or you suffer at the hands of server lag. BUGS worse than a bug eaten rotten tree termite infestation baseball field ant mound (mods) few bugs (no mods) nothingExplination PUBG is probably one of the most laggiest games one can play. It performs like butt in CQC and okish at long distance combat.

2017-08-03,0,0,42,True,Recommended,In the beginning PUBG was terrbile for me. It was lagging crashing frames would drop enormously it would take some time to even load the map in game! It was terrible. BUT when i went online and i searched up the problems i was having i looked up some things on how to fix the problems i was having. IT WORKED! After all the problems were fixed the game ran beautifuly and with a steady FPS rate of around 100fps. The lag the crashing and all the other problems were gone! And now that they are gone i cant stop playing this game!Here are some pros and cons (Most of the cons are due to the early acces which im sure will be fixed later on)Pros Amazing mapGreat gameplayLag has been fixedWeapons are greatCons The game feels a bit clunky when shooting (early acces though im sure it will be fixed)Some times I do have a little but of a lag spike (Not that big of a problem)I would like it if maybe they could add more weapons because i have come across many of the same weapons. (again this is only the early acces so im sure they will add more)Text me anyone if you disagree with me and i would glady explain why i think its a Pro or a Con ) EJB,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Yes it laggs and yes it is poorly optimized it'll crash you get the gesture. It is in EARLY ACCESS. Every game in early access gives a warning about it being buggy. The fact that people complain about wasting their money is pathetic. I enjoy the game even though I have a low end processor and garbage internet and I still love it. I am more than happy that I bought this for 30$ when it feels like it should be sold for 60.

2018-06-04,0,0,370,False,Recommended,PUBG is a multiplayer only game that revolves around picking up guns scattered across a map and trying to eliminate the competition to finish first. There are three modes available &gt Solo &gt Duo &gt Squad (3 man squad included from 3 to four teammates)The game starts with a large map containing various landscapes ranging from forest to mountains lakes and towns. You begin with no weapons inside a plane going in a straight line over the map and you will have to launch yourself from it and glide towards the desired zone on the map. From then on you will have to find weapons that are randomly generated all around the map and kill the other players/teams. A white circle will appear telling you to which zone you should go. Soon a blue circle will join the borders of the white one and everything outside of the zone will take continuous damage until they get inside the circle or die. As time goes on the circle gets smaller forcing the teams to face each other or die outside the playzone. There are two different views each with its on advantages and drawbacks FPP(first person) and TPP (third person). The game relies heavily on RNG be it for the circle's first appearance or for which weapons appear and where (for example there could be entire houses with absolutely nothing in them) which can lead to very frustrating situations and can discourage many potential players. Though when played with friends (which i recommend) the game becomes considerably more fun and bearable creating funny and unexpected situations. The voice chat can be extremely annoying but can also provide its own lot of fun depending on the players in it. The graphics are decent. However playing with ultra quality will surprisingly put you at a disadvantage since objects like grass and small bushes can be disabled in the lower qualities resulting in situations where a player with high graphic settings crawling through a field can be killed easily by a player with low settings since for him the grass of the field will not have appeared. Depending on whether you survive to win the first place a single game will usually range from 1min to 35 minutes. In the end PUBG is a decent game that requires a certain mindset to fully enjoy. RNG can become quite annoying and cheaters and lag can somtimes ruin an otherwise perfectly good game. The DEV team is still pushing update after update and the bugs are progressively being corrected one after another. My final rating for PUBG ? 13 / 20Thank you for reading!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

My computer is pretty decent (It can run GTA V at 60 fps for comparison) and a lot of times the fps drops which can lead to me dying. Now to the thing I love about the game.

It gives the game legs. It's also interesting to reflect on your defeat (and you will get defeated a lot) and learn from your mistakes poor luck or just misjudgement.But.You really have to go into this with your eyes open at the moment.There are a LOT of hackers. Yes you can use your DeathCam to see who got you see if it was a hacker and report them if it was but you're still dead.The hackers are attracted by the marketplace for crates and until and unless that marketplace is removed this problem will continue.There are of course the famous glitches problems with optimisation ping differences etc. but it's not as bad as some AAA games have released and they keep fixing it.IMO there needs to be a mechanism to select maps as they play very differently.Also the Miramar map does not lend itself to thoughtful play. Too little cover and without a scope you are dead.Personally I'm going to stop playing for a while until these issues are fixed and this is after having sunk hundred of hours into the pre launch game.If you can live with those caveats go for it but if not wait for them to fix the problems or look elsewhere.NB If the above get addressed I shall revisit this review and recommendation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Then its just you and the last guy. His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavyThere's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti.

2017-09-18,0,0,140,True,Recommended,FYI I have never written a review on steam but this game is just to good I had to back it up.First off I have to say thank you for putting duo in the game me my best freind havent found any game this fun that we can play co op EVER!!! The rush and excitement you get from start to finish is amazing and uncomparable to any other multiplayer game. I was playing Overwatch for a while with my freind but it didnt quite satisfy us it wasnt enough to keep us entertained. But this game has gave us that satisfaction we were looking for from dropping out of the plane sky diving then parachuting to racing others in the area to find a weapon of any kind or falling to close to another player and fist fighting your way in to buildings and getting a weapon before they do. There is alot of fun in this game I personally love looting and there is alot of towns farms buildings and other giant structures to loot EVERYWHERE!! In the game there is a blue circle that closes in the playable area it gets really small towards the end and if your outside it you take damage escaping taking damage to get to the middle of it and fighting others to get there is one of the best parts of the game. The most exciting part of all is the last part of the match when th circle gets realllly tiny and there is like 15 20 people in it just brawling to survive its a real exhilerating feeling. And being the last one alive with one other the fight for that chicken dinner feels like the most important battle you have ever had it is really intense and heart pounding!! (There is also vehichles like cars jeeps and boats to help you get farther into the map which help ALOT when trying to get to the center of the playable area before dying.) P.S. I havent been banned for anything i know people complain about it but havent encountered it yet so this review is based on my expierience as of today.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-18,0,0,34,True,Not Recommended,The game is fun and the game has potential but with the state it's in right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone. First off the game is POORLY optimized. My computer is pretty decent and is able to play most if not all of my current games on ultra with no struggle but I have to play this game on the lowest settings and it still lags. Not to mention there's the chance buildings won't spawn in correctly and sometimes the game will just close itself. Honestly a game like PUBG is pretty cool on paper but it is being executed the wrong way. They should have worked on getting it out of early access but I believe the fame has gone to their heads. If the game gets a major fix or at least get out of early access hell then I'll change my review. But until then it's a no from me,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,707,True,Recommended,I purchased the game yesterday (as of 3/272017) with my brother because we are fans of open world type games that require tactics and most of all patience. It's so much fun and I enjoy this game a lot whether I play with friends or not. The game is balanced as it should be the vehicles don't protect you from shots which is also pretty sweet and the game just grabs you and makes you want te become the last survivor of this sick and twisted show!Now that doesn't mean this game has it's faults. This game does have a couple of issues which I will list out below This game is terribly optimized at the moment even running on the lowest settings my Overclocked 1080 DDR5X with a i7 7700K is not able to run this game perfectly. Now of course I will excuse this 'SOMEWHAT' because it's currently in early access and for some developers it takes time to fixing performance issues like this because everyone has a different outcome to one game. Another thing about buying a game in early access that relies on 100 player onslaught for each match and with many people currently playing it there are going to be a lot of connection issues. There have been times where the servers were not behaving the way that the developers intended them to do so. But it's only happen once or twice through a 7 hour playthrough so we'll see how quickly they'll get to this issue. Lastly (and I'll make this short) some items on the ground that you would literally kill to get sometimes will not allow you to pick them up mostly due to a glitch in the system which happens but can get very annoying when you see a Kar98K and you want to go it.... then sadly you're not able to because the game denies your happiness. So those are some of the issues that I have with the game but besides that it's been a blast playing this game and I am so glad to be a apart of this community and hopefull work with the devs on finding and solving these issues! Superb job so far in my opinion and you're still not sure you want to buy as well as my opinion isn't up to your standars I reccomend watching these players just to see how you really feel.

2017-08-11,0,0,545,True,Recommended,It's a great game. From the simplicity of the concept to overall smoothness of the gameplay. Nothing quite like the thrill of getting your first chicken dinner and having won several over the short time that I've owned it I can say that the feeling never gets old. I see a lot of negative reviews here from people who are unhappy about the new micro transactions. To me this is kind of a petty gripe. The gameplay is really good and I definitely feel that I've got my money's worth at this point. Who cares if they're trying to monetize a bit more of it? That simply makes them the same as every popular shooting game right now. The difference is this game actually offers a great experience without the repetitiveness of most of those other games. All that said here are what I think are some legitimate gripes about the game 1. Poor performance optimization causes semi frequent game crashes and you'll need to turn your graphics settings down pretty low to minimize this issue. 2. Vehicle physics are broken. Not game breakingly so but none of the vehicles are particularly stable and it gets annoying being able to crash through wooden fences but getting stopped cold by a hay bale. 3. Not being able to climb and mantle is a pain but it looks like that one is getting fixed soon.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-11,0,0,17,True,Recommended,"EDIT Stream sniping should not be a bannable offense IMO. If the enemy is dumb enough to brodcast his location for money he deserves to be ""sniped"". Streamers are definitely good advertisers due to their fanbase but they should be smarter about it.This game is a blast. Please don't listen to the negative reviews about paid loot crates. The transaction is vouluntary. This is the equivalent of going to McDonald's and complaining that they offer diet Coke to customers who want it. You have more say (collectively) in what goes into this game than just about anything else in life and you choose to cry about microtransactions that affect gameplay zilch. The point of any video game is to make money. The only people who care about this in a negative way are the same people who will buy all of their games on a Steam sale since they're too cheap to pay full price. The gameplay is quite fun. I play solo and it can be frustrating but the best advice I can give you is ""git gud"". Sometimes you get a good draw and get some sweet loot at the first drop and sometimes you get high top combat boots in the first house and die coming out the door. I'm really glad that they added first person mode only servers since third person seems a bit cheap to me. Just my opinion.The sounds of the guns are quite distinct and if you play enough you can tell the difference. Matchmaking is a dream. I love the fact that if I die I can get into another game almost immediately instead of having to wait for matches to be over long lobby times waiting for players etc.Give this game a go. Stop finding things to complain about if you already own it.TL DR Shut up and play the game you paid money for.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-22,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Update the game is better now that it's out. Still needs quite a bit of polish though. But most importantly I find it fun now. So I'm changing my rating.Time spent in this game Matchmaking queue (varies) Wait for players to connect (up to 2 minutes) Plane ride (30 seconds) Parachute down (up to a minute) Start gathering gear (up to five minutes) Die Rinse and repeatAnd then you can actually start playing. Unless you got killed during that last phase.The game has lots of potential and is fun when you are a group that's for sure but it would benefit so so so so so much from letting you try your luck faster seeing as how it's so easy to die without even knowing how it happened. This is the single biggest thing holding the game back in my opinion.

2018-01-03,0,0,231,False,Recommended,I like it. It has glitches and is not optimized/runs on an old engine. If you make the game boring it'll be boring (land in a low loot area on a corner of the map and run a lot just to get killed by a random guy in a building) But if you land in a high loot area it'll get interesting. People camp a lot but it makes sense since that's how people typically think that's how you win the game (survive don't get the most kills is the mentality). But if you play in First Person it gets better.Great feeling killing everyone else in an area and even better winning the game.

It cannot be played casually if you are aiming to win. Difficult to master the mechanics yet highly rewarding when you do get kills and win. Solo play is generally more worrying although it is also the best feeling if you win one. Fun with friends can be a laugh a lot of the time you decide if you take it seriously or just joke around. Close to full PC 1.0 release many of the aspects are near completion with optimisations and more content updates to come after the official release.

2017-08-10,0,0,712,True,Recommended,First off don't listen to the people that are pissy at PlayerUnknown about paid crates. The game is wildly successful and it's your choice to buy them or not. What's wrong with a game trying to make more money?This game blows H1Z1 out of the park if you've played that. Eliminating idiotic mechanics like being able to jump out of cars and survive Battlegrounds brings Battle Royale to a whole new level. With realistic physics akin to its original Arma mods this game is an exciting rollercoaster every game. It's hard to explain if you don't have the game but it's so very rewarding. The reality and immersiveness of it brings killing extremely satisfying. There is something about hearing the huge bang of a gun go off and hitting that headshot you lined up from 500 meters away. It's inexplicable. Don't get me wrong it's a game and I'm not a murderer.I love this game. A wide variety of guns and attachments allows me to customize and pick what I want to play with.

2017-08-09,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,"First issue is the crates. As much as I ""love"" micro transactions you can't just go back on your word like that. Also the rates are abysmal its not even fair. Let's say there's 500 000 people online at a time leaving you with several million per week each person gets a few crates per weeks for free and there's still only 2 skirts for sale at a time in the market? Seriously that only leaves your imagination as to how rare they are. So going back on their word and then making the rate for rare items astronomically low? Please.Now for the other issue the game is alright but the rules being enforced kinda ruin it. This game is ""supposed"" to be chaotic anarchy whatever you say goes kind of attitude. Now you can get banned for what you say and team killing. Don't get me wrong it can be annoying to be killed by a teammate but isn't that why they're adding ranked? Just enforce it there. There's no penalty to dying in this game you can just start up a new game 3 seconds later. Simple things like that made the game what it was. The game itself isn't the fun part it was the communities toxic racist egotistical bs that gave it that unique and fun flair that you were allowed to do it without repercussions. Now that that's over I find myself rarely getting on. I feel hacking should be the only bannable offense outside of ranked play in this type of game.Don't get me wrong though I'm still gonna get on at least once a week to get my chest and sell it at least I'll be able to make my $30 back eventually.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,138,True,Recommended,I'd like to say first of all that (in my opnion) the microtransaction arguement for not buying this game is completely unjustified. Yes it may prove the devs to be somewhat untrustworthy in delivering promised aspects of the game but it does not change the gameplay AT ALL. So judging this game poorly based on it the fact that it has microtransactions is ridiculous to me. Putting that aside this is one of the most heart racing and exhilirating games I have ever played. I personally don't play any multiplayer games unless they're with friends but this is a game I can solo play and still have a blast. Even when you die you feel hyped up because of the situation you were in. Sure if you get randomly headshotted in the middle of a field you're gonna be pretty but this is a video game where all choices can have consequences. YOU decided to walk in the middle of a field. YOU decided to run to the next house when the area wasn't clear. Sometimes making these calls can be tough which just adds to the tense experience.The bugs in this game can hold it back a little bit though. For example my friend and I occasionaly experience an issue when first parachuting out of the plane. Sometimes if we go down too fast our textures won't load in properly and we will be screwed until they decide to load in. Other than that I reccomend you buy this game if you're looking for a good time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-16,0,0,175,False,Recommended,This is not a run and gun game. If you don't believe me feel free to try. You will either die immediately or find no action for about 10 minutes until you are suddenly gunned down with no idea where the bullets even came from. Skill matters more than quick reaction times although having both helps. You *can* win a game without any of your victims fighting back if you are cunning (and lucky) enough. Firearm and balistic mechanics are modeled quite well almost everything you would see IRL minus wind. The guns fill their roles as they do IRL as well. Consider which situations military and police use each firearm in and that will give you an idea of what you should be doing. Of course you don't always have the luxury of choice. When I do I opt for an close range UMP paired with a one of the autoloading center fire rifles for medium range engagements ideally an SKS or min14 if I can find one. Long range is fun but often a waste of ammo and time as well as a quick way to reveal your location to everyone around you.My advise to noobs don't drop in dense areas until you have some kills under your belt. Once you find a decent gun find a good place to camp and spring traps on anyone in range. This will get you actual experience as opposed to the mindless shooting you will find if you go to dense areas first. Save that for later to test your new skills.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You land run into the nearest house praying to find a gun5. Grats you've got a pistol6. One of the other 3 guys that landed near you runs into you with an AK7. You shoot him 4 times before he somehow kills you in only 2 bullets.Rinse and repeat ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-02,0,0,293,True,Recommended,First I must warn you. This game is not about winning. It may look that way but it is about the journey. Even the top people in each region have less than 25% win rate. It is about the little wins along the way and finding your game play. You run into campers run and guns and military style players. Just when you think your safe that is when you are most vulnerable. This game is based on luck most of all and skill second. Luck is the loot battle zone circles and vehicle spawns. Skill side of it is based on sneaking camping shooting. All of the fps shooter games you have played up until now have prepared you for this game. In my first weekend of play I got a solo win and then a duo win with a friend I have played CS GO with for years. Each time you die it is basically oh well what can I do differently next time. The only cons I can say about this game are the one map is starting to get old. They have confirmed more maps with release. The second one is and they may like it to be more realistic but it would be nice to see how you died to help you learn for next time. Just remember when you die it is over.

2018-04-11,0,0,624,False,Recommended,Player Unknown PUBG GHonestly it s been a lot of fun sinking hours into this game with friends. This is by no means a polished game at all but a lot of the Not recommended reviewers have sunk 3 4 or 5 hundred hours. Doesn t that tell you something? If it was so bad why have they kept playing? Maybe there is some enjoyment from this game after all regardless of all the crazy things that can happen. This game can be absolutely soul destroying. There s been a few heart breaking moments when myself or my squad have gotten to the final circle and in an awesome position to win against only one or two people left only to get killed by a hacker amazing player at the end. Or my squad just looted an area and is absolutely geared up for the rest of the game then jump in a car only to randomly blow up in a vehicle moving 10km per hour after touching a bale of hay. Or catapulting one vehicle into space after it accidentally clips a squad mate in the vehicle driving in front. Or climbing on top of a fallen loot crate only to fall to your death jumping from the top to the ground.There are many many more dumb stupid things that happen in this game. And whilst some of them are stupid and really rage inducing others have been absolutely hysterical and have created fits of laughter on discord for hours. If you re a serious gamer who hates bugs and playing in teams and prefers to play things on your own I d best avoid a game like pubg. But if you enjoy having bants and a few laughs with mates this is a good game. Just don t take it seriously. The developers certainly were not expecting this game to be so successful. TLDR This game is crap but crap in a fun way. And OMG it feels great to win. Play with friends or not at all.*Technically I made money playing this opened a few loot crates and sold an item for $110. Loot boxes are dumb people who pay that much for an item are dumber*,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-26,0,0,670,False,Not Recommended,This game has not recieved any meaningful updates like major bug fixes or performance boosts in the last year. Instead it recieved microtransactions and pricey skins. Maybe some weapons and 2 new maps that are both far less superior to the original. And also we have been bombarded with PUBG Invitational ads everywhere from the lobby to the plane and even inin game objects. The gameplay itself hasn't really changed since release. I have had the game since launch and 1 year would have been enough for any developer to turn an unpolished early access game to something fun and polished. Not bluehole tho. They saw their numbers dropping and instead of fixing the game they filed a lawsuit to sue Fortnite thinking that would make the players come back. The players didn't leave because of Fortnite. They left because they had faith in a game with huge potentional that didn't evolve how it should have.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-02,0,0,12,True,Recommended,"Battlegrounds is an amazing game. A large map large number of players and a variety of weapons there is so much that can happen. What makes it so great is the tension. That feeling you are being watched at all times knowing a scope is zeroed on your head. Then you hear the shot but the bullet is not for you. Relief washes over you but it is only temporary as the sniper has now noticed you. You pray to God you can evade him but alas his aim is true and you are cut down.As you expire those words appear seemingly taunting you.

2017-05-02,0,0,285,True,Recommended,This game has caught me be surprise. For an early access game it ticks quite a lot of boxes. This game has brought the joy of online play back (for me).The Australian playerbase is strong at the moment and the general attitude is great I'm yet to experince a toxic group.I've heard about hacking and have seen the youtube videos however I feel I'm yet to experience it. (that I know of). Pros Servers fill up quick minimal queue times Devs are rolling out update after update Graphics are alright Sound is alright Drop rates are good It's $30.00General premis of game and how its been put together works.Cons Lots of small and some large technical glitches that need to be overcome (which I presume will come with updates)I feel like they should be squeezing more out of the U4 engine considering the lead designer chose to avoid propriatary engines like on H1Z1 and ARMA which slowed development.I'm excited to see where this game goes I really hope it doesnt follow suit of most early access games these days and just quietly get mothballed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It looks like a game that came out in 2012 to be honest it reminds me of that era which is not good for a open world game that came out in 2017. Net code is still awful that again is not good for battle royal open world games in general. There are tons of issues with server connectivity this issue has been around since it was in early access. I highly doubt that these problems would get resolved soon but here they are.It's clucky AF even though it's been ""released"".Do you hate having to deal with hard campers in every little hole in a freaking open word game? this game is filled with them and that's the only way you can get to top 10 out of 100.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-03,0,0,262,True,Recommended,Feels a lot like the DayZ Mod (not standalone) with better controls and easy to use UI. One minute youre scavenging and the next you've been surrounded by four cucksters looking to steal your crap. Once you've learned to be the cucker and not the cuckee you'll have a lot of fun with this game.One of the DayZ feels is when you're walking through a seemingly empty field and get your wrecked in 7.62ms flat by some little cuckster hanging out in a bush. (legit strat you'll get lots of BP if you play in the end game circle).The points don't mean though. Won a game with 1 kill because I was prone the whole time and killed the last guy. As of now the points unlock crates which give you one random clothing item...which you're going to change out once you get in game anyways as soon as you find a better piece of gear.Honestly pretty good for a game in Alpha stage. Better than the DayZ standalone even to this day unless you like running around for gear all day and not seeing a single person to use it on. Vehicles/weapons/looting/PVP all on release. It does need to be optimized as many have said. I have a Lenovo Y50 laptop that's 3 years old with an GT 860M and i'm running on low.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The guns are fairly balananced.The devs are amazing and post weekly updates on their website. Their latest push is to make the game more compatible to lower spec pc's.This game has a lot of potential and the dev's seem like they want to take this game out of beta.If you are reading this you probably are on the fence wondering if you should drop $30 like I did. You definately should.Solo is alright and rewards you the most in game currency just for playing. Duo and Squad play rewards great too but only if you make it far and get tons of kills.You will feel at first like you can't hit anyone but just aim ahead of where the player is.Would recommend 9/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is doing very well and I am going to remain optimistic that this game will incorporate more modes to directly compete with DayZ in the future.

2017-07-16,0,0,19,True,Recommended,"its a really intense game. It can be strongly action driven but also more stealth like kinda like MGS series. The more you realize at a certain point you can get #1 you literally feel your heart racing. And the moment you actually did it the first time will really feel like a huge achievement )Nevertheless keep in mind that its early access so it still struggles with performance issues. Its possible that buildings are not rendered properly or your screen freezes in the second you want to approach the enemy. Its absolutely not optimized yet so be prepared to play on low/medium even with a good PC. lags. The enemy is watching in a different direction (as you see it) but you are still shot by him first. Im playing from Germany on EU server dont know if its different in different place wordwide. no story purely multiplayer. And the MP has no ""story"" as well. Well its not claiming to be more so thats not negative but be aware of it. Some ppl might think there is no meaning to the game. as every big multiplayer game there are hackers here. The good news is the developers ban them on a regular basis and more counter measures are being implemented soon (like reporting). The game itself is really fun but keep it mind its still early access so you will find the issues listed above. NOT ALWAYS but sometimes. Also i feel like this are typical EA sicknesses that will be dealt with as soon it reaches release Q2017.

2017-09-03,0,0,60,True,Not Recommended,Too buggy to recommend in current state.Main issues for me Third Person Mode is the default for this game although when you aim it goes to First Person.. game doens't know what it wants to be TPS or FPS. Apparently FPS mode is coming but it's doesn't exist for oceania/aussie players yet. Connectivity. No ping indicated in the game however occasionally 'high latency detected' will pop up so I presume I'm playing on the Sydney server and routing latency sometimes sucks. There should be more (local) servers available for a game with literally the most concurrent players on Steam constantly. Hopefully will be fixed in time. Hit registration. I shoot a guy several times he turns around and hits me twice. So i've had the drop on him i've emptied a clip into him. Somehow he takes i tall and then kills me. Annoyingly common and probably related to my connection to the server.The hype is real and the game is OK. Plays like Stalker Shadow Of Chernobyl.

On top of that you have issues with damage bugs and server tick rate/netcode issues. The sad part is it keeps getting worse. It doesnt seem like the main issues which are above are being dealt with.

Somehow my game runs worse after 1.0 having 60 70 fps on ultra before the update and having 50 60 fps on very low after 1.0. Frames for some reason like to drop during intense firefights or when driving on uneven slopes basically exactly when i can possibly something up.For gameplay it is VERY fun for the first 50 to 70 hours or so of gameplay even when i replay it now it sends me an adrenaline rush coursing through my veins during tense moments being in top 10 or just simply trying to survive a firefight. but after 100 hours i just can't seem to find anymore interest in this game and the games seem to draw out 20 to 30 minutes in length where you run for hours on end not seeing any enemies at all but getting shot from far away by a baby with a rifle and an any times scope. I mean that helps with the adrenaline rush the fear of losing it all but the reward for such a triumph is 1000 to 1500 BP which is either just enough or not even close to the price of getting your second battlepack for the week. It would be better if winning awarded you with 2 or more battlepacks atleast or more than 1500 BP. Sure you get ""bragging rights"" but since literally millions of players own this game winning Chicken Dinner isn't much of a feat as it used to be.It could be that my connection is bad but usually during the start of a round where there are usually 85 to 100 players in the game it sometimes lags and picking anything up can become delayed. I mean it is 100 players but the main selling point of this game is the fact that you are in an arena with said hundred players.So i think that i won't recommend this game (for now as i may come back in a couple months) because of the poor optomization bad servers and repetitiveness. Even if the two of the problems on my list could be that ""my computers quot or that ""you probably just have bad internet"" but it doesn't mean that they're not contributing to the problem aswell. For the final verdict i'd give this a 6/10 as even though i have alot of problems with the game at times it can be very fun and exciting to play and if my friends would like to play it i wouldn't complain. Its fun to come back to every once in a while but playing it continiously is just impossible for me to do. Hopefully most of these problems will be fixed later on and i can finally recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-04-21,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,The game is unresponsive which it terrible for a game where you need to pick up items or open doors fast. Movement is also very unresponsive it feels very slow clunky and imprecise. Would have expected better performance from this game considering I have a GTX 1080. Framerates is not stable. The UI is poor for example it does not remember the last game mode you selected. I.e. if you were only interested in playing first person you need to manually select it each time. Gun fights feel very clunky and feel very imprecise to compared to other big shooting games. As far as gameplay itself is concerned it's very very slow action wise. There are few moments of actual action. Most of the game is spent walking or driving around finding a gun. Map design is very poor games will often end with you dying to someone peaking behind a tree miles away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game needs to match the ping of players. If a players ping is to long then he shouldnt be aloud to connect. Chinese and Other Asian countries jump on OC server because their servers are full. this should not be a choice. If their server is full they shouldnt then be able to flood the OC server.

But the issues that I have with it that many other people also have with it is that its too buggy and most of the bugs still haven't been addressed in anyway by the developers. And you would think that after being in alpha/beta for almost a year that it when it goes into full launch it should have minimal bugs. I had my fun with this game. But i find that its competitor (fortnite) and its other competitor (H1Z1 realisticly isnt really a competitor because of how dead it is atm) are just better games. Fortnite is less buggy and H1Z1 developers are trying their best to make the game more enjoyable. Overall Buy PUBG if you want its fun.

2018-07-20,0,0,117,False,Not Recommended,Really wanted to like this game but after over 10 hours of laggy gameplay the tech issues finally got to me and I uninstalled it. First what I liked... Closest thing to a battle simulator out there. The realism was what kept me coming back for more. Finally a game that doesn't pamper the player into thinking he's/she's the chosen one. Has great potential the maps were awesome and it's really cool exploring them. Nice weapon selections and design. The way they behave and sound is pretty close to real life.Now the bad stuff... The latency oh dear god the latency! At first I was blown away by the super human reflexes and aim that everyone in the game had except me. Here I am crouching at that perfect spot in an ambush. Player pops up and already knew I was there even though I was silent the whole time. But after I got shot when standing behind a brick wall I wisened up and decided to check. Turns out the best ping I get is well over 300 ms. The only time it goes down to 50ish is when connected to a server in India. All other servers (even those in Asia) are pathetic as best. For those who don't know what latency is it's the time for a movement made on your computer to register on everyone elses. The slower this is the slower you will seem in the game consequently those with better latency will always have an edge.This was further substantiated by death cam replays where the player who killed me is always aiming like 10 15 feet behind me and still hitting me. I realize this could be because of my internet connection too but the fact that other players are facing similar issues proves that it's a system problem. Bluewhatever please fix this!

2018-04-10,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,I've played this game now for almost 90 hours. I had some fun with friends it WAS nice.I'm quite disappointed how bad it actually still runs on a good computer. I would have expected it to be optimized more by now. Waiting for friend to come online can take as much as 3 minutes.I can definitely say that I hate the desert map. There is no way where you can select a map.I hate the way you cannot really control what you pickup from the floor which results in changing pants 10x before picking the weapon you really need. You can also press 'TAB' but then you won't see your surroundings.I get tired of having to wait more than a minute before every game and than spending another minute or two in a plane or in the sky before the game actually starts. There are some bugs in this game are not acceptable getting stuck in the world invisible walls while driving and there is a bug in which you won't get your BP after a game.Speaking of which you played a lot of battles trying to collect as much BP as you can for a chest. Only to find out you need to BUY a key of 2 00 to open the chest.And last but not least cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-21,0,0,184,False,Not Recommended,When this game first came out it was super fun and a change of pace. However now that time has passed I have lost that feeling. PUBG seems to have gotten too cocky with what they are doing resulting in them neglecting this game. First off there are so many areas where this game is broken and they still have yet to fix them. Rather than doing this PUBG Corp. wants to add new content into the game to try and distract everyone from the issues. The issue with this is that it is pretty difficult to enjoy new content WHEN THE GAME IS BROKEN. I have been a fan of this game for a long time but with the recent blatant hacking and PUBG doing barely anything about it I have been completely tunred off of this game. If its on sale for $5 sure pick it up with friends and get a couple hours of entertainment out of it. Other than that I dont see this game being worth it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

(Houseguest reference) This game is a BLAST but there are bugs that have been around for the longest time that need to be addressed. I mainly play this in duo or squads with friends and we enjoy our time (most of the time) fragging together. One of the biggest things is the crazy amount of desync this game has...Holy cow...So many times I've been shot while in cover or behind walls due to desync. You just have to laugh and say screw it and move on. There are MX but its all cosmetic so there is no reason to spend money if you don't want to after you purchaseOverall this is a very fun game when playing with friends and I would recommend it to all my friends if they want some BR action.

It seems like every gun you get is either a SMG or a shotgun. When you use the gun it isn't in fully automatic mode which means if you forget to awitch the firing you'll be using a SMG that only shoots one bullet at a time. The game should be 5 dollars instead of 30. They didn't even put the game on sale during the steam winter sale. The game feels like a 30 dollar beta instead of a complete game.

2018-07-11,0,0,156,False,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale shooter which can be played in first or third person perspective.

When you start a match you are dropped onto a large island by plane. Where you are dropped is up to you though since you can jump from the drop plane at any point and decide where to land with your parachute. From this point the rat race begins as you hurry to find any means to defend yourself against other players that may have dropped near you. You simply never know what around the next corner. So being well prepared is a good idea and be prepared for the worst at that. You can find a variety of weapons at the numerous locations on the island from machetes to assault rifles. Aside from weapons you can find different ways of protecting yourself in the form of helmets and bullet proof vests. These come in 3 different levels of protection. You'll need these to give you the edge over the competition so finding level 3 protective gear is in your best interest. Speaking of survivability you can find various types of healing items aswell. When you take heavy fire but manage to escape by the skin of your teeth these items will help you get back on your feet and continue the fight. You have your standard med kits but there are also energy drinks which replenishes your health over time and can even give you a movement speed boost if you chug away enough of them. Vehicles are also present and will be needed to escape groups of hostile players and the dreaded blue circle which you will be running from over the course of a match. This blue circle will shrink in size as the game goes on and being outside the blue circle will drain your health. Not so much in the beginning but as the circle gets smaller the damage over time also increases. Therefore the circle is super important to keep you eye on later in the game. It forces the players closer and closer together and will ultimately force a confrontation between the last standing players. Being one of the last survivors really puts you on edge and you'll want to win especially if you've come this far. As if the blue circle and all the players out to get you weren't enough on occasion red circles will appear on the map. These indicate that this particular zone will be bombed. If you find yourself in this zone your best bet is seeking shelter indoors or getting out of it ASAP. You can imagine all these element make for a fun and addictive gameplay loop and it will make you want to go for another round to get that elusive #1 spot. Playing with friends is the best way to experience most multiplayer games and this one is no exception. Being able to strategize with your team and plan your next move as the circle is closing in is a very satisfying experience and one that pays off. That said the game is not perfect and suffers from some lag issues from time to time. There are also instances where you can get stuck on the environment or take unnecessary damage trough some wonky hitboxes and physics. These things can happen from time to time and can certainly diminish your enjoyment of the game. Especially when you are on a losing streak and you get a cheap death trough one of the game's many bugs. Be mindful of that but let it also be known that the core game is a ton of fun regardless. When all works well you can have a blast and you'll find the hours flying by as you keep pushing yourself to be number one. Be it solo or as a team you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as you try and survive and end up on top and get that famous chicken dinner!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-11,0,0,116,False,Not Recommended,Honestly they need to do something about server connection with this f#cking game. Every time there's an update for the game or at random times the servers are down for hours. This is the only game that I play that has this many issues with connectivity.Also the lootbox system is offensive as hell. Usually how it goes is that you can buy lootboxes for cosmetic items or play enough and recieve in game currency to buy them. I've always felt that system was fair for multiplayer games. With this one however first you pay for the lootbox then you pay for the key to open it. That is such utter horsecrap.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Automatic guns by default has semi auto mode on which is bit unusual and annoying. Ofc you can get used to it but when you get SMG the last thing you can think of that it will not spray enemies in close quarters but just shoot like pistol . (Add 1500 rpm sniper rifle mode by default to balance this crazyness haha).Overall I think marketing of this game is excelent but game itself is just ""playable"" and not worth the money.

THE PERFORMANCE NEEDS TO BE FIXED close quarter gunfights are unbearable FPS average when taking fire is like 20fps and often capable of dropping bellow 10fps for the duration of being fired upon. I'd recommend this game to everyone if they can just fix their before they call it 1.0 this game seems like it just came out of alpha barely on beta stage. Red dot recticle also appears as a very distracting + throughout the entire optical more often than not significantly disadvantaging my capability of engaging the opposition if I only have a red dot available as it it obscures your view.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

How do people have fun playing a game where they aren't doing anything other than running around and letting a program do the rest for them?

I don't care if I win and I don't care if I lose I just liked playing with my friends and enjoying the stupid moments we had. What I absolutely cannot stand for is the fact that the hacking issues have present from even before the game left early access to now and more than likely untill the end of time.The game devs like to make you think that they are taking care of the issue by handing out reports of an unreasonable amount of accounts they have blocked that were linked to hacking in game or lawsuits they filed against those selling the hacking programs. But what they continue to refrain from doing is IP bans on said hackers or region locks to keep the area responsible for a vast majority of the issues that most players have away and confined. They would lose too much money if they did that being that it's much more profitable for them to force the banned player to make a new steam and rebuy their game to play again and letting them run rampant through all the servers gives more players the chance to suffer and report the hackers resulting in even more meaningless bans.These people do not care their game has made them all the money they could have asked for and then some. Remeber when they said micratransactions wouldn't be a part of this game till it left early access? Or even better how they called this game E sports ready....This game and it's developers are a joke.

2017-09-03,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,It's a fun game. Even better if you win but that always seems to evade me.That is what I said when I made my original review back in September 2017. Pretty much when the game was in its prime. However I just wanted to say a few more things about this game. I haven't played in a long time but that's because I don't have much drive to keep playing.I kinda stopped before hacking became a big problem a little while after 1.0 released and everyone still liked it so I never delt with hackers (as far as I know of). But every match felt the same. I land and try to find a gun I kill others in the area and look for more weapons and players while the circle is decreasing. I thought maybe I just needed to change tactics so instead of the ambusher and stalker style I played the aggressor. Still didn't feel that much different.Now I am bad at this game. I always have been and that's probably a big factor but it just seems to random. I check a house and find a crowbar and armor while that guy next door found an smg and guns me down. It seems out of my control and I keep wondering what's the point. I never won a game and I don't have interest in trying again.It is a fun game and I do see why people liked it so much back in the day but the fun wore out for me even before all the technical issues and hacking problems. I have the same feelings about fortnite but at least that game is more stable than pubg ever was and the devs seem to give a crap about their game and their community. I know I'm in the minority here but battle royal just seems to random for me to keep trying to win. Just my 2 cents though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now I understand that all battle royales are fun and even but still some of them have OP weapons over the other that just destroy you in some hits I understand the difference between Ar's Sniper's Shotgun's ect.

Something needs to be done about that but they're not going therefore this game is going to tank hard. As soon as they made it so you could buy and sell loot crates on steam people started hacking so they could make miniscule ammounts of money playing the game.

This may be true but I have played both on NA &amp SA without encountering a single hacker since I started playing. The second issue seems to be about skins and crates. PEOPLE IT'S JUST COSMETICS PLS! I'm sick of complaints on the fact that we have to pay for cosmetics when they are completely useless in game. All it does is make you look good.Secondly I want to note that yes the game in it's current state is not at it's best. Yes devs don't quite listen to the community. Optimization is actually amazing considering that I had a intel pentium and could still run the game at 15 20 fps constant on lowest settings.Finally don't listen to all the negative reviews you can have so much fun playing this game.

2017-08-11,0,0,726,True,Not Recommended,This game's idea is amazing and the concept as adicting and fun. But the who ever wrote the code for the game is horrible. the mechanics are awefull. the close range combat is garbage because of how laggy character motion looks on screen. They developed this on the unreal engine but still found a way to make it stupidly demanding on the CPU instead of the graphics card. which makes the over all game just aweful to play. you will crash. you will lag when the game starts resulting in your death. It just seems like who ever wrote the code and design the mechanics have never developed a game before. its soo unprofesionally done. This game has to be the most poorly optimized product I have ever seen for a game who's graphics look like it was made for the first xbox. some year 2000 games look better than this does and can run on old systems yet my GTX 1080 w/ i7 proccessor some times can't handle it. that on top of the servers being god awefull and lagging you out makes some of the experience seem not worth booting up. i write all this before it releases because it comes out tomorrow. i cannot believe they will this game in its Garbage state. that being said... pubg is best aweful game I have ever played. Im not recommending becuase the developers should be embarrased at the lack of optimization of this game for when it releases. .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-02,0,0,1060,False,Not Recommended,This game could be a great game and it has the addictive game flow we all love i use to love to play BUT now it seems that killing a guy is all luck maybe that game u get a good connection to server and you kill ppl most the time not all as i am not a god i die from 5ft around a corner. one game last week i died inside a building almost all the way up the stairs to a guy outside the building to the left behind a wall. 7m in and still on aws cloud servers after they've made so much off the game they could be on dedicated servers by now or atleast let hosting site get server files so we can buy our own dedicated servers. And banning ppl who speack out or are stream snipers ha this is ridiculous you cant even prove this unless its completely obvious on stream. Then the rule of conduct are the rule of a high school and u cant enforce them if u did the player base would die and the game would fail every lobby 10 ppl break that with name calling and racism so you game would be dead.EDIT Game awesome fun time Server ha do i even need to speak about thisactually yes the hit reg/desync is the worst ive ever seen and u want survey of gun balance update ok let me see o 30 rounds scar no bullet count we cant give u feed back on that can we stop pandering to the 1% with fiber internet. EASY fix open file for server hosting companies uve made 1b + off game and still with the mincraft servers come bluehole server hosting is free for u company will pay u for the rights to use ur game/ file to get more buisness for them and its a win all around for everybodyFanboys Stop with the blind following of the game and when some one calls out a issue its ur system broing them is not how the game gets better fanboys kill everything at this rate pubg will be dead and fanboys and hackers will be all that is leftits not ones system (if ppl had brains) y u can dump rounds in ppl and they walk off and u get shot 3 times and die,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-03,0,0,671,True,Recommended,Well after 203 hours into the game and being with the game since its birth I can honestly say at the current state is definitely playable with some deaths and events that happen being questionable. Mainly the bulk of the issues are surrounded by hit registration desync although that has came leaps and bounds some vehicle lag in certain situations and the occasional parachute lag and the latency when you open doors at the beginning of the game. With that being said they have also added a lag switch detector to minimize the chance of people being able to use a lag switch and if I recall an overlay that will run behind the game that is looking for ESP and spinbots as well as other hacks. I love the guns in the game each gun has its own feel and action to it that you will more than likely grow accustomed to a few weapons depending on your playstyle. Do you wanna play CQB when the zone gets small or run a sniper rifle for long range engangments? That's a choice that you have to make depending on the zone and how its collapsing to the end play zone and what kind of position you have on the map as well as what your teammates are running.Loot crates make the game more dynamic as well camp the crate and try to pick people off or make a run for it and hope for the best. The weapons also have tons of attachments that add another dimension to the game being able to choose your sight and barrel attachment.Right now I would give the game an 8/10 with the last two points missing because of overall server optimization and some in game bugs that are being ironed out. The game is being supported by an awesome team over at Bluehole and there are weekly patches as well as one large monthly patch.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-27,0,0,51,True,Recommended,"Hello.OK. So after playing it for a week this my rating for this game in its current status 7.75To raise that rating I think...Some major points should be Improve performance. This is very important otherwise a big number of players will not be able to play (buy) the game. No one enjoys a low quality lagged gameplay. Improve physics on vehicles. Its current physics are bringing disturbing bugs / gameplay. Add a new map/s with completely different locations and atmosphere. I know the current one is so big but in the end it's the same and some variation would definitely help.Some important points should be Improve damage caused by guns (not 10 gunshots to kill someone in short range) and/or create a ""hardcore"" mode. (I know this has already been said). Hardcore mode should be first person camera only. Make sure that long distanced enemies are surrouned by properly loaded textures. It's very important because this game aims to offer a realistic survival. Add more weather effects / time of the day for new map. Night survival with thermal / night viewer would be awesome. Add wild life (animals) to some parts of the map/s. I've seen some birds as fact. Some cows or such would be great and also could cause distraction / noise. More realism. Add more weapons / technical war elements. Add different type of games capture the flag find and eliminate etc. Keep the weapon spawn ratio low. We don't want this game to turn into a CoD.These are just some suggestions sure I could make the list longer. Anyways this is a good game in its current status is playable and it seems that (as I hope) it will be improved more and frequently.To me this could be the definitive realistic survival game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-15,0,0,100,True,Not Recommended,"I still play this game. I also still enjoy it. But I cannot tell anyone it is worth buying. Bluehole and Plunk seem to only care about ""Hyping"" this game up. They are adding another map adding new towns to the current map. But they are completely ignoring critical issues that the game has.Combat is trash This includes everything from Player movement to firing a weapon. Landing a punch is the equivalent to trying to hit someone with a foam pool noodle. You swing but you dont really know when or where it will land.They are working on adding Vaulting to the game but at this point people have waited so long that it doesn't even matter that much. We have mastered the ""PUBG Parkour"".The guns are not too bad. I mean really how can you mess that up. The biggest problem with guns is aiming inside of a vehicle. It is absolute cancer. I swear being in the passenger seat while trying to aim a gun you would think you had Parkinson's. For people that play in First Person only it is even worse because they don't have the option(at least I dont think they do) to use the 3rd person aiming. Which while it would make your accuracy slightly worse at least you wont have an epileptic seizure while doing so.Hackers? I have seen a lot of complaints about cheaters but I cannot with honesty say that I have noticed or experienced them for myself. There was one moment when me and 2 of my friends got sniped on a rooftop a ridiculous distance away by an UMP. I don't want to straight up claim that was cheating but at that distance either it was cheating or Bluehole needs to fix the UMP. Because an ump should not be that effective at that range.Rewards for playing/Reasons for playing We can laugh about this. The only reason to play is to have fun here. That is the way it should be for any game. The only reward system is in the form of Battlecoins(or whatever they are called) and they can be used to buy some loot crates. Inside those crates you will find cosmetic items that take the award for ""Most Lackluster Experience"". I have opened about 7 crates myself. I currently have a Hat 3 black tank tops 2 Black Combat Pants and a couple striped shirts. woo.About the Devs LOL! No seriously where are they? We don't get anything from them other then the periodic Map update that seems like it will never come. And the continuous post poning of the vaulting system. It seems Bluehole and Plunk thought it would be a good idea to start working on a generic money grabbing korean mmo(a review for another time) rather than focus their resources on this game.Overall Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a buggy mess developed by people that have no sense of priority. You will not be rewarded for your gameplay other then with terrible loot chests that have the worst RNG in any loot crate you will ever find. HOWEVER! Just like a bottle of cheap wine the taste may be bad but you will still get drunk and have fun. So if you value the having fun part over a completed game with trustworthy devs it is all for you.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-06,0,0,112,False,Recommended,Despite what everyone says about Chinese hackers this game is amazing. I play on oceanic servers and the amount of times I ve come across these low life s is little to none. The game itself is beautiful such an addicting style of gameplay that ll have you analysing your kills and your deaths to try and find a better way of doing it. Frustrating as when you get killed in the first 2 minutes of one game and then the next you last until the top 10 30 minutes into game. I think it s this fact that everyday people can make it big in games simply due to the unpredictability of the games R&amp G. This is what keeps people coming back. For the hope that the next game will be better than the last. And cannot forget about that feeling you get when you get your first chicken dinner.

2018-01-06,0,0,162,False,Not Recommended,its been since march 2017 that this game has been in EA now its full release. an there has been nearly 2mil bans already. i play on the north american server because its my region (duh) but i have to deal with hackers every match. an none of them are from the NA region. all hackers come from the AS server. battle eye proved it with over 85% of hackers banned was from the AS region. so as long as there is no region lock an no real actions took to hinder hackers.. this game will be trash. ive waited long enough for the devs to do something. but you rather line your pockets with all the hackers constanly re buying your TRASH CAN game. on top of it you won t give out refunds. but will sell the same hacker another copy of pubg on a new account.. START IP BANNING!

2018-03-07,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,Yea yea i have less then a day on record but I have played enough games to know when I dislike something and why. I stopped playing this game a couple months back becuase of the cheating and honestly some poorly optimized mechanics of the game. They recently released a big update (unless a 7 gig update was steam going ) and i have yet to realize any improvement in any feature of the game. The only noticible change though not an improvement was the creation of a new lootbox which of course requires you to buy a key and there goes the freakin cash sink. Really my main issue with this game is the lack of reward for actually being accurate with your shots and the lack of penalty for being inaccurate. Maybe its just a visual bug but there are too many times when the enemies crosshair is not even close to me or their red dot is a whole 6 feet to the right of me and i continue to get shot yet i never manage to have the same luck. Call it recoil randomness but its not like the gun actually seems to change direction or angle. this game is now up to 14 gigs of hard drive space and you cant even easily vault a half wall....April 20th tried it again now uninstalling it everyone knows where you are and you have no clue where anyone else is.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In my hundred hours or so of playing PUBG i have only matched squad with another Filipino once and only very few times with english speakers.Even when try playing in NA and SA servers it's still full of Chinese players.Anyway all the other reviews here about lag is unfair almost all of them don't include their PC specs and internet speed it's unfair for them to give a bad review when their intel atom procie intel HD integrated GPU and low speed internet can't run the game properly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-08,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is not the first battle royale the best battle royale or even a GOOD battle royale game. PUBG is just a stain on gaming with a novel idea but flawed exectution. The game is laggy has no region lock the report system is a joke and you are going to die to a cheater almost all of the time. I wish I could say there were SOME redeeming qualities such as Crates being valued highly but since they are putting keys in a game that is thirty dollars not even that is redeeming.First off this game runs so poor on a gaming computer with all of the settings minimized that it is annoying and frustrating. I have everything at Low and I still will get major lag spikes for no reason at all which is something you should not have happen in a game like this as that can mean Victory or Loss for a player. That makes it so either the lagging player is at disadvantage without being able to retaliate to gunshots or is put at advantage and ruins everyone else's game.Next is how there is a lack of Region Lock keeping people off of the servers where they can basically lag hard enough that they effectively can win the match through teleportation from the lag. You will often tell who these players are by their habit of eating through an entire clip of your gun then somehow being behind you and killing you.The Report System in theory is supposed to allow players who were wronged to report those who cheated have an offensive username or teamed up with another player to kill you. In reality however the system has shown no evidence of working with players using it to hopefully have the hacker banned or take away all BP or SOMETHING but there is no support nobody who got banned that we know of.This allows the Cheaters to run rampant through the game. A telling factor is how a lot of players can either shoot a gun with no recoil whilst having no attachments on it making it so that SCAR L that they had was basically a godsend. There is also the people who will spawn themselves weapons then snap to a headshot there are people who have god mode enabled and can eat bullets like nobody else and there are people can shoot you before they see you.Crates even are a bad factor of this game. You saved up 700 BP from your games win or loss. You are feeling happy to get this crate Desperado Crate... You must purchase a $2.50 key to open this crate where you won't recoup the cost unless you happen to get lucky. Overall PUBG is a game that knocks you down by taking $30 for a bad game and if you want to recoup the cost from the game with crates you are going to wish you never paid the money as it will take so long to grind out the crates with all that is wrong. Read through the other reviews you will see ""Hackers everywhere"" and ""Region Lock China"" to prove that it isn't just a ""bad"" player trying to make myself seem good. We all either have problems with hackers and the lack of Region Lock or we are hackers or use region lock. Do not trust the good reviews if they are not addressing anything with the game and even then do not always trust the reviews that say it is good besides the fact of it being full of hackers. This game should not make money anymore H1Z1 is completely free now and Fortnite is free and they are 100% free to play with Cosmetics being the only items on sale.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-28,0,0,450,True,Recommended,Awsome game. Never had any expierience with battle royale (who comes up with these names anyway) but a friend got it and he kept playing so I've decided to take a peak...and so I've got lured and hooked. Game while still in early access is already very enjoyable. Rules are simple you jump out of perfectly good airplane along with up to a hundred other guys and gals naked in terms of any equipment and you rush towards the ground so that you can pick up as many tools of individual distruction as posible as soon as posible. Then it's just you (or you and up to 3 other team mates) against the world on an evershrinking battleground. If you are looking for another clone of CoD where you rush troughout the battlefield spraying bullits as if they were seeds well that's not it. Here you have to be patient clever and a bit lucky too. There is no camping in this game only tacktical ambushing. Due to early access the game is still a bit faulty when it comes to techicalities and ugly too (then again it's one of those games which you want to play on the lowest settings anyways). Can be a bit frustrating when after several minutes of gathering equipment you die because of a nasty lag. Optimisation is not its strongest point either but the developers are working on it and they do publish weekly updates that do improve the expierience. Besides even if you do get killed by a lag your vains will be filled with adrenaline and you will jump to another session right away. If you are looking for something different than mainstream CoD clones where tacktics matters and adrenaline builds up like crazy this might just be it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-15,0,0,612,False,Not Recommended,After one year the frustration overweighs the positive effects.Generally the game is very exciting but the following problems make a long term usage quite annoying Biggest problem is the fighting system. This includes problems of visibility from different angles (TPP) and the hit box. Sometimes you see and shoot at players but because of glitches you cannot hit them. Though you get hit by them. Biggest problem is the damage dealt by weapons. The game is very unrealistic in this regard. You can shoot somebody in the head/face from 1m with a pistol and the guy is NOT dead immediately. Or shots to the neck should be fatal too. This frustrates many many times. The game play is very exciting at the beginning because 1. u don't know the map 2. u don't really know how to shoot because you have no possibility to train. However once you managed to become good with the weapons and know all the good spots you have to decide whether you want to have fun (shooting) or win (looting and avoiding fights). If you go for confrontation chances are very high that you'll never reach top positions and die at an early stage. If you go for the last circle you are basacly sprawling around for half an hour with almost no enemy contact. Though what is VERY ANNOYING is that if you go for the low key game mode you might get shot at a random point and just die with the best equipment. Thus you played for nothing. If everything goes well you make it to the end and get a chicken dinner with 1 3 kills. No thanks It is of course good if a game gets extensions/improvements. However I cannot count how many GB i have downloaded for PUBG and the main points (except frame rate which as actually only improved because rendering has been reduced dramatically to object within a few meters) is still very poor (s. fighting mode etc.). Balances of weapons shift. So there is no continuity. Still waiting every time 1 minute to start the game??? Once 90 is reached the game should start within 10 secondsPro Cheating has been reduced very wellAt the beginning very exciting. (However then it wears off and eventhough you get frustrated you play it more out of habit/addiction then enjoyment)..Summary PUBG has been one of the biggest promises but also one of the biggest fails. It has it's moments but if you want to go for points and statistics you'll get annoyed by the many bugs and imbalances. If you go for fun you'll never make a chicken dinner.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-31,0,0,285,False,Not Recommended,EDITED AGAIN They cannot get optimization right. This game should be passed on as a result. I do not regret the time I have played but would not reccomend this to anyobdy now. The developers are greedy and have not fixed the underlying issues with the game before adding more and more loot crates. Totally without merit and overall a bad move from a studio that has one game to focus on.Developer is having issues fixing de synch and poor optimization leading to constant issues in close quarters firefights. Often times it seems like people kill you before you even see them around a corner. The game is fun but highly frustrating right now due to overall stability issues. Honestly it is quite a disapointment considering the popularity of the game. Don't buy until it is fixed if they ever fix it at all (early access devs tend to cut and run with their games...),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It might seem like cheaters are the culprit if you die in an instance but thats the game. Check your deathcam ....I have been playing since the early days and it's still loads of fun. Updates are getting slower some bugs are still ingame but thats about it. Running this on a 1070 with a 3770k on 2560x1080 and performance is 60fps+ (usually around 80).

2017-12-20,0,0,593,True,Recommended,"PUBG is characterized by long periods of quiet mixed with frantic brutal quick firefights often in cluttered urban environments. This is not the meatgrinder all fight all the time of COD this is a much more tactical game. If you want to win you need to learn to watch and to wait and to know when to move. You need to learn not to take every shot you see. Sometimes the best move is just to let somebody drive on by and get lit up by the next guy down the road.Does PUBG have problems? Yeah I guess. The occasional hacker some lag for the first minute or two of every match but nothing that makes it unplayable.Every time somebody asks me if PUBG's worth buying I tell them ""Are you okay with occasinally getting shot in the head by a guy 500m away who you had no real chance to see?""

Hit registration has gotten wrose somehow lag compensation is trash and theres no signs of it being fixed. I enjoy this game I enjoy it more than any other battle royale game..... when the factors of Laggy asians and a mass amount of hackers (which just all of the sudden appeared after 1.0 release?) are subtracted. I would still recommend it as its a very thrilling experience and kills feel more rewarding than other battle royale games but just pray you don't get hackers in your lobby.... its possible but rare now. And as for the laggy asians well half of them are hackers and you can't avoid them. So have fun with that side. Do not buy if you expect rage free gameplay.Because before they fix the hacking problem porting this to XBOX PS4 Mobile and your ing toaster is a priority to PUBG Corp.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-06-12,0,0,343,False,Not Recommended,They keep releasing new content when they need to focus on optimizing the game. Matches are inconsistent as this game has a lot of RNG. Hit detection is flawed. Servers are consistently laggy. A lot of hackers who ruin the game. The game was fun at first but once they involved the market with skins it ruined the game. Just like every other game now theres the loot box gambling BS. I wouldn't recommend playing the game at this time until they fix their,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-21,0,0,358,False,Recommended,A very solid game that defines an eraAlthough this isn't the first battle royale style game I believe it is the best and most true to the formula as it was created by the father of battle royale. Now don't get me wrong it is not perfect and I'm not just praising it for its creator. Graphically it is very realistic and is certainly the best graphics wise of any battle royale game. Obviously it has its issues sometimes however personally I am a huge fan of the art style. Now bear in mind it is not optimized the best so you're gonna need a pretty decent graphics card for the max settings but it's worth it.Now this wouldn't be a PUBG review without talking about crashes hm? Personally since the full release I've only experienced two or three crashes which I am fine dealing with. I know others have dealt with a lot especially on poorer quality hardware. Hopefully the gang at Bluehole continues to improve this as it is probably this game's biggest issue. Other notable aspects include the gunplay. Automaticv guns have learnable spray patterns in the vein of CS which I like. It makes the skill ceiling quite high as you must be able to use any weapon you get since there's never a guarantee you can get the gun you want.Overall score 9/10. A personal favorite high skill game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-21,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,"Before I bought PUBG a friend told me ""if you don't find a scope you are screwed"" and that couldn't be more true. So a huge portion of being successful depends on RNG and not actual skill. If someone has a sniper rifle with a scope and all you have is a carbine with optics you are done unless they are really bad. Event modes only last a few days which is silly. Why not make more game modes permanent? No weather Always light never dusk or night. If someone throws a grenade and you are turned around you will not hear it even if it goes off directly behind you. That goes for both frag grenades and stun grenades. Stun grenades will have no effect on you if you aren't looking directly in it's direction. Hit detection is just stupid. You can head shot someone with a pistol from 100 yards away but miss an entire mag from a M16 from 20 feet. Vehicles rolling back onto you. When you leave a vehicle you can somehow end up ""in the way"" of what you were driving or riding it. It makes absolutely no sense. Driving or riding in vehicles is absolutely nauseating. If you play in FPP which a lot of people do now then good luck with the field of view while driving and I wish you even more luck if you attempt to ride in and defend a vehicle while doing so. It will hurt your eyes and head. Never ending updates. Literally every single day there is an update. This might not seem like a big deal but before the majority of them you'll have to restart your computer to get them to start downloading. Why this happens to some people is unknown. Update times are Wednesday night at 7pm PDT. To have that as your server downtime is yet another boggling thing about PUBG. Region resetting to Asia after major updates and/or server maintenance. After every match when you exit back the menu the default solo and third person are selected. That may not seem like a big deal but when you constantly play squad and first person then you always have to select that and be careful not to start the ""default"" selected game mode. If you play PUBG and then close Steam and decide to play PUBG later you will again have to restart your computer. This doesn't happen to everyone but it does to me and many others.I've only had the game for a few weeks now and have 30 hours played but I don't think it should take anyone five minutes to think of at least ten things that are wrong with a game. PUBG is better than any other game in the genre but still has a long way to go before I would recommend anyone pay full price for it or invest hundreds of hours into it. It has honestly already about run it's course with me when it comes to being fun. I look forward to the next best game of this type to come out down the line because all the issues aside PUBG is honestly can be fun if you play just for fun and overlook the things you will find wrong with it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-07,0,0,93,False,Not Recommended,I've had nothing but issues from the moment i purchased this game. Apart from being poorly optimised the game simply will NOT work no matter what I try. At first it was just connectivity issues with the make and model on my router instantly blocking any traffic from the game for some 3 months I'm not using that router anymore but it wouldnt suprise me if it wasn't fixed. I've had a fresh install of windows 10 with a brand new SSD and it wont even get past the title screen. It crashes as often as an early acess title if not more. This company is as poorly run as any I've ever seen. They focus more on getting asmany people playing as they can to get as much money as possble instead of just FIXING the versions of the game that already exist. It's beyond pitiful. It's downright criminal. F*** the PUBG corporation. I've spent 75 hours playing this game and half of that haven't seen a fully finished game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
