2016-11-09,0,0,275,False,Not Recommended,Man I've been a fan of Rockstar Games from a very young age. With the release of Grand Theft Auto V I thought it was groundbreaking and the best thing for next gen games.With Take Two's recent decision that I'm sure they will regret in time. You can't have any mods whatsoever. The whole purpose of PC gaming to me is to have a mod friendly environment. I'd only have things like retextures to make my game's graphics look higher than they should be.Online... From the start online was incredible. Money wasn't hard whatsoever. Some missions would give you a payout of $30k robbing stores would give you $14K. Updates after updates It's clear as day Rockstar has sold out and wants you to buy their awful shark cards. Want to rob a store? Enjoy the $2K and impossible police chase that builds up. I put nearly all of my online money into a business that looked promising and to help out players that don't have much money. It's not worth it. You need to drive a slow truck or van to pick up cargo and drive back to a warehouse HOPING that a player won't try to destroy you to get XP from you. As I was saying with helping out new players. All the hours of work to build up a normal warehouse will give them about $30K. Way too much grinding. Online is fun... If you're rich. And the only rich people are the ones who played online from the start. If you're new? Don't support the shark cards. Anyone who is rich that wasn't from the start had a modder shoot loads of money bags at them or randomly received $9M out of nowhere undetected. The game is all about crime for crying out loud.What is unfortunate about my online expereince is that one of my single player mods resulted in me getting my character with $2M completely wiped and suspended for a month. Want to reason with Rockstar and prove that you weren't modding or doing anything whatsoever? Not a possibility unfortunately. It's very sad to see what Rockstar has done to their online community compared to GTAIV and Red Dead Redemption.Now back to Take Two. I don't see what they will get out of banning single player mods as you can see with reviews several people are very unhappy about this. It's also sad that Rockstar so far has kept quiet. Rockstar surely can't be for Take Two's decision as they started from making a modified version of a game and supported the modding community for so long. Seeing that their being harsh on modders compared to their laidback approach in the beginning makes me lose hope in any future game to come. This isn't exactly ''protecting online''.My opinion PC gaming is all about singleplayer mods. Modifying the game to your liking. Making it your own. No mods is just going to make this game die out in my opinion.Rockstar don't do this to us.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,"The PC Version of GTA is all about Modding. Cutting that away is a realy bad move. I preordered the XBox360 Version and the PC Version of this Game so i payed 130 but apparently i've been ""undermonitized"" and a CEO that dosen't even play games thinks that microtransactions is the way to go instead of a complete good Game.The online mode of this Game was a mess from the start glitchers and hackers everywhere. Now Take 2 bans the modding scene and the one mod that strictly affects ONLY the singleplayer mode because they think it could harm their precious Money Making Machine which is the multyplayer. The Money it makes comes strictly from kids that are to lazy to play the actual game so they just buy ingame money with real money. So Take 2 does not only adress the issues the game has on their side very slowly or not at all(wich makes hacking and glitching possible in the first place) they actively attract cancerous players for the sake of milking even the last few cents out of this game.It is sad for the crative team at Rockstar that sits behind this masterpiece and no doubt about it the singleplayer IS a masterpiece of gaming. But the greedy money hungry people in suits at Take 2 that just can't get enough ruined thos otherwise brilliant game.Under this circumstances i will never buy any Take 2 game ever and i strongly recomend the same to anyone that loves gaming and good games.",Grand Theft Auto V

The reason me and many others have brought this same game for the THIRD TIME.

Offline modding...Quite frankly I almost dropped the game completely until i read that the ban was lifted shortly after. Paying 60$ to primarily play offline with the infinite possibilities that mods give was my intention when buying this game. Not online cash shop demoralizing grind fest until yu buy shark card money and shet. MMORPG style gta is disgusting. I want to PLAY not WORK.(Edit)And now I notice that we can't spawn like 50% of the good cars in the game in single player mode (with the mod trainer) unless we install more mods/work arounds etc.Rockstar is literally trying to diminish the appeal of single player gta 5 so we'll play online instead.

If you want a game where you can literally do anything you want from beating up people to racing to stealing cash cars guns and drugs then this is the game for you. If not its probably still one of the best games out there. I play this game with my family I enjoy most sessions except for when some dirtbag is modding and kiling us all(20% of the time). This game pushes my pc harder looks better and has more content than any game released ever. you can go watch a movie tv throw snowballs hack computers and fly helicopters or even jets. I have a jetpack lowriders and a garage full of motorcycles. You can take selfies. Try it you will not regret it except for the worlds most annoying intro(after you have had to play it eleven times).

2015-04-18,0,0,241,False,Recommended,I have bought this game on three diffrent systems Xbox 360 PS4 and now PC. As expected PC is better than both. Even though I had already completed the story missions twice before I didn't feel bored completing it for a third and final time. The story is great it provides great entertainment and hours worth of fun. You can play as three main chracters each with hugely diffrent personalities this helps to keep the story intresting. You also have side missons called Strangers and Freaks missions for each chracter. Even without the story the singleplayer still provides plenty to do such as exploring the beautiful city and the breath taking surrounding area. You won't run out of things to do on GTA V.GTA V also comes with GTA Online which allows you to play with your friends or complete strangers this adds extra hours of entertainment the online is much better than GTA IV's. GTA Online uses a seperate chracter for online activities (obviously) and this chracter can do missons for various chracters to gain exp and level up. Now GTA Online includes heists which are amazing to play but require a team of 4 to complete(bar the first mission which requires 2). These heists help add even more hours of entertainment to the game.Now to the graphics I play the game on high at about a median of 50fps. I would say the game the game is well optimized and doesn't provide too much of a challenge to run. If intrested or if you want to compare my specs are AMD FX 8320 Nvidia GeForce GTX 760 8gb DDR3 RAM(1600mhz) Even for returning players GTA V introduces director mode and rockstar editor this allows you to film and edit your own movies a great addition to the PC version. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v qHkKY1PITU0 example of director mode here.

2017-11-25,0,0,577,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an big game which contains a lot of details. There are tons of things you can do both in the offline and online mode.The gameplay in both modes are excellent smooth and fun. However Rockstar (in my opinion) let us down by the way they optimalised stuff. Pros Excellent gameplay Tons of things to do in both offline and online mode Ability to install mods in offline mode Ability to have fun and drink beer with your friends in online mode Ability to grow bigger and bigger in online mode by buying buisinesses and expand your (car boat plane etc.) fleet Frequent updates on the online game mode (for free)Cons The loading screen (sometimes) takes ages to load (or even worse it'll never finish loading) The anti cheat isn't as it should be in 2017 They do ban cheaters but unfortunately they also ban players who never cheated No updates on the story mode or anything in offline mode.Conlusion It's a good game. If they spend energy in optimizing the loading screens and work on adding a good anti cheat the game would be the best game ever.,Grand Theft Auto V

But no. what we want go buy shark cards.

2018-01-03,1,1,248,False,Recommended,Not really sure how to review GTA 5 but here I go (I had over 200 hours on GTA on disk before I got the steam version so calm down when looking at my hours)GTA online is the only reason the game is still thriving to this day. There are so many new releases that make it so interesting to play. The downside to these releases is that with new releases comes overpowering weapons and vehicles. There is no easy way to stop these vehicles unless you have one yourself or simply find another lobby. There are H E A P S of modders in online. This can make the game so much better or make it hell for you. Majority of the time they're all relaxed and give out money drops which can be very useful since EVERYTHING IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Moving onto the money part EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE! I would say im fairly experienced in GTA and don't struggle with the money side of it but newer players will find it soooooo hard to get decent vehicles and weapons. (Don't give into buying shark cards!)Overall GTA can be either a very fun and addictive game or you hate it due to modders and the whole absolutely everything is expensive problem. Buy the game and im sure you wont regret it. Just don't expect to get everything quickly it takes time! ),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,"This is my first and likely to be my only ever Steam review of a game but given current events I felt it necessary to say something.First things first GTA V is a good game all in all. It provides for hours of hijinks and entertainment but can easily become monotonous. GTA Online had the potential to be a repreive from this monotony but was handeled with such greed and a complete and blatant disregard for its audiance that it's frankly insulting.The ""gameplay"" offered by GTA Online is based entirely around a grind for cash and RP for leveling and many gameplay elements are blocked out to the player unless they have enough cash or a high enough level. This not only serves to prolong this feeling of monotony but also stips the gameplay of any of the fun that could be acheived in the singleplayer.This is only worsened by the games use of microtransactions ""graciously"" allowing players to skip the ridicilous and unnecessary grind by rewarding the player with cash and RP in exchange for ridicilous amounts of real money. For instance the price of a yacht in in game currency is $8 00 000 which translates to either dozens of hours spent in game grinding or $100 in real world currency.GTA Online is also completely hostile to new players new players lacking the necessary level or cash to have access to any decent vehicles weaponry armor housing and vehicle storage have no way to combat the more experienced players or those who chose to pay for their levels and cash. This makes it nearly impossible for new players to advance in the game without having to waste their money on microtransactions as they will not be able to compete with the other players.This monotony could and was eliminated through the use of mods giving the player a potentially indefinite amount of hours of hijinks and entertainment through the hard work of dedicated modders. Unfortunately and what I find has proven to be the nail in this games coffin the game's publisher Take Two issued a cease and desist to OpenIV one of the major modding tools of GTA V used by most of the better mods. Now I am no lawyer so I could be completely off base but from my limited understanding this cease and desist has no actual basis but instead is just an assualt on the modding community and on the fans. Unfortunately independent modders don't have the funds necessary to challenge a multi million publishing company in court so instead they've been allowed to get away with this frankly disgusting behavior.Without mods I cannot honnestly recommend this game nor would I want to and I'd recommend that potential buyers avoid this game for the time being if for nothing more than to send a message to the publishers that we will not tolerate such greed and disgusting underhanded business practices.On another note the keyboard controls or terrible but the game has controller support so it's not that much of an inconvenience.TL DRAvoid this game unless the publishers go back on their current practices and begin to at the very least tollerate the existance of mods.",Grand Theft Auto V

They are liars and cheaters.But the main problem is one dlc in this example cost approximately 400Euro / 446 US Dollar. Mostly other game dlc's costs 15 to 25 Euro / 16 to 30 US Dollar. One Season Pass 40 to 50 Euro / 44 to 55 US Dollar.Thats are facts and the reality of their bussines. Most people do not care about these facts.

I caught a 30 day ban and my character was completely reset for using an overlay for my streaming software (Xsplit).

But when you are a solo player then the vehicles that you want can be grindy to get and you may be force to buy premium currency. The only reason I recomment this game is for its single player.

Reducing the amout of money you could get from sellig a car or completing a mission and skyrocketing the price of everything in the game is completely unfair and made me regret spending money to buy the game.

At the begining rockstar nailed everything they needed to make this game good now they got greedy and started milking it.

2018-01-06,0,0,275,False,Not Recommended,This game as of recently is very disappointing. The prices for items is SO high and the prices keep inflating while at the same time the missions and heists stayed the same or have even been nurffed. As a veteran player I would need to play roughly 50 hours just to make enough money to afford the prerequisites required to play the doomsday heist.Really a shame the dynamic of this game has changed so drastically. It's likely in part to so may people modding and cheating but also more likely a result of pushing people to pay for micro transactions/shark cards.On a side note the shark cars are way over priced. I'd almost consider one if it wasn't so expensive ($USD &gt In Game Currency),Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-06,0,0,376,False,Not Recommended,Enough maybe even too much time spent on the game.Besides CS and some story based games GTA pretty much made my 2015. And the game was great. Free content for online as well as more complex missions and objectives for it. Playing with your friends really took the time off from you and eventually it was night.... or the next morning.Money in online always was a problem for me and my mates. Replaying a heist costs money purchasing an office for the cool jobs costs enough already and the new cars and slick clothing had to come short. And oh boy you don't want to miss out on cars or suits. You really don't.Anyways it was always possible to afford all these items without having to buy the ingame currency with your real cash. And that was a good thing. I pretty much spent enough on skins for CS anyways so SharkCards came short.With the recent updates however items became so incredibly expensive that buying these cards almost became necessary or well it pretty much became necessary. Purchase this bunker to play the new heist. Purchase this. Purchase that. It's not even the fact of new items that are required to play the new content I'm all for it. You needed a high end appartment to start the heists in 2014 but with the increase in pricing you are not able to afford a hangar or a bunker or whatever. It pretty much becomes impossible to achieve all of this without spending real money. Sure you could play the game for thousands of hours and you may be stacked with money. But when I left the game in spring of 2016 and came back a year later I was not able to do a lot with the million I had left.And purchasing some house or bunker is not just enough no being able to enjoy the full experience granted by Rockstar means that you may want to invest 1 or 2 million dollars additionally or more.Don't get me wrong here I absolutely loved the story. Action packed hilarious moments you know. Just some GTA and for Online... Well let's just say I would not have played 320 hours of it if it was not good. But with these DLCs and the pricing of the new items you either have to grind your off for lots of hours just to be able to afford a bunker i.e. and then need to start the grind again just to finish the missions or a new heist whatever.All this leads to me not recommending this game. As much as I used to love it it just became and to be fair boring. I may should have written such a review a few months or maybe even a year ago but anyways.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-29,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,This game is alright. I have owned this game on PC and XBOX 360 and One. I have to say this game is much better on console but having the modding aspect is a game changer. The game looks pretty good and runs good but some of the mechanics are trash. Switching weapons is absoulety dreadful and you sometimes lag out during a mission. This can be super frustrating because you will be in midddle of a heist and then you lag out and the entire thing is cancelled. This has only happened to me twice. Overall the car customization and gun modifying is a blast. So much content in this game it is almost hard to get bored unless you have no money which makes the game boring. And that comes to my next point everything is so expensive now I can not afford a $3 000 000 bunker just so I can play the new heist! I think this game is fun but you better have some friends or download some cool mods to have fun on this game otherwise I think you will find yourself getting frustrated. Anyways that is just my opinion of owning the game since it has came out for xbox and PC,Grand Theft Auto V

The controls are a nightmare (example swimming) and to add insult to injury nothing is explained properly (like how to swim UP). I spent probably half my game time in the key bindings settings trying to figure out how to complete the current quest. Then add the just disastrous decision to have three half baked characters instead of one good one and all the little glitches like quest targets disappearing behind walls. Story is boring as hell compared to older GTAs (e.g. Vice City). For me the second worst GTA of all time (with San Andreas still number one). And instead of a real DLC such as ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"" for GTA IV they keep adding online modes.Oh and by the way the ""world record"" on the airport race is 0.170 seconds at the time of this review. Yes less than a second for two laps around the airport. Basically all the top places in all such modes be it golfing or races or anything are cheated.

So you should just play Campain because you don't have to deal with Modders Getting kicked from heists and there's not alot lag to deal with.

2018-01-08,0,0,95,False,Not Recommended,Ok I finally broke down and got this game because friends playing it. Thank Jebus I only paid 20 bucks for this single player marvel and complete multiplayer hack fest trash. First the main issue... 1.) The developers do NOTHING to stop people from hacking the game2.) It completely stops you from just playing with your friends. every damn mission the game forces you to join public or throws some random joe into your misson. It FORCES you to join public servers and deal with those hackers in order to do ANYTHING with your buisnesses.3.) It only supports MODS in single player. There are some AMAZING MODS for this game like the graphics overhaul mods that are only on your end and in no way affect the game for ANYONE ONE ELSE that are straight up not allowed into online because of rockstars BS controling how you play the game. So in reality the is NO MOD SUPPORT FOR THIS GAME!!!!4.) the SUPER BASIC concept of alowing players to create their own PUBLIC SERVERS allow who they want in their PUBLIC servers and have the ability to browse PUBLIC servers that are online has aparently escaped rock star. THIS alone would have made this game amazing and would have completely looked over the other glaring issues because they really wouldn't be an issue....THIS would eliminate 90% of this ing games problems.5.) STOP AUTO CORRECTING MY HELI FLIGHT AND ALLOW FOR MOUSE AXIS PITCH CONTROL!!!So overall impression of this game. If your looking for an AMAZING singleplayer game that is deep and entraling in it's execution and has SP Mod support... This game is an absolute must...If your looking for a multiplayer even close to most other games basic functionality and options for multiplayer.... STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE,Grand Theft Auto V

Or you make like 50 000 dollars in like 30 minutes but its a pain in the because the AI autoaims and never misses AI spawns ahead of you in missions where you have to protect cars from damage and they start shooting your car up. It's just frustrating overall. Anything worth it is like at least 1 million dollars with the new gunrunning DLC it took me upward of 10mil to get everything and I make like 700 000 every 12 hours which is because you have to be online for it to count.

2017-06-17,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,I own GTAV on X360 X1 and PC... why am I leaving this bad review? It's not specifically about the anti modding support... but that's now a big part of it. My bad review is based on the actual decline of how fun this game has been to me and my friends.On launch 360 a long time ago... I went to a launch party played some gtav with people and came home and actually enjoyed the game offline and it's still fun offline but ... i discovered online after the 100% story mode and really had tons of fun with my friends and then the nerfs and really stupid stuff happened. First it started with nerfing cash payouts for tons of jobs you used to get 18k on hard mode for blowing up 3 trash trucks that were decently far apart. and raiding a compound... now you get maybe 4k for the entire thing. the weapons/ammo you use costs more than 4k.There was the admittedly cheaty mission where you blew up cars in a parking lot and got a quick 25k understandable they made it harder... but then nerfed the entire mission to 10k the car spawned running away and you had to chase it and then take the case and deliver it to martin... all for 10k. 10k honestly will buy you nothing in the game now. Now we have supercars that are 2m+ giant garage's that you have to buy each level of gang warehouses all sorts of new content! but ... all the heists and missions don't pay near enough to actually afford these things you must buy shark cards. Don't get me wrong I understand shark cards support the game as I've bought 2 3 of them myself to support the game... but there's a point when it has to stop. I can't enjoy the game because there's so much content that it's impossible to earn enough money for it all just playing normally and normally meaning not 12 hours a day... The game itself has lots of content lots of great fun to be had... but the structure is gone it's no longer fun because of how stupid and difficult it is to earn anything anymore. I only have 55 hours in the PC version of the game simply because all of my friends stopped long ago and no longer play for the exact same reasons. I hope in the future when the new GTA Online is released it's not this bad... because reading all the reviews just about mod tools makes you realize one thing it's not even the mod tools that was the issue per se... it's the fact said mod tools spawned money players flocked to these 'modders' because making money in GTA Online is ridiculous now and the only way to do anything is through modders. There are still tools out there for this... but I just stopped playing because it's impossible to make enough money to do anything anymore the game is dead and not even because of the open IV issue....,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-30,0,0,318,False,Not Recommended,BLUF (TL DR) Harassed by in game characters calling you constantly to remind you to buy that mere $5 million 'thing'. While you grind along making $5000 here or there on missions. Malevolent modders that treat the online servers as good fun to harass and kill everyone with invulnerable vehicles or teleporting you to the great unknown or deciding to derail your CEO plans by destroying your cargo or spawning items over you. Why? Because they can and in a world where Rockstar cares more about you buying that new 'thing' then maintaining gameplay you won't see anything get resolved soon.My History With The Series Fanboy LevelI've played the GTA series since its inception. I remember losing hours playing the previous installments and even more hours with MTA and SAMP. You would think with this type of history I'm probably a fanboy and for the most part I would agree with you. However this game has broken that winning tradition.Game Mechanics Spot On Great Mechanics and Physics.The game mechanics at least for me are spot on. The flying driving swimming physics are all great. In single player the game is a winner however the sustainment of this game is through it's online component and that's where it fails. The netcode seems fine the interactions are great and I like the idea of having CEO/VIP/MC missions that sometimes involve the entire server's population.Online Great until you run into an evil modderThere seems to always be one modder in every server that wants to ruin the fun. Modding isn't necessarily a bad thing but when modding includes providing a single player an invincible vehicle to then mercilessly torture the rest of the players with then it is. Time after time I frequently end up in servers with such players constantly harassing me as I try to grind through missions to pay the exorbitant fees rockstar feels the need to charge for their 'new' content.New 'Content' These are like DLCsIt's great that Rockstar didn't abandon creating new content for the game adding nightclubs yachts bunkers facilities etc. However the goal is to get players to buy 'Shark' cards which translate to in game money. So if you're like me you aren't going to do that but that won't stop non player characters from calling you every minute to remind you to buy these things. So while you're dodging that modder who's flying around on a hover bike with missiles that can't be destroyed you'll be busy answering a call from Lester the Molester who wants to remind you to buy a bunker or a hangar or any number of stupid things.With these last two topics the game has lost the fun it once had. Now it's down to luck in getting a populating server without a modding who is merely out to ruin your day.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game just goes your way and you have a nice and smooth storyline. A lot of sidequests and tasks to complete outside of the main storyline. Honestly what more can you want? Well that is why we have GTA Online.GTA Online well this is no where near GTA 5 Singleplayer besides the fact that you get more and more things to do which keeps you entertained. In some aspects of course. GTA Online has become horrible due to very very very long loading times. Not only that random connection drops and having somebody disconnect because of GTA Online servers ing up which cancels the heist missions.Another view is modders and cheaters that either purposely attempt to get others banned from the server by dropping a lot of money and cases on players.Another experience I had was when I had a group of players to do a mission with me from my Clubhouse and I was the President. Then a few moments into the mission I get a dude in a tank with his friend spawn right on me and kill everyone in the mission from my group. Which is not fair at all... Another thing is using the Orbital Strike that is just ing stupid. It is one of the most cheapest ways to kill players and groups of players.GTA 5 Is an outstanding game itself thank god Rockstar hasn't touched or altered the singleplayer from this point because there would be even more negative reviews. But Rockstar is now only focused on GTA online to hoard a lot of money from players who buy Shark cards.

2017-06-19,0,0,402,False,Not Recommended,Its a real shame what rockstar has let happen to a game that could have been so much more. When this game was first revealed I almost came. I was glued to my tv for a solid day and a half on release the amount of detail they put into the world was beyond belief and the cars and driving felt like a good balance from the previous games spongy feel. Even as time went on and gta online kept getting pushed back further and further I didnt think anything of it. I mean it has to be difficult developing a game on this scale right? So I patiently waited and low and behold they released it in some form or another. It was pretty fun fofr a while until the question of heist came up...another few months pass and then the game gets released on pc...still no heists. Finally heists get unveiled after months of scrounging for rp and cash like some kind of bottomfeeder and its still barely enough to afford the already expensive clothes cars and apartments. but I keep playing with the promise of being a ceo and the owner of a biker gang and single player dlc that I'm pretty certain they mentioned but it only gets worse. With each dlc the cars get more expensive the headdquarters even more so and the missions get more and more grindy. Finally they release their gunrunner dlc and big goddamn surprise everything is pricey as . So many cool things that will never be used because theres no reason for anyone to buy a ing anti aircraft trailer to pull around. So unfortunately this is the end for me until rockstar gets their together they will get anymore support from me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-13,0,0,366,False,Recommended,To begin with the story mode of GTA V is fun. It's fun to play as the characters use their abilities and explore the world. Many reviews focus solely on the online aspect which is a bit broken. To be fair I wouldn't buy this game just for the story mode but it's definitely something to take into consideration. Now online. From the get go online is pay to win. In order to have fun you have to get past multiple million dollar (in game) paywalls. Some people might argue that you can still play races and minigames but dealing with unmodified cars and weapons you have no experience with can be annoying. There's always that one guy with a perfectly tuned supercar and the extensive combat knowledge. The races are still fun but they're more enjoyable when you have a chance. To be perfectly honest the shark cards are hugely overpriced. If i remember rightly at one point my profit from import/export was 18 million. Would I have paid upwards of $200 AU for that? Hell no. If you want to have fun in online you have to be ready for the grinding.The hardest part of online is starting out. Getting that first few million to grab an apartment and a decent car. It's getting easier these days with Rockstar giving out fairly frequent login rewards to try and keep this game alive a little longer. There are plenty of guides on how to make the maximum amount of cash per hour. Take what those people say seriously but do what is most enjoyable for you. If import/export gets you the most cash but you find heists really fun do that instead. There have been times when I've gotten sick of it all and the key to not getting there is finding the stuff in online that you actually like doing. I personally love the game. The freedom and satisfaction from finally modding out that supercar or buying that facility is great. I hate how long it takes to get there though. Everything is hugely expensive in order to encourage people to buy the overpriced shark cards. If you can put up with the grinding and even have some friends to help you through it I would definitely recommend this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

RS if your going to charge me to buy the game and then not take care of it and / or your customer shouldn't this game be free to play ? or they THAT greedy that they still want your money to buy the game ? and want you to buy sharkcards? but yet let the modders run ramped . i don't get it . one of lifes biggest mysteries . its sad to say but i hope an employee of RS has a kid and wants to play gta 5 online and somehow gets a virus and it breaks the kids heart and destroys the pc's hard drive. and they somehow grow up hating their father because he / she let the modders happen. maybe then rockstar will do there job . i guess $65 239 $120 775 isn't enough to give a anymore.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,378,False,Not Recommended,Thank you Rockstar for fixing this mess. But the fact remains you allowed Take two to take SINGLEPLAYER modding away... Even if it only was a quick time. You dont realise that there has been 14 069 068 downloads on lspdfr.com alone. That is a huge part of your fanbase. And although single player was quite fun Mods make it 10x better to experiance. And i completly agree that online modders should be baned but there is a fine line between singleplayer modding and multiplayer exploiting. Taking singleplayer modding is just plain greedy.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-25,1,1,1234,False,Recommended,"This game is a rollercoaster of emotions for me. It makes me want to have a 'Mixed' review option the most. But since we do not have that I simply must surrender to lord Gabe and rate it up.Singleplayer The single player is without doubt one of the most amazing experiences you will have. The world is vast and the missions are a delight. The attention to detail is amazing. The storyline although not very deep is still very engaging. I absolutely love how the character develop and how they manage to connect a small time gang member a retired bank robber and an absolute psychopath the character of who in itself is a huge plus for the game. It is worth the money for the single player alone and I would not thumbs up this game if not for it.Multiplayer This is where my dliemma begins. Almost all of my odd 1100 hours clocked in this game have been online and I am STILL conflicted about it. On one hand you have times as much content in online as you do in singleplayer and the ability to play multitudes of heists missions races and other activies among freeroam with your friends. even with over a thousand hours clocked in I still haven't played all the modes this game has to offer. On the other hand is how Rockstar has turned this game into a cash cow and are milking it for every single penny. The game began relatively balanced but now you have humongous paywalls put up to encourage you to buy microtransactions instead of grinding your way the top (which believe me you will not unless you make GTA the only thing you do for the rest of your life.) The payouts are absurd compared to the prices of the in game content. To put it in a prespective the highest you can earn from the most rewarding heist is around $1.2M which will barely get you one of the nicer supercars (full modifications excluded) but will take around 3 4 hours to complete. Many more if you don't have in game friends. But if you have an active group of friends or a crew you can run all the bussinesses and earn around a couple of millions every 2 3 days or so if you play regular. If you play solo running businesses is a nightmare. It's simply undoable the grind is unreal. If Rockstar's predatory approach to the consumers wasn't bad enough the matchmaking is absolute trash. It doesn't matter if you have the best internet in the world the load times are painfully long and the frequent disconnects ruin all the fun. Then there are the hackers and rockstars errant banning mechanism. There are a lot of hacker and most of them are hostile. Look at them the wrong way and they spam your character with toilet bowls and spaceships till your game crashes. The banning system is a cherry on top of the dung cake. They ban people who've done nothing and let the obvious hackers play on. The very fact that you play GTA puts you in the risk of getting banned. Plus the bans are absolute. You cannot get them reverted and if you try the support bot slaps you with the ""all bans are final"" message.So how is it that with this essay on how bad it is I still recommend this game? Because despite all the flaws It still manages to be extremely enjoyable. It's a nighmare when it doesn't go right but an absolute delight when it does. If ethics are not a big deal to you and you're okay with modding/glitching (as I am there's no enjoying this game to the fullest without screwing the system) go ahead buy this game you'll love it. But if you're all about the legit play and wouldn't cheat/mod if your life depended on it save yourself the money you'll spend more time grinding the money than you will enjoying this game.P.S If you do buy this game NEVER EVER PURCHASE SHARKCARDS! MICROTRANSACTIONS ARE CANCER!",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-03,0,0,1176,False,Not Recommended,Everyone forces solo lobbies because R* capitalizes on the social incentive of being an (Incentivized griefing and force to sell in public sessions) and they did it well. 90% of PvP is Toxic and shady (Cargo Griefing Easy Way out (Killing Yourself) spamming Job Teleporting etc.) the other 10% is against Godmode hackers that either put you in a cage or kill everyone (after they spam their website info and costs of hacker gta$ first) then leave. R* allows game breaking glitches/exploits/cheats as long as they are at the expense of the consumer and it promotes Shark Card purchasing. For example MkII Oppressors... will be a great addition once R* fixes the glitch that allows it to fly faster than the Lazer with near impossible missile tracking (missiles will u turn and it's griefers best friend). They will however fix car duplication IMMEDIATELY from the Nightclub Garages as After Hours still drip feeds and will even create a system that just even limits the amount of cars you sell. Pounder Custom will get stuck under bridges armor will highcenter itself on a pile of leaves and the ram stop you 60 0 if you hit a curb. Speedo Custom proxymines don't work right either. The B 11... was a waste of GTA$ and a huge letdown. Most examples are from most recent DLC but they're everywhere. The game can be fun though. You HAVE to know all of the nuances of GTA V for it to be enjoyable. I do enjoy killing cargo griefers in public sessions with my Savage until they leave. But most of my hours involved with this game are AFK (Nightclub/Bunker) because thats the only way for you to make enough money without trying to convince yourself of the value of a shark card.

It tries to throw in a shy family values attempt but you can cringe your way through it. I have no idea how I clocked close to 100 hours in it. I must have left it open idling in a car quite a few times because there's probably only about 40 50 hours worth of content max. Even most of it gets boring so it's probably closer to 30 40. You can skip things like buying most properties unless you want the grindy side quests. You can buy clothes if that's your thing. Everyone on my crew simply rolls with one really nice suit and one fully upgraded stolen car which I leave all over the ing city rarely to find it again for the whole game. Stunt jumps?

I think there should be different review categories splitting 'single player' and 'multiplayer'. A lot of the negative reviews for this game focus on multiplayer aspects and the disgruntled feelings of players who have been banned for various and what appears to be spurious reasons. There are actually many gamers such as myself who do not rate the multiplayer aspects of a game highly. We're old and decrepit and prefer single player experiences. I cannot fault the single player experience of GTA 5. I am lucky enough to have a modern PC with a blisteringly fast CPU and graphics card and I am running Windows 10.

2017-06-15,0,0,577,False,Not Recommended,As its own game GTA 5 singleplayer is amazing in every respect graphics gameplay depth and enjoyment. However the online section of the game leaves much to be desired and has only become more grindy as time passed. To put into perspective most of the latest vehicles costs around $2.5 3.5 million in game. This could cost you around 31 just for one vehicle if you buy a Shark Card. Earning this much through grinding is no small feat either I have access to some of the top money making methods (such as having an office and warehouse to play missions from these cost around $2.5 million at least) and it'd still take me about 7 8 hours to earn this much (if optimistically I could earn $400k an hour) just for one vehicle. Grinding is not fun and none of the recent DLCs have done much if anything to reduce this. All they've given is a few more shiny toys to play with nothing has changed up the gameplay since CEO and office work came out in June 2016.I played Payday 2 through its microtransaction debacle and that comes nothing close to how badly infected with microtransactions and grinding GTA Online is. The Payday devs learned from their mistake and now the game is microtransaction free unlike Rockstar.Let alone the fact they've suddenly decided to attempt to kill singleplayer modding for no good reason.I guess having the 4th best selling game of all time makes you greedy huh.I can't recommend a game so blatantly anti consumer like this if it weren't for all that crap I'd have gladly given this a glowing review as at its core GTA 5 is an amazing game but it's been rotted over time by greedy publishers.,Grand Theft Auto V

Because 1.7 mil could totally buy me everything in that game. *sarcasm* It takes me forever to save up that much in game because I don't like randos I don't wanna participate in all the 2x xp and cash pvp stuff that you can supposedly make millions in hours if you participate in. Be like one guy in the forums who got 50k from a hacker and rockstar took 32 mi off his account in the end even when he reported it to protect himself. Doing things solo or with friends still takes time on all the business plus bodyguards and prospects don't make jack from the profit if you don't fit missions in between.

2017-06-17,0,0,365,False,Not Recommended,"Note This review is concerning the singleplayer component of the game.Grand Theft Auto V is a barely interactive linear action game. It is not a sandbox game by any stretch of the word and nor is it a good game in general. Yes it is humorous the graphics are amazing the production values are high and the world is nice but all of that does not equal an engaging experience. Other than the dialogue and the scenery I couldn't find much else to enjoy in this game.I'll get the story out of the way first. While the campaign does have its moments via humor and social commentary overall it fails to tell an interesting story or at least a sensical one. It's ridiculous and over the top. With the exception of Michael the protagonists are badly written they lack motivation and aren't relatable. The trio lacks chemistry with one another and you often wonder why they are doing the things they're doing. It also doesn't feel like they are in control of their story but rather just pawns in it.The core gameplay in GTA V comes down to driving shooting and flying. Coming from GTA IV you'll notice that all of the above was dumbed down to a laughable level. Driving a car and riding a bike now require way less skill and caution cars take tons of damage before their performance suffers to any significant degree and with both cars and bikes you'll rarely lose control at any speed. Likewise shooting is now also extremely forgiving and again requires almost no skill mostly due to the lack of recoil and recovering health but also thanks to the huge arsenal of weapons you're able to carry and the practically infinite ammo capacity. To make matters worse all three player characters have superpowers which turn the game's mechanics into an even bigger joke. GTA V's campaign delivers gameplay through extremely linear missions. The vast majority of them consist of three main elements driving from A to B cover based shooting and chasing or escaping enemies in various vehicles. Of course none of the missions challenge you or require you to use your brain. You have a built in step by step walkthrough text instructing you at all times characters yelling instructions at you every 10 seconds (even if they're your subordinates story wise) waypoints and GPS routes and finally a mothеr ing skip button. Furthermore any deviation from the tightly arranged path results in a ""mission failed"" screen. The same screen appears if you happen to die and of course it respawns you pretty much where you died. Not only does the game not punish you for failure it actually heals you to full health and offers to skip the section.To summarize GTA V fails at fulfilling the basic requirements I have for a game. It expects nothing from the player so the player won't feel like he achieved anything. It doesn't demand tactics good driving navigational skills or any sort of situational awareness. The text at the bottom just blatantly tells you what to do. You can watch TV and eat popcorn while playing this game on mute and still finish it. You cannot defend it by saying it's a ""sandbox."" It is absolutely not a sandbox blowing up cars and playing horde mode with the police is not a sandbox. And to me It's a great shame that they utterly failed to put the pretty world they have created to good use.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,4014,False,Not Recommended,"Hello everyone i have spent 3314 hours in gta 5/Online.Single player stuff in game is ok but online part of game is better on so many levels which i played 99% of the time.Most of it is frustration loading and some of it can be really nice fun with friends.I got banned (for one month) after all those years of playing and being loyal and regular player.Of course all my progress was reset both characters deleted and all their properties vehicles etc...Everything i worked for over the years was reset and deleted just like that!!!My characters were 330 and 380 level. Criminal mastermind challenges and elite challenges i completed over the years with my friends are all gone too now.At the time of ban i had almost all cars bikes vehicles yachts planes etc and other fun toys that i worked hard over the years. Also had around 21 million in bank.If you have good friends you can make nice money with various business and heists in game.So why would i cheat now?I never cheated nor used mods in any way. I'm very skilled player and i know almost all tricks in game and how stuff in game works.I got banned literally for no reason you also get no explanation of course to why you were banned.How is it possible that regular player get banned like that?I don't have money to buy gta 5 every month like people from other country's.When i bought the game in April 2015 i always tried to comply to the rules. Why would i waste my money on a game just to get banned?Never really understood people who cheated in games.There must be some flaw with system I'm confused how can this happen?If I'm confused about all this what can new players in game expect?I'm now treated like a regular fella cheater/modder. Basically type of player i always hated. I will say it again I never cheated!Rockstar does not know to handle cheaters in game that's a fact. So it leaves banning to some scripts that most of the time ban randomly and yes innocent players too.Just by reviewing youtube videos they can manually ban at least real ""public"" cheaters in game with impossible levels like 2000 8000 that have billions or even trillions of $.Every public session has at least one cheater or more that like to participate in collective mayhem of destroying the game.Invite only sessions/friends sessions are sometimes only way to play. There's a periodic outbursts of cheatermania from time to time in game.You can report them (i reported over the years at least 1000) but they are free to ruin everyone's time in the game.You get no protection they set you on fire make you wear funny clothes and constantly explode you or make your game crash.They also give money to random players which could trigger ban. But as we can see on youtube some people are just protected and can do whatever they want (mod money abuse game mechanic do glitches etc) while others have to work to get money and get banned after for no reason. And yeah almost forgot you can buy in game money with real money using shark cards. That's why everything in game is super overpriced.So either way you are destined to end up frustrated and annoyed like me.Actually you'll end up either banned or quit the game because some neantherthal decided it want's to have fun.Rockstar has terrible support actually there isn't any.You can talk to their auto bot replying system because that's how much you are worth to them.Your support tickets are closed right away with no right to appeal. Basically you only get more frustration nothing else.That's it thanks for reading.I wish you guys all the best.Endless...",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,344,False,Recommended,A fantastic game with many issues all from the greed of Rockstar. It's honestly a pity that such a well made fun and full game is destroyed by the multiplayer. The single player is untouched thank god and still is one of the best games ever made and if that is what you are looking for you need not look further than this game With engaging game design fun characters enjoyable timesinks and a deep gorgeous and active world. Very few games can even hope to match GTA V's single player experience. Sadly the multiplayer is no such paradise. With rampant cheating horrible pay to win microtransactions the utmost grind I have ever seen in a game and not to mention the treatment of players as statues with wallets. No other game demonstrates the good and the bad of extremely large triple a game development in general. The worst sin of the multiplayer however is that it shifted the focus from the single player expansions to horrible microtransaction laden multiplayer expectations. Removing all of the new content that was going to expand the single player and shattering hopes and dreams everywhere. Not only that but if you want to mod GTA V you would have to have two of the 65GB game installed onto your computer as if you even start up the multiplayer with a mod installed you have a much higher chance of being banned(also for playing the game normally). Once again if you want a fantastic single player game this is one of the best if you want a multiplayer game make sure that you have a fat wallet or 64 hours in the day to dedicate solely to this game.single player 8.9/10multiplayer 4/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-11,0,0,815,False,Recommended,Overall Game I have followed GTA 5 for a long time now. I first got the Xbox One version of the game and it was amazing! I got with friends and did tons of missions not realizing that we spent half the day in the game! Then hiests came out and that made the expierience even more fun. Don't forget aboutr the story mode too. I mainly play the Online mode but I always found myself playing this amazing story mode! I would definently recommend that you try a few missions of the story mode to get a feel for the world of Los Santos! But enough of how I think of the game let's get into how the game plays. How it Runs If you are worried about how the game runs don't be. This game runs completely fine for me but that might just be because I have a decent to high end computer (GTX 970 NON OC 16gb of RAM i5 6600k NON OC Windows 8.1 64bit and this IS running on a Mechanical hard drive).This game does not require to run on a SSD but if you have enough space you might as well to make sure you are getting the best performance. Everybody say the loading screens are horrible but they run completely fine for me. It's not extremely fast like some games though. You can always mix and match what your graphics settings are to get the performance If you want me look at your computers specs to see if you can run it just send me a message. Game Mechanics I was a bit skeptical about the driving on a keyboard but it turns out that the driving was actually really fun in my opinion. Just in case though you should have a controller plugged in just so you can switch between them. On the other hand I'm not a big fan of the flying with a keyboard I would definently recommend a controller for flying. On foot this game plays amazing in gun fights. It all comes down to your opinion on how you want to play the game though. If you don't like the controls for the keyboard experiment! You can fully customize what your controls are from on foot or in a air craft! Thoughts I completely recommend this game to anyone who likes open world shooters heck why don't you just buy it already. This game is great with friends or just by yourself!,Grand Theft Auto V

The online mode is where things take a turn for the worse. The online mode is very grindy and similar to a F2P game like War Thunder. Everything costs a little more than a million in game dollars. Rockstar wants to make as much money off of the online mode as possible. The last few updates have been big money grabs. The core mechanics of Online is good however. You can do absolutely stupid things with friends on cars and motorcycles. You don t need a $1000 computer to play this game all you need is an AMDFX or equivalent and something above an 650ti.

2016-01-02,0,0,269,False,Not Recommended,Overall a very well polished game although it lacks clothing variety(and quality since the utility vests are just too basic) certain Online features(like the heavy military grade armor from singleplayer it would be great if it was possible to call an airdrop of that thing as VIP). Also the final mission was way too basic and rushed. And as an addition to all of that the multiplayer is overfilled with cheaters most of which are abusive 10yo children that keep screaming in the mic while running all over with godmode and killing everyone with world objects explosions and other kinds of crap.2017 update From my experience of returning to the game after having upgraded the PC it's still a decent game on it's own but it has it's enormous flaws that simply can not be looked away from. Ranging from degenerative toxic community with child mentality to various glitches and exploits poor weapon balancing etc etc.As it stays right now it's really hard to tell whether the game is worth it's price or not. Sure it has a decent amount of content great storyline and all that... But when it gets to multiplayer it's but a sad scene of cheaters exploiters and obnoxious trash tearing the game apart. The anti cheat software doesn't help the game at all. After all these years I still get to see absolute scum every second session. And even those times that there isn't one you have to be the lucky one in a million to have your session stay that way for more than an hour.As a pure example to that some time ago R* decided to completely prohibit client modification which brought down all that garbage for good. Except... The toxic herd was displeased by that so after some whining they managed to get that update reverted so they could continue ruining the fun of legitimate players.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-06-28,0,0,390,False,Not Recommended,***EDITED FOR OPENIV MOD BAN*** In support of the OpenIV mod team I'm retracting my positive review and giving this game a negative review.I can't support Take Two's actions. Singleplayer with mods and that's about it. Don't let my hours decieve you it says I only played an hour but I've actually played probably 500 hours into this game and beaten the story mode two times about to play it a third time.I haven't gone near the online part probably never will. I didn't even go online in GTAIV just played singleplayer. For the time I played GTAV I'd say it's worth a try. The story is funny action packed and cliche but surprisingly I enjoyed the cliches. There's plenty to do after beating the game like finding hidden objects and completing time trial missions. There are also hundreds of mods out there that you can download to enhance this game. My biggest complaint is they ditched pool from GTAIV I played pool so much it was the best part of GTAIV.My favourite mod is probably the body guard mod because getting 4 strippers armed with assault rifles is good times.Something memorable is driving along the highway just as the sun is rising it's quite relaxing. Flying an airplane or jet through the mountains and valleys. Driving a dirt bike over the sand dunes. Taking a sail boat through 2 storey high waves in the middle of a thunder storm (can make those waves bigger with a mod but I found them big enough). Or stealing a passenger jet from the airport and flying off with it then ditching it at high altitude and parachuting. Exploring the bottom of the ocean as a fish. Flying around the whole map as a bird. Playing as a monkey and running around decking people with my monkey fists. Starting a traffic jams and creating fist fights between NPCs. Getting someone to chase me and make them punch me in front of the police and then he gets shot to death by them. Crash landing a jet in the mountains and managing to barely survive.Car customization is a lot better than GTAIV. You can do a lot more and add a lot more to the cars. It was fun to take a car and upgrade it with a bunch of stuff. Funniest thing is taking a rusty beater car and adding chrome paint and big off road SUV tires to it.Not sure what else to say it's good and will keep you busy for a while.Pros Tons of cars bikes boats submarines utility military and air vehicles.A lot of customization for vehicles.A lot of gun customization.Funny NPCs.Decent story with humorous cliches.Fun police chases.Relaxing atmosphere.Well built world with believable locations. (Even the bottom of the ocean is detailed with seaweed and coral which you will almost certainly never see in a normal playthrough)Custom radio station which announces your music it's been in other GTA's too but it's my favourite returning feature.Princess Robot Bubblegum. Nuff said.Wide variety of wild life from cats dogs birds fish mountain lions monkeys whales and sharks and more I forgot.Tennis mini game is fun.A lot of story mode locations are still accessible after beating the game.They brought back the military having Marines as body guards is pretty bad Some cool secrets and easter eggs.Free game updates.Cons No pool.No girlfriends. (except for Michael's wife and sex contacts which don't really count)Fewer television and radio shows than GTAIV.Can't go to restaurants anymore. Only source of food are soda machines.Can't sell drugs... This was my favourite feature in China Town Wars I made hundreds of thousands of dollars in that game buying and selling drugs.End game payout is too low.Johnny Klebitz dies and is less of a bad The writers portrayed Johnny as this really hard core stone cold killer in the Episodes of Liberty City but in GTAV he acts like a scared little boy and gets his head kicked in by Trever Philips. Doesn't make much sense. I think the version of Johnny from Episodes would've been more than a match for Trevor.Neutral I haven't been able to see a huge difference between a silenced weapon and an unsilenced weapon. Both seem to scare people easily.Driving a boat outside the map will cause it to eventually randomly sink. Driving an air plane outside the map will cause it's engines to eventually die out. this isn't a pro or a con but I'm putting it here because I have a phobia of deep water and this was probably the scariest thing in the game for me. It literally sent chills down my spine when my boat sank in the middle of no where.The game tries to make hunting a thing but it doesn't really fly since you're doing it between two busy highways. Didn't feel authentic.The buildings under contruction remain under contruction for the whole game and are never ever completed.Ordering a blimp via cell phone. Ordering a freakin' mother en' blimp with your god damn cell phone. That makes no sense strangest feature in this game imo.I almost never used my cell phone. I often used my cell phone in GTAIV for activities but in GTAV it's less of a presence in terms of features and can be easily ignored.That's not everything but it's an idea of what I think about this game. It's really worth your time in terms of singleplayer I had a blast with it and continue playing it.Nominated for Game Within A Game award (2016).,Grand Theft Auto V

The problem is that you focus too much on multiplayer gameplay so much that 99% of the missions are litterally unplayable because no one stays in the mission and if a single person makes a mistake then it all goes to If your game focuses a lot on microtransactions then your game sucks so there's that. You can't moderate for there's thousands of hackers in your game and they never get punished for it (one of my social club friends is one and he hasn't had the full force of the law pushed upon him like he deserves).

2016-12-03,0,0,2760,False,Recommended,I've played this game for so many hours finished 100% and enjoyed every bit.There is just so much to do which brings you hours of entertainment I've felt so free in San Andreas.San Andreas is a beautiful map with quite the size and activities whether it's exploring or doing some extra missions races or triathlons you'll always enjoy yourself in San Andreas.The Online missions are very well crafted and enjoyable given that your crew knows how to handle themselves.Of course with the later updates people seem to be a bit disappointed most reviews will tell you there are an abundance of modders long loading times and overpriced items unfortunately most of this is true and I've yet to see Rockstar implement any better means of preventing cheaters. The items are indeed very expensive and you can expect a very long grind to even get a foothold in this game (like getting a Office or Motorcycle Club) and even when you manage to get this far you haven't even scratched the surface for the pricing on in game items are just ridiculous for players who have not advanced so far in Online.So Rockstar decided to add Shark Cards for those who do not feel like grinding so hard asking for ridiculous prices for almost a handful of cash (74 99 for 8 000 000$ in game will get you about 2 3 high end vehicles) the economy in the game is just very broken I usually fill up my businesses and sit afk for hours on end waiting for them to turn me a profit while I'm waiting. Rockstar has addressed the modder problem significantly I have not come across a modder for an extended period of time unlike one in every lobby back in the day. This doesn't mean there are no more modders as there are certainly a few hanging around. Players are often very ware and hostile towards others so I would certainly recommend having friends with you to help you in sessions and more importantly doing jobs together because doing everything in this game solo will make you think the grind I mentioned earlier is just a walk in the park.Otherwise there are just so many things to do both Offline and Online. I recommend this game to anyone who does not mind grinding and those with friends to help them.It's certainly worth the price you pay even if you just plan on playing Singleplayer I would just advise against spending money on Shark Cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,1951,False,Not Recommended,Although I enjoyed about half of the time I spent playing Grand Theft Auto V recent decisions made by the developers involving the modding community (seriously almost every negative review in the last 24 hours has covered that) and the FREE DLC as well as me reflecting on my experience as of late has led me to realize that this game is only a good buy for a select few.From my over 800 hours spent in GTA Online I will tell you that it is not worth anybody s time unless they a) have several friends b) have a crap ton of time and/or money and c) have friends who also have a crap ton of time and/or money. The best experiences I ve had in this game have been with my friends friends who have booted up the game in almost a year.So why do you still play?I only play this game as something mindless and repetitive like an grindy MMO something I do while watching endless amounts of youtube videos and podcasts. This is the only game I have found where I can simultaneously be as productive as someone who is not distracted while never missing a word of what Philip DeFranco or the Nerdwriter1 decide to talk about this week. This is the only way I can justify spending time binging these videos even though I have a ton of free time this summer. I also semi enjoy the challenge of trying to manage my time between the various activities in game so as to maximize long term profit and have learned a lot about the reward system developed through content updates. Boring Information Incoming! Ever since last year Rockstar have been pushing out content that revolve around setting up businesses which have a high several million dollar upfront cost that generate a reliable income that is by far the best way to make money long term. Once everything is maxed out with all of the businesses offered you can make almost $400K per hour if you are working as productively as possible and know what you are doing. Not bad until you realize that it costs at least 13.5 million to get to that point meaning it would take at least 34 hours to pay off those upfront costs assuming you buy all those properties and upgrades at once and that you do not buy anything extra when purchasing your properties. This is of course if you can sit through the repetitive missions you will have to do hundreds of times in order to make that money. To add insult to injury if you were to decide to flip burgers at a minimum wage paying job in the US and use all of that money to buy GTA V Shark Cards you could earn almost 600K an hour doing repetitive work and if you live in a state like California you could earn over 800K per hour! TLDR If you do not care about doing boring work and don t mind give hundreds of dollars to Rockstar you can potentially earn twice as much as you could through legitimate methods. It is no surprise loads of smart people unlike myself have decided to either hack money into online to enjoy the game with friends mod the DLC content and more into single player or opt out of the GTA experience entirely. Now with single player mods being deliberately axed by Rockstar the only options that do not involve hacking in money which will get you banned are to grind away your valuable time at a videogame in order to buy expensive jets and cars to fill the void where your friends should be or to just not buy this stupid game. Unless you have not played the single player which is amazing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-27,0,0,2770,False,Not Recommended,"This game can be whatever you want it to be. Whether you choose to see it as what it appears to be at first sight (that being the action packed reckless killing for no reason) or a real chillout behind the wheel of a car. You name it this game has it.*UPDATE the 15th of June*So how should I put this. One of the very few things that make you choose how you play your game which is essentially what this review was focused on has been halted and declared ""illegal"" allegedly by this game's publisher (who is also responsible for GTA Online) Take Two Interactive.Before you ask yes I'm talking about modding. In case you're new to the GTA V universe let me tell you that the modding community is a huge huuuge part of the overall GTA V fan and/or playerbase. Due to Take Two Interactive acting the way they just recently did projects like OpenIV (a tool that had been used for mods to be inserted into the game safely etc.) to a close.So my personal opinion on this product changes DRASTICALLY with this piece of information at hand. I do not recommend you to support the game over this reason alone. No developers/publisher teams should be able to create this sort of weird ""monopoly"" with their product and screw their customers over like this. I get it it's their product they have the right to do it. However it is certainly not a nice move one that will most definitely leave scars on the game itself.Last but not least thanks for taking your time to read this review. Also I'd like to apologize for any spelling errors/grammar mistakes in this text beforehand.",Grand Theft Auto V
2017-12-30,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,The online version of this game is a really great game with heaps to do but is completely ruined by a phone that keeps popping up on the screen and constantly ringing and it doesn't shut up EVER. While you can stop the sound the phone continually pops up onto the screen and while it is on the screen you can't select weapons or aim weapons and after twenty hours of playing the game I now regret my descision to buy the game as I don't want to play it anymore simply because the phone wont stop ringing and it continually interrupts the gameplay and is literally driving me ing crazy. I play games to get away from annoying phone calls idiot people who I don't want to talk to and work. The last thing I want in a game is a phone that I can't get rid of or turn off that literally interrupts the gameplay every fifteen to thirty seconds or so. Now I remember why I didn't buy this game years ago when it first came out because the ing phone just wont stop ringing and interrupting gameplay. Why they put this phone in that stops you aiming stops you selecting weapons and that wont stop annoying the out of you and completely ruining the gameplay I have no idea I will never buy a GTA game ever again and will go back to playing GTA3 San Andreas if I want an open world do whatever the you want game. They have made a great game with great graphics and heaps of missions and then just completely destroyed it all with a poxy phone that never stops ringing and interrupting gameplay and driving the player crazy. The offline version of the game doesn't do this as much and it's the only part of the game I can play without wanting to put my fist though the poxy phone on the screen. After two hours of the poxy phone ringing and ringing and driving me nuts I just can't play the online version of this game. Also THERE IS STILL NO SUPPORT FOR JOYSTICK OR WHEEL AND THIS GAME HAS PLANES AND CARS IN IT. LIKE WHAT THE ING ?,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-24,0,0,187,False,Recommended,When I was only in 6th grade Grand Theft Auto V was released for PS3 and Xbox 360. That was back in 2013 and from then we have come a long way in terms of videgame design graphics and general quality (Depending on who you ask). Not only for its time but in the modern gaming landscape this is a true masterpiece of art and entertainment. Since I first played it on the PS3 a few years ago I've played it 9 times over yet to my suprise I discover new missions interactions vehicles and locations that I didn't catch previously. It seems like the world goes on forever because of the vast arid desert of sandy shores to the buzzing bright never asleep city of Los Santos. If you have ever played the other installations in the GTA franchise this is nothing like them. Everything is so much more refined and overall amazing. Above all else the character development for each character both major and minor is enough of a reason to get this game. The contrast of the ghetto life of young Franklin against the yuppie middle aged rich Michael is a good relationship that you see blossom and make each mission feel like it matters. There is minimal filler missions and the mission that are are the optional ones. This is and always will be one of my top 3 favorite games and to truly experience it to its fullest you have to play it for yourself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-25,0,0,355,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online has turned into pay2win filth it's an exceptional grind to get the money to do anything and each new dlc requires a bunker or some other garbage facility to be purchased and upgraded so you can start to make your money back. If you aren't prepared to grind like it's a full time job or buy multiple shark cash cards then sadly this is not the game for you.The pricing of ingame items is a joke too. It takes multiple hours to grind to get 1mil for example (even once you have multiple businesses set up) and this won't even buy you a decent car. Let alone allow you to upgrade it.Also EVERY SINGLE TIME you log on be prepared to be bombarded with calls from random characters who wil ring you incessantly to try and flog whatever trash Rockstar has added to the game until you eventually cave. If you don't cave they will ring you every single game/session change without fail. They don't stop. It's infuriating and while I used to enjoy the game it simply isnt fun anymore unless you have a bunch of friends who play and have good enough gear to defend yourselves from the griefers and don't mind switching lobbies as soon as a modder decides to mess your game up. And dont mind hanging up on lester 15 times a day.I've only played it recently to get the free money for logging in as part of whatever random promotion it is this time.TLDR No I wouldn't recommend any new players purchase this game.

I've been playing it since last gen and yes the prices for items and vehicles has gone up a lot but there have been so many updates that allow users to gain millions of dollars relatively quick and easy compared to the last gen days when we only had contact missions. Now there are several businesses that can be used to earn a lot of cash including ones which provide passive income. Once you've got a few of these its pretty enjoyable to complete the sell missions and you earn so much money in the process. The heists provide some nice payouts too. There's so much to do buy and explore. You never run out of things to do. Well worth the purchase.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,0,0,215,False,Recommended,I've put numerous hours into this game (including 800+ hrs on the Xbox version's online alone and who knows how many in single player) so I figured it was time to give a quick review. Grand Theft Auto V has received a lot of negative reviews because of the direction that GTA Online is heading. Sadly I have to agree with most of the complaints. Online has become too much of a grind. It is good to have to work for what you earn but you end up devoting entirely too much time just grinding out the same missions and jobs to try to make enough money to buy only a fraction of the things that the game has to offer. It is still enjoyable but Rockstar is simply trying to cash out by getting people to purchase shark cards. Despite this negativity the game still has a lot to offer. Single player has an amazing storyline that is very entertaining the whole way through. The world is incredibly detailed and has tons of easter eggs hidden throughout it. Playing with friends online is an absolute blast and can provide near endless possibilities. The driving mechanics are very smooth and feel really good. Ultimately this game is an experience to be had. I will always look upon this game fondly and am certain that any players (new or old) can find pleasure in playing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-30,1,1,109,False,Recommended,"So this is without a doubt one of the most polished PC ports I have seen in quite some time. Although I have found that as of late every update that comes with this game also drastically impacts performance. Now I know that most of you are thinking that this is entirely on me and that my rig isn't up to the task of running this game but I know my specs and I'll be damned if this thing can't run this game or any other game for that matter.Anyways the game itself is one of the most enjoyable online experiences I've had in a long time and for all of you out there that prefer to go it alone this game delivers an amazing story with rich gameplay and diverse campaign missions. There was never once that I felt that I was doing something as ""filler"" only existing to lengthen the time needed to finish the game. The gun play is extremely polished and feels fluid although first person view while shooting feels awkward as hell but while driving it is my go to view.This is my first Grand Theft Auto game so I can't speak as to how it compares or differs from past titles but despite that on its own this game is definitely worth the price. Although if you want the best experience in my opinion of course then I recommend you have a friend who also has the game and play with them online. I haven't enjoyed a multiplayer experience like this is ages there truly is nothing quite like being in a car chase while being shot at by police with armored vans helicopters and swat vehicles. All in all the game feels polished plays like a top of the line AAA game has a great campaign full of interesting characters missions and gameplay. This is a game you should probably keep an eye out for during steam sales!",Grand Theft Auto V

After about 1 900 hours I'm level 318 have about 42mil and about everything I can/want to buy. It really helps if you've got a group of buddies that helps you out and you can run with. had about 5 10 people on every day at 1 point then got into a good secure money making crew for a few months until the 2 crew leaders fell out and broke it up lol. I still play from time to time and i really hope to God that Red Dead Redemption 2's multiplayer is not this broken. D So should you Buy this game? Yes because the price was cut in half and with RDR2 multiplayer still about a year out I'd say this game's got about 2 4 years before GTA6 Online comes out and makes this game irrelevant.

2017-06-16,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,It breaks my heart to do this but Rockstar and TakeTwo need to learn you don't handle someone using a tool in a way in which it was never intended by completely banning the tool altogether you talk to the tool's creators and mention the issue with the tool and suggest they look into fixing it. Cars are sometimes used to run people over or commit crimes but you don't see people banning the use of cars do you? TakeTwo need to take a step back and think about what they've done here. This kind of business practice can have a HUGE impact on future sales If people think you're a scummy company they're not going to want to buy your product anymore. This hurts not only your company but as a publisher it can have a negative impact on the sales of every single game you publish and if you earn that kind of reputation nobody will want to come to you to publish their games meaning that you lose a ton of future potential clients.Take two is signing their own death warrant with this little stunt.

I get that companies follow the money but leaving singleplayer in the state they did was a mistake on their part. Also they seem to be a little ban happy in Online. Instead of adjusting the market Rockstar just bans players who want to experience all the content without shelling out real life money. They don't ban players who straight up cheat just the ones who cheat for in game cash. That's the reason I'm never going to buy Shark Cards or even play Online. Singleplayer gets a 10/10.

Also soon Rockstar is probably going to start banning people for setting up racing wheels using xbox 360 controller emulators because Rockstar was too lazy to set up joystick and racing wheel support in the first place).In conclusion No mod support and if you do mod with good intentions then you get banned.If you hack and cheat ""Welcome to GTA Online"" Rockstar Games",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-12,0,0,135,False,Recommended,Personally Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in a couple favorite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I piloted an aircraft into another aircraft battled the crew seized control of the aircraft and then parachuted out and observed it crash into the sea to avoid death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. A different time whilst driving about in an off road motorcycle I got distracted by something that appeared like a trail up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following the trail to the summit where I almost ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them screamed toward me. That is one of the things I enjoy with GTA 5 the random callouts and yelling by the AI.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an plenty of before mentioned moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living environment where anything can occur. It both gives you enormous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realized universe and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.Positives Free multiplayer Intrusive story modeNegatives (mostly online) Bad Anti Cheat system with ban waves that causes suspensions even for legit players et there are still many modders It has a lot of bugs Tuns of super long loadings screensGrand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously delightful video game but also an exceptional and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a purification of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every imaginable way but it s also exceptionally ambitious in its individual way. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humor and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and intriguing story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed experiences through San Andreas.I would give this game a 9/10 for the story mode but a 4/10 for the online aspect.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-23,1,1,222,False,Not Recommended,"Not worth it unless you're cheating.Game mechanics are overly complicated and poorly expained on purpose.Input delay is annoying and not fun.Combat is flawed and not fun most weapons are completely useless.Flight controls are gay.Missions gets repetitive or are played only once because there are better payoffs.Cheaters and glitchers are running rampart.Bugs are still present.Banned people for using singleplayer modsPut all of the above aside because the following is the main and biggest reason why tar is killing this game and why people hate the game and stop playing it 90% of the content in the game is bought with via in game money. the important ones are the ones you are gonna use the most including cars aircrafts seacrafts heavy vehicles property and specific heists.The problem? 60% (and that's lowballing) of that 90% of content is bloatly overpriced on purpose.why?Because you can bypass this problem with buying the in game money with overpriced real life money. Already the microtransactions in a paid game especially in a triple A game is a red flag but let's continue.Hypothetically you can unlock all said content for free of course but for the average player it won't happen and here's why Rockstar intentionally designed the game so that to get expensive stuff you'll have to grind. a lot.not just a few hours. but days just to get a couple of millions for that 1 car you wanted.and its worse than you think.The game constantly over complicates missions or mislead adevrtised content to squeeze money out of you.and it's not only that the game finds every way possible in you do to squeeze as much as money as possible from your character.and its still not only that because the rockstar artifically increases mission and money making time by either putting delays while grinding or puts unnecessary obstacles in your path purposely making the destinated objective location as far as possible from the cheapest starting point(your apartment bunker facility hangar office vehicle warehouse that are required to actually start doing stuff).Heists are hard to complete not because of any real difficulty but because the community is nearly braindead from all of rockstar's skull g practices they die or leave all the time for stupid reasons and in hard mode(which is what you aim for because of extra pay bonuses) 1 death will literally make you lose and either restart from a checkpoint or leave.even after the hard work and time input the payment sucks anyway. and if you're in it for the story you won't do it more than once.Dispatches are fast and more forgiving but are also too repetitive and pay about 15k for about 5 minutes of work.Every content update after release only gives you a taste of the BBC of said content via specific missions where you can drive the new cars or they gibs you the new weapons and the costs of a single car goes up with each update.They went full EA with the years and want to make you as angry frustrated and desperate as possible via repetitive low paying and time consuming missions to make you purchase overpriced shark cards that costs more than the game itself to begin with that give you less than 8 000 001 Million $.an example for the grinding is this This is the most efficient way to make the most amount of money Source import/export of cars and it goes like this Step 1 Buy the cheapest office and vehicle warehouse which are about 2.5 million combined.Step 2 Go to your office waste 5 seconds for the sitting animation and waste another 6 seconds for the leaning in and logging in animation. press the ""source vehicle"" buttonStep 3 Gtfo drive for 2 years through traffic to steal a car. either hop right in or kill some enemies. sometimes theres an annoying part of following a car/picking it up and a Carbobvegene.Step 4 Drive for 2 more years through traffic to your vehicle warehouse either chased by cancerous enemies or DA POLEESE. call molester and waste 600$ to save time and get rid of the police because of the broken star system. a good mention is that getting the car damaged will cost you a repair fee about 5 000$ on average.Step 5 Go to your computer waste more time on the animations choose a car to export. you WILL choose top range and the specialist for maximum profit.Top range you ask? You have (i guess) 1/3 chance to find a top range car when you source one increased by the more standard and medium cars you have. You will waste 20 000$ to randomly mash your keyboard to change the appearance of your car.Step 6 Drive for another 2 years through traffic to the DESIGNATED location pursued by godlike AI that drives better than you ever could shooting at you. again damaging the car will reduce your payment usually around 5 000$.After you finished you get up to 100 000$. but hol up you wasted 20 000k for the upgrades and around 10 000k for repairs so the total profit is 70k(if you export a top range). You can export up the 3 more in the same time with your friends. if you have any. but they only earn 9000k from this.Step 7 Repeat steps 2 6. but after the 15 minutes delay after exporting This is the best way to grind money as it can get annoying repetitive and time consuming just to get 70k.in between exporting you can source vehicles or you can do the annoying and repetitive dispatches that pay you 15k.The average good car costs around 1.7 million without all fo the upgrades. the really good cars cost around 2.4 Million. You do the math.Unless you have an anime profile picture you probably don't have time for all this just to enjoy a game.",Grand Theft Auto V

I like the story thus far I love the graphics I love the gameplay I love the characters I love the humor ... it's all so wonderful. Plenty to do. Runs well too. Plenty of graphical settings to choose in order to get the fps you want provided you're not running on a toaster/potato.I have near max settings capped at 30fps (I prefer consistent fps) with an i5 4690K an ASUS 760 OC and 8GB RAM. Very enjoyable. WIll be a lot more enjoyable when I get one of those newer cards! )However...I would NOT recommend this game for mutliplayer at all in its current state. Rockstar are overbearing parents and the game is full of hackers and trolls. Not my idea of a good time. I would definitely stay away from GTA5 if your only desire is MP unless you wanna get banned for doing nothing wrong (seems to happen a lot) or you want to troll people selfishly screwing up other peoples' fun because you lack integrity.I'm a long time GTA fan.

Now I'm done with it cause apparently they don't give a crap about the people who played the game when it wasn't online. 174 hours played on pc but more then 500 hours played on the ps3. Would I say buy I don't know as I have been a long time supporter of R* but with that said I don't think they care about that anymore. I can't give it a thumbs up because of all the problems that happen in the game along hackers. I do belive they should have the abilty to do so but not at the cost ruining someone else's game. Not till they fix these issues would I recommend this game to anyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-24,0,0,47,False,Recommended,I went to a clothing store to buy a nice set of pants I went to pay and the clerk told me that they were $500 each. I was like whatever I have the money I'll buy a pair. Damn these inflation rates.Across the street I see a guy who punched a woman and nabbed her purse. I jumped out of the store and took somebody's bicycle to catch up to him. I was going to lightly run into him with my tire but I ended up rupturing his kidney upon impact which left him spewing blood. It was sad but I picked up the purse to return to the woman.Unfortunately the LSPD had caught wind of me stealing a bike and had already converged on my location. I tried telling them that I had to do it to stop a purse thief and that I'd give the bike back. They wouldn't listen and pulled out their guns on me can never be too careful i guess. I then rode through an alleyway with bullets whizzing past me can't believe the police are spending their time hunting heroes nowadays (Now I know how Captain America and Spiderman feel).After a few miles of riding I was exhausted the police were still on my tail. I needed to get something that I didn't have to expend my energy on like a car or motorcycle. Fortunately there was one of those teensy smart cars in the parking lot that I had resting in. I broke the window hotwired it and sped away. I made it to I 1 heading towards Mount Chiliad man this car was quick quick enough to lose the cops after a few minutes of swerving around traffic. I ended up at a bar near Sandy Shores $500 dollars richer but I left behind both my pairs of pants back in Rockford Hills.Pretty good game haven't played singleplayer yet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-10,0,0,53,False,Not Recommended,TL DR The game runs like a slideshow after between 30 mins and an hour as a result of a memory leak rockstar haven't acknowledged the issue community solutions only delay the onset of the issue at best I've been able to get 1h30/2h before the game becomes unplayable. The game itself is completely fine gameplay great story decent etc etc however there is one MASSIVE issue with this game since an update that occured around mid 2015 (as far as I can tell from trawling google).Essentially the game suffers from a disasterous memory leak which results in ever increasing stuttering regardless of your rig to the point where the game becomes unplayable. There are countless solutions on the internet none of which actually solve the problem at best they delay its onset by maybe 10 minutes. Some have condescendingly suggested upping RAM from 8GB to 16GB but from reports I have seen this only delays the onset of the stuttering (you might be able to play for 2 hours rather than say half an hour). Lowering settings doesn't work adjusting control panel settings doesn't work and setting priority doesn't work. My rig Intel i5 4590MSI GTX 1070Even with the above on Med/High settings the game begins to stutter after around 30 45 mins becomming unplayable after maybe 1h30m. The game runs fine up until memory and pagefile usage is topped out RAM isn't being cleaned like most games do hence the memory leak. I have seen people with rigs far exceeding mine reporting the exact same issues since mid 2015 nothing has been done on rockstar's behalf to solve this issue. Any solutions provided by the community only delay the issue slightly even restricting the game to 30fps results in maybe a delay of around 30 minutes. The game needs to be fixed before it's worth buying. If you have a console and really want to play the game you're much better off getting it on there.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-13,0,0,669,False,Not Recommended,The offline Story Mode version of GTA 5 sometimes called Single Player is limited in gameplay compared to what I have read about the Online game. Rockstar don't seem to have any nterest in improving the offline version further as they do not make a significant amount of money from doing so compared to GTA 5 Online or so it would appear.In the Offlines Story Mode you cannot buy apartments or houses cannot improve the characters especially that of Trevor who no matter how nice you dress him up he wil be viewed as a vagrant by anyone near him this is not very enjoyable and for the above reasons I don't recommend buying GTA 5 if you only want to play offline.,Grand Theft Auto V

Also you have to play alot to get anything online and I get bored after being disconnected from my friends because of a server error 3 times in under an hour. I'm not paying for fake in a game never will and if more people were like me we wouldn't have games completely ruined by microtransactions.

I can't begin to describe how disapointing this game is. They removed EVERYTHING that was good about GTA 4 and created a cash cow. They're still charging full price for a nearly 6 year old game. There is NO support for offline play. They've abandoned the single player experience. All vehicles they put out cost in excess of $1 000 000. You cannot play the game without a group of friends. Every ""Update"" Is a some stupid new add on that requires guess what? $1 000 000 to buy yet another stupid base. The physics are terrible the driving is horrible. Driving a Semi Truck brings the same feel as driving a Super Car. The Rubberband physics for the police is like something out of a 1999 PS1 game. Don't even get me started on the Toxic community. I've been followed an harassed even when in Passive mode. So badly you have to change servers constantly. The children that own all the upgrades will hunt you down and make it impossible to have any kind of fun. I wouldn't reccomend this game if it were $10. When playing online you get this ing beep that reminds you to buy the latest crap they've put out. Then you get a phone call every 3 seconds guess what? Reminding you to BUY MORE CRAP.The offline story is You get a pathetic washed up criminal who's wife is ing the yoga guy. A typical gangster black character who's really a wimp. And the deranged lunatic that is sure to have every 11 year old laughing with his jokes and bloody rampages. Horrible game awful greedy developer. I'm really hesitant to buy Red Dead Online.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-24,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,Seriously what an absolute waste of money.GTAV is if nothing else a giant mess. When things do work you can guarantee it won't last long.Online has about 120 different issues at any given time from poor servers to garbage availability. Games constantly disconnect or refuse to connect at all. I was feeling a little bit nostaligic for some GTA Online due to all the progress I made so I downloaded it. Tried to get online 3 times. Failed every sing time. Promptly uninstalled.GTA was cranked out as a cry from fanboys to get something good. It almost was.Hesits are a great idea with the most garbage execution possible. Not only is it a giant grief machine due to the way it's designed but they take FOREVER to load. And if one person disconnects (bound to happen frequently) so does every else. WHAT.Conecting to online takes FOREVER to do even with a SSD.The only salvaging grace about this game is the spats of fun you can have in between the disconnects server failures frequent cheaters and bugs. It still isn't worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-07,1,1,594,False,Not Recommended,The only game where I felt there was genuinelt nothing to lose by cheating and potentially getting caught and banned. Either I have money to play with and the game is actually fun again or I can no longer play the game and am no longer tempted to see if it's still frustrating to play.The game can be a lot of fun playing with friends but that applies to anything. Playing solo as I did for almost 600 hours the game is a tedious array of loading screens and waiting for other players to join the heist hoping that they're competent and won't quit out. Repeat that for a week or so and maybe you have enough to buy one of the many recently added toys Rockstar added into the game.The real fun of the game is messing around in freeroam with all the planes trucks etc that the game has available but even after 600 hours and running into several hackers that spawned vast amounts of money for me I was still broke and having to grind endlessly every time a new update came out.The game is genuinely fun at times but Rockstar have worked so hard to make sure you have to earn those moments and it simply isn't worth it any more. The most fun I ever had in this game was after I finally started cheating when I could buy whatever I wanted without having to worry about how much I'd have to grind to get that.

Become a rich gangster with tons of money just to run around and blow everything up buy a racecar or play a set of golf. This game really gave me a good amount of joyful hours. I would say the only negative thing about this game comes from the long loading times the unskippable cinematics and the heist setup. Money grinding is awful as well but I found it slightly fun to do so that is not a thing I would say is bad but some people may find it boring.

2017-01-06,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I purchased this in part because of the high metacritic rating. REALLY overinflated. This was my first foray into a GTA game. Glad I only paid the on sale price. The single player story mode is extremely boring and immediately and overwhelmingly grind oriented. I don't need another tow truck mission. Hardly anything in the open world is accessible or can be manipulated. The vast majority of NPC cannont be interacted with. I usually don't like online playing there are always other people there to remind me why we all use video games to escape for a while. Really kind of a pointless game.

The community around this game have been changing and modifying the game to make it more fun and enjoyable for years and the PC version has stood out as being the best version for its incredible customizability from settings to mods. Take Two saw this thriving ecosystem and decided that instead of letting it work and improving it that they would C&amp D a critical SINGLE PLAYER ONLY mod that is REQUIRED for safe and fair use friendly modding called Open IV. I wish bad things on a laughably small amount of people but Take Two have Taken Too many good things from our world and I hope they reconsider making such a blatant anti consumer stance on something that they have LITERALLY no right to stop,Grand Theft Auto V

Once you do make it online the chance you will be attacked by a hacker is extremely high its like they have no one manning the support desk for this hackers have literally taken over and are more then willing and able to ruin your purchase. The last is a huge one for me and the killer. The game clearly states it supports sony ps controllers um thats a lie the amount of problems you have with them makes it dam near impossible. My PS3 controller had so many bugs it was unbearable. so i switch to PS4 controller and it works for a few weeks then automaticlly changes its own dam keys every login to where you are having to remap it every login then it eventually stops being recognized by GTAV all togeather. And god help you if you contact support there answer to everything is to run file check on everything like the support agent just started that day and is using you to learn. just save your self some money and headache and do not buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-10,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is a master class in world buidling design and single player open world story telling. Unfortunately GTA Online is a toxic pay to win dumpster fire. Even more unfortunate GTA 5 was originally intended to have single player story DLC. Instead of extending the excellent single player experience Rockstar decided to invest those resources in continually releasing new content for GTA Online. This wouldn't been so bad if nearly every ing thing weren't behind an in game currency paywall. In order to progress and even access most of the content you need to constantly shell out currency and lots of it. If you want you can spend an additional $40 right off to avoid a ridiculous grind in order to access a good portion of the content but even with it there's still more content to buy though you will be equipped to make in game currency much easilerIf you've interested in the single player experience which is fantastic buy this game.If you're interested in a multiplayer crime game check out Pay Day 2 or something along those lines.If you're OK with super predatory p2w mechanics and one of the most toxic communities on the internet...you'll be right at home here.Buy this game if you're interested in the single player experience.,Grand Theft Auto V

Its a cool game I spent 80 dollars on it. Im going to play it and then mabey another dlc will come out and I will play some more.

2018-07-28,0,0,604,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V was one of the most influential and 'game'changing titles in recent years and it was one of the best games of all time. HowEVER as a five year old game it's been getting stale. The countlless free (but mandatory) DLC updates for Online all feel the same and make you wonder why the in game currency seems to be worth less and less each time. Obviously it's microtransactions. Don't play this game in 2018 (on second thought if you havent played it yet why not). Play Watch Dogs 2 instead that one was underplayed. Not much point to writing a review for this nowadays but it's gotten old and the DLCs aren't much but a posthumous reach for a few extra cents.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,89,False,Recommended,"Ahh rockstar. the gaming giants creating the ultimate crime playgrounds since the 90's. Then GTA V comes out becoming one of the best selling games of all time. there was a wide world to explore 3 protagonists all with different abillities and backgrounds and some of the most beautiful graphics to exist at the time. Sadly the initial release didn't include a PC version and everyone was annoyed since a PC version means tons and tons of mods to enhance the gameplay. Then a ""Next Gen"" version came out with improved graphics realistic First person mode and... still no PC release. Everyone got a bit more annoyed. Finally 3 years after the initial release of GTA V the PC Version comes out and the internet Rejoices. The Community is hard at work creating new mods like the hulk a zombie apocalypse a trainer that lets you do ing anything. All is well until just today when it was revealed that the backbone of GTA modding OPENIV got a cease and desist. Everyone is going ing berserk and they have the right to. I can understand banning people for using mods in multiplayer but making it near impossible for your community to continue enjoying a game they've bought 3 ING TIMES!?

2016-12-19,0,0,275,False,Recommended,Well it is one of the best sellers he story part is awesome as it is said but i will talk about online part of this game. First of all if you don't have friends playing GTA V online might be boring for you. There are many things to do such as stunt races heist missions CEO missions or motorcycle club missions which is mainly drug dealing and all that stuff etc. But when you want to play any of these you must join a room which is mostly formed by 4 people. Since there are many options it certainly will take a time to full all the positions. Beside the waiting for any mission this game is still a huge fun even in freemode. You can just meet with ordinary players in map and do stupid but funny things like trying to stop the train or going in military zone. By the way i should warn you about hackers. I know many people said there are modders but their number is growing everyday.,Grand Theft Auto V

Cinematics modifications (SINGLE PLAYER ONLY!) the storyline all of these are amazing. I love the game as a whole however recently Take Two had made a big mistake. Modding was removed but then restored? I'm unsure but I sincerely do recommend this game. Modding isn't ""illegal"" and wasn't ""illegal"" during the takedown but it was against the EULA. However you are still able to mod and I believe recently the takedown was backed up. Have fun!",Grand Theft Auto V

I bought GTA V on PS3 PS4 Xbox 360 Xbox One and Twice on PC. Unfortunatly Rockstar has banned my account for no aparent reason and will not let me know why. I have not played GTA V online for almost 6 months and I have never modded the game. If I legitamatly did something to ban me I would like to know what it is and not just tell me that bans are not able to be appealed.

2018-03-04,0,0,139,False,Not Recommended,I love the single player mode but Online has been engineered in such a way that it favors those who buy shark cards and its hard to argue that the starter pack isn't pay to win given the instant advantage it gives over new players who would have to grind for hundreds of hours to match. This has resulted in a two tier experience online where players who paid for shark cards and the starter kits are treated favorably by other players while those who just want to play online without paying anything additionally are treated like a nusiance by the paying players. At the very beginning I've been religated to solo sessions because I can't find people who will play with me anyway and the higher level players liked to use me for target practice or killed me indirectly so their mental state would be unaffected. Overall all this has made the whole experiance sour and the atmosphere toxic when its clear there is lots of fun to be had here.... but only if you are willing to pay more for it otherwise you'll be treated like an outcast by both Rockstar and players.This definately a departure from the great experience I had with Red Dead Redemption and GTA IV online experience.

I digress SURELY this latest GTA game will be ALL of the things a game like this SHOULD be coming from a company all of Us loyal PAYING fans made rich with so many purchases of their games over the years... SURELY this game is AWESOME SAUCE dipped in molten CHOCOLATE?!? No sorry this game is WAY worse with the idiotic ghetto trash single charcter (if you play as anybody else in story later I'll never find out I have no desire to be a ghetto trash wanna be gangsta minority in ANY game) with a playable NWA music video for a story mode one that's ridiculously perverted (h0m0s3xual dogs3x... your aunt asking for footrubs &amp other inapropriate physical attention etc.) utterly stupid in the way the games inhabitants act AND speak Oh &amp you CAN play offline with a whole bunch of characters (I can EVEN make one that looks like Me) but you'll get no weapons no missions &amp cannot save any progress dirrector mode ...I have SIXTY MB/s netspeed on a ""gaming"" PC that's less then a year old... I can play lagfree on MMOs with servers over 5 thousand miles accross the ocean but cannot connect to GTA's cheap 20 year old server like EVER. if you go by all the various forums around the net neither can MOST players AND the ones who can... get random lagspikes &amp disconnects for no reason what so ever EVEN playing in solo online modes...The game may LOOK nice but that's it... no matter how much in game cash you spend on the game's TOP END vehicles &amp motorcycles they ALL handle like crap which is sad because even going top speed they feel/look like you're going about 40 MPH compaired to real life driving... The one single airplane I've found to fly yet also handled like utter crud Saints row TWO (not 3 or 4 or even 5 BUT TWO) had vehicles planes &amp helecoptors that handled WAY Way way better then these do. Maybe if Rockstar cared more about gameplay &amp fun factor (a term often used in the 90s by game companies back when games actually WERE designed with FUN in mind) instead of eye candy to sell more copies to their target audience that they OBVIOUSLY hate... this game COULD have been the best all around game ever made but instead it's the last nail in Rockstar's coffin for MANY people who like Myself feel as though they've been duped.If you think playing a WAY worse story mode then GTA San andreas had (which was actually witty &amp fun despite being forced to play out an NWA video) as a ghetto trash minority in an idiotic &amp utterly repulsive version of LA &amp never want to play online or as a custom char that looks like you then by all means purchase this game if you plan on playing online go shell out 1 000 bucks for a new Playstation &amp hang online with all those mouthy kids.TWO updates later the have to turn off your video card to boot up the game error HAS been fixed but it didn't fix anything about their cheap old trashy server connectivity issues that MOST players have on PC ...I cannot believe what Microsoft &amp EA have turned the video game industry into since about Y2K but it's utterly disgusting sad that in order to play games that aren't broken &amp are still fun We have to dig out old copies of games that're a decade or more old... You broke My heart Rockstar We're through *drops mic* ###Update###Okay after playing the game online for awhile ""IF"" your online mode will work there's TONS of neat &amp fun stuff to do on this game... You can make a custom avatar to use online (even save more then one per profile) The editor is a little hard to figure out at 1st chose mother+ father then toggle which you look more like then chose skintone etc. After that the edit is pretty easy took Me a good hour juggling the mother/father bits to get one that even remotely looked like Me but in the end it's worth the effort I guess... Watch out for hacktool users online as there was almost always one in every session I was in but when people start mocking them they usually leave also watch for campers sitting outside places like where the tutorial ends etc. All n all if they manage to get MOST (preferably all) players to stay connected online with future updates &amp server tweeks I do highly recomend this game... the story mode is still offensive &amp ridiculously ""ghetto"".**Edit** ""IF"" you can connect &amp stay connected online want to spent an hour making your avatar &amp don't mind at least 10% of the people you encounter in freeroam &amp jobs (races deathmatch heists etc.) being hacktool users then this honestly IS an awesome game... the cars almost always spin out when you ""TRY"" to drift but the peddal bikes &amp motorbikes drift quite well The stats they make you build up during the game glitch out in multiplayer the custom tires glitch out on motorbikes BUT none of this is that big of deal nor does the bugs make the game unfun... the engine Saints Row 2 was made with is WAY better for the way vehicles handle across the board yet this game overall if the 1st sandbox game to top SR2 in overall ""FUN"" factor. Oh &amp the plane races are asinine &amp all aircraft handle like crap... Hey Rockstar go play Saints Row 2 1 000 hours for each dev then fix your planes AND car drifting.

2016-12-25,0,0,357,False,Recommended,I've played Grand Theft Auto V for 300+ hours. Which is enough time to beat the game multiple times and enjoy a couple hundred hours of multiplayer. If you want a good review this might be it.The game is a good addition to the series. It is a great display of the newest generation of graphics and gameplay. Here is my breakdown PriceI pre ordered this game for $60.00 USD. I think it is worth that price considering how much it has to offer. I haven't seen a person play this game for less than 100 hours before moving on. And it's a game you can come back to in a couple months. It definitely isn't cheap but it was one of the biggest game releases of the year taking thousands of people to make. The price is to be expected with a game this big and this long awaited.DifficultyThe game comes with many different options to make it as enjoyable as you want it to be. It is quite customizable. Online it can be a bit challenging. You face high pressure pvp situations at times and at others you might play with hackers. The heists are also quite hard at times. It was a good time all the way through and continues to be. The only real difficulty might be running the game with lower end computers.Overview and RatingThe game is great. I would say it is worth the price for not only the campaign but also (if not mainly) the multiplayer experience. It is great to play with friends. I would recommend it to anybody that likes the older GTA's or any games of the sort. It has also had quite a few DLC updates after it's release which is great.I would give the game a 9.1/10. Here are pro's and con's Pro'sFunGreat multiplayerGreat graphicsLots of contentCon'sHigh priceRampid hackersMay be hard to runAll credits go to Rockstar. Thank you.,Grand Theft Auto V

The gun play is better than orther GTAs but still not the best but fun.The missions are well designed. The map is well crafted.The performance is very good on my mid ranged rig. Cons.The characters are obnoxious and the worst of the series.The writing is garbage not smart like the previous games.The story is sloppy and the married with children angle is just dopey TV farty sitcom with more cursing and a 'edge'.Most of the jokes are just edgy to be edgy.The NPC bantar on the street is zzzzz which is very disapointing because GTA was the BEST at that. The map is small like IV.The races have a 'cheat' for the main driving character which makes it too easy. Since the driving and the driving routes are the best of the series it gets a thumbs up. It's an impressive game despite the horrible writting. At this point the price for the game is right.,Grand Theft Auto V

Graphics were good for that year that it came out. Gameplay is really good in single and online mode. But when you finish the snigle player you go to online. And here where the starts. I bought this game only for online I played single player after 300 hours of gameplay. First time gta online was good enjoyed it 100%. But then people just randomly started blowing you up. Not just doing it with RPG or some other explosive guns they were just hackers. I dont know if you get banned or no but in every session there were like at least 5 hackers. Some were just getting XP or money. Ok i dont care if people use hacks to get xp or money but when i drive and randomly die thats the thing i care about. After couple years rockstar didn do with that even I think now people just hack in sessions and rockstar dont do After some couple updates we saw some flying cars and bikes with missles. Ok my question is WTF? They made this game grinding all other updates are either some cool flying with rockets machine gun and you become god inside or grinding property like office moto club and bunker. Its all about grinding money to spend on some OP Its not fun anymore.

Do you like to race cars? Do that. Heisting? Do that too. Anything you want. Just don't cheat or ruin other people's fun.However all the cool stuff is so god awfully expensive. I heard one Youtuber say ""cancel your Red Dead Redemption preorder and never buy another shark card"". This is the state of the gaming industry. People afraid to hold onto their money because they're afraid they'll be left out of the new cool thing.GTA does everything it can to get you to buy Shark Cards. I'm not feffing joking. Prepare for having no life because you'll spend it stealing business supplies cargo and vehicles because EVERYTHING costs money and LOTS of it.People are grinding this game because they can't afford all this expensive stuff. I stopped playing GTA because the game doesn't respect my time. Upon replaying it it still doesn't. The toxic PVP makes the grinding like pulling teeth it'll be all over soon just a few more minutes of your time. Waste your life fighting toxic edgelord e thugs so that you can spend more money on Shark Cards so you can get that weaponized vehicle to fight them with only to be blown out of the sky/water with a new thing that was released a week later.The PVPers and griefing modders want you to stick around for as long as possible and endure whatever whimsy they have. I report the modders vote to kick and move on. But for every modder I report five more show up. And the newbie players don't help in votekicking they're too busy kissing modder's ashes to get free money.I'm not saying you should not play multiplayer there are good people in this game.

They make this game worth it.I will never miss the PVPers or the griefer modders or money modders. I hope they have the day they deserve. If you think that's me being polite you need to think about that statement a little further.Singleplayer is fun to play. Multiplayer with friends and productive players is fun too.The multiplayer is riddled with issues and let me explain by drawing comparisons to other ""open world"" games.Saints Row The Third NPCs are reasonable some even come equipped with pistols to defend themselves.GTA Pistols FEH. I have a car and no regard for the online character's life.Fallout 4 Let me compensate you for that mission you did for me.GTA Congrats you made a sale for a friend you get NO MONEY.Saints Row Congrats on taking out that Stronghold now here's the money for doing it!GTA Looks like you rolled a plane sale! But oh it bugged out! You won't be able to finish the mission or your plane blew up!GTA Online suffers from what my friend SpazzDragon calls ""Mosquito bites of B.S. "" basically all these little things that Jarate you off to no end that make playing the game less than enjoyable. You can't just boot it up and feff around. You have to make money the way R* wants you to. You have to fight other players like R* wants you to. All while dealing with these mosquito bites. And then maybe you can scrimp and pinch pennies until you can afford a weaponized vehicle to fight them with and maybe THEN you can feff around until the modders/greifers show up in your lobby.It's a good thing the Onlline portion is free for people who own the game because if it were a paid product I'd probably be even more angry.

2017-11-26,0,0,9668,False,Recommended,Source IGNFor me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again. Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent wickedly comic and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary post economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire it rips into the Millennial generation celebrities the far right the far left the middle class the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar s sharp tongue including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first person shooter called Righteous Slaughter ( Rated PG pretty much the same as the last game. ) It s not exactly subtle he literally has the word Entitled tattooed on his neck and the in game radio and TV s outright takes don t leave much to the imagination but it is often extremely funny and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto s San Andreas is a fantasy but the things it satirises greed corruption hypocrisy the abuse of power are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.Grand Theft Auto V s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains hijack military aircraft and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people albeit extraordinarily f***ed up people.Michael is a retired con man in his 40s filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son air headed daughter serially unfaithful wife and very expensive therapist all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang banger stereotype even as he s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there s Trevor a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed up childhood. The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three and it s a credit to GTA V s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times they re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.This three character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto s personality. In doing so it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here many of Michael s missions revolve around his family and his past Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills Franklin can to slow time while driving for example which gives them a unique touch. Narratively it s effective even off mission I found myself playing in character acting like a mid life crisis guy with anger issues as Michael a thrill seeker as Franklin and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car because I felt like that s what he d want.Trevor feels a like a bit of a get out of jail free card for Rockstar providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get out clauses go though it s pretty effective and Trevor s over the top missions are some of GTA V s action packed highlights. It s a successful way of solving a problem that s prevalent in open world games the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both masterfully allowing neither to undermine the other. Last but not least Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-22,0,0,207,False,Recommended,"So far I can say I like it. The story's good the gameplay is pretty solid the game world is highly reactive and there's a lot of options for customization. The pace of advancement on GTAO is nice.However some downsides GTA requires you to for.. Whatever reason register a second 'social club' account if you wish to play it *at all*. So keep in mind that your product is kinda held to ransom behind that. But on a personal note I really didn't care.The online servers are somewhat unreliable and i've stopped playing public sessions because I encountered hackers almost the second I was put into the game. The tutorial weirdly seems insistant on forcing you to play online with people potentially exposing a player who's trying to learn the game to players of greater skill or as in my personal experience a hacker. An experience that could prompt some people to demand an immediate refund!That being said what has irked me most is the aggrivating way that Rockstar has set up the story to online transition. If for any reason you get pushed from an invite only session to a public session you will have to wait for several loading screens because the only way to change to a private/invite session again is to load story mode and then load GTAO again. You also have to launch the game in story mode initially if you wish to play in a closed/invite only session. The missions are enjoyable i'd recommed rockstar consider adding in some basic AI for things like races and 2+ player missions so that players can choose to race against or do multi man missions with AI for lesser rewards. I understand the point of GTAO online is to play online but there's really no reason not to accomodate as many people as possible and i'd love to team up against AI with my friends in the ""PVP"" jobs.Just my two cents. Overall great game worth the money.EDIT 10/23/2017 Finding rockstar's servers to be incredibly unreliable. Multiple times i've been disconnected mid mission and forfeited of all my earnings as a result.I also have at least one friend who's unable to play and has found it hard to troubleshoot the issue because Rockstar makes no real effort to visibly provide fixes or tips for problems that are experienced by a *lot* of people. Rockstar's general attitude towards customer service seems to be to do as little as humanly possible.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-03,0,0,348,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an incredible game with hours upon hours of entertainment. It has bucketloads of care and attention to detail for just about everything such as an informative yet simple UI extremely satisfying and consistent hitreg hyper realistic ragdoll physics semi destructible environments unique handling for different cars well designed missions easter eggs and the list goes on. The story is expertly put together with very few (if any) plotholes incredibly likeable main characters and many relateable side characters. The atmosphere is spot on where every separate area of Los Santos makes you feel like you're really there from meth farms in Blaine County to Superficial cars and people in the hills to graffiti and gangster ridden slums everything is perfect. HOWEVER GTA Online is not nearly such an instant hit. While the atmosphere is largely intact and much of the attention to detail is carried over there are a few massive problems with GTA Online that can make or break it for you. GTA Online awards players money and RP mainly for three things completing jobs completing heists and participating in freeroam activities. Even then people rarely play any jobs besides the job that gives 2x cash and RP at the time due to how over saturated the jobs list is. This also makes the create a job feature near worthless because nobody will ever want to play a street race after they do a rocket voltic stunt race. This narrows your money earning options significantly as you could imagine.Heists are incredibly fun the first time you play through them with tons of dialouge (not yours obviously) and decently entertaining setup missions. However there comes the problem that missions designed for heavy team coordination do not work well in an environment where you'd be lucky to find someone with a mic that isn't screaming epithets.This leaves what is in my opinion the best money making method freeroam activities. Owning a motorcycle club/business/corporation/gunrunning is very fun while simultaneously being tense because you're doing it in the company of people who can snatch it right from you. However this isn't as well paying as heists and getting dominated by a 6 person MC is not fun in the slightest.On the bright side there are a plethora of things to buy whether it be to expand your business or just luxury goods. However this leads to the issue where you can't buy anything because you're not earning enough. But don't worry shark cards and subliminal messaging come to save the day! With constant annoying calls from side characters telling you to buy things from all the separate expansions i feel you're being pushed to buy into the shark cards.And then the most glaring issue of them all is modders. Modders run rampant in GTA Online. In fact they run so rampant that the community got fed up of calling them hackers and began to call them modders. Half the servers you get into there will be a modder whether they're openly killing everyone or just constantly spawning in vehicles for themselves they'll be there. And on nearly every server you'll see people asking and begging modders to give them money. And the best part is that R* has employed a team of chimps to stop this from happening considering so many people have been banned for having the modded money levels and weapons that modders gave them.On a brighter note the expansions for online are free even if you probably can't afford to participate in them and playing with friends can be pretty satisfying.TL DR If you want to buy GTA 5 and feel like GTA Online is a nice bonus for the pricetag buy this game immediately. However if you want to buy GTA Online and feel like GTA 5 is a nice bonus for the pricetag go buy san andreas and play with the online mod for that game because it is ironically moderated much more and has a far less toxic community.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,989,False,Not Recommended,"GTAV is a genre defining sandbox game I mean what game *isn't* at least partially based around mechanics forged from the series? Over the decade it has evolved and developed into a unique title with every console generation. Now for the online game. I want to like GTA Online. I really do. Since I purchased the game I have not sat down for more than an hour of online foolery with friends without at least one modder/hacker/scriptkiddie dropping in and parking a bus in my garage or insta killing my cargo shipments from across the map. Or selling off all my cars. When I do (and it's a rare occurence) manage to find a lobby that's not full of hacked cars or screaming kids I do manage to have a half decent time. Until I hit a paywall needing another 2 million dollars to progress my business. Rather than provide interesting diverse gameplay to achieve the many expensive things in the online mode (and there are a lot of expensive necesary items) Rockstar chose mircotransactions. Lots of them. For the low low price of 9.99 or so you can chop nearly a dozen hours off any grind for any item through the in game ""shark cards"" (aptly named payment for direct progression). ""Oh but they're not necesary!"" Sure. You can grind for dozens and dozens of hours for a small bit of progression and the Shark Cards get a little expensive for larger purchases. You can hit your head against that wall as long as you want. However as far as I'm concerned direct money out of your wallet for small chunks of progress undermines the entire point of the online game. TL DR The game is quite enjoyable at its core however total lack of moderation or consideration towards players spoils the online mode. Microtransactions although not totally necesary to progress ruin my enjoyment of the game by always lingering there as an easy out option.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-21,0,0,1982,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar themselves have forgotten what this franchise is about. It's a good game riddled with ridiculous weaponised vehicles and items that never needed to be added and bugs that have never been fixed some since release.Nobody ever asked for an orbital cannon either. Its literally like paid first party mods for players with actual modded money. It costs 750k to fire once. One time. One target. 4 8 hours of grinding for me and that's money wasted on something that can be done with a single sticky bomb and a 4km trip in most cases.750k can buy a top of the range sports car and all of its performance mods. 750k can buy an MC. 750k can buy like 5 high end apartments. It used to take me an entire week to grind to get the Kuruma armored on the Xbox 360 version.The base game was great. Import export was a great dlc. Gunrunning smugglers run and Doomsday DLC was some of the worst dlc to ever come to this game. These DLC's make it harder to do NORMAL CEO/MC free mode missions.The amount of bugs sometimes makes this game unplayable sometimes forcing me to restart the game and wait about 4 minutes to get back into a good low population lobby where I can be safe from modders (there's about 2 per 20 pllayers in a public session on PC)I also enjoy this game most of the time and I enjoy import/export missions and it really sucks that some idiot in a flying car or motorcycle can lock on to me and destroy 80k worth of car. The risk is too much sometimes. I've actually been so angry from playing this game sometimes. It's the masochistic sadists at rockstar to blame not my bad driving or defensive tactics or the 10 year old on the chrome oppressor it's rockstars greed. Absolute disgust for most of their employees.The thing I really enjoy though is the amount of pure vehicle customization. There's no licensing of vehicles or vehicle parts so they can literally put any (non weaponised) car in that they feel the community would enjoy. The Elegy retro is my favourite car. The manchez is my favourite motorcycle.It's like driving a really nice car covered in feces. There's something good under all of it.I hope GTA 6 does not include ANY weaponised vehicles unless they are about as powerful as a normal tank or hydra with the same Pegasus delivery style. That's how much I could tolerate. GTA 6 should ONLY be focused on what this game is about. Stealing cars and driving cars. But they let the greed take over with GTA V but only after 2 or 3 years.Would not recommend to new players. You have to be a player since release to have a good time.And the amount of time between dlc's is getting to the point where i wont touch this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

So Rockstar has made a game with alot of potential here but sadly Rockstar only cares for their games aslong as they can make money out of it. And in the case of GTA the only updates that are brought out are content updates so there will be more vehicles and more things the player can spend money on so that he will buy more sharkcards. There are no updates for things like bugfixes performanceimprovement or weapon and vehiclebalancing. Also there are just general gamemechanics in GTA V that are either absolutely cancerous (for example when your charackter decides to roll down a hill with 3km/h and then just ing dies and you respawn on top of the whole god ing mountain again) or just not in the game (for example crouching &amp ledgegrabbing which were both extremely helpful mechanics in GTA IV).So I would say the game is playable and you will have fun with it at some point but it's not worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,Well looks like the Grand Theft Auto series ends here with greed from Take Two and the CEO treating customers like his personal piggy bank all whilst whining that he could monitise GTA V even more and that if he did the customer might start to notice .I never did like GTA Online with its pay to win microtransactions and sending OpenIV a cease and desist sealed the series death for me.Goodbye it was a grand old time and F YOU TAKE TWO.Update Dec 2018 They continue to add new content to online hackers and cheaters are rife still and no care for any single player DLC or extra features or missions it is all about the money that online makes.Grand Theft Auto V is probably the end of the series for many and considering RDR2 has a similar online grind that is designed to make Take Two and Rockstar as much money as possible leaves me with little hope for the next GTA game. Companies that are this large making this amount of money with a system like online and milking it for all it is worth start putting profits before game design designing games around a model that profits rather than what is good or innovative.GTA Online feels like it was designed and built from the question What can we (Take Two and Rockstar) do to maximise our gain from all the players? rather than What experience can we offer to the best of our ability to the players? .The GTA singleplayer experience now takes a back burner and is turned down to a simmer whilst online gets all the spices and heat turned up. This nelglect of GTA V's singleplayer experience is why I will no longer consider buying future GTA games.GTA is no longer the king of openworld games there are plenty of other developers who consider game making an art that is first and foremost about the players experience all whilst keeping it singleplayer cough CD PR cough.RIP Grand Theft Auto 1997 2015 Damn you DMA design you made some great games once.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-12,0,0,49,False,Recommended,Still a fantastic open world game. Most of the negativity comes from normies who played the multiplayer too much.The actual single player is top knotch. I have never played a game that has such good writing and characters whilst also being so insanely hilarious at times. Everything is a lot more seamless than gta 4 and the gameplay mechanics are beyond anything you could reasonably expect from a sequel. The only actual issues I have are the downgraded Physics and the overabundance of killing in the single player missions.You'll notice that the physics for enemies aren't nearly as detailed as they were in 4. Enemies aren't as reactive to getting shot at as they were in the previous game.The technological downgrades aren't a huge deal but the excessive killing can hurt the story a bit. Like I know the trio of characters are experienced but I don't really think they can down 30+ guys in the span of 15 20 minutes.However I think that's more of an issue with video games in general and not gta 5.It's just something that stuck out for me as I played.Everything else is great though lmao.

2015-10-09,1,1,432,False,Not Recommended,This game suffers from a wide range of issues HUGE grind as well as a large amount of hackers &amp toxic players. Singleplayer itself is rather alright though it's a bit lacking in activities.I'll focus on some things hurting the game (primarily Online) Possibly one of the most toxic online communities nowadays. Expect people to use the most OP / cheesy ways to kill you including a hitscan RPG. More about that later. Connection issues disconnecting game moving you to a different server and away from your friends you just played with. Very long loading times it's often faster to load into single player and then multiplayer than straight into multiplayer. Also those long loading times continue even after you got into multiplayer and are just hopping between gamemodes heck they don't have to start. All that needs to prompt a load is you accepting an invite into a game lobby (more precisely waiting room) You can't use Steam Overlay when loading because said loading will simply pause. Bad and laggy melee combat system. Hackers. There's lots of them and they have HUGE range of abilities you think an enemy constantly spawning in a jet (which normally takes time to get is very powerful and can be super difficult to take down) is annoying? Well I hope you don't meet hackers who can kick you out of the session or crash your game by spawning dozens of clothes on you. Limited clothes. Rockstar has been improving itself when it came to clothing adding some new models with every larger update (although they still never added the objects available for all three main characters in singleplayer). However those clothes are often of poor texture quality and aren't available in all colours. You like red? Well that's a shame we only have pitch black white brown navy blue camo desert camo forest camo and two hideous mixes. Also don't expect to make your entire outfit match the green you have on your sweater will most likely be different from the one on your cap. Also the game is really strict on what you can wear with what for example you can wear this jacket with these shirts but not with those shirts or you can wear a scarf with pink tanktop but not with black tanktop. Car customization is a bit eeh in the game. Many cars aren't very customizable the best thing you can do in many of them is lengthen the sides by a couple of centimeters. Some cars aren't customizable at all and you can't even put them in your normal garage. Heists are pretty damn boring. They're nothing like in Singleplayer where you have multiple approaches places to set up your escape vehicles et cetera et cetera. In GTA Online heists are pretty much standard missions with some story behind them you don't have a choice in how to go through with the mission. Also if somebody leaves during a heist everyone will drop out. Combine that with the connection issues and you'll see the possible infuriation. At least the stories and cutscenes are fun.. Things are extremely expensive (up to several millions) in order to 'encourage' people to buy Shark Cards AKA cards giving you in game currency for real money. In reality you get little currency for huge amount. You need to grind a lot for money.. or find a hacker who will simply spawn millions for you to pick up. Though you're likely to get banned even if you never intended to pick up any money that the hacker spawned on you. GTA V uses a level (rank) system for its weapons so you'll be able to unlock specific weapons at specific levels. ...Except that they added free widely available DLCs which add the best weapons (stat wise) to purchase with no rank restrictions. There's a complete lack of balance not even an attempt at it. Aside from the aforementioned nonsense with the levels Rockstar started with things like fast bullet proof vehicles and eventually reached explosive bullets which can be applied to a sniper rifle creating a hitscan RPG that I mentioned. Perfect for killing players with one shot to the big toe. Their customer support is infamous for being useless even in really urgent cases like having your account stolen. If they reply to you then their bot will copy paste you a useless response about how bans are permament when you asked for something else. Rockstar releases huge content patches which you need to pay tons of money to get into. CEO update? Pay at least a million for an office then few hundred thousand for a warehouse. You also have to pay for crates which are the main missions in this update. Oh yeah randoms can completely destroy all your progress during the final mission when you sell said crates. They're even encouraged to attack you. The recent Gunrunning upgrade allows you to conduct research in order to get things like weapon mods (including the explosive ammunition for the Hitscan RPG mentioned above). Research takes.. 4 real life hours I believe? You need to be online through it all and you need to keep your supply meter high you either buy those or steal them (AKA do a mission one that takes place in the full lobby so everyone can attack you while you're doing it other players even get a ping to let them know about you!). There are 45 research upgrades that means 7.5 days of playtime. Of course you can speed up the research with sweet $$$ and what better way to get it than with Shark Cards! Oh the research is random too you do not get to pick what you want to get next. Oh yeah Singleplayer doesn't get anything. Not even the many vehicles that appear Online. Rockstar likes to patch stuff! Especially if by 'stuff' I mean harmless glitches that for example allow you to equip a mask with a hat something you can't do normally and yet it looks perfectly fine no clipping or anything. Having lower graphics specifically ones that change the amount of nature puts you at a gigantic advantage. Having said option put to lowest absolutely removes grass which can be rather high in this game leading to situations in which you get headshotted by someone you couldn't see behind it all. There are also some facts like that Rockstar fooled customers by raising the price of GTA V when Steam Summer Sale 2015 started (so the discount it got was equivalent to its standard price of 59 99 ). Not only that they included Shark Cash Card. Said Shark Cash Card gives you in game money. Sounds pretty sweet right? Except that it counts as a redeemed DLC the moment you get it which means that you wouldn't be able to get a refund for GTA V because of it.In 2017 of course there was the fiasco with making mods illegal.All in all singleplayer which I didn't focus a lot on as it's rather okay has a nice story likeable characters although it's lacking in activities and is very unlikely to receive any sort of story enhancing DLCs. Online is terrible imbalanced toxic and Rockstar's greedy attempts at taking more money aren't helping the game as a whole. If you're not sure whether to get it or not ask yourself if you have friends to play with because trying to find yourself in the community will be problematic. Don't get it just for the singleplayer. And don't get it for full price.It's a shame really at its core GTA is a super fun game but everything Rockstar built on top of it only dragged it further down and down.,Grand Theft Auto V

You are also unable to use mod menus to spawn in multiplayer content in singleplayer with the game removing it almost instantly after spawning. Some vehicles such as the ramp buggy from gunrunning are actually buffed up for the test drive mission with the ramp buggy being near indestructible in the missions but in free roam they get destroyed after ramping 5 cars at the most. The online community is toxic and will flame you for killing them in grant theft auto a game known for massive amounts of death and destruction and especially if you do what the game tells you to do and blow up their shipments from the afformentioned updates and even more so if you use something such as the hydra VTOL jet. Some positive things now the soundtrack is pretty great and features a variety of music it's pretty decently optimized and even ran at around 30fps on low 720p on my old GT 730 and the singleplayer is very fun to play even more so with mods.

2017-11-26,0,0,70,False,Recommended,One of the best parts of this game is the online multiplayer because you can do a lot of what you can do in the singleplayer game explore shop run from the cops kill people kill your friends rob stores buy a house race and the list goes on. The singleplayer game is also fun and you can do some more things like hunt and do photography. The world actually feels even bigger in singleplayer. You can waste tens of hours in this game with your friends or even alone. I bought it when it was discounted to $40 and I can say that it was very well worth those $40.Also it's really easy to get in game money! It's not worth it to get shark cards. You shouldn't be spending more on a game that you've already purchased to keep. &gt,Grand Theft Auto V

This is about online play.For quite a while griefers were making this game near unplayable. From my personal experience lately this has luckily been increasingly been solved as I am experiencing it less each update. But there are still issues with the game if you're a solo player.I understand that Rockstar wants you playing with friends but that is not always an option. So you try and get in an heist or game. Some of these go pretty quick. Most of the time though if you aren't playing one of the game types that are either double xp/cash or one the game is suggesting you probably are going to be waiting a long time. It would be very nice if Rockstar would make even a couple solo heists that are either specific to 1 2 players or some that can be done with 1 4 instead of either needing 4 to even launch it.I'm glad Rockstar is still updating the game and thoroughly impressed as to how far and fun the game has came but it's definitely still a ""play with friends"" game and not the best game to play alone.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-03,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,NOT RECOMMENDING THE ONLINESINGLE PLAYER IS RECOMMENDEDBut really the online is a shameful cash grab ripe with hackers and griefers. Persue at your own risk. The singleplayer on the otherhand is handsdown one of the most fun and engaging experinces this generation. They really did a marverlous job in that department. If only Rockstar actually cared about singleplayer and expanded it with additional content more than the online. Not only did they do more for the online the singleplayer content in the base game is all your going to get. Online is the go to because that's how they are going to make the most money with the microtransactions. I would say wait until a sale just because of the shady and downright disrespectful practices Rockstar had begun to lean towards. I hope Red Dead Redemption 2 turns out to be a more consumer friendly experience than the Shark Card sham that is GTA Online.Also ignore my time played I played this mostly on the xbox and bought it for PC only for it to not work because of poor optimization and compatibility with my OS.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-13,0,0,1232,False,Recommended,Where do i even begin with this game. I've been playing GTA for almost 4 years (2014 2015 on Xbox One before i got banned) and i have to tell you that this game is a bittersweet pill to mei despise the fact that the online is a chaotic grindfest these days as i had seen better days when it was simple fun and rewarding but i absolutely LOVE the singleplayer i spent 300 hours on singleplayer alone just replaying the missions and having fun with mods. Everytime i get sick of it or mad at it i would still come back to it and play more GTA Now lets move on to the conflicting part of the review Online Online is flawed chaotic and hectic but it's still fun as There are still nice people online and i happen to know 30 of my friends just playing online Online is rage inducing but everytime i quit i'd still get back into the online world sure the vehicle prices are alot but who needs those to have fun you can just download singleplayer mods for those vehicles so would i recommend it? Yes,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-15,0,0,2447,False,Recommended,"Pros Beautiful and detailed open world from sunsets over the ocean to the busy streets of Los Santos and the moonlit mountains in Blaine County. Thousands of hours in and I am still finding small and interesting details that I have never noticed before. Engaging singleplayer with three main playable characters with their own special abilities and quirks. Wealth of free content updates for Online every year since launch adding new features heists game modes weapons vehicles properties etc. Great soundtrack including the in game radio. You have the ability to record and edit singleplayer and online gameplay clips from color filters to camera angles in the Rockstar Editor to easily produce high quality video content or screenshots. You also have a Content Creator that allows you to create your own races and deathmatches to share with the GTA Online community. Ability to use third or first person point of view. Even though the game lacks official mod support and Steam Workshop it has a massive modding community for singleplayer and third party multiplayer mods like FiveM. (This is also a con for vanilla GTA Online.) Cons Online on PC suffers from a long term toxic community and cheater epidemic. It's probably nine times out of ten that every full public lobby that you join will have some kind of cheater using mods in it and they either keep to themselves or mess with everyone spawning objects on people griefing players in weaponized god mode vehicles or kicking players instantly that they don't like from the lobby etc. (Keep in mind even with the community the way it is there is still plenty of chances to find amazing people and have epic experiences.) Shark Card microtransactions. Extensive grind in Online. Long loading times. NPCs can be a nuisance sometimes with how normal civilians drive and get in the way. Overzealous police that will stop at nothing to kill you practically driving under tank treads on purpose to perform a PIT maneuver. Some Online mission related enemies are just bullet sponges with laser like accuracy. ""It's LJT ugh with some bad news..."" ""Hey there it's your partner LJT..."" ""It's LJT. Guess who I just spoke to? Hmm?..."" ""LJT you got a minute?..."" ""Just your friend LJT..."" ""It's LJT ugh with some bad news..."" ""Hey there it's your partner LJT..."" ""It's LJT. Guess who I just spoke to? Hmm?..."" ""LJT you got a minute?..."" ""Just your friend LJT..."" Conclusion Sure Grand Theft Auto V has it's issues but overall I think it's well worth it. Just be wary of the frustrations that may come along with GTA Online like the grind and the cheaters. If you can look past that this is one of the best games ever made.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-24,0,0,1099,False,Recommended,About GTA 5 GTA 5 also known as Grand Theft Auto V. Most people will think Freedom of wandering Freedom to pull the trigger and Freedom to violation of the law. This is a sandbox game with highly DOF! GTA 5 has two modes come with Single player (Story Mode) and Multiplayer (GTA Online) . PROS Highly DOF. (Degree of freedom) Characters of story mode have great personalities. Graphics are breathtaking. Huge map. Great story. Driving more realistic and easy to control. GTA Online will update DLC regularly. You can troll your friend in GTA Online. Compatible with controller. CONS A lot of buildings aren't accessible. Inablity to rob banks/pull off own heists in free roam. Anti Cheat Sytem of GTA Online is suck. Many Modders in GTA Online. (Modder can also be called Hacker) Easy to get mistaken ban when you play with Modder. (But Modder is safe) Rockstar will not unban for you. PRO TIPS If you saw Modder in Session GTA Online quickly change the session to prevent you getting mistake ban. Don t take Modder s money drop.

With friends tho its one of my favorite games. I have had the game since xbox 360 (I preordered). I highly recommend as a game to play with a group of people or a friend. 8/10. My one petpeve is that if you want to keep up with all the free dlc you have to pay a premium with shark cards. Very annoying but worth it in the longrun.,Grand Theft Auto V

In Online Freemode if you kill someone even once with a hunter or anything that has fire power then odds are the person you just killed is going to call up his/her buddy that has mods to hit you off online or force you to leave. At the end of the day do not buy GTA V for the online its not worth the headache and fake reports/kicks you get when you're playing the game they way its ment to be played.

Yes have to restart all over from all the work I've done and put into from when I played in PS3! Yes you can link accounts. This game becomes more a catastrophe each time.

2017-05-29,0,0,682,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game when it decides to workI have had this game for about 8 months or so and it installed just fine and worked fine for about a week. After that the game just randomly decides to not function for a number of various reasons that it decides are a good idea. Now this doesnt happen all the time or daily but it does happen offten enough that it has driven me to give it a negative review.Here are a list of just SOME of the problems that i have encountered while trying to use this game. Game boots up fine and boots into the story or online fine but after about 5 10 min in it crashes and give some cryptic error message about the graphics not being initiallized or something. ( i know this not to be the problem with my computer because i have had this problem happen on THREE computers all with different hardware) Game doesn't even start. Click on the GTA V icon looks normal but crashes and says it failed. Game just randomly doesn't work anymore had to reinstall twice before it worked again. deleted my clound sync data and i lose all of my progress in the game. (i had finished the game) decides not to connect to online just because (not my router as i went to youtube and it worked fine also i dont think it was there servers becaseu a friend of mine could get online just fine.) Straight up vanishes from my desktop. I'm not kidding no i didnt uninstall it was just gone one day ( The icon just vanished not the whole game. while using hardware capable or getting 60+ fps on high settings GTA decides that a solid 10 15 FPS is way more playable. (probably not my hardware as a friend had the same exact thing happen to him.)Now dont get my wrong when the game funtions it is a phenomenal game amazing graphics great story great gameplay etc. But the fact that it crashes and breaks this much is very annoying not to mention the presence of online hackers. Oh and also people seem to be getting banned for no apparent reason.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-30,1,1,221,False,Not Recommended,Alright I need to be real rn. GTAV Online is one of the worst kept online modes in a video game I have ever seen. Never have I seen so many hackers wrongly banned players p2w t in any video game ever. So many issues with the game make me wish rockstar never makes a gtao ever again due to how ing horrible they are at their own job THEIR OWN DAMN JOB. They get paid to do this and they can't even do that right. By all means play single player. Single players is fun balanced expansive and well kept (probably since they never do anything with it) but for everything else about this game the shity people who exploit kids to make money the shity kids who play this game just to hack it and ruin people's day the hackers the community really anything other than the single player and single player mods DO NOT BUY THIS. Even saying this I don't even recommend buying this game because rockstar doesn't deserve the money for this (if anything pirating comes to rockstar probably wouldn't even give a flying ).,Grand Theft Auto V

Basically as you go around the world it will eat up any available RAM (if you have 64gigs of ram it will keep going untill its full) and not clear the cache so you end up getting overloaded memory and the game becomes extremley jittery. To fix you have to close game or get a program that periodically wipes your RAM... which i wouldn't recommend.

2017-06-18,0,0,47,False,Not Recommended,I remember watching the final prerelease trailer for GTAV and preordering immediately. I showed all my gamer friends the trailer for Online it felt like the true next generation of GTA was here. Online began as a letdown missing key features and hampered by inexcusable technical problems that still persist today. Ultimately it became the force that ruined any positive future for a game that I was thrilled about on release. I wish I could return to these characters in storyline DLC. I wish I could rob that casino as Trevor Franklin and Michael. If the DLCs that were supposedly planned and leaked online are true what we got sucks even more in comparison. Oh and all that excitement was for the 360 version. I bought this ing game twice still hopeful there may be more singleplayer content someday. There's still a cool world and a great story mode in the base game but there are companies that deserve your money much more than Take Two does. I can't even fathom how much money they've made off this pig at this point. And now they've had the audacity to ban singleplayer modding tools yet this game uses peer to peer networking and is fundamentally broken from an online security standpoint. The dlc they sell for thousands of points consists of textures that take minutes for an artist to complete and recycled content from scrapped story dlc that would have turned less profit than it did nickel and dimed through shark points.,Grand Theft Auto V

MULTIPLAYER Rockstar pushes out content that you can only use if you either spend your entire life grinding or buy shark cards. I understand they have to make money but come on. The new ""Gunrunning"" DLC costs insane amounts of money just to get up and running. Time to buy a shark card. Oh you want customizations? Shark Card. I would consider buying a shark card except for the fact that I could buy every good Bethesda game for the price of one Megaladon Card.What is the point of buying a game if you have to practically buy the game again for every DLC just to play the DLC.If they added private servers with mod compatability they could solve all of their problems but they are too busy being greedy to appeal to the customers demands.

2018-05-28,1,1,338,False,Recommended,"I'm gonna be talking about the online mode for this review because i didn't bother the single player that much. From what I've played it's pretty good but that's not the point of this review. I have mixed thoughts on GTA Online the Graphics dialog controls and presentation are all amazing but that's just the base game. The online itself is pretty fun. When you're in free mode you can alot without any money and even more with alot of money. You can run people over have gun fights steal vehicles and just mess around with your friends. It's pretty cool but you'll get tired of the stuff you have after a while and you'll need too get money too buy more guns and vehicles. This where the money making comes in. There are a couple ways of doing this such as playing online minigame type stuff doing heists or starting a buisness. Too start off you'll wanna do the heists and get the funding for them from either entering other peoples heists or minigames. There are 5 major heists in the game and 3 extra ""doomsday heists"" which require you own a facility. Now playing these heists with friends is extremely fun and enjoyable and it's probably my favorite aspect of the game. All the heists are extremely well designed too be fun and engaging. But the problem is the isn't alot of them too do and once you done them all you can only do them again which isn't as fun the 2nd time around. But once you done some of the heists you'll have enough money too buy a buisness which can be used to grind for alot more money. The problem is that most of the missions you do in these buinesses are extremely boring or repetitive. The only fun missions are in the bunker jobs but they don't make enough money too be a a good grinding method. But just messing around in free mode is pretty fun but here comes my next problem...This game is plauged by having a (sometimes) awful commuinity has probably the worst hacker problem i've ever seen.I've been in multiple games where everyone is trying too ruin me finishing my buisness or when I kill someone and they litterally got into my friends webcam and threatend too said they'll ruin my computer in 2 days. Nothing happended cause i'm a safe boy but my friend was affected. Too do your buiness you NEED too do the glitch where you on a server on you're own but still counts as a public server. Now the hackers they are everywhere. They will constantly blow you up drop bags of hacked money on you making this stupid menu saying that you can't receive any more money from drops keep coming up. They will teleport too you blow everything you own up making you have too call the stupid insurance company every 10 seconds and even one time they kicked me from online and it glitched my game making it so i can't join back so i had too restart my game. Some hackers aren't that bad but some can be nightmarish. I don't mind if people are hacking aslong as they don't keep screwing me over. I have alot of good friends who are hackers and they don't screw any one over so i don't mind them hacking because every thing is overpriced in this game and that brings me too my next point.Everything is too expensive. It can take a very long time too grind for money in this game and depending on how you're doing it can be insanely boring. Everything on the store can be $1 500 000 $4 500 000. The money seams realistic until you realise from one heists you can get around $70 000 $1 250 000 at max. the adverage heist payout is around $500 000. This means if you wanna get money from heists you have too repeat them alot of times. If you wanna do it from buisnesss lets take the car stealing buisness for example if you steal a top range car and pay $30 000 of for high deal you can make $100 000 but that's for 1 car so you'd have too repeat this alot of times and not all cars are top range so this process can take alot of time. The reason I think it is like this is too promote the shark card feature where if you pay $10 you can get $1 250 000. This is dumb because i don't want too pay for money i want too earn it but if earning it takes a really long time then what's the point. This is probably why alot of people resort too hacking so they can get all the cool things they want without having too do much and i can understand that in a way. Overall the online mode is fun if you're willing too put up with toxic people/hackers and spend ALOT of time grinding for cash. I'd recommend playing for the heists and then stopping once you've done everything with them. Use the money you get with it for funding the next heists with friends and for the facility too do doomsday then once you've done that buy something cool with they money you earned and then stop playing and move onto a different game too play with your friends. I'd rate the online mode a 6/10 fun but flawed. Hopefully they will improove on the problems in the future. Thanks for reading my review ) i hope i have helped some people with there choice too buy the game. I've heard alot of great things about the story any way so you'll have that too and the online minigames are pretty fun so enjoy that too. Thanks for reading )",Grand Theft Auto V

I tried emailing AND calling them and it's like robots they just say ""there are many reasons a ban can trigger we cannot reverse it"". I've never hacked nor have I attempted to go to multiplayer without removing singleplayer mods. That brings me to another point singleplayer.

GTAO only exists to promote Shark Cards and removing mod support is just another move by T2 to get people to convert their real people money into fantasy money. There are items in game that end up costing either &gt $100 IRL or 20+ hours of farming but at the same time they can't up their security to prevent modders from locking you in your house blowing up your vehicles or removing your guns so you have to re purchase them. Network infrastructure is slow (5 10 minutes to connect to the server) and finicky at best constantly dropping connections and dumping you out into Single Player so you can mash buttons through a cutscene just to sit through another 10 minute load screen. The worst part about this game is that it's fun so you end up putting up with most of the t but if they're going to spit on their players that are modding their single player experience because $700 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN REVENUE FOR A 4 YEAR OLD GAME isn't enough then em,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-30,0,0,620,False,Not Recommended,*UPDATE* Take Two the people who published GTA V have given the team of OpenIV a cease and desist letter. OpenIV was a popular modding tool for GTA. Frankly I have no ing idea why they decided to do this. Most likely they want people to shift away from singeplayer mods to Online just so they can make more money. This decision alone is going to change my review to a negative one but you can read my previous review below.I am rating this game on singleplayer alone not the terrible Online.The singleplayer consists of a engaging story of heists backstabbing or the occasional car chase. All fun in their own way. You play as three characters Michael Franklin and Trevor. Each with their own abilities and backstories though Michael is the most developed character. I don't want to spoil the story so I'll get to the mechanics of the game. From the title you could probably infer that the game is about stealing cars and you're right. The amount of cars and customization is mind boggling. Each car handles differently sounds different etc. If you like to steal cars you'll also want a gun. Maybe two. The types of guns you can purchase or steal can range from knifes all the way to a minigun. Like cars they each sound and handle differently. You can customize guns with finishes and attachments like a supressor. (Yes there is stealth.) With all of these tools at your disposal where do you use them? In San Andreas of course. The map size doesn't seem that big if you drive around. (10 minutes at max from one end to the other.) Though each little nook and cranny is filled with something to keep you exploring. The map is divided into two halves Blaine County and Los Santos. One is an open desert ripe for exploring while the other is a city good for snapping pictures. In this world citizens react believably. They talk with each other go on their daily commute which makes you feel like a gear in the machine. If you manage to kill enough people you will get a wanted system. Whilst keeping in touch with GTA IV's system it also improves. The new stealth system is now implemented meaning you can hide in places where you think cops wont find you. Each star represents a different level of response. 1 2 is easy 3 is medium 4 is hard and 5 is death. At later wanted levels NOOSE will come after you hunting you down with ruthless agression.If you combine all of these factors in to great singeplayer game you get a masterpiece worth buying. If you want GTA V for multiplayer only try to get friends with you and use multiplayer mods. Online is garbage. Buy this game for singeplayer if you like those types of games!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-12,0,0,257,False,Recommended,Right off the bat I am already going to state this game is a 9/10.The game has a huge world set in a modern but with a sterotypical and ironic touch. The storyline allows the older audience understand and be able to relate to the characters problems or views of the world. Each character having their own sidemissions and story arcs that is intertwined throughout till the finale.The story allows 3 switchable characters with thier own story arc A madman who runs a drug company A retired father who has family problems and social aspects coming back to haunt him from the past A gangster who wants to live without problems and move on from ''gangbanging''*Each character offers special abilities such as slowing time easier driving and even a bullet time/rage mode boosing dps.Once the player has finished the story and seen most of the world there is now a multiplayer option they can tackle.While the multiplayer is story map the game is toned down graphically when it comes to lighting or the amount of npcs roaming the streets air or ocean. Things you can do in multiplayer with friends *Start a orginization to sell cars and soon guns/cars with guns.*Bounty hunt other players for cash*Buy tanks or vehicles that have special abilities ie a car with a parachute or the rocket car.*Rob a grocery store for a small amount of cash*Buy guns ranging from pistols to miniguns*Race*Skydive*Buy a yacht and live out your days in a hottub*Buy apartments or housing for yourself*Buy cars or sell npc cars every 48 minutes*Missions from story characters *Team death matchect...The only downside is loading and server issues. The loading time is on average 3 10 minutes depending on your pc and internet. As well as the server. Portforwading for most players has become the norm when it came to this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-25,0,0,81,False,Recommended,"Nominating this game for the ""Game within a game"" award. GTA has always been known for a ridiculous amount of things to do in the game and GTA 5 takes that to the next level along with everything else in the game. I see a lot of poor reviews for online when I did manage to play it with friends especially the heists it was simply what I dreamed off all along when I imagined GTA online. The biggest problems arrise with how hard it is to actually play online. For me it was ridiculous loading times and somewhat poor UI (at least in terms of UI on PC). For others it seems it is banning for no reason which sounds extremely infuriating. I think it is unreasonable to not recommend this game however simply because the singleplayer is amazing and already worth the price tag alone. The somewhat functioning multiplayer is the thick but crumbling icing on the cake.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-28,0,0,672,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V has stood the test of time. Being the most recent of a series of games in the GTA series GTA V has improvements over the past games and includes more than just a story mode. Although the story mode can keep you entertained for months on end trying to collect everything and beat the game with a perfect score if you like playing with others you can try Online. Although online has its problems with cheaters overpriced cars and such it is still amazing to play with friends and meet some on GTA Online. This game is so easy to spend hours on it is no surprise how many copies of this game have sold over the past years. Rockstar is still just as hard at work as they were in 2013 now ready to push out their next game Red Dead Redemption 2. I am excited to see what the future of GTA as a series holds and will certainly buy the next game as soon as it is released.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-11,0,0,89,False,Not Recommended,Think the first problem with this game is the fact that every lobby you join in online will always have atleast one hacker and they usally just kill everyone . My second problem is the grinding for money its a bit tedious at times since rockstar just says HEY BUY THESE SHARK CARDS Third problem is the connectivity problems I load in and it take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to load into online On top of that Some times i can play missions and heist no problem other times i disconnect for no reason,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-09-11,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"I don't have much time into the game right now and i'll keep playing it just cause i need a break from my usual ARPG grind or similiar. The game does have plenty to offer. The graphics are fair. Sometimes the controls feel a tiny bit 'wonky' like.. when i press 'S' to move back no game has ever forced you to do a complete 360. Or flying the plane i feel like the controls are way harder than they need to be. Everything works fine just sometimes it kinda i dunno.. throws ya off. But i guess that's what we get for a console port.What i can't get over though? The WRITING. By god this is the WORST writing i have ever seen on ANYTHING! CSI Miami The Muppets and Teletubbies are all Grammy worthy material compared to this. For example.. .. that's all ya hear during the first couple hours. Two black guys calling each other ' ' over and over and over and over and over again. They brought to an entirely new level of context. I mean really? I know for certain that i'm sheltered up here in white suburban hell but you've got be frickin kidding me! I felt like white people wrote this thinking this was how black people talked 100% of the time. Rockstar.. are you racist? (someone please back me up here)One quest requires you to break into a place to rig a cell phone with a device. Along the way you run into this programmer and for some reason he thinks you're from tech support. The guy has a buch of viruses and literally DOESN'T know how to run a virus scan. A programmer! Can't run a virus scan! The **** kind of world do they think we live in? ""Yeah i'd like to apply for the computer programming job. What? Do i KNOW how to use a computer? YOU'RE ASKING THE IMPOSSIBLE!"" That's the conversation this guy had with the HR department.Later on you play a meth head that was the previous guys partner. He see's a news story and realizes it was his partner from a long time ago. What's the most logical course of action at this immediate point? Slaughter a trailer park full of bikers of course! No connection. No reasoning. Just like ""Hey i bet thats my bud! I'm gunna go kill some bikers!"". Bonus go back later to blow 'em up again with explosives. There's plenty more in there i'm just highlighting a few. It's so bad that i cringe every time there's dialogue. I can give a pass to some questionable graphics or less than fun music or weird mechanics.. but i just can't get past BAD WRITING. In the above examples literally a 9 year old could've written a better story. Heck i'll take NO story over a BAD story. If this were a movie it would easily and i mean EASILY be ranked as THE worst movie in all of film history GLOBALLY! And no i'm not giving a chance on 'oh well it was all tongue in cheek' kind of style. It isn't. It's just poor writing.Thank god i got this on sale. Maybe i'll just play music from here on out cause the story line isn't worth this ashtray full of cigarette butts.",Grand Theft Auto V

It is such a shame that there is so much fun cars planes boats gear and weapons but a casual player can't get to it cause of the rediculous high prices of items. You are either forced to buy sharkcards what is just WAAYYYY to expensive in real life money or you need to grind 10000 hours to get 1 car. It's such a big damn shame.The story is good though the offline part is very amusing but eventualy you will screw around with your friends in online but that just gets to much hassle when you run out of money.I cannot recommend the cashgrab of Rockstar on this one such a shame......",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-12-11,0,0,575,False,Recommended,The game is indeed fun to play but if you're looking to grind on online mode it's just BoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoRiNg since well either you fail to complete objectives and rage or you got to make a little thing to get alone in a public session so no one actually will get on your way (just the AIMBOT NPCs the most Advanced A.I. I've ever seen) so aye it has it's prons and cons it's damn boring alone only grinding but yet that's what you have to do to get stuff at the game but yeah if you got a friend at a high level or just one to level up with you go on play it like story more BLOW UP EVERYTHING. and then be poor again for wasting your money on ammo So aye my ratings are 8/10 since it's more enjoyable with friendos 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Most of the content of GTA Online is meant to be played in a group. The game is still playable in 2017 after so many DLCs and alterations that were added in the past 4 years or so. I still recommend this game to be played if you have friends.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-24,0,0,583,False,Recommended,It's a nice game and most of online is good the only problems are that the cheat detectors are terrible people who are innocent getting banned for no reason while actual modders are god moding booting framing and ruining the game for others.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-24,0,0,210,False,Recommended,"Most of my playtime on GTA V is from single player modding experiences and multiplayer with friends. While the story is great I have already completed it on console and I would 100% recommend playing through the whole thing before starting to play on Online. Modding on single player is very fun and it has close to Skyrim levels of moddability giving it a huge replayability. Online is a... well lets just say it isn't the worst but it definately is not the best. The pay to win factor is probably higher than that of EA. Money is basically needed to be bought to make any progress in Online which I have done and regret. The money I bought was that of the ""DLC"" known as the Criminal Enterprise Pack. I could not say not to buy it anymore it is not worth it at all. My Online experience was honestly not the greatest and that was with access to basic fundage to fuel my rampaging needs. I would say that this game is much more multiplayer focused although the singleplayer story mode is a lot better. I just wish Rockstar had delivered on their promises of DLC for singleplayer as they did with GTA IV paid or not. As a rating for the online side of things for GTA I will give it a measly 4/10 rating. As for story mode that is where this game really shines so I give that a 9/10.",Grand Theft Auto V

The problem I have with it is that Rockstar took their solid gold introduced it to the playerbase and then proceeded to jam it where the sun don't shine by removing the only thing that made GTA popular on PC modding. They just don't seem to understand that one of the things most people buy GTA on PC for explicitly is to play around with mods. Using a trainer online is one thing and is certainly an issue but mods like LSPDFR mods that bring in characters like Hulk or even Harry Potter you know mods that in no way affect the multiplayer aspect of GTA 5 will probably get the boot now. Rockstar makes great games but they just don't get their playerbase it seems.,Grand Theft Auto V

All in all I would rate this game very high. My only bug a boo with this game would be that the community is kind of crappy a lot of the time and the banning system is pretty horrible.

2018-12-26,0,0,339,False,Not Recommended,"I have played this game snice it came out in 2013 it's a great and well developed game with a perfectly exacuted story line to enjoy ( unless u watched it on youtube but let's be real it's a 5yr old game you probaly have seen it ) however I still kinda recommend it but not really and here's why. When GTA V was first realsed yea it was a brand new and enjoyable experience it was a break and something different to do then play Battlefield CoD etc. Once you completed the campaign there was still something to do in singleplayer like side missions random events rob a store customise cars buy businesses to make money or if you liked you could reply the mission to do it again or try and complete it so you have a gold metal rating for that mission. But this ant it this is not where the problem lies it lies in GTA Online GTA Online was the best thing and it was enjoyble for most if not all people who bought or got gifted the game. Sure it didn't have a stable launch for online but Rockstar slowly fixed it's problems here and there but after the major bugs and glitch's where fixed it became a great game for me and I belive for others aswell. This is because the game is simple to understande and how the ranking and mission system worked just corralted with each other perfticaly and made it fun and enjoyble for me and ranking up or looking forward to unlock that new gun was just another leep ahead.So I will not dive into detail about what started ""killing"" the game there are a tone of youtubers and articals that have covered this already. But I reckon it started goning down hill when they realsed ""III Gotten Gains Part 1"".It didn't take a nose dive to becoming a dead game filled with cheaters. But it was aparent to many and myself that Rockstar games had started making there DLC's a cash grab the defintion of cash grab ""When movie studios produce unnecessary and often poor quality sequels in order to obtain more money."" Originally posted by author Dat H Man posted on urban dictionary. I mean just look up video's of this ""Cash Grab"" on youtube. Also yes I know it says ""Movie Studios"" but the same principles can be applied aswell but after the said DLC's after that well some where bloody great but some are just eh and a clear MONEY GRAB.So imma just say this even thoe I enjoyed the god damn game and wish this stuiped didn't and never happened it is what it is the game is so hard to start out nowdays that they have a pack called the ""Criminal Enterprise Pack"" just to help u get into the just of thing but the pack itself doesn't even give u enough too keep u going. So I don't recommond this game unless you really want it then buy it otherwise I would'nt.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-02,0,0,1203,False,Not Recommended,"I usually dont write any reviews and if I do I stick to positive ones however in this case no matter how painful it is I have to break a habit.Despite all the things that could make this game fantastic the following three factors steal all fun from it leaving only bad memories. A legion of modders on the loose Powerless neglecting and indifferent ""support"" from Rockstar and really I mean REALLY long loading times.In this order.While the game has breathtaking graphics fun game mechanics good humour and always something to do for endgame it has zero control over cheaters/modders due to its P2P nature.You are defenseless against cheating people with mod menus. With a single keystroke they can explode you stuck bulky or flaming items permanently on you which persist until you restart game put persistent objects in the game world (like cages around you) take control of your vehicle become invisible and/or invulnerable teleport you or themselves around the map or miles above the air use the new orbital cannon and destroy anything at will kill you even in passive mode by becoming invulnerable getting a 5 star police wanted level and teleporting on you constantly so when NPCs shooting them they will hit you instead.Just to name a few but the list goes on and expands every passing day.Why not reporting modders? Trust me I did. A lot of them. Heck I even reported when I got modded money Avoiding to spend it for months having trouble to keep track of the amount of cash I can safely use.In the rare occurences Rockstar answered at all it was always generic ""please be patient"" and ""we are actively doing this and that"" or ""you can report modders on x forums"" with no actual action or effect seemed to follow.In fact modders are so numerous that when publisher Take Two Interactive started a ""cease and desist"" order against the creator of OpenIV a long standing modding tool for Grand Theft Auto 5 it's users started to give so many negative reviews on steam that Rockstar asked them to back off.They stated Rockstar Games believes in reasonable fan creativity and in particular wants creators to showcase their passion for our games which would be fair enough if they were able to monitor or control if this mods effect single player mode (which is ok) or online (which interferes other player's fun). But they aren't.There is an option to play online in invite only sessions (this would solve all the problems with modders) but Rockstar disabled the best gameplay options in this mode. There were petitions in the past but nothing seemed to change.You could say ok. Let's just leave the problematic session and find another. I did countless times. Nowdays that's almost impossible. 95% of the sessions has at least 1 modder or if hasn't it will in about 20 30 mins.And with the brutal (sometimes 5 10 mins!) loading times just to get another session thats propably just as bad as the previous one it's not a temtpting option either.There would be a solution (enable all gameplay mechanics in invite only sessions) but as I see now Rockstar neglects its clean playerbase. I dont know maybe we are in minority now (?) The only way left for me to protest is a negative review and staying away from their titles as long as they wont change their politics. Until then i think the next title would be less misleading GMA 6 (Grand Modder Auto 6)",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-10,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Pretty epic single player experience especially with mods. Would completely recommend this game especially at its current price of $30. My views on Online are currently mixed as much as I want to enjoy it I simply just can't. It's so disappointing to see what Rockstar has implented into this game. The amount of micro transactions and online DLC in Online is nothing short of ridiculous. The community is also pretty stinky. To avoid the community I would advise you find a couple of friends and play in a private session. The heists in Online are incredibly engaging when you have friends to play with. Other than the interaction of friends there really are no pros of Online. Social Club is also very stinky. Hopefully RDR2 won't have the same problems but it probably will.,Grand Theft Auto V

Wish they would allow to transfer from ps3/xbox360 to pc still. The only downside to this game if you're playing online it takes some time to get decent money which forces some to think about buying the sark cards which is in my opinion insane.,Grand Theft Auto V
2019-01-03,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,I wish I could leave two seperate reviews for GTAV and GTAO. Lets start with GTAV. The story is decent and offers a lot of replayability. I personally have played it twice on PS4 and am working towards it on PC. There is no singleplayer DLC which is a huge bummer but the base game is still very fun. Now onto GTAO. I have almost 500 hours on my PS4 copy and have most everything. I stopped playing after the Doomsday Heist update came out. I have the best vehicles in the game and had a fun time playing with friends. I recently picked up the PC copy to play with friends and quickly found out how difficult it is to start a new character. They stopped character transfers for stupid reasons so I had to make a brand new save. I did double money modes and got up to a million dollars. I bought the cheapest cocaine warehouse and made a ltitle bit of money. One of my friends started at the same time and was a little bit behind me. We realized that in the ed up state that the game is in it was impossible to gain money as a new player without GTAO becoming a full time job. We both picked up $10 mod menus and had more fun in one day than in all the time we'd had GTA. I was finally able to afford the best of the best and I could afford to mess around with friends and have fun instead of grinding all the time. I would only reccommend this game if you have an extra $10 to rent a mod menu for a month. Free mod menus do work but they will get you banned. Just drop $10 on a mod menu and you'll have the time of your life. The issue with this is they make it so difficult to make money that your only option is to cheat. I personally don't grief randoms with the mod menu(only friends). Don't buy this game and support Rockstar because all you're doing is giving them a reward for continuing to stand behind a broken mess of a game. Only buy to meme and mess around with friends. Any attempts to play the game the way it was meant to be played will result in you getting frusturated.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-10,0,0,229,False,Recommended,Awesome game full of fun and action! But there is one mayor issue (this only happens in GTA Online)You can meet some very toxic people on the game. They just shoot you when they see you. And the worst they don't have a reason to do so. As an example Around 6 hours before I've wrote this comment I was in my garage (there are garages all across the map where you can store your vehicles) and I was spending some money on searching for a new offroad based vehicle. When I exited my garage and wanted to head to Los Santos customs (you can modify/upgrade your vehicles there) there was a guy infront of my garage. Before I realised what he wants to do he pulled out a rifle and shot me. I respawned and headed back to get into my vehicle. But guess what? he was sitting there jsut waiting to shoot me again when I pop up. After another 3 attempts to get back to my vehicle I just left the game and went into another lobby. You will experience this kind of scenario all across GTA Online and it will be hard to get rid of it. Mostly this are very young kids who think that this game is shooting only. I also think that there should be something to report this kind of toxic behavior (if there is any kind how to report it please write it in the comments below as I didn't find any way how to do so) If you ever meet any player like this just leave and search for another lobby as I did.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-28,0,0,935,False,Not Recommended,Edit Too many modders. It was bearable at one point to deal with them but now there are way too many. Teleporting everywhere and giving me an disconnection error if I don't treat them like king and queen. Too many military vehicles that result in GTA becoming cluttered with cancer and a fair few of the worst ones can be called back in almost immediately. Rockstar's response? None. xdA semi long pros and cons list from a player who has spent 1 200hrs on PS4 and over 420+hrs on PC who hasn't been banned/hasn't had their characters wiped. If I get banned I have my character on PS4 to play with. I don't mind that.Pros Massive fun to be had alone or with friends. PvP is really fun in freeroam or in deathmatches when there's no modders. A lot of the community are grinders and don't mind lending a hand when it comes to helping others making money. Crews and bikie gangs are a fun way to experience Online if you're into that sort of thing. Plenty of R*/community made deathmatches and races to keep you entertained. More than enough ways to make money in this game to get the things you want. DLC to keep the game fresh and alive. The world itself is nice to explore and mess around with. With friends or without. Vehicle handling is pretty nice. I consider it better than GTA IV's which some claim to be better than V's. Rockstar Editor is avaliable to those who want to make a mini movie for their 20 subscriber YouTube channel.Neutral Money. Once you obtain a bunker and a bikie drug business money is easy to get from there but it takes a bit of time to get those. You go to your bunker/business pay for supplies and wait for them to be used up by playing the game then once it's all done you sell it. Heists missions new adversary modes etc are also quick ways to obtain money. Grinding isn't all that hard nor will you have a terrible experience with it but it takes a bit of time getting the things you want. Getting targeted by griefers makes it fun as well. Rockstar's Support. I have never been banned so I cannot relate to any of the people who may have been falsely banned for nothing. In my experience I have never had an issue with R*s support when I submit a ticket. They get the job done for me. Loading Times. An average of 5+ minutes to load in from a 7200RPM 1TB WD HDD. After that loading screens are much shorter and not frequent. Unless you want to join a deathmatch through the Quick Play app on your phone. That will range from finding a deathmatch in 10 seconds or waiting 6 minutes to join a deathmatch that turns out to be a parkour map.Cons The community. Many are paranoid of modders and it makes PvP annoying since they'll accuse you of hacking report you and leave. Unbalanced. Rockstar did a great job with the Ruiner 2000 and then they gave up soon after that. Deluxo's missiles are OP the Oppressor (AKA Broomstick) is annoying and can be called to your location instantly after it gets blown up. Khanjali tank and MKII Oppressor is the go to noob vehicle for when you get dominated. The orbital cannon is perfect for people who care about 1 0s. It used to be Hydras and Lazers that were the issue but not anymore. Now it's all this P2P. Although you can play with mates that are on the other side of the world with 400 ping with no issue good luck if you anger some Chinese men and they grab your IP. Anticheat. What anticheat? Sometimes it works. Summary..I love this game but it can be pretty terrible to play. Despite that though there is a massive amount of fun to be had in this game and I do not regret the large amount of hours I've spent on this game. I'm not worried about getting falsely banned but we'll see what happens.,Grand Theft Auto V

In 2015 the PC version of the screen is still amazing although not top level screen but also a super high level HD level. The overall tone of the picture is very eye catching and looks very comfortable. The models and models are in place and character modeling is good but facial modeling is not good enough. R has always suffered from bad vegetation. In the 5th generation herbaceous plants have made great progress but woody plants can still feel a strong sense of texture overlap at a glance which is very contrary to HD environment. The surface of the water is very good the touch of the water is also very good there are many kinds of surface effects of the game such as sea water River water Lake water the depth of the water is different deep water and shallow water have different feelings unlike other games all the water is almost a literary. Generally speaking the portrayal of the water body is very good rain scenery night scenery details are very good but the rendering is not strong enough rain scenery and night scenery look very real pavement water effect and rain patting do well but compared with other games the lack of enhanced rendering aesthetic feeling.lasting appealIn fact the GTA5 single player mode is not as perfect as it imagined. Because it removes many excellent settings and details. For example body size system nurturing system gang system younger brother function bodyguard function martial arts schools and gyms girlfriend system fun games (game machines and billiard halls etc.). Some details were deleted such as the mandatory non stalling of getting off the car in GTA4 (not stalling when jumping in GTA5) the setting of passers by taking umbrellas and so on while riding motorcycles the clothes of this generation can not shake with the wind but the evil city of 12 years ago portrayed this detail vividly. In particular access to buildings has been reduced. But why is it an excellent 3A masterpiece? Although it deleted many classic settings it added more interesting elements. If the single player is not playing well enough then the OL mode will refresh you. The map area is 7.2 times the size of GTA SA. The rich and colorful online tasks and game modes keep the GTA series playing well in the sand box game. Interaction with players NPCs and officials gives you a feeling of traveling through the sandbox world. I will not disclose anything specific. Only after playing. In fact GTA5 will be more powerful if you don't delete the classic settings in VC SA 4.U.S.,Grand Theft Auto V

But Online really needs to be fixedIt would be easy to downvote this because its a tripple A company and it deserves to be critisised for having the funds necassary. But The money issue online is extremely apparent as there seems to only be two ways to play the gameEither GrindOr ModAnd grinding would be more acceptable to accept if modding wassnt so easy and common Which kind of ruins the purpose of a grind system to work in GTA. If anyone has played GTA online from release you would understand that the main focus wasnt to try and stack as much money as possible (even though people did through glitches) but was more focused on customisation and doing events. Now gta has turned into get as much money before the next update so you can use the next OP item as much as possible Which is kind of depressing knowing there was a lack of these items during early versions of the gameIt sort of leaves the question of if GTA online can really be fixed as its already broken itself already...BTW Single player needs an actual content update rather then modding having to remedy this issue Thanks A nobody,Grand Theft Auto V

The only way you can actually have fun is to find a modder who gives out money or mod your own game in online.

I'd even go as far as to say that i was helping more people while hacking. Rockstar just sucks and is money hungry as . So i wouldnt recommend this unless you wanna spend hundreds of hours driving back and forth from building to building getting killed by other hackers and rich kids with their mom's credit card.Note Its also pretty dumb you cant even appeal after getting bannedEdit User Yotter is a hacker he spawns money I recommend banning him if you read this.,Grand Theft Auto V

It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.

There are several vehicles and items this game has that are somewhat overpowered or have very little to no use but the Opressor MK2 stands alone in the category of ridiculous features. It needs to be nerfed or removed. It damages the community and the already questionable combat balance of the game tremendously to the point where there is literally a ing PETITION asking rockstar to nerf it. A PETITION. I would not suggest this game to anyone both in protest of the opressor mk2 and because rockstar believes in adding more content and not fixing broken and unbalanced content.

2015-12-28,1,1,146,False,Recommended,First of all GTA 5 is a great game and doesn't require very good system. Although some said that there are many hackers on GTA online I don't seem to find alot of them although there are still some out there. However some hackers may be good and spawn weapons and vehicles to play with you but some just on godmode and shoots rockets everywhere. Anyways GTA 5 is a fun game for you and your friends and of course even online. However I found out that the service is not very great in fact it is really bad so if you buy the game you are taking on a great risk as if your game doesn't work you will have to refund it OR go online to search for solutions to solve the problem yourself as rockstar wont give a sh*t about you.

2018-11-22,0,0,1385,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online is a griefer's paradise and was designed that way to manipulate players into buying Shark Cards for in game money. Grinding money legitimately is slow and the game almost always announces what you are doing to the whole session so that griefers can target you.Full of bugs that are never fixed. New GTA Online content is almost never patched or tuned post release. Because of this new DLC consistently makes old DLC obsolete. Rockstar is running out of ideas for new content so to lure people to buy Shark Cards new DLC mostly revolves around overpowered weaponized vehicles that turn GTA Online into a war zone. There is even an orbital cannon that allows players to kill you with just a click on the map that is mostly only used by modders.There is no functional anti cheat in this game as sessions are hosted by players instead of dedicated servers. Rarely will you encounter a populated session without modders.Once you play this game for long enough you'll realize that Rockstar has no interest in improving the player experience only in pumping out expensive overpowered Shark Card magnets for their cash cow.,Grand Theft Auto V

What is very flawed however is the anticheat as I'm sure you've seen in countless other reviews. If there is a modder leave if they cash drop you banned and reset. If you complete 'too many' VIP Missions in a row banned and reset. Rock* then blame you and don't reverse anything If they want to keep players they really need to stop banning innocent ones and start actually banning the cheaters. Again just to brush over singleplayer it really is great it has a good storyline likeable characters and the character switching gives it something new. I've rated positive almost solely from singleplayer online was fun until everything required insane amounts of grinding and of course me getting banned for a month and being reset.

2018-03-01,0,0,518,False,Not Recommended,Fun if you have friends. The reason that this is a thumbs down review is that the creators made it impossible to make substantial money so that you would cave in and buy shark cards. The grinding is only fun if you enjoy basically shipping things around and being extremely boring. Annoyingly the missions only make you good money the first time you play them and the doomsday heists only make money for anybody but the host. They keep adding more and more extremely expensive things to force you to either suck it up and grind for days and days or just cave in and buy DLC money.TL DR online is only fun for a bit and only with friends. Grinding is awful and the game is built so that you must get mony through microtransactions if you want quick cash,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-28,0,0,39,False,Recommended,This game is all around great there's a lot of content and things to experience and the story is pretty good. But one thing that holds this game back a lot is the amount of boring filler missions. Some of them are important to the story but most a lot of them are just a chore for anyone looking to get 100%. For instance the construction mission with Trevor or the tow truck missions with Franklin are both super boring. It is kind of nitpicky but it does tarnish the image of a very very good game. 9/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

The map is huge and extremely detailed making it always fun to explore and even after 350 hours I still discover new things. The general atmosphere of the game is very nice and charming. The game looks very good if you have the ability to put the graphics settings high enough! There is a lot but I mean a lot of things to do once you are done with the story and on the Online mode. Activities missions businesses goofing around ... Plus the Rockstar team adds frequent DLCs that are free. There are plenty of easter eggs and interesting places/things to discover! There is a huge variety of weapons and vehicles to choose from to have fun and do the missions when Online.This is overall a very good and fun game that will probably keep you busy for at least a good hundred hours!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-13,0,0,71,False,Recommended,Fun to play. Best since GTA VCGeneral The newest in the GTA franchise made some alterations to mix it up a bit and it has worked out well. Nice campaign/story plenty to do after and a at least ok multiplayer. Single Player For the first time GTA focusses around 3 characters instead of 1. In my opinion Micheal has been the most interesting of the three characters franklin an overal ok one (I personally cant relate to this character) and Trevor has been a sometimes funny WTF character (but a perfect match for the way anyone would play GTA).The story in general is good yet some missions and several side quests are mildly irritating (ffs tonya how about you go tow someone off instead). Also it is great you are able to choose your own ending. Still I must say I hoped for a bit more of CJ or othe GTA SA references.Multiplayer Overal OK lots of fun to play game modes both competitive and co op yet feels boring and repetitive after a while.Secret wish Rockstar please create a new GTA in the GTA1/GTA L/GTA2 style for the pc.PS Ive played this game on both the PC and xbox 360 almost have 100% on the second.

It has solid gameplay with a large amount of things to do throughout the game both online and off. The gunplay was a bit weird going into it but after moving away from GTA IV it was much easier and I prefer it now. The online itself is a great mix of solo aspects that you can have fun with by yourself and ridiculously fun things to do with a group of friends. My one major negative is the heists in the game I wish there was a way to do them without all four people though I understand that everyone has a role and must be accounted for. Just wishing for things that can't happen. All in all great game. Would recommend to anyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

However the singeplayer is really fun plus the modding in this game is great specifically fiveM which is 200 times better than normal online. So if you plan to play online don t waste your time just go find a good server on FiveM. FiveM has a great community and no modders and griefers to ruin everything. Another great mod is LSPDFR which is singeplayer but fun nonetheless. I would encourage people to finish the campaign and stay away from online and go onto fiveM. For those who negatively reviewed the game just go ing play mods like fivem or LSPDFR which are way better anyways. And you can just do random in story mode even after your done so that s ing fun too. 10/10 don t listen to dumbass negative reviewers,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,0,0,7,False,Recommended,I got this last year and I might get the PC of this but I ll wait to see how it works on that. Where GTA 4 was about the American Dream GTA 5 is about this economy thing. in GTA 5 you get to play not one but three characters over the course of the main story Franklin Michael and Trevor.Each one as a special ability as Franklin can slow down time while driving. Michael can slow down time on foot while Trevor can go into this rage mode and be invincible. Over the game you ll have these big heist plans and people to help you out. You need to pick some decent people and not the bare minimum since they ll get killed easely.There s also a bunch of other activities like tennis golf and other things like the stock market. As well as a bunch of collectables all over the big wide map of Los Sanotos and Blaine County. There s also this big decision at the end of the game and three endings. Two of them kinda leave a bad taste in your mouth and mess up the tone.GTA Online I only played once but it was pretty amazing and I was real nervous worried and a little excited. Since I never played online games and even my parents thought it wouldn t be a good idea. Thought there would be people razing me and mocking me when I lose too much.There s also a setting on GTA Online if it gets to hectic where you can just play with your friends. Might have to try that out next time if I ever play it again. This game is a classic in every sense of the word and should be in your library.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-12-27,0,0,648,False,Recommended,If this game was VAC bannable this game would possibly be GOTY material for me. Modders are what is ruining the game. Modders has not only made you get blown up randomly in most lobbies but it has also ruined the economy. I played since release and when I first got my 1mil $ car I was proud driving around in it. Now a days if you do not have a 10$ yacht you're an outsider. Sad to see the direction of the game however I'm still recommending it. You can avoid modders mostly. If you do this and don't mod yourself I do reckon you can get a good few hours of fun out of it.,Grand Theft Auto V

To the point where i was only pushing myself to finish the game to see how it ends. Cops spawning infront of you automatically knowing where you are making escaping them a slog especially if a mission requires it. How is it that my super car that was outfitted to the max is unable to outrun police cars? how can enemies automatically lock onto me before i even pop a shot off? whats the point of giving experience to heist members if the expensive ones don't need it and the rookies die every time you hire them?Save your money buy yourself a Coke or some nice lunch and skip out on GTA V you aren't missing anything or atleast anything fun,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,232,False,Not Recommended,Was promised singleplayer DLC content it never came. Loading time for Online is huge sometimes it's not even joining. In order to buy things you either have no life and only play GTA V or you give them more money to buy Shark Cards. The singleplayer story was ok ish but not as good as the other GTAs. You can't play singleplayer without internet connection (this makes no sense). In Online after you play like every mission available and then you start do some other things it gets repetitive and boring after a while nothing to do. Also you can no longer mod the singleplayer game because they want more money from Online. After Rockstar has been very supportive of the modding community Take Two is screwing with everyone.,Grand Theft Auto V

To go with that storyline we cant have a GTA Game without Online can we? GTA V Online is 10 times better then GTA IV Online.

2017-06-27,0,0,406,False,Not Recommended,"I was pondering some random aspects of life and figured it would be a good time to sit down and give off what i think of this game. I preordered GTA back on the 360. ive had it sence the start. and i have to say... it isnt worth it. baseically the entire thing is and always was a microtransaction farming scheme. (the singleplayer is baseically the best part and is worth $15 30) the entire multiplayer setup started out buggy and with inflated over the top prices. but it was managable. however after the initial updates that made it harder to actually make money in online the entire development has been a circle of hyping an update releasing said update that turns out to be a reskin of the previous updates and expansions but now with more over priced t expect you to buy the ingame currency so that you can buy a fake car for one of you fake characters or say... a fake house for a fake character... you can have multiple characters but the only shared part is your total money pool... they heists are and always were garbage. the contact missions pay like the multiplayer races deathmatches etc are ok but usually pay like its just a michro transaction farm.after making me completely reinstall the game because i used open IV to CHANGE MY LOADING SCREENS AND MUSIC... all i used it for... im kinda irritated. meanwhile hackers seem free to cause multiplayer lag by spawning hundreds of jumbojets. and s never leave you alone... why? why would hackers giving free money online be a problem why would some of my good friends in this game have their characters reset for trying to doupe cars? OHO THATS RIGHT ONLINE IS ROCKSTAR TRYING TO PUSH SHARK CARDS ludcris inflation and overpricing for simple things (back on the 360 limited time overpriced cars for ""a limited time"") cars that suck the release of ""gun running"" which is just a combo of CEO and Biker... BUT MORE EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING... im a little with them right now.meanwhile because a hacker gave me about 2mil which allowed me to spend it all on biker stuff... a long time ago... i now get to lose 4mil in online currency. then smuggler stuff comes out. and its more of the same nonsense with very little new... just pressuring everyone to buy more shark cards so they can kill themselves in online.Aug 2018 edit i saw a rockstar sale... and saw the ""online premium edition""... you mean to say that after i spend how many hours grinding spent a bit on gay shark cards.. etc. now anyone can just spend extra money and get access to the i spend MILLIONS OF INGAME DOLLARS ON... they say this game is pay to win... and its true.christmas comes sale is on...

Then I got bored with it and remembered that back when I had GTA IV there were mods for single player most notably the ability to change your role in the game and play as a police officer with really cool realistic looking custom police cars and uniforms! And so the game was revived for me once again. Now TakeTwo/Rockstar are taking that away. I regret spending the money on this game now and I will NEVER give another single penny to TakeTwo unless they reverse this immediately!If you were thinking of getting this game (whether or not you plan to mod single player) don't do it. Don't give these greedy morons anymore money as they don't deserve it.

2018-10-02,0,0,121,False,Not Recommended,You know I love Grand Theft Auto thing is I found weapon selection clunky and more complicated than it had to be... Why not buy all the guns and just equip the ones you want to use?The aiming is difficult but managable though found mouse and keyboard generally has better aim that using a controller since the controller if you didn't set to manual aiming will attempt to aim at civi's over other players that are trying to kill you.Game is overrun with hack users I mean I had six cars dropped on me from the sky... Que X Files Music...They have added quite a bit of content cars weapons clothing. However let me remind you this is when not playing single player a online game and unless you have a group of friends to play with on an every day basis you will be stuck with random players who do not know what they are doing or are happy with screwing you up for their own amusement.In game cash isn't easy to get you will be grinding away for hours to even days to buy that vehicle you always wanted or you can like Rockstar is hoping you will get frustrated and whip out that credit card and buy cash from the in game shop using your hard earned real life cash.Servers constantly crash either by internal server errors or DDOS attacks cause the local cheater is mad about something or another.I guess if you want to play this game get prepared for a love/hate relationship cause this game has one of the worst toxic communities I have come by in a long time... the 2nd worst I found was on Minecraft on a server called 2b2t my third most toxic would be APB Reloaded which I would recommend over GTAV just because combat isn't so clunky so long as you have a really good computer that can push past the poor optimization that game has to offer.I want to recommend this game but I am sorry I cannot recommend this game at this time.,Grand Theft Auto V

Why? When you see a modder/cheater you need to find new session because it will suck if you stay on it and if he gives you any money you need to tell Rockstar about it so they take it away from you and you won't get banned blah blah. Also they spawn random stuff on map and put you in cages and ... People constantly leaving jobs in some cases you end up 5vs1 which is ... they should make a punishment system for a better ONLINE gameplay such as not being able to join jobs for 1 2 hours REAL TIME or SOMETHING. When someone gets DC or leaves a job there will be a chance of game ERROR Freeze Crash and then you need to Alt + F4 and wait again that long loading screen even on SSD. Sometimes gets buggy.

Where it should have been E throughout. The game is a faking mess from beginning to end.Obviously when they made this game they didn't have a clue how to map keys but that's no excuse to leave it in such a sorry state.Also the game try's to do things that the poor old engine isn't capable of.

2017-06-14,1,1,935,False,Recommended,"This game has one of the most fun single player campaigns I have ever played. The story the characters the missions and the world are fantastic. The handling and damage for the vehicles is terrible but thank god for mods. Mods add unlimited replayability as you can see by the sad amount of hours I have devoted to this game. LSPDFR alone is hours and hours of enjoyment. The Online portion is okay in my opinion it gets boring after a while with everything being locked behind levels and enormous price tags plus there is an infinite amount of hackers and just all around d*uchebags. My main issue with Online though is that it is the biggest hinderance in the game's potential. Thanks to ""free"" DLCs for Online players began buying shark cards for in game cash so they could afford the ridiculously priced content. This led to a huge influx of wealth for Rockstar and their greedy publisher Take Two. Because of how well Online was doing all the focus was put there and taken away from single player. Because of this GTA V has zero single player DLCs which is such a shame. The Ballad of Gay Tony for GTA IV was actually better than the base game and became my preferred choice. I hate to think about the amazing ideas they had for GTA V that we will never get to see. Maybe they thought about origin stories for each of the characters. Playing each individually to see how they started. Maybe the three characters go to North Korea to rescue Dennis Rodman from the gentle caress of Kim Jong Un while simultaneously preventing a rocket launch... we'll never know. GTA Online being the cash cow it is Take Two would die before letting anyone experience their content without either grinding for hours on end or paying for it out of pocket. That means there are no dedicated servers like in GTA IV where you can play with all the fun mods with all your friends. They also went as far as blocking the content from single player requiring mods to unlock everything. THEN they went even further and tried to ban modding by going after Open IV the primary and essential tool for all modding. This act led to my initial negative review but since then Rockstar delegated a compromise between T2 and the Open IV and it looks like Open IV is back in business. Good on you Rockstar but as for the lack of single player that's a bad Rockstar BAD! Because I am such a big fan of theirs I like to think Rockstar did not have a choice in the matter that evil greedy T2 forced them to focus on GTA Online. If that's not the case then you should be ashamed of yourselves. inb4 they release GTA VI Online ONLY.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,1,1,195,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid 2013 and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014 before finally being released on the PC in April 2015. The game quite rightly is a record setter selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists who each have their own story and plot to go with them somehow all three of these characters s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other s story. The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics. I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane but the flying parts of the game are few and far between. The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire s collection right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. The game has gorgeous graphics no they aren t photo realistic but that s because the game s style isn t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming it just puts the console s version to shame when you compare the two. My rig which is a monster couldn t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time but GTA V does none of that each of the textures are all high res animation is absolutely perfect and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. As with all GTA games you are going to get a blockbuster style story line this is one of the best if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character s story are so well written and perfectly intertwining with each other. The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete they all have some sort of story behind them for each character which are all well worth your time in completing. The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too there is never a moment where there is just silence whether it is people in the street chatting to each other or someone getting road rage there is always something going on. Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. The game isn t exactly hard there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!) but I don t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made it is bigger than GTA IV GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete I still have plenty of heists extra missions stunts races so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once I cannot be 100% sure on this but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. Technically GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible but they really knocked it out of the park here. The abundance of graphical options audio options and options in general really make this a proper PC game. The game can be played on a gamepad or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad but the game is so well optimized for the PC the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me it just plays so fluidly. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay exquisite story line and huge open world for you to explore it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,0,0,85,False,Recommended,What a game!!! When's the next one out?? The multiplayer is extremely fun but I haven't really had time to rank up. Too many games not enough time!!What I like is the story gameplay graphics and a nice big open World. What I dislike is that you need a big GPU to run it with some decent graphics but then I suppose a lot of games are like that these days. As far as ports go this is a great one. Very solid.

2015-12-27,0,0,366,False,Recommended,This game has given me countless hours of fun and criminal conquest that no other game to date has fulfilled. The story mode is superb with the in depth character development and emotional connections formed with the characters as you progress through the campaign. GTA Online is incredible offering any number of activities from pulling million dollar heists playing a game of darts to simply relaxing on a yacht with friends. On tat note definitely gather some friends to play with for the optimum online experience. This is definitely one of my favorite games to date.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-21,0,0,124,False,Recommended,This game garnered enough reputation from across the internet by being an outstanding yet questionable at that. It brought up new things that made the game itself a luxury and each experience was worth taking note of. Though when I said questionable however I really meant it really is. Every aspect from GTA at this point were brought up here but like it's predecessors some of the common ways we deal through the game are lost entirely which isn't a bad thing depending on how you see it. Literally this game is well known for pushing things beyond of what people wanted to make whether it'd be a singleplayer mayhem full of mods clustering about or a multiplayer experience that's between a blender and a swimming pool.If you're going to look for my opinion about multiplayer look elsewhere. I barely have touched the darn gamemode itself as I always have enjoyed many past GTA titles alone. Although I'd be bias if this was the good old GTA San Andreas which I used SAMP to play online which it isn't. I have to say for the few hours I experienced GTA Online is the constant punishment that I'd get for not going beyond from where I start and it's completely exposed with an enormous amount of ridiculous proportions. For the meat of the game being the singleplayer my experience is a mixed bag. Now what about I said earlier about the game being amazing? Well it is that is if you are a mindless duck. Stories on these types of games aren't usually the strongest that many developers would want to take and this game tries hard to be really damn good about the storytelling portion. While I admit the characters in this story is damn amazing especially Trevor Michael and Franklin the more I replayed throughout the missions it felt like it was forced out. The story wanted to be as much favorable and interesting to the players but man does this feel like a bad kicker. I would say all the plot holes were plugged immediately with that surprising comeback and eventual endings the game have it doesn't do a whole alot to convince me that it's a really good story for the game. If you're confused about this I'm sorry I would make it simplier to say that the game's story is a good rice meal but it smells. I just don't find that interesting that much but I would honestly take note of some of the best scenes in the story at least.The gameplay is the heart of this damn game and I loved it. I damn sure do loved the gameplay while I try to choke myself in rgards to my own opinions about the story. From driving cars to shooting people for the most absolute and reasons ever are the key reasons why I kept hogging my hours on this game. The FPS mode is a winner here makes me feel like it's more than just a game but a different world of its own and goddamn would it be great to have a decent VR support to make it livable cause I would really take it. But of course as we expand to this this game got tons of mods and they're... They're pretty amazing! But how you put them in is not.See this is where I hate about the lack of the developers' respect is that anytime you wanted to twist the game out of it's fun and add some things that would extend or explode the lifetime the game has. I love putting mods on games that are definitely damn great to have but setting them up here on GTAV is such a pain in the neck. I wanted to make sure everything is placed right and man I wished there was an easier way to put the mods in like a workshop feature that could spare us alot of time. But no we have to make do with what we have I guess and I appreciate that they do make great work of this but it still sucks to spend minutes of trying to put the things on the right places. It's like picking a specific type of condom for your to put on to make sure your girlfriend doesn't get too about the risks.The technical side of this game is somewhere I'd say is just okay in my opinion. Now you might say this game is optimized and yeah it is it's really well optimized. But boy does it take a while for things to generate and you're gonna need a really good hardware to run this damn game. If you're thinking about playing it with less than four physical cores god forgive that you have to stop and actually get a CPU with four physical cores. Everything begins to go crazy when you play it with only two cores and hyperthreaded ones doesn't solve your issues with this. Everything just stutters to hell and it's not that fun. So yeah get a CPU with four cores got it? Also a decent GPU and at least 8GB of RAM should nail it.Now to wrap things up should you buy this game? Who wouldn't? You should too!. But what's with the clouds of negativity around though? That's just me talking but it's also worth noting that like many other great triple a games out there GTA V nails the cake for a great experience but you need to take watch of the developers though. Not the game the developers. The DEVELOPERS.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-17,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Well it's GTA V. To be honest I've owned this game while I had a PS4 but after trying to play it I kind of disliked the idea of switching between various characters. I've always likes the idea of playing a solo character and bounding to his story.When I moved back to PC I bought the game on a Steam Sale it just stayed there for about 6 months. Recently I've decided to give it another try and what can I say? Seems that I delayed a lot of fun. If as me you are used to play games with a solo character and be switching within 3 charaters seems bad just give it a try. As the plot goes deeper the stories of the three main charecters gets more and more connected. Also it's GTA this means a lot of crazy fun.I haven't played the online version of it.

2018-11-13,0,0,549,False,Not Recommended,Story Mode is incredible fell in love with it for hours until I ve beaten this great game. However my reason for this negative review is pretty obvious as it s related to Online Mode. Online Mode is very creative and has a great story to it with their interesting heists but the cons with this game I m about to say should let buyers not play Online Mode.Cons Massively toxic playerbase/community. This is mainly involving K/D warriors and Griefers who get on only to cause havoc and pain to Grinders and even your friends. Next one is Modders/hackers these guys are the worst as they ruin anyone s gameplay with various things such as freezing trapping sends rockets at anyone and setting everyone on fire until everyone leaves. The worst part is receiving unwanted goods from them which I will explain later down below.The game and even the shark cards are priced so ludicrously high that s not even worth looking into getting one. Now these are designed so that Rock* farms money from raging players who get griefed so that they buy money to try and pay those bad players back. Nice one Rock* for being so low.Next one is their support they WILL not talk to you or anyone once when you create a thread for them you will receive an reply from a bot thus completely ignoring you the same also goes for Live Chat you receive automated responses based on what you say which is very low. So if a player wants to report a bug/player or appeal their bans then you re out of luck buddy.The Ban Bot for GTA Online got updated and now bans players 30 days after they ve touched illegal items such as modded money. The ban length is 30 days + character reset which is very bad. So if you re a modder you got 30 days of tormenting players until you end up getting banned along with all of the other players who get unjustly banned and you got two characters so even if you permanently lose one of them they will continue on their second account then repeat the process which is why this game is turning into a ghost lobby. I even got evidence that this has happened to me and a few mates of mine. Grinded 400 hours of my time to get toys to have some fun with my mates only to get banned by the Ban Bot from receiving unwanted money from a modder I reported but got ignored.Buy it for Story Mode if you re into that but avoid their Online mode as it s invested with issues that it isn t even fun to play there anymore.Thanks for reading my long review on this mess of a game and hope anyone who reads this to avoid Online Mode. (I m going to expect a lot of negative feedback after posting this review and am going to receive a perma ban as I heard that they perma ban players who gives negative reviews on this game because Rock* is very immature).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-28,0,0,135,False,Recommended,I first bought this game on the ps3. I waited a long time for this game and wasn't disapointed with my experience on the ps3. Then I got it on the ps4. Again I was greatly pleased the already amazing story line was only enhaced by better graphics more populated streets more emersives features such as the long awaited first person mode.About a year ago when I build my first trully gaming pc I fell I love with so many things that I regreted ever leaving the beloved pc for the console. I still use my console but mostly for sports and couch gaming with friend But the pc is so emersive and the community much more friendly and stimulating.After buying two installments of the same game I told myself it would be stupid to waste my money on an third one. Was I so wrong! finally breaking under the pressure I did it I bought a third version of the same game. Waited a few long hours to download it boot it up perfected the settings and started a new story.I was totally blown away. The experience was amazing. The same game yes but more in every way. The upgraded from ps3 to ps4 was great but this was on an other level. The responsiveness of mouse and key board felt amazing. The first mission in north yankton was the eye opener to the precission of mouse aim making you feel like a true criminal and dead eye marksman. No more lock on just pure fluid movement moving to one head to the other dealing massive dammage and trully satisfying bodies falling as you walk trough the snow parking.Once the prelude done Los Santos came to life. The intro video gave a preview of what was to come. The same great game plus some. If you read all the way to here fist off congratulation for tolarating my pationate and distracted mind but mostly you can understand that this game is truly good and even considering that you might have played on another platform if you enjoyed it you will the same on pc.

One of my friends tells us about an injector script that gives you $5 million every second. I downloaded it (reluctantly thinking this was another virus or shutdown script prank) to my surprise it worked and before I knew it I had the maze bank tower and 30 x80s (in case they did a money purge it was only a rumor at the time but I hardly believed it would happen). 'About a week after using it we're playing around with the new I got. going around either killing random players we come across or doing pvp fights with eachother. One of my friends buys an OPENIV mod menu the day before the cease and desist and we were all on a flying yacht for the next 20 minutes.The next day back on online mode I spawn in my office and get on a call with friends only to hear that they were all perma banned everyone but me and the guy with the now useless mod menu ( he got banned a few hours later). What the rockstar? I am still not banned and I still have about 5 x80s left (they even patched the injector script so don't get any ideas) but the point is that I hacked money in game and Im still not banned yet while my friends that haven't modded or gotten any large sums of money from drops. Now I'm going to touch on something else overpriced DLC items.Im going to be really brief but unless you are able to shell up $100 to buy the cheapest hangar with one of the new $50 planes your out of luck.

2019-01-31,0,0,119,False,Recommended,Finished the story finally. Off and on for a few years. Great story and great characters. This game is stunningly beautiful. Nice large open world map. Driving is so satifsing and what's even better is the first person. Played the whole game in first person. Amazing. However the only way to play with friends is online. This sucks. No mods or your banned. Thats not fun. I want to be able to host a session for me and my friends to join spawn some tanks in and just drive around having fun. Sadly the only way to do this is with mods. That is not how a game should be. Rockstar can have their online multiplayer but there should be a seperate way to host a session where you can use mods and cheats without the fear of being banned. Over all still a good game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Haven't encountered any hacker in the online mode which I was surprised at because the majorty of lobies on 360 had at least one hacker.Only problem I had was that I had to create a new Rockstar social club account because the one I was trying to login to was saying the password was wrong.(But thats only a minor problem that wasn't the games fault)10/10 would recommend this my friend because to me the PC version is a lot better than the console version.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-19,0,0,547,False,Recommended,Pros *Lot of content *Good selection of vehicles *Fun to play with friends*Single player mods (no major game changing mods yet but they are coming)*Cons*Hackers although they are becoming less and less they came in waves as soon as trainers are patched and cycle repeats. *Cant buy everything. Pretty impossible to own everything in the game without buying sharkcards (ingame money) *Payouts during most missions are pointless. Heist are only way to make money now and can get boring as there is only handful and become grinding expirence. *There is currently no visable way to pick your country server so you easily can stubble upon lobby of french speaking people (which I just go find new session). Final thoughts I think the game is pretty good for what it is and rockstar did a pretty well job in porting this game to PC I do not have any issue running this on GTX 780 on high and get always above 60fps. Lowering things easily puts me in 100 150 fps range. Only thing I would say after playing this game it is good game to meet people in. Just takes time to find people as many people in the GTA community are and are sometimes just rude. GTA community on pc is mainly men but quite a few girls play GTA and the have entire girl only crews that women can join to play with other girls which is always nice thing to so in the gaming community. So definatly a diverse game with lot to offer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-05,0,0,58,False,Recommended,"Disclaimer I played only the single player so my review won't mention anything about the online component of the game.TL DR Even though the story is considerably weaker than both GTA IV and San Andreas GTA V is still a brilliant masterpiece and definitely recommended.Now here are the positives and negatives + The story doesn't have the impact of GTA IV or San Andreas but it still has enough depth to be engaging. Going through the story mode with three different protagonists is a somewhat unique experience as not many games do that.+ The graphics are incredible for a 3 year old game. And I didn't even install any graphic enhancers. I have a GTX 1080 and with everything max'd the visuals are breath taking. What impressed me most is how real how life like everything looked. It enhances the atmosphere greatly.+ Speaking of atmosphere Rockstar does it again. They have created a masterfully crafted mind blowingly detailed living breathing world. From the sound of cooling metal after you drive a vehicle for a long time to the customisation options in your cell phone the world is full of details. I can't even begin to guess how much time they spent designing Los Santos.+ Incredible top notch voice acting. Every single person in the game even the pedestrians will make you feel like you are listening to actual human beings talking real time instead of studio recorded voice files. No other game I've played has this level of quality voice acting.+ The radio and TV shows. You can spend hours listening to/watching them. They are that good.+ The game offers so many options that you can tweak almost every aspect of the game. The Settings menu is just huge.+ The game doesn't just consist of the story mode. There are tons of activities you can do all around Los Santos. Even after you finish the story you can keep playing for at least 50 60 hours. The story lacks the impact of both GTA IV (and its superb DLC The Ballad of Gay Tony) and San Andreas. It lacks the personal touch those games had. I couldn't really care about either Michael or Trevor (I actually hated every minute we played as Trevor). The only person I was interested in was Franklin and he is the least focused on protagonist. Niko's past haunted him all throughout the game and CJ had an odyssey filled with loss grief betrayal and twists of luck. There is no deep story here. We just follow a ""from rags to riches"" story with no special twists or surprises. The end of the story was definitely not cathartic like GTA IV or San Andreas was. Hell even Vice City had a more impactful ending. There isn't enough information about some of the missions before you start them and you get bad results that you could've easily avoided if you read a walkthrough. For example whatever you do leave the Lester assassination missions after the main storyline or you won't be able to 100% the game because you won't have enough money to buy all the properties. Those missions can earn you enormous amounts of cash IF you finish the main story first. Also towards the end of the main story there is a mission during which a wrong decision may cost you almost 20 million dollars. There are a few other missions like this where you have no warning whatsoever and the wrong choice creates a lot of headache for you down the road. There are some optimization problems. Even with a i7 8700 16 GB DDR4 RAM and a GTX 1080 I had FPS drops more often than I'd tolerate. The problem seemed to get better after a driver update but still persisted.All in all this is one of the best games to come out in the last 5 years. I definitely recommend it. Even though the story feels a little lacklustre compared to the previous games in the franchise it's still a masterpiece.",Grand Theft Auto V

I bought the game on PS4 and I don't like to play online on a console.I think it is a great game.Maybe the greatest game I've ever played.I buyed it by full price in 2017 it's still worth the price.Pros +Extraodinary story.+Three protagonists Micheal Travor and Franklin.Two Americans and a Canadian(Trevor) with totally different characters. I love Franklin he is cute +Interesting npcs funny plots and quests.+A very large and well designed open world map which depicts the whole city of Los Angeles. +Pretty nice graphics well optimized(even my old pc can run it smoothly....by the lowest level of graphics.)+You can select first person or third person.+Happy single player experience of 40+hours.+/ Hard to aim when shooting that little white point is too small to find.(2017/11/11 edited seems that this can be changed in settings)EDIT I bought the game on PC and I started playing online so I will edit once more again and I will review the online part of the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-26,0,0,254,False,Recommended,Don't even kid yourself this is the best sandbox game ever made to date. This is one of the few games I felt was worth the full 60 bucks. Taking your motorcycle cross country or stunt jumping through the city is an entirely different game. The potential for messing around and having fun is pretty great and this game looks amazing for its scale and for being an open world game.That said the single player felt a little short and a little boring at times. Specifically the missions. All the characters were interesting enough and had great voice acting except for Franklin. I felt the writing was slightly too serious and gritty this time around but I could just be biased from liking San Andreas the most.Online is still riddled with hackers with no end in sight. Custom races and missions are pretty fun if it's worth your time. It's also a pain to use cheats in single player since they wanted to prevent online hacking (didn't work out too well) which makes me think they should have just made it a seperate game for online and they could have focused more on single player missions.Overall great game get it on a sale though and make sure you can run it first.,Grand Theft Auto V

It feels like they rate it negativley to be contrarian or they rate if by a different standard that they would rate other games. This game is so huge so real so beautiful that we still see it as the gold standard to which open world games need to look up to 4 years later. This game is so extrodinary and mindblowing that it's difficult too say why somebody wouldn't like it. I have a couple of friends who don't and they say that it just didn't feel good to control which I kind of understand. Kind of. Multiplayer has turned into it's huge money maker but even if you don't like it (which I can see why with the average GTA V player) the story just by itself is enough for it to be outstanding. The voice acting in this is so great as well that it feels so real but self aware that it's silly at the same time.

2018-12-05,0,0,527,False,Not Recommended,Well after 450 Hours of playing so far it's time to make a honest review about this game.First of. i would recommend the game for the singleplayer yes cuz i really love the singleplayer and the story.but to come to the online mode. . . i dont even know where to start with so i gonna put pros and cons into a list insteed.SingleplayerPros good ambients good story line nice details enjoyable gameplayCons not much activitys (mostly the same destroying and killing things) Cops can be a pain in the butt sometimes cars break down to quick (without armor upgrade) some missions are really hard sometimes mostly almost impossible to not die ones.GTA v OnlinePros lots of choices of cars aircrafts etc. nice heists you can perform nice conzept (actually no but i will explain later)Cons way to many cheaters in seasons sometimes overprices stuff and upgrades if you're new it's almost impossible to play with all the unfair vehicles sometimes you cannot perform some heist and missions while being in a friends only sessions (you're forced to go on a puplic online session) some glitching and bugging things as example put back the avenger into the base manualy. (will result in endless loading screen) getting money is really a slow progress if you dont have much people to do heists with. heavy armor is a joke. dont even bother to buy one.in short. there are waaaaaaaay more things i encountered while playing but the list will go on forever so i just put the most important things.I dont recomment the game if you plan on playing the online mode. stay away from it as far as possible. but if you are interested into singleplayer i would recomment it.so up to you to waste money for a online mode or spend the money to enjoy a great story mode,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,36,False,Not Recommended,"I have bought this game three times (XB 360 One and now PC) and I love it.The content added to the game over the years has been great and it's been very generous for Rockstar to hand out DLC for free. The game has its flaws but that's perfectly ok as long as the developers try to make your gaming experience better. As my frien put it ""I would happily spend $100 on GTA with all the content is has now."" And so would I.Modding a game for the most part is almost entirely benefitial to the game. You've seen it with Bethesda titles such as Skyrim and Fallout and was very true for even GTA VI. Modding allows for communities to form and interact with one another to find ways to make a game even better. It's a passion and it takes hard work and dedication to create custom content for the games we already love. We do it not to insult the creators but to make our own stories and discover our own artistic interests. If the creators of a game refuses to improve their games then the community will. Plain and simple.Games such as GTA V that are more susceptible to alterations and modifications only entice players to jump on the creative train and take their shot at making something wonderful. If the game one makes is easily manipulated then one cannot complain that people take advantage of it. It's better to encourage modding than to spend thousands of dollars to prevent it something Rockstar clearly has not done. There will always be someone willing to change the code and enter a section of the game's engine that was never inteded to be breached.Singleplayer is a portion of ther game entirely different from its multiplayer countrpart. Taking away modding from a singleplayer game serves absolutely no purpose and should never be done. That's why people mod singleplayer sections of game to not ruin the multiplayer experience.Take Two this was a huge mistake and it should be considered fraud. Thousands of players have purchased GTA V multiple times and you should have no right to ban players based on your speculations of cheating. People who have spent $180 on your game should not be banned because of a flaw in your game design. No one asked you to create a currency in your game and no one said you had to create free DLC. You could have simply left the game alone and let the communty imprive it. Banning players for singleplayer modding is a great way to kill a game you spent millions on developing. Stop acting like you're underpayed and underappreciated. These reviews should have been the first thing you thought about when making this decision. Modding is an art form it's the same reason people become game developers. You can't just hinder someone's want for creativity. Next time think with your brain instead of your wallet.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-27,0,0,321,False,Not Recommended,"Update I have been playing this game for a bit mostly for the multiplayer. However my opinion has changed and NO it is not about the stupid OpenIV boycott that everyone is doing. This is my own opinion.Firstly the positives. The story is good and the chemistry between the three characters are great. each character's abilities are unique where it would represent their speciality and don't have a copy + paste ability. Michael's ability is like a bullet time effect where you can shoot enemies in slow motion and his speciality of precision and use of weapons Franklin's ability is a driving ability and allows him to turn corners or dodge vehicles easier and represents his passion for boosting cars and street racing (my favourite) and Trevor's rage ability where he resists most of the damage taken by enemies which represents his psychopathic behaviours. Seeing each character have its own banter together and disagreements can make you laugh or possibly think about who you like/dislike. personally I like all of the characters and it doesn't seem to be a problem because it all goes with the flow even if there is some beef between the characters.Another positive I found is that the game is well optimised. For me running an AMD FX 4350 processor and ASUS' AMD R9 270 on medium settings makes me manage the single player easily but there can be some difficulties for the multiplayer some few FPS drops here and there other than that the game feels easy to run.However the negatives I find are mostly on the multiplayer grand theft auto online. I'm sorry more like ""Grind Theft Auto Online"". It is a mess. Rockstar I know you want to add new content into the game that experienced players can have but the problem is having to be forced with Pay to win elements in a game (shark cards) makes free to play games feel embarrassed. Why are you putting a pay to win element in a game that already costs 20 (or 40 without discount). I mean yeah people will just go and grind their way to get the vehicles and the stuff they want but honestly having to grind for 3 Million for a CEO office (which is completely useless on its own) and a bunker or one of those import/export garages disgusts me. I even had to be given money just to enjoy the things I wanted to play with which is 10x more fun than actually grinding the same missions over and over again.Another negative is that the multiplayer is boring. As if playing for hours and hours would be boring enough the payouts in missions is basically slave money. you are forced to grind the missions either way unless you do the hiests (which I didn't do in the end because of how much a chore it is). The activities are bland there is no point in doing races or anything that relies on PVP as people that you face against on GTA O have a significantly stupid advantage over you just because they managed to win several races or have almost everything in the game including custom vehicles with the highest upgrades. People on GTA O also have almost everything that you can imagine e.g the new gun running vehicles and weapons that can be used as personal vehicles which defeats the purpose of having pegesus vehicles. You can have more stuff to do on a serious RP server on Multi Theft Auto than playing on GTA O without being maimed constantly by a person that has everything from shark cards. I mean come on where is the Single player DLC that they promised us for years and still haven't delivered it to us. Looks like they're too busy on trying to make a lot of money on GTA O and possibly developing GTA 6 like those lying and illiterate GTA youtubers who are discussing about and trying to find substance to fool many 8 year olds who love the game too much.Oh yeah another thing I wanted to add is that there are not many hiests only 5 (Fleeca job Prison Break Humane Labs The trevor hiest (don't know the name) and the Pacific rim job hiest). And also playing these hiests are also a pain unless you have friends to help you. the randoms make it more aggrovating than it sounds and you can't even control their incompetence. The payment is... ok I guess but generally when they had 2 3 years making these hiests I felt a bit disappointed because there were a lot of things they could've done but didn't because they want to make the experience of the game more stale than a piece of bread.Lastly the final thing I want to discuss are the servers. Sorry I mean Peer to peer connection they have for GTA O. Well considering that Rockstar got massive amount of profit for the initial release of GTA it would make sense of having server's right? well not on their business model. I remembered playing with an irish friend of mine that couldn't play because of Peer to peer connection which is stupid and disappointing because of how much the friend wanted to play GTA O and join in the adventures with me yeah sure there can be some things Rockstar is developing other games and representing them elsewhere but surely a AAA title that runs Peer to peer connection is questioning the overall quality of the execution they made on GTA O Overall If you want to get the game for the single player and for its mods then this game is for you. However I find that the multiplayer is too grindy too boring and represents a F2P stereotype that we know and hate. Of all of the games I was surprised that Rockstar is one of the culprits of having F2P elements in the game. For anyone that defends this sort of sellout stratergy I say no to that. Telling me to grind missions or get good at the game is literally not even an argument that overtakes my point if I'm going to play a multiplayer game I'd expect the opposing team or players in the game to have beaten me or play against me fair and square without the use of pay to win elements I am against microtransactions because it just makes the progression of the game meaningless to an extent where you would be dominating people just because the developer's patted you on the back for giving them your cash.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-28,0,0,100,False,Not Recommended,The single player mode is fine but GTA Online is horrible and that is where you will spend all your time once you complete the story mode. A year ago the game was so filled with hackers that you couldn't even play GTA Online without being assaulted by a never ending stream of cheaters and hackers it was horrible. So I waited for a year thinking that after that long surely Rockstar had the game functioning properly. Well the hackers aren't as abundant but now the game if full of glitches that render the game unplayable. First problem I noticed was half of my map icons didn't exist anymore. I could not see clothing stores garages barber shops etc. So I completely reinstalled the game which takes forever with a game this size and now my map icons are back but I keep getting stuck on loading screens when I enter or exit missions. I sent a support ticket to Rockstar which they are not responding to so I tried to talk to Steam about the problem but the only way I found to communicate with them was to send a refund request which of course they denied because I have had the game for over a year. Rockstar does not deserve anymore money for this incomplete product we aren't talking about an early access game this is supposed to be the final version of the game which means it should be fully functional. Rockstar does not care if it's customers are satisfied once they have your money they leave you hanging with no options. I am seriously considering filing a report with the federal trade comission they have gotten rich off of this game the least they could do is make it actually playable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-16,0,0,1308,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is a game of (unlimited mode) of unlimited possibilities but there is no doubt what's really great about the latest GTA? I will try to summarize the following in the following rows.. . The story of the latest big car robbery could be summed up into one single sentence ""You You Become a Boss"" as in any GTA ... but since the game has up to three playable characters (Ku which we get later) each has its own problems dependencies and this is also the focus of missions ... so the psychopathic Trevor (T) has the best and most mission critical missions because he has to take care of his company ""Trevor Philips Industries"" (If you run drugs to Blaine County behind Trevorov).. . On the other hand such a 40 year old Michael has his family which consists of a fat / ungrateful son a wife and daughter in law who apparently would like to get into the TV and do anything (He has no problem with ). So it follows that Michael (Only M) does not only have time for various illegal activities but must protect his family honestly ... not to mention that he will later get into the movie business.. . And we get to the character whose first mission is to steal the car ... yes it is the last character of Franklin. The whole game I could not get rid of the feeling that Franklin (already only F) is actually CJ just lives in 2014. But even so his missions have from the beginning (Nechem to express racist) ""black"" content or you will steal cars and more than half the attempt you will not get rich.. . When you know F M T you can imagine what happens when these 3 elements meet and you can believe that it will be a really rough ride.. . . The big plus is of course the Dialogues that are the best Rockstar Games ever offered and with a good knowledge of English you will be laughing at each sentence as they are really Perfect. I can only talk about dialogues.. . The end of the story however is based on you and you can either be spoiled or take care of all your problems and decide whether you will live or die in Los Santos.. . The city is indeed as vast as everyone says. But the question remains whether or not to do it? The answer is definitely yes. In the city there are many races minigames or mini missions in the form of adrenaline jumps from parachutes from huge buildings and of course not to forget there are walkers strip clubs and of course Rampage (But you can play only for T and unfortunately there are only 5 is quite a disappointment).. . But personally the city has been hurt by the lack of strength and the impossibility of buying Safe Houss (Buildings You Can Buy). What the previous GTA did not have is a triathlon (I do not have to explain what is going on) which is fairly enjoyable and confiscated about a bit (They are 3 and the last one is less than 40 minutes to go). Of course everyone who wants to enjoy a good adrenaline action will take a mountain bike turn on First Person and go from Mount Chilliad.. . I would like to get to the best of my PC and PS4 versions. This is of course the above mentioned FPS mode. He has his flies for example that the character in the FPS fashion can not use his hands and so in the door just bluntly. One more thing (As I like the movie feeling of the game) which is more than a matter of fact is that the character does not know how to walk slowly in the FPS fashion and so it still escapes and it spoils the impression of some scenes.. . The action is on the other hand in FPS fashion perfect and weapon details to experience a more realistic action and to feel like you were a real psychopathic T like killing brothers O Neils so FPS mode is right for you (I spent more than 17 h).. . On the contrary driving a car is much harder as sparse mirrors are absolutely nothing to you and you can not even see them in Highest details (which is quite sad for such a game).. . That's how we get to the graphics that were perfect at the time of release on the PS3 and now after the release of the next gen and the PC is fairly decently transformed ... as soon as the sledge does not fall out of it but you still scare off the perfectly processed water perfectly crafted faces of the main characters and of course you have the famous 60 FPS.. . There is no need to comment on the graphic because it is still more than good but as long as I was waiting on the PC version it could be even better for two.. . Missions unlike previous parts of the GTA series have relatively long quests and that means you just have to move from A to B and mash everything you can but this time you have to go to buy weapons first then a journey full of great dialogues awaits you then a massive shootout some cut scenes the way home and if you're lucky enough to have another massive shotgun (such as Mr. T).. . Okay but that's not something that makes the new GTA much better than the previous ones. But you have not yet heard about HEISTOS ... ask yourself what it is? These are the best missions that GTA offers. Robbery. Of course such a robbery of the World Bank requires some planning ... so you have to get some fire fighting cars then you have to cover up your crutch take the guys to this lucrative JOB and then choose the procedure.. . After this long and difficult planning however waiting for you to deserve robbery where despite the very good planning something always goes wrong (I'm talking about Palleto Bay) ... but the catch up to the last heist is never worth the trouble. And that's what GTA V is different from the previous ones.. . Multiplayer is so sweet from the main part of these heistov where you play with your friends on the NPC eckok and it's more fun I personally uploaded it for about 20 25 hours with my friend and it's incredible fun. Of course it's not just about the Heats there are races (All Kinds) DeadMatch fights those heistas and I do not forget the missions and you can rob the stores and it all bears that in the classic GTA story and completes the overall impression from GTA.. . GTA V is therefore a good game like everyone else and although the basic story goes for about 40 50 hours Multiplayer bonus activity and overall openness can confuse you for the next 150 hours.. . 9.5/10.

I enjoyed the story and I generally enjoyed the multiplayer scene and the amount of extra content being added for free is a neat touch as well. I'd recommend getting a group of friends together for the heists it'll make your life so much easier particularly as some could do with proper voice chat. There is an issue with hackers but they rarely affected my gameplay in a negative way. However Rockstar really do need to sort out the stability issues that the GTA Online servers seem to have and it's annoying that they haven't done so these issues date back to the X360 and PS3 versions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-10,0,0,75,False,Recommended,I briefly played Grand Theft Auto 4 and felt amused and intrigued by the game but unfortunately I never finished the game. I didnt even get past 10% on the game im sure but as soon as I started playing GTA 5 I was hooked. This game is well worth the hours spent on it. Story is great Visuals side missions extra added missions cars weapons and just about everything else is so well done. Not to mention the music is great as well. Im probably more biased on this game than some of the other GTA games but this has to be my favorite so far. Granted my all time favorite is still Vice city stories but only based on story and nostalgia. I just like the whole 80's theme/tony montana vibe. Nevertheless GTA 5 is loads of fun to play and has lots of comedic undertones in it that make it enjoyable throughout the game. I love games that also have replayability value and this is definitely one of them. Good job guys.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-08,0,0,278,False,Not Recommended,I used to play this on the 360 i can say that the singleplayer is quite good but i prefer the story of GTA IV because it was more focus in one chacarter instead 3 i found to be more easy to relate to 1 protagonist instead of 3 still though mods are a plus in pc gaming and this franchise it's no stranger when it comes to modding. As for the online part it's bad for the most part. It can be fun at first but after 100 hours into and still grinding my off it start to get boring. After a while you don't get the feel that you're progressing in anyway it feels more like im doing this for nothing trying to get a bunch of fast cars and crazy vehicles just to amuse me for mere hours/minutes. Sure they drop alot of ''free'' updates but then again... it's the same thing all over it you grind alot you get what you want and after some hours/minutes you're done. As for the grinding it's ridiculous this is a AAA game that you pay $60USD and it feels like a mobile game in the sense that you must have the patience of a virtue to earn such item if you do buy this game soley for the online... well then prepare yourself to redo alot of heists vip/ceo/biker bussines and 2xRP/Money events or pay real money just to get something that feels overpriced. Another problem with the online aspect it's Hackers i can assume that 80% of the freemode servers it's bond to have at least 1 hacker and it's even sad when half of the lobby ask the hacker for in game cash... or even worse when the hacker starts to ''play'' with your account. Overall GTA V it is a fun game at most but i think it is somewhat overpriced because of the multiplayer. I think Gta online should turn into a F2P or something like that while we pay $30USD just for the singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is good and extremely fun to play and the online is addicting.That being said I absolutely cannot recommend this game at all.If you purchase this game you will spend about 1/3 of it in loading screens. It takes between 5 10 minutes to load into an online session and between 2 5 minutes for story mode. The loading times are absolutely atrocious and is the worst part of this game. Sometimes after doing a heist you will be stuck in an infinite loading screen that can only go away by forcibly closing the application.

2015-12-05,0,0,390,False,Recommended,"Here's an honest review over GTAV. I only have 4.5 Hours currently on the PC Version but i can tell you alot about the core game i have played GTA V since its release in September 2013 yeah this game is over two years old now and just released this April on the PC.So first off why everyone comes to reviews is to look at the Cons ill start with those.CONS This game is a Cash Cow. R* Doesn't give a flying flip about you unless your spending money on their shark cards (in game currecy). A good example if you wanted to buy all the cars from the last DLC drop with real money you would spend nearly $450 buying the cars and upgrading them all the way this is only like 7 cars mind you and doesn't include any of the houses guns clothing. R* Support/Servers both suck. R* doesn't really care to help you with any problems unless its just a connection problem but even then you will more than likely will get a automated message about 3 4 days after submitting a ticket you're better off trying to talk to other players on the forums. Secondly the servers tend to drop out alot ive tried this from my own home to my friends house in the city who has a 1GB internet speed its the servers problem. With that said you will also drop in and out of ghost lobbies too (by yourself) or just experince lag in a lobby with 10 15 people in it. Hackers/Modders. Their everywhere. First lobby i joined on PC had a hacker who dropped me 300k. I submitted a ticket which im still waiting for to get taken care of to remove it so i dont get banned. *Fingers crossed*. Then i hopped around found a couple good lobbies found one with a few guys where we went to the airport and started racing. This one kid shows up (literal kid 13 year old squeaker) with a T20 while were all in muscle cars he destroys us obviously and we told him he's being a brat and needs to get the same class car he ends up overclocking all of our characters (hacking) and made all 4 of our games crash just because we ""told him to get a different car"". From stories i hear theres even hackers that can get you banned by putting your name as theirs and they go on killing sprees blowing up peoples cars and placing you in the bad sport lobbies. Everything is overpriced. As i said ealier this game is a cash cow and they want your real life money. EVERY DLC the cars just get more and more expensive. Like recently in this low rider DLC you can get a car for 30 000 (previously the DLC before this the cheapest car was 400k). This isn't too bad for a lowrider but when you take it to the shop to ""upgrade"" it to become a low rider custom you have to drop 350k just to unlock the parts then 75 150k each part for hydralics dash interior wheels etc etc. You'll easily spend 2m on the most recent DLC on just one car. Mind you 1.2m is $20 real life money and it is stupid hard to actually earn money in game unless you spend 15 hours a day grinding heists to afford ONE car in a few days (45 hours total). Limited Customization. This game has been out for two years and theres SO MANY faults in this game. Theres no black or white backwards hats but there sure is green and purple. You cant have a regular ol bent foward hat but you can have the swag flat bills. Theres tons of cars that have no modifications cant put a cowl hood on a el camino. Theres no body work out system where you can tone your apperance or get fat everyone is slimmed. The Apartments are a joke once you buy a ""High"" Apartment you pretty much own them all and the only reason why you would buy any of the others aside from the cheapest one is for location or just to have another garage for more cars. Everyone is an . You will just be cruising along on your street bike jamming to your own self playlist just to have a tryhard in a zentorno come flying at you knock you off and throw a sticky bomb at you and drive away... They will repeat this 5x till you blow them up (which costs you money for destroying another players vehicle and since zentornos are super cars thats 25k outa your pocket just for the car) then they will go into passive mode (cant kill them) call in their car again that you paid to replace and start repeating. Theres at least 2 people like this in every server. Who at the first sign of losing will go get a tank/jet and ruin everyones fun. Can't tell you how many times ive tried to hold a car show on the XB1 with easily 20 people show up and get all parked looking fancy just for a guy to fly by in a jet and kill everyone till we all leave/hide underground. The game is unfinished. Yes it is i don't care what anyone says. Theres literally dozens of locations you can glitch into that have no purpose (yet). Good examples are how you could glitch into some of the prisons buildings into the Labs or the banks because they were intended to be opened up later as DLC. Yes people all the DLC you get is already in the game that their just ""unlocking"". R* is just milking this game for your money.Now with this down let me tell you why i do recommend this game. Pros You will never have a experince like this on any other game. I have lead a crew on GTA since the release ""Player Killers"" i started out small and grew the crew into 600+ People we were ranked #16 on the leader boards for TDM we were a force. Slowly tho the crew died out as the game got repeatative and i ended up joining a MC(Motocylce club) Bound By Blood and i stayed with them for over a year it was really neat playing with 60 or so other players in the same crew who role played as a biker club and we would all ride in formation it was something else alot of memories and drama was made on this game as also finding brothers who were passionate about the same things i was. You can practically do anything and go to anywhere you see. Want to sky glide from the mountain to the ocean? Do it. You want to fly that jet upside down in that tunnel? Good luck but do it. You want to ruin everyones car show by taking a Monster Truck through it? Do it. You want to go stunt biking in the city? Do it. You want to be an and ruin everyones day? Do it. Aside from R* obvious money hungry strategy they do keep adding more DLC to the game (unlocking) areas clothes and cars about every 2 3 months keeping the game fresh. You can make your own playlist on the radio from your own music folders i currently have 150 songs in game on one radio station on repeat sadly other people cant hear it but its really refreshing to listen to your own tunes in game. The Graphics are one of the best even if its built on a older gen system and just upped for PC its still amazing and you can download mods to make it even better (offline only).Final Verdict 8/10.Other than the outstanding flaws in this game from R* being greedy bad support and the player base full of hackers the core game itself is pretty fun and you can easily grind out 500+ hours from this game 200+ from the story alone if you want to complete everything and take your time.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-12,0,0,444,False,Recommended,I really really hate what Rockstar decided for GTA V that is putting all the additional content into the online mode and make the single player empty. To this point there's no necessity for me to right yet another critical review of GTA V's story mode. So I'm gonna recommend the story mode. The online mode is fun with friends for maybe dozens of hours. What after that is mindless grind or challenges with no real story. Since how much content was cut for microtransaction items the city is hardly immersive when comparing it to the previous titles. There are many good game modes when playing online but never have they become truly memorable since in the essence they are only chores for leveling up and gain cash. The character creation is... you can only create 2 characters and never get the chance to change anything about them after creation. For a game like GTA V shouldn't customization being a priority? Besides that Rockstar expect everyone to be the same person the same criminal boss or robots who have hardly any motivations for doing things. You get to get the cash the cars and weapons and houses and other stuff but never a character development. Character development should not be a thing to care about in GTA online originally. However like I said after updates and updates the game promotes the idea that you should make your criminal business bigger like you are some somebody that the whole city should reckon but in the end you are not. That creates a conflict between new gameplay and the reason to experience new things... There are many other flaws but these are what I care about the most.,Grand Theft Auto V
2019-02-13,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Hands down one of the greatest games ever made. Rockstar the developer has been making GTA games for two decades and Grand Theft Auto V is their masterpiece. It is has more attention to detail than any other game I've ever played. The story is unique well written hilarious shocking and heart breaking all at the same time. If that's not enough there is an online mode that has been supported with updates and new content for years. This game offers hundreds &amp hundreds of hours of some of the best content in video games. If you haven't played this stop what you are doing and start GTA 5 now.,Grand Theft Auto V

If something was done to shift the balance just a tiny bit or even make matchmaking more appropriate i would gladly suggest people buy the game but not when it will continously spawn you in front of groups that have significantly better gear and just want to kill you instead of giving you a chance to even try getting a better weapon.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-09,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,I bought GTA V with high hopes as I had greatly enjoyed playing it on the Xbox 360. I create my online character and begin to enjoy the game.The game itself? Phenominal. Just a masterpiece. It is hard to get started with money and all but once you do it is easy.Then 3 days after getting the game I encounter a hacker. He had given everyone in the lobby rank 150 and 400 mil. Me not wanting to get banned called Rockstar support. I simply told them that I wished to have my money and rank put back to where it was.They told me that the hack was coming from my computer and was not given to me by someone else. I am given a supsension and my progress will be reset. I wouldn't have been too mad except I had spent money on the criminal enterprise starter pack and was told it would not be refunded or given to me again.Basically Rockstar support sucks. This game is good if you can manage to not get banned for something you didn't do.2/10 DO NOT buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-11,0,0,1427,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is a very good game No question about it.GTA O on the other hand is the worst experience you can get from any open world multiplayer Hackers Banned without reason ( seriously ) Need to clock in several days worth of hours to buy good stuff. ( not always but getting businesses to get money fast requires lots of grinding in the first place ) Useless support contact The economy is inflated ( stuff now cost millions ) Economy that suits Shark Cards ( which isn't worth it since you can't buy that much stuff from a Megalodon SC ) etcThey cut the price of the game in half because less people are playing it and to attract new people to buy the game. They also added the ""Guest List"" as an incentive to play online (which is absolutely worthless $100K may seem alot but it really isn't). If you've seen reviews some new players (not even 9 hours in) have gotten banned for no reason. The Ban system of GTA O is random. It doesnt always target hackers and legit players have been caught in the crossfire.I've been banned recently for no reason and I get the SAME copy+paste NO REPLY email from R* saying that ""i violated""(which i didn't i always grind) their terms and service.They say their bans are FINAL which i call t. You can't appeal a ban to restore your character. no no no. You can get banned for no reason and show proof and they still won't believe you.GTA O has been riddled with bugs since launch. R* cares more about making money from Shark Cards instead of fixing their bugs. The occasional updates that cause bugs that are exploited by players get patched quickly ( deluxo superspeed ) but bugs that happen to businesses and bunker research ( researching the same item twice ) hasn't been patched yet.I'm actually happy from getting the ban from R* I can now freely mod singleplayer without any risks of getting banned in Online. It is a online ban (which is worthless) so it doesn't affect me much (though i lost my progress).If you're buying GTA V for the story and action Go ahead and buy it. It's a blast to play.If you're buying GTA V for the Online. Just Dont. It isn't even worth it.Note GTA Online is fun to play if you have friends and a blast to play on heists. Playing Online alone is like a survival game. Alone and everyone wants to kill you (especially those tryhards and griefers).",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstars customer support is so bad they just have a bot that auto responds to any enquiries about bans leaving the player clueless to why they get banned and with hundreds of hours wiped even though modders just keep on going never getting banned but legit players do just for being in the same lobby as them. Rockstars anti cheat software seems to just be ban everyone but the modders so there is less people to scan in there game when they do look for modders.Don't buy this game you'll only waste your time trying to avoid Rockstars constant push for shark cards so you can get one vehicle thats fun then get your account wiped from some A hole cheater and rockstars flintlock accuracy anti cheat system.,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-01-20,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,There should be full mod support on here on steam workshop. Otherwise most reviews are accurate on the single player being good(but disappointing since dlc wise rockstar is really obsessed on the multiplayer angle of things sadly) and the multiplayer leaving alot to be desired. I refuse to pay for ingame money so it's more of a grind for me. and i Just try to be miminalistic with what I do especially bullets wise. But again I'd just get the game for single player since it has a decent length and very detailed open world multiplayer has potential but rockstar should really focus on the single player side of their games in general.Aside from that I hope for gta 6 they build on their open world design and let you go in more buildings and the police system is argubably my favorite out of the other open world games I've played.

No helicopter jet or armoured car is safe from the Oppressor MK2.

2018-07-09,1,1,142,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V I am writing this review only for the main story because Online personally is not GTA V. Story You take three roles Trevor's Michael's and Franklin's. It begins with Trevor Michael and Brad (which is dead) robbing a bank. That's it! Robbing a bank. When the heist is over you take control over Franklin with his friend Lamar repossesing two cars for Simeon. As Franklin is doing a mission for Simeon his is almost done by taking a car from a rich house something happens that takes you to the beautiful story of Grand Theft Auto V. When all the characters meet the star thinking about the big heist something big that will get them retired for the rest of their lives but to reach their goal they will have to pass some very big obstacles. Character description Michael He is my favorite character. He is a rich guy with two children Tracey and Jim and a stripper for wife Amanda. He is the serious man with some obstacles in his life. Michael's story centers around how his seemingly idyllic and halcyon lifestyle is brought to a halt as his past demons and morally compromising mistakes come back to haunt him. Meanwhile his midlife crisis pushes him to his ultimate snapping point. Trevor Trevor is my second favorite character being a very vrazy guy with a lot of power to kill you. Seriously. Trevor has been described as a difficult person to deal with extreme impetuous vengeful psychopathic unhinged unpredictable untamed infamous homicidal and prone to violent outbursts and destructive rampages. He does everything in a sociopathic and relentless manner (much different from Michael). Although Trevor is like this he is honest about it and will never show hypocrisy. He has his own charm along with his own principles.Franklin If Franklin was a little more like Michael he would be my favorite character meaning I would not have had Michael and Trevor at these positions. Franklin is described as ambitious but perhaps to a fault and very eager to take on new illegal challenges. He is also described as calm smart rational and a logical way of showing a young man with a lot of hope with Dan Houser claiming that this would be a nice contrast from Michael. He is also a person that even though he's being mentored by Michael in crime mentors Michael in life. My rate 8 5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

The pause menu has some lag here and there it's not a big deal but still noteworthy also at the moment there is a memory leak in this game meaning it's not taking full advantage of the hardware so it doesn't matter if you have a GTX 770 or a GTX 1080 ti this game will punish any card if you crank up the settings and resoultion up it's one of those games like Crysis that just is crazy taxing on any system as of Q4 of 2017 maybe one day not so much The Story is great and has multi endings depending on your choice near the end of the story driving is very nice also too many games try hard to be this game and most fail compared to this Watch Dogs 1 &amp 2 Mafia 3 and Tom Clancy Ghost Recon Wildlands all have nothing on GTA 5 this game puts all of them to shame hands down the driving is better in this game than all of those I mentioned also you can mod the hell out of it in single player or in FiveM I don't like GTA Online that much but I'm sure there's people that will love and enjoy the grind or have tons of real money to blow on the Online The gunplay is good but feels cluncky and akward at times I would stay in 3rd person most of the time 1st person is cool but gets old fast so your mileage will very on that end of things Trevor is by far the best one out of 3 characters you play and is the most fun to run around as Micheal is a train wreck at the start of the game and he always finds a way to be up to creek and is very cringey of a person all around and last also least Franklin is the most Sterotypical lame and boring out of all three of them Trevor when you switch to him is throwing a bike gang member off a edge of a bringe Micheal Either Crying inside his car or driving one of his family members around in his ride Franklin is Ironing his shirt or typing on his Laptop lame asf they could've made Franklin way more intresting but played it safe the Cars go anywhere from a smart car to a Bugatti Veyron but they renamed it Adder prob to save money also you can Drive Tanks Fighter Jets Monster trucks ATV's Dirt Bikes normal bicycles just like in San Andreas mopeds To BMW Motorcyles look alikes Lambo's Ferrari's GT R look alikes and Muscles Cars all USA ones you can pimp your ride at any chop shop buy guns go hunting go swiming or in a submarine fly a chopper crop duster have a yachet own a garage full of cars own houses own an airport steal a commerical plane have a dune buggie those are fun have a mad max looking muscle car change from many outfits and shoes and hats get tattto's buy local buisness around the area have make $ on the side from that rob a store or help stop a robbery course steal cars duh and shoot a ton of gang members law enforment and miltary than I can remember and anyone else that stands in your way in this game it's about 4 times bigger than GTA 4 i'm guessing maybe more or less depending on who you ask the support characters are very cringey all of them and live up to the streoyptes you'd expect and the cutscences are some of the best all around in short this game had a massive budget and they def messed up here or there but still a solid game overall,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,139,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.,Grand Theft Auto V

I learned English through them too. SA was my number one. I thought no other GTA will ever surpass it. But this one. Jeez. The story. The characters. The map. Love it. Only thing i don't like is the Online mode. I mean everything is Allright but too many modders... They teleport you to them and keep on killing you. But other than that the game is perfect.

2018-07-13,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,"I'll try to put this as simple as possible.Single PlayerSingle player in this game is an example of developers having no ideas for storyline and just came up with something that they thought it would be extremely appealing. It's short and not very interesting at all.Online Note There's nothing else to say about Single player since this game is intended to be an online game and that is exactly one of the reasons why single player was massively neglected.GTA Online started off very good actually but soon Rockstar realized that it's not the best way for them to make money off players. So that's when carefully calculated misproportion arrived on the scene. It's sole intention was to make Online experience as hard as possible. Prices of GTA Online in game purchasables are way up (millions) compared to what you earn from Missions/Heists. * Properties have to be ""maintained"" meaning in game currency is deducted for certain ammount to ""try and make it more realistic"" when at the same time flying cars and bikes are available for purchase (again millions).* Random wanted levels for no reason usually resolved by dialing in game contact Lester who would take off the wanted level for in game price.This might not seem as much but slowly over time it affects in game money massively it's is created so you hardly notice an obvious impact on the player's money.Comparing Single player prices to Online prices makes it really obvious. You don't pay utilities in Single player nor you pay dozens of thousands for car wheels but in Online this ""realism"" steps in.This whole idea of ""trying to be realistic"" ended up being very obvious intention. Shark Cards.This carefully constructed system of GTA Online is made so the players spend money really fast and earn it really hard and entire system so ""innocently"" leans towards an option to buy Shark Cards for in game currency. Yes you can do mission/heists indeed you can. What players call grinding in this game is more of exhausting waste of time. You want to skip meaningless heist repeating over over and over again just so you can earn few millions? Buy Shark Cards. Example 80 for 8M in game money gets you few properties not to mention that you need much more to fully ""upgrade"" cars which are few millions also and upgrades are around additional million. New players stand no chance against other players everything comes down to Shark Cards or playing for thousands of hours untill you're exhausted from it or just give up. But there's a solution yes Shark Cards.In addition Online is known to have long loading problems and even very often ""disconnected from online session"" problems. This was just an experimental phase for Rockstar as they are known for not being able to create functional multiplayer. Altering the course from what they did the best (Single Player/ Storylines) to Online ""experience"" mixing it up with Micro Transactions ended up as a disaster.And now the real stuff. Lobbies lobbies full of hackers/cheaters who intentionally ruin fun for others by trolling. Freezing trapping in cages setting on fire god modes exploding other players kicking out of lobbies and much more.So what do you do in this fabricated chaos? Nothing. Surely nobody would buy 80 Shark Card that is 30 more expensive than the GAME ITSELF. Fake reports that can get you mic muted when you don't even have a mic. How to resolve that? Contact support? Yes that's an option and it could take a long time. It all came down to Modder VS Modder experience.The only reason the anti cheat exists in this game is because of Shark Cards. They don't care about destroying the lobbies with trolling mods no primary intention is to ""hunt down"" the accounts that used the mods to add the money to avoid buying Shark Cards.But they add free content what about that?Free content is there to keep the game going so the players have something to latch on to the content that brings more overpriced purchasables.ConclusionGTA 5 can be described in 3 words Buy Shark Cards.If you are planing on buying this game because of Online or Single player Do NOT. Save your money and save your TIME.Mark 0/10 The worst GTA so far.",Grand Theft Auto V

CCCCCCOOOOOOOOZZZZ for example Maze Bank West is free (so excited) bbbbbuuuttt after you purchase it you still need to spend at least a million in the interior and blablabla...............When you play the game later you will then realise that all the missions you do in the future your earnings could not even afford one friggin' car (For example A Zentorno costs about $700 000 and a mission at least 30 minutes will only contribute 10% in order to buy a car.) Rockstar Games just made every content in game worse and worse every year just like EA.

2018-08-20,0,0,682,False,Not Recommended,To start ill quickly go over the single player since everything about it you can say has already been said The singleplayer is pretty fun experience that has an absolute ton of content to enjoy and will allow for hours of fun the characters are decent though using a single protagonist like previous GTA games would've been better in my opinion. Overall youre looking at a great singleplayer experience that is worth a look on sale espcially. However this game has an online component which is objectively the defining feature of the game in general and what R* games really want you to play and espcially spend money on(more on this later).I luckily got the game for christmas as a gift on PS4 originally moving into the year the heists update came out which gave me ample time to learn the game and get really invested in it. I had a blast playing it made a couple of friends on the way and we were hyped when heists came out and earned a good paycheck but sadly it wasnt enough for the dlc that came after and this is where the great gta grind begins. I drifted away from the game after heists discouraged by the grinding needed to acquire new items in the update and I eventually purchased the game on PC. By this point two new updates were out Finance and Felony and the Bikers update which introduced a new business element to the game which admittedly was cool to begin with and could be used as a long term consistent source of finance needed for new items. Problem with this was it was still the repetitive gameplay id quit GTA for previously grinding. It gets worse as Gunrunning releases which like previous updates introduced new meta defining items such as the Oppressor which griefers use to blow up business supplies and products of rivals in freemode sessions. So now you have items which cost an absurd amount to begin with and money making is made extremely difficult due to presence of other players. So one would seek other sources of cash injection because the need for money in GTA is now so great just so you can fight back against other players. From Gunrunning to present day all R* have done is keep introducing content which redefines the meta so money making is more difficult and prices of items are so ridiculous you either have to play the game like its your daily ing job or purchase sharkcards.GTA V is the finest example of how corporate greed ruins great games. My final statement about this game is Singleplayer is worth it on sale if you plan to play the multiplayer component use mods to inject cash into your account to save weeks of grinding or cashing out on over 100 of real money for single items. Without cash the online mode is not fun.Whatever you choose to do do not support Rockstars' anti consumer practices in any way as they do not deserve your money for making their best selling game a pay to play grind online,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-26,0,0,606,False,Not Recommended,"WARNING LONG REVIEW IS LONG And pretty well detailed in my not really that humble opinion (Psst spoiler free) )First a little bit sidetrack let's go back to the launch i was surprised when rockstar said it would run on a gt9800 i was amazed i had a gtx520 at the time and i was really happy because i was broke and that was what i had bought it at pre order played it on day 1...it was barely f*cking running now before one of you s start ranting about ""hurr it's an old gpu what did you expect?"" i expected it to RUN since the minimum was a goddamn 9800 i was playing it on full minimum and couldn't get a stable fps out of it they straight up LIED about it and no one seemed to notice maybe you can just save a quarter or half a salary and buy a evga 1080 but i live in Brazil here that costs nearly FOUR minimum wages and that nearly is my monthly house income. Probably it doesn't affect you but i bet more people were unable to play it because of this straight up lie.Now onto the game the campaign had nearly no REAL addition to even the 360 and ps3 versions it's just the same campaign same missions same cars just the same thing all over again it had some additions in purchase options some new buyable cars and a couple of side quests but that's about it for all these years singleplayer is a remaster AT BEST.However it's still a great experience if you never played it before i would surely reccomend it it's not THE best experience out there but that is up to you that is just opinion based it has some reasonably deep characters a good plot pretty different from what you would expect from the GTA franchise the dialogues are well written the pacing is good the gameplay is simple and satisfactory and the map is quite lively and fun to explore every other aspect is at least above average the only thing that kinda sets off the pace are the overuse of chase sequences using rigs and heavy vehicles that make the chase just depressing no car chase is fun at 65km/h.The main thing of this game is the ""constant expanding"" massive multiplayer now it's gut wrenching hard to talk about this without letting my TERRIBLE experience get in the way but i'll try at first it's relly fun even by yourself you'll see how many things you can do how many things you can buy you can buy houses exclusive cars exclusive jets VTOL jets russian hinds rocket cars private jets made of gold limos with miniguns lowriders racecars yachts bunkers clubs even car tuning has some depth and it's a blast getting your first houses and cars i would say the first 15 25 hours give or take wich let's be honest it's quite alright i remember that i had so much fun earning my money with street races and starting and customizing my garage but comes a point when you're already kinda entrenched in the game that you realize that making some real money in the game is f*cking IMPOSSIBLE you see that the races and survival missions you were doing have absolutely no value since everything cool costs at least a million there are sadly only two things you can do to earn money the public organization missions wich i will talk more later and heists.Heists are probably what you will be doing after a good couple of hours since it's more accessible then the organization missions all you need is a high end apartment wich can be bought easily enough even solo this is when it goes in a scary downward spiral it is a PAIN to find random people to do heists that won't up the whole thing you'll easily restart the same heist over 15 times because of a single dumbass if you're solo now with a team it's still fun as you'll have the designated driver pilot and stick together to pull off some pretty creative missions a quick tip if you make all heists in sequence with the same people you'll earn two achievements wich will grant you around 2 million each that plus the money from the heists wich might amass to a whooping 8 million on your bank account now if you're REALLY good at this game and finish the elite challenges also you'll be injected with so much f*cking money you'll feel like one of those middle eastern billionaires riding on golden bugattis and throwing cash at strippers but don't get your hopes up since the challenges are pretty insaneNow the REAL way to make money are organization missions wich compile CEO MC and now apparently gunrunning those will be your #1 and sometimes only hope of getting some meaningful money but there is a twist they can only be done on public lobbies you know the one filled with hackers trolls and armoured kurumas gunning down people with an uzi because they didn't even care to get a real car and a real weapon not even to troll.They are basically the same collect goods from spot A bring them to spot B to store and then take them to spot C to sell it ranges from crates to cars and drugs you will get marked on the map as a big red target for EVERYONE in the lobby everytime you pick up the goods if it gets destroyed game over try again however it requires a reaaaally big upfront pay making it ridiculously risky and nearly impossible to make a reasonable profit out of it.Another tip the vehicle CEO missions are the safest you don't need to pay to source a vehicle you'll only lose money if you up the delivery plus it's easy to run away from most trolls on highly tuned hypercarsThen your cousing ""D*ckhead"" comes in ""Ey there has to be some way to overcome it...right?"" and the answer is NO....not oficially *wink* (shoutout to grade)I'll let you guys in some juicy secret props for reading my t so far you can block UDP ports on your firewall to bug the servers and spawn you on a public lobby on your own i have been doing this for countless patches you won't get banned from it and even if for some REALLY harsh luck you get any kind of penalty for it (wich let's get real if that level 963 guy teleporting players to buildings and gunning them down doesn't get the hammer you won't for doing just this) just blame your ISP for blocking ports wich is a thing most ISPs do the UPD ports are 61457 61458 61456 6672 61455If you're familiar with firewall it shouldn't be too hard if you didn't get a single thing i said google ""how to block udp ports on firewall"" or ""blocking udp ports gta v"" search a little and you'll find out howSumming it up i wouldn't reccomend you to buy it AT ALL but i wouldn't dare to say it isn't worth a shot either maybe you have a taste for these types of games or you didn't get to play GTA V and want to just experience it once i would say give it a shot if you have some spare time and money try to get it on a sale or sweet talk your girl or boy into getting you a copy but DO NOT put it high on your list give priority to other better balanced gamesCheers mateEDIT Smuggler's run update made making money EVEN HARDER every freaking month they release something that gives more guns to people that screw your deliveries the UDP port blocking does not work as before i am uninstalling and giving up on this completely every day that passes the modders earn more and the rest gets a huge F* YOU from rockstar it's blatant how rockstar is going corporate commander on players and it pains me to see people turning a blind eye to it if this is a high standart for a multiplayer open world game sign me out right away as someone who had already played the hell out of the singleplayer campaign on console i kinda regret my purchase nowEDIT 2 Doomsday dlc is up trolls and toxic players have even more ridiculous weapons at their disposal but with the new heist wich you can do with just a friend makes earning money just a tiny tiny bit easier (props for the mental additions tho batmobiles orbital cannons and stealth choppers holy single mother of three some of those are awesome)",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-03,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,This game.... could have been great. Too bad it has wonky physics missions without the ability to restart them unless you fail or die ( and the car race missions last a few minutes so if you didn't save you have to wait) and a half cover system to use while shooting it out with whatever army the game is tossing against you. If none of these bother you though the graphics are top notch the destructible environment is pretty awesome and the notoriety mechanic(at least at low wanted levels) is fairly easy to beat. Overall though I just can't get past the first few issues so I requested a refund. It wasn't even worth the sale price to me I'd rather go replay Vice City.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-24,0,0,282,False,Not Recommended,First off I am not a huge gamer so my expectations are not well developed as others. GTA has great visuals story telling and voice acting. There is plenty to do in GTA multiplayer from cooperative tasks to PVP and they are quite fun. The game is constantly updated and the activities you can do is getting more diverse. There are many downsides of the game. The main one being it requires too much grinding for cash and levels. Levels unlock much better weapons. Cash allows you to buy properties which unlock missions and to buy various vehicles which is essential for open world PVP. You can pay real cash to get in game currency but its just a rip off. Due to the grinding nature of the game certain activities are rarely done as the payout is way too low which reduces variety of the game. Other problems include connections/game loading issues and excessive modders (cheaters). I have in the past spent 20 minutes of the hour just waiting for the game to connect (not just joining the game but within the game) and spending 10 minutes out of 1 hour waiting is common. Getting kicked out of the online session and having to restart the game is really common. As for the cheaters there are plenty of them and from what i read online its been an issue since GTA came to PC and has never been addressed well. Cheaters make PVP impossible and can also interfere with your missions. Overall if businesses weren't so focused on maximising profits this would have been an excellent game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-20,0,0,791,False,Not Recommended,when i first played this game back in 2015 it was a great game with alot of content and it was all attainable through a fair system which let players do say 5 heists for 2 to 3 mill allowing the player to get practically any car they wanted. now there is a massive grind that basically forces shark cards down your throat for fake $ to buy the DLC cars. this has led to hackers coming into the game more often and modders as well so in 2018 i can not recommend this game as it uses rather scummy business practices and this would not have been the case if they had kept it the way it was in 2015,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-12,0,0,566,False,Recommended,The single player is good. Online is fun when playing with friends and when you are actually able to purchase expensive items after grinding for hundreds of hours. Toxicity cancerous behavior and hacking is also unfortunately prevalent in Online. All the DLC is free but there are purchasable shark cards that boost your progress towards expensive goods. (I do not recommend buying these scams) Overall though GTA Online has its enjoyable moments with friends but if you are without people to play with then you'll likely find it quite boring.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-08,0,0,164,False,Not Recommended,"Yeah let's face the fact that if they didn't fear a financial burden they wouldn't be apologizing to anyone. They're not ""listening to the community"" or ""doing what's right"". They're protecting their product. GTA online is designed for money completely and utterly. It is completely pay to win and everything else is a grind. You can blame the company but the consumer is the reason this stupid bullsh*t keeps occuring all over the gaming industry. They wouldn't be making money if you didn't waste your time buying fictional shark cards. After the story I don't play this game online unless it's a private lobby with friends.Rockstar and Take Two are not holding a good ratio of income VS output. Online mode is very basic it is extremely boring. It is not what we were promised. Also the DLC they've released is the most basic BS I've seen more impressive stuff made in garry's mod. This reminds me of the morons who sh*t their pants over Valve's CS GO update where they added ""defuse wires"". It's easy to make and computer illiterate people get excited because they have no idea how little effort it took to create.When you support malformed business practices you're making a statement that they will be tolerated. It is successful and will continue to be successful as long as the idiot consumer lets it occur.As for the hackers you get the free money scripts from the same websites you get Godlike cheats from.

2019-02-14,0,0,180,False,Not Recommended,Bought this version because I was convinced by my friends. Would be a fun game if Rockstar actually wanted people to be able to buy or do anything other than the same missions over and over and over and over and over and over and then someone blows up your stuff and then over and over.... you get the idea. Let's face it everybody now who buys this game buys it for the online. The story mode isn't the problem but Rockstar and the community itself is. If you think you can suck up the grind that Rockstar made so that you can actually enjoy the game itself I'm here to tell you that won't happen. I've owned the game on 360 since the very first online update and trust when I say that the grind I'm talking about will never end. Quite literally because by the time you start to buy something from four updates ago they release something different that costs even more than the last. Don't even think of buying shark cards. You'd have to pay $1 300 extra because the scumbags never updated the shark cards so that they suffice some of the updates. It's still the same price and worth that it was when online first started and they kept it the same because they know people will be dumb enough to just buy them over and over.Then maybe you might think ok well maybe Rockstar doesn't care about modders anymore and I'll just mod my account and get some money. Nope. I recieved money from a modder once then got banned for a month happened a second time except I was afk and it was literally out of my hands then they permanently banned me. To top that off I know friends who have modded accounts and they typically don't last longer than a month and then you get reset.All the content that they add becomes so much less appealing when you realize how much you have to grind to be able to buy it. Hell I even bothered doing the math once and if you want to make let's say $100M which by the way isn't even equivalent to what you see typical let's players or what people think the average account is like. That's about one month of grind IN HOURS not in the actual rate and that was if you literally had every single business fully upgraded and three people who work with you perfectly all those hours with their own equipment. To own the businesses themselves also takes about a month in hours because you have basically next to nothing to get money in the start to top that off nobody will take you into any missions when your low rank because you won't have any body armor guns or experience which by itself adds an extra week before your able to buy the businesses.Every single complaint about Rockstar support I can promise you is true. They do absolutely no work in reviewing reports. You get reported? Your emblem get reported? Then you can't do a single thing. That combined with one of the absolute worst player bases I've ever seen will eventually net you trouble because even if you didn't do anything to them they still can and will just report you without reason. Not to mention the modders that haven't been banned yet breaking servers and possible resetting your character too. So you know. That's fun.Alright maybe you figure that you don't need the money or any of the content you'll just mess around with friends. Yeah that's not going to happen either. As soon as a jet or player comes remotely close then you already have become a part of a pointless fight with a random. Even half of all the content is locked whenever you try to go into a private lobby so even then your taking it with a grain of salt.If you ever consider buying this game don't ever bother creating and online account. It's way more painful than it is fun.Story mode wise it's ok. Don't get me wrong it's fun but I owned the game for 5 years and never felt motivated to finish the story. Not to mention nearly every time they update the game almost nothing from that update transfers to story mode aside from some of the cars but that's it. I honestly would just recommend saving your money and getting something you can get more of your money's worth like The Witcher 3 or something like that.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-23,0,0,208,False,Not Recommended,Game itself it good. However someone gave me money and i got an instant ban when i didn't ask them to? Also the vehicle prices are too much making you have to buy 'sharkcards' that are also over priced. Due to the new update if you want he Luxor jet or golden swift you have to buy money. How are you meant to make enough money to be able to get it when the highest paid mission is 30.000 How ever the heist give you more but still not enough to be able to afford a simple Luxor jet. With this game i feel its just a way for Rockstar to make as much money as possible out of there customers.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-23,0,0,114,False,Not Recommended,The story mode is great as you would expect from the series.

Regardless of how much you report someone it just generally doesnt do anything and rockstar knows this and doesnt care using the negative publicity on youtube garnered from these hacks to add to their playerbase.

The free to play model DOES NOT WORK in a 30 60$ game period.

A big one to say the least.Take Two is not only anymore a subsidiary to Rockstar Games. They have taken big control over the company as Rockstar Games keeps bringing other parties to compose the name of the company and letting them take control over it and their products. Take Two is making some bad decisions over the actions they are taking against their games and their communities management. The poor and almost (if not) null feedback to the community and the over all mediocre management of the decisions to be made over the games in this case Grand Theft Auto V (not to mention the amount of micro transactions and the subtle ""pay to win/pay to enjoy"" bases that the game now has over its dominant online interface) are really taking the experience and enjoyment of the game down the cliff thinking only with their wallets and not with their heads for what the customers deserve and want leaving regular players fans and long time followers of the Rockstar Games long history to just drop their forehead and eyes looking to the ground in sigh. Its one of the reasons I'm putting a vote for the OpenIV petition to bring it back.Take Two needs to see that their feet are tapping over the line and its not something the community is going to tolerate anymore. OpenIV as well as many other projects that don't infringe with their policies are been attacked with legal threats making it a direct hit to the fans. OpenIV was one important pillar for a very very BIG amount of people to be dropped to the dust because of this threats from Take Two. Its really sad and just frustrating to see this type of things happen all the time over the gaming world but one thing its just not caring about your customers opinions and another is to demolish their works time and efforts to make their product feel more enjoyable open and alive after fans getting no real support or reply on the communities desires and needs. They decided to take the jobs for themselves and make it real as the producers wouldn't. Rockstar Games and Take Two need to see that the fans wont keep tolerating this type of actions over them anymore.

And i don't mean top 3 or anything you have to finish first which is hard if you're matched up with players of same skill so many people abuse it by purposely losing races for each other*Upgrades cost more than in singleplayer. And sometimes you get unreasonable fees fixing the car from a small bump*Vip work and CEO organisation work gave mayhem some kind of purpose*Highly customisable cars (benny's) upgrades costs alot so you either farm cash or buy shark cards(don't buy shark cards)*Yachts are basically static waste of money with few mini events and cost alot so Rockstar really wants you to buy shark cards. Basically your e p*nis..*No more content for singleplayer (sad)*Kuruma still has insurance for some reason. I mean come on if someone gangs up on you with it it's damn hard to kill them without blowing up the car and paying their insurance.*Weapon wheel is a mess. You have to cycle through all of the weapon types and cannot remove certain weapons so it makes it harder to fight sometimes*Major shuttering issues are fixed although there some texture popping issues specialy on windows 10*For some reason Online works worse then singleplayer with shutters texture pop ins and other weird stuff*Input lag. Sometime this thing happens out of nowhere.*Community is kind of toxic but that is expected for this satire game. Even the game is built in such way so people could screw over each other so expect players talking respawn camping you chasing all over the map just for killing them that one times or bumping into their vehicle*Customer support is non existent you have better luck searching the forums for help from other players or googling going on youtube to find solutions for your issues.This game is worth it's price even for just it's singleplayer witch is about 30 50 hours depending on your playstyle .

2017-04-04,0,0,11,False,Recommended,Fantastic game absolutely love it but it has performance issues. I have an i7 4790 12gb ram and a gtx 970 I can run this game at a high framerate on my 144hz monitor but it doesn't utilize the gpu properly. I can max out the in game settings and be running the game at say 40fps but gpu utilization will be like 70%. I was also inside the shooting range getting 144fps but then I walk outside and fps and gpu usage drops. I monitor using msi ab and my cpu is not bottlenecking my card. You can google gta 5 low gpu usage and see for yourselves that it is a problem. Also fps gets pegged at 70 unless I turn vsync off then on again.

2018-12-04,1,1,137,False,Not Recommended,The game is okay had some installation issues. Currently am reinstalling this game just in time for Xmas as well as other games too. Don't really bother to play GTA Online much spent most of my time in offline mode most of the time. Singleplayer mode hasn't got much to offer in terms of content &amp story the story wasn't that great anyway i found it way too boring. The only aspect i liked about the game was the singleplayer missions but not the story. I hated the online portion of the game just like any other MMO game too grindy structured to force players to take out thier wallet in order to even make any decent cash. I played this previously on my PS4 online with a lobby hack where i got into lobbies on my own where i did crates all by myself. I did fine then but on PC? Forget it its even worse. I'm guessing Rockstar will want to make the next GTA game Online only going by the way GTA V turned out. Looks like i won't be buying another GTA game in a while until they change their sales tactic. One bad gripe i have with this game is the internet connection. Why the hell do i need to have internet in order to play offline with this game because most of the patches is nothing to do with offline mode only online mode wtf rockstar? Its not enough that customers leagally buy your game from steam or retail then have those same customers jump through stupid hoops just in order to play the stupid dam game all because you release some stupid dam patch for GTAV online which prevents players who actually want to play this game in OFFLINE SINGLEPLAYER mode. Wrong move Rockstar that was a pretty stupid move Rockstar. I won't be buying GTA VI.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-16,0,0,954,False,Not Recommended,TLDR I can't recommend you get this game even when it's super cheap. The single player isn't worth it and you run the risk of losing all your online progress when their bot screws up with no recourse.Like so many others I was suspended and all my online progress whipped out through no fault of my own and Rockstar will not hear any appeal. I spent months grinding away to get where I was online and I just lost it all. This is not the first time Rockstar has had this problem where they suspend/ban innocent players. Having a no appeal policy in place for an automated process is completely unreasonable given how many bugs are in the game. They obviously don't know how to test their code properly.The online game has some very fun aspects to it but there is a very tedious grind to it as well. There are a limited number of heists you can participate in and other ways to earn money mainly involve diving/flying to some location retrieve some item/vehicle and return it to some location. Frequently doing the latter mission type you'll be accosted by bored teenagers who just kill you for the lolz. Not to mention running into actual modders who will teleport you out of your building and kill you.The single player story was no where near as good as other GTAs. I've played them all starting with 3 and this one just felt to fragmented. You play as three different characters which you can switch between. To me it really felt like the stories of each character were too shallow and overall the game was missing something.,Grand Theft Auto V

Even if Rockstar realizes that there s not a reason for you to be banned and that it s a problem on their side it s still game over. Investing money and time in this game is risking having them stolen from you. At this point and time I strongly recommend not buying the game until rockstar changes their policy fixes their anticheat and stop braking their own rules.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-12,0,0,248,False,Not Recommended,What I have to say here likely has been said. It's been a slice getting into GTA online a slice of barely strung together content marred by the icing of griefers general jerks and modders and thats not even mentioning all of the strange and frustrating programming choices that Rockstar have made. I've spent about a hundred hours working my way through the new content and for a while it was fun to look forward to getting a bunker set up and having all of those side businesses set up and making some money for all the new toys that Rockstar adds. After a while it got old the double RP and cash bonus changed to missions and activities that I didn't care for the constant badgering phone calls from NPc's about spending millions more on the next best thing to unlock more carelessly planned out content and missions. The most irksome thing was feeling punished for trying to complete some of these missions solo like if I dont have a group of four players with me I was playing the game wrong and it must therefore be especially difficult to maintain these businesses. Therin is the biggest issue I have had with the whole of GTA Online it seems to me that a group of economists got together and made sure that the game would constantly motivate you to need more in game currency than you ever have or are able to make. The heist payouts are laughable for the amount of work coordination and money spent on ammo and armour the side mission payouts are also half what they should/could be and all to encourage the player to fork over more real world cash to get anywhere in the game. Games are games not jobs I don't think they should be tedious frustrating excercises in ocasional futility. Games have so much potential for good and having the bottom line of profit at any cost and underwritten on every programming decision sours the expereience for me personally. Greed has taken what could have been amazing and made it into a steaming pile of aggravating garbage. Do what you like but I am pulling the plug on my GTA Online career.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-05-24,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Single player is nice funny story. Except that controles are optimised for console so M&amp K support is quirky that makes some tasks frustratingly hard. Multiplayer is just plain bad playing heists with randoms is almost impossible when someone quits the whole heists ends and everyone is returned to the game (not even the lobby)To join friends you need to start the game wait for it to load start the online part wait for it to load select a friend and choose the join option and wait for it to load again. Lots of hackers doing all kinds of redicious (being spawned on fire in a cage spawning planes on a deadmatch map that doesnt have planes aimbots etc etc)Menus are non intuitive and you need to press a lot of buttons to get to somewhere. setting up a crew and inviting people is just way to vague.

(the game was purchased by myself on the date of Feb 18th 2017)Even when my account is eventually unsuspended a month from now I will barely be motivated to play GTA Online anymore due to being suspended under absolutely unreasonable circumstances and then basically becoming totally outraged over the entirely obscene situation obviously getting angry that it ever happened.I could give several points and reasons why I shouldn't be suspended but instead am breaking the 4th wall on the the fact that I payed real life money to be able to play this game and now I can't play this game...To whatever employee is reading this there is honestly nothing you can do and nothing I can do and I think we both realize that this world is not a perfect place and is actually very screwed up.I am just bothering to send this ticket because a friend of mine urged me to repeatedly and even though I told him it'd make no difference I'm sending it in anyway. I have no idea if this will make any difference involving how the company treats or provides services to those who pay for those services and my common sense tells me this will just be another insignificant message which makes no actual difference.Basically the purpose of this message is I've genuinely gotten very emotionally upset angry frustrated from this experience. I am not even getting what I really payed for unless I ironically considered that I was 'paying' for the terms of service and stuff which sort of came with the game so I legally in a twisted way payed to agree to have myself suspended etc.UPDATE I received a reply ""Hello Insane_David40 Your account is temporarily suspended from GTA Online. Your suspension expiration date is shown on the splash screen after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online. In addition to being suspended all GTA Online characters progress and inventory on PC will be reset.

I used to regularly play this game with my friends... now I can hardly bear playing about 15 minutes of it before leaving and waiting to load into jobs that require 4 people.This game has become so broken in the 5.5 years it has been out so many of the mechanics absolute garbage and the overall design of the game itself while breathtaking in visuals and having great depth in character is so graphically demanding that half the time the goddamn world doesn't load and there are lag spikes every half second when playing on the lowest resolution and lowest graphic settings. Good lord Rockstar updates their game with amazing multiplayer content that allows you to play this game with all your friends... if they are all able to stay connected and not DC in the middle of a job rendering you all stuck until they can take 10 minutes to load back in or god forbid you have to rely on randos to fill your heist or 4 player job. Another thing heists in this game are literally broken. Arguably one of the best ways to get money in game absolutely requiring 4 players to complete each and every heist after the Fleeca job is literally so. goddamn. stupid. Go the Payday route. Although it is another broken as all hell game at least the heist mechanics make some sense you can solo any job you want or have up to 4 players who can come and go at will. Seriously fix some of the core problems of the game that have existed SINCE LAUNCH. Stop adding new content that requires millions upon millions of dollars in game money that does nothing except pressure people into wasting their money on Shark Cards to afford ""The Hip and Cool in game features"" and causes up to 10 minute loading screens for just OPENING the game. That's another thing. Hackers. Admittedly I used mods for about one week in an attempt to get a vehicle I could only access from transitioning from standard to enhanced edition of GTA Online... until I started playing again about a couple months ago. These people are so rampant and hell bent on making the game miserable for everyone except themselves and yet it continues to make the already existing problem of lag spikes and unsuccessful rendering of textures worse than can imagine.I used to love playing this game but good lord. Rockstar needs to get their act together. You can't make everything better in a game just by adding new content that makes people forget about the broken core problems of a game. It's called REWORKING. Finding the underlying issue and making it right. Even when Rockstar attempts to patch the game ""one thing is fixed and about 10 new things are broken"" as one of my old crew friends would say.3/10. Amazing visuals music characters and some mechanics of the game itself. Everything else is ed. Stay away unless you already own it or have a ton of disposable income for shark cards or time to grind your life away trying to own the best things in game.Lastly been getting EA Star Wars Battlefrontish vibes akin to loot boxes when it comes to shark cards and other players having advantages in online freeroam.Broken game.",Grand Theft Auto V

They don't want you playing single player because their is no need for shark cards there..at least not yet but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens too.2. GTA online was a good mode that was turned to trash and in my opinion is not worth playing. They have turned it into a grindfest in order to sell shark cards it's totally unbalanced and reminds me of fifa online absolute trash. They purposely hugely increased the grind to force people to buy shark cards3. Game is filled with hackers and even without hackers if your not pumping in real world cash it's going to be pretty unbalanced with you on the wrong end. 4. Unlikely ever to make single player expansions because they don't want you playing single player because it competes with online shark cards and why would they want to pay people to make content for your mone when they can sell you shark cards which cost zero dollars to produce an infinite quantity of5. They can ban you and reset all your progress if they ""suspect"" you have cheated and you are not allowed to appeal.

2015-09-23,0,0,445,False,Not Recommended,The story is okay. Single player is pretty fun but gets boring quick. That's all I have to say about single player because it's not as intensive as online is.**LONG RANT AHEAD**Online blows for the most part if you plan on buying this game to play online go buy something else not worth your money.The controls are very unresponsive in third person. Walking around it like being drunk on a pogo stick and trying to perform combat in third person is even worse especially when you're trying to roll and end up climbing up the side of the wall for no reason. third person in vehicles is okay the vehicle mechanics are fine until Rockstar feels the need to mess around with the range of the weapons. First person is almost as bad so don't let that feature give you any impressions either. First person is very responsive to your mouse. You can look/aim where ever you want without hassle. Moving forward and backward is no problem either. Strafing however tends to lag behind and get you killed. Maneuvering any vehicle in first person is bound to get you killed or stuck. First person in cars is the easiest looking around is a bit overreactive but that's it. When you start actually driving though you're stuck looking forward almost always with like a 30 degree view so checking where the rest of your car is in comparison to the environment might get you into trouble. Shooting inside a car in first person is broken simply to say. You lose a large portion of area to shoot through and are limited in accuracy. First person in aero vehicles is odd as well. Helicopters act like they did in GTA 4 and it's difficult to see out of a cockpit in a plane. Planes are also overreactive on the control scheme so simple adjusting the yaw might send you spiraling into the ground.Combat is okay in certain aspects and utterly horrid in others. As I mentioned above about the combat in vehicles it's not that great unless you're in third person. Combat against other players is clean and accurate everythings works just nicely. Combat against AI however is pure Whenever you fight AI your chances of survival greatly diminish than that against players as the AI is more powerful (somehow) and more accurate. There's also significant delay behind the AI when they actually shoot at you so you'll be getting damaged a half second or so after the AI actually shoots you. Moving around during combat is hectic too I've had too many experiences trying to roll and then climbing up something and dying immediately afterwards (roll and climb are the same button space bar.) A slightly insigifnicant problem I've had too is getting sniper shots. Sometimes when I shoot someone far away with the sniper it'll tell me I hit them but they won't take any damage. It happens much more sparingly with other weapons. Combat in vehicles is junk. Helicopters use the same firing mechanics are GTA 4 so basically no practical aim (unless the AI has a helicopter in which case they'll shoot you through the ing fender of their own heli) so you have to use missiles most often. Helicopters are also incredibly weak so it's near pointless to use them unless you're killing low level players or the AI. All jets have explosive rounds so there is still some use to using bullets instead of missiles like strafing a tank. Jet's are probably the most defined and well worked combat mechanic in the game. Using mounted guns on vehicles like the tank insurgent or technical are decent as well.Activities in GTA 5 are always combat related. There's rarely any races anymore and and even more sparse are the sports activities like tennis arm wrestling or darts. Did I mention there's no pool? Yeah no pool super disappointed in that. If you want to play any of these other activities you'll have to get with some close friends because random players won't play them as often. The activities work well and are pretty even. I wish there a bit more player creativity in them because I'd like to see players actually make Survival's or Contact Missions.Online connectivity is also super terrible. The most hated thing about GTA5 is the connection issues. I've played indie games from 2006 with better connection than this. A lot of times I'll be playing and I time out of the lobby (when you time out everyone else in the lobby leaves except you.) Sometimes when I get mission requests in my phone on the game I'll join them only for GTA to tell me that I can't connect for miscellaneous reasons. I serious pet peeve of mine when I do join a request from my phone it tells me the mission is full and then sends me too a new lobby back at my house. Everything takes about 2 3 minutes to load so getting in and out isn't actually possible.I'll be editing this later to rant more.,Grand Theft Auto V

Hell I'm going to college for programming now because of all that I've learned from the game and tools that allow me to see how the game is structured. I understand that as a company you have every right to do this but you just don't understand what you're doing. Maybe you think you do but take a second look please. Thanks to you there are many young adults like me that have overstepped their bounds and learned how to do various things such as 3DModelling Software Engineering Programming and loads of other things that wouldn't have been possible without such an amazing platform that RAGE provides. To take down the *only* tool we have (for editing game files) that has been worked on for 9 10 years is like spitting in our faces. I feel ashamed to be a fan of Rockstar Games because they're just giving in to the monsters that are TakeTwo Interactive. I will no longer support or purchase your games until you work with your own community to bring back everything we've worked to hard to build. You may think ""Oh who cares we have millions of other customers."" but I'm not sure if you've read the reviews seen the petitions or watched YouTube but there are millions of us too.

I do wish Open IV would be allowed to create Liberty City still but I understand Rockstar's policy on that.Grand Theft Auto V is in my opinion the best game ever made. It is incredible the graphical quiality in the game truly takes my breath away the work in the little details that I still find everywhere in this game. The level of thought and work that went into this is astounding and Rockstar did an incredible job of it. I cannot wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto VI though I know I'll have to since that is most likely 3 or so years out from when I'm writing this review perhaps more. And the reason I want another game to follow this isn't because I'm sick of this one it's because I cannot wait to see what else Rockstar is capapble of what other places I'll eventually be able to roam around wreaking havoc and joining others in doing so.

2015-05-17,0,0,61,False,Recommended,The seventh game in the Grand Theft Auto series brings back Los Santos and San Andreas(though greatly overhauled). It also brings a fair amount of new stuff to do compared to its lackluster predecessor as well as a fleshed out online component. Unfortunately it also comes with its share of issues.For one it's an incredibly hardware intensive game and while you can run most of the settings at High or Very High if you don't have a 3/4GB VRAM card you're not going to be able to run textures on anything higher than Normal. It's also plagued by a few persistent issues such as the custom radio causing stutter for many and performance drops where they really shouldn't occur. Issues with shadows either not appearing or bugging out have also been reported (and experienced by myself).Those issues aside it's a better port than the previous games and the online component works much better on a good desktop than it does on consoles. Loading times are good and the new Director Mode allows you to unleash your inner Spielberg. If you've already played the console version you know what to expect.

Filled with hackers little kids who constantly kill you and Rockstar has milked this game dry with their silly little ""FREE DLC's"" (What a great company everyone is thinking.) that would actually cost $200 to purchase everything included (All of the DLC combined would probably cost close to $1500 give or take Im just guesstimating.) Not to mention its repetitive as hell and gets boring in about 30 hours if you have no friends to play with (All of my friends have stopped playing) I think the reason it gets boring so fast is due to the fact that I have pretty much everything (bought all of the items when everyone was a billionaire back on PS3 and Xbox hehe) However even if you're the poorest of poor in this game its still boring due to the missions that give you no cash nor reward.Pros Great Singleplayer story Amazing voice acting &amp memorable characters Fun singleplayer missions Cons Multiplayer...

Also there are individuals playing this game without the actual requirements needed and some who have those requirements are having issues. So far I have not passed the Social club and don t know if there is an option to click to play or if the game runs after you login it s been over 5 6 hours. Currently I wouldn t by this game yet until they fix these issues or you can and just download it and wait until everything is available. In this technological era and with all the orders they received through steam their sites as well as other sites they should have been prepared and being unprepared damages the fun and hype of the game and its community. Currently I give this game a 5/10 due to their lack of communication and their lack in preparation. I m very patient however so I will wait until they fix these issues. Once I m able to log into the game and see what is out there I will change my opinion on it. There are other issues many individuals are reporting through the discussion boards about logins and crashes and etc. those could be helpful to anyone who are interested in the release.

2015-05-16,0,0,141,False,Recommended,The first GTA I've actually enjoyed. Bacause of the first person camera viewpoint but mainly because they've tightened up the driving physics (although the traction is still like driving on snow (you can travel about 200 metres along the sand on a beached Jetski)) and included a driver's eye line camera viewpoint (although it does turn into a chest cam on vehicles like the quad bike).But all told a really really enjoyable experience. One of my fave games and one of the best I've played in a long long time. I've not enjoyed myself this much in an open world game since Mafia Lost Heaven.,Grand Theft Auto V

But no seriously the customer support over at the rockstar games website is horrible and the communication is minimal and mostly automated. The servers of GTA online are filled with hackers to the brim and there is nothing anyone can do to stop them. I regularly get shot with money teleported around and killed even when in passive mode. I have objects spawn in my body and stuff showing up in my garage.... the use of trainers and script hooks in this game is pathetic and laughable and almost every other game in the world with an online function prevents this type of bulls***. This game needs alot of work for the online sections and rockstar needs to start doing something about their horrible customer service.The game is great despite all of the above flaws and you should definately pick it up if you have some spare steam wallet currency. Everything works as it should 60 FPS gameplay (if your PC is worth around 1.2k+) free DLC every so often for the online multiplayer and the amount of content will keep you busy for well over 300+ hours.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,577,False,Recommended,Just... Awesome. It's a must have to play it even playing the Online version. Visuals are so realistic I can't believe what it'll be with a mod that enhances it even farther. I would recommend ALL my friends to buy and play this game it is worth it. This'll be the next Skyrim if mods ever come out I can't wait for those mods. Best game I've ever played in a really long time. The Storyline of GTA V is awesome and hilarious at the same time. GTA Online is even better when you play with your friends the downside of this is some players that are in the session may just come and murder you for no reason. I was able to defend myself back so many times. But due to me just killing random Civilians and hunting down bounties my Mental State in statistics considers me as a psychopath. But I think GTA Online is a better experience unless it comes down making an archenemy. GTA Online is great when you rank up through missions and heists and people won't be able to mess with you if you're ranked high enough.The game is inexplainable in general. In GTA Online I just blow stuff up 360 no scope Players that tries to kill me and make Los Santos my World.11/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-29,0,0,145,False,Not Recommended,So I assume you're reading this because you're playing with the thought to buy the game. You want to play around with all the cool mods that make you a drag racer police officer or Thomas the Tankengine in Singleplayer and then head over to the Multiplayer to race against your friends in supercars and compete in challenging deathmatches right?Forget it.To the Singleplayer Mods used to be possible and they enhanced the game in a great way only now the publisher of GTA 5 sent out a Cease and Desist to mod developers threatening to sue them if they don't stop producing mods. So why did they do it? I hear you asking. Let's first head to the Multiplayer Rockstar offers ingame purchases where you exchange your real money for a fake currency. And this is where Rockstar makes most of its money. GTA Online features a bride range of cars that are unattainable through playing the Online mode since they cost tens of millions (usual payout for a race 5.000$) these cars are completely overpowered. So don't expect to win anything if you just buy the game you need around 50$ (of your real life money of course) for a decent car and another 50$ to upgrade it. Then you probably use it for a month until the next DLC is announced featuring an even better car that is even more expensive.But what does that have to do with GTA's publisher sueing mod developers? Well Rockstar and Take Two didn't like that a modded Singleplayer used to be much more fun then their very own Multiplayer. Why would players bother with their Multiplayer? Why would they spend their real life money on horrendously expensive cars if they can try out way more interesting ones in the Singleplayer? Well money must sure be honey in the rich publisher's game.,Grand Theft Auto V

The CEO of T2 has said that he doesn't think they're ""making enough money"" off GTAV now to put that in perspective it's one of the top five best selling games of all time and still sells at 40 so it is by far the highest grossing game ever made.(T2 is the parent company of Rockstar)EDIT 2 T2 recently announced that with future games they're going to heavily increase the amount of micro transactions. Seeing as I have no way of spreading this info because GTA6 doesn't exist yet I just thought I'd let you know. Oh and also this game has become a pathetic grind with each update as things are more and more expensive for no good reason other than to encourage the purchase of Shark Cards.

Rockstar baffled finally came back and said that it must be because I am on Windows 10 because everyone else who is having this issue also has Windows 10. If the problem is Windows 10 shame on them. Every game I play upgraded to windows 10 MONTHS AGO except GTA V. Horrible company never buy this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-02,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game on the Xbox 360 and on the Xbox One. I was one of the first people to connect to GTA Online on Xbox One the moment it launched. I did enjoy the game very much on Xbox platforms.I recently purchased GTA V on PC (Steam) for $30 and I was very happy at first. The single player has better graphics and the framerate is smooth with my i5 4690k and 1050 ti but THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE IS EXTREMELY FLAWED.The amount of hackers and modded accounts on GTA ONLINE (STEAM) is completely unacceptable I have encountered a hacker or modded account on every day I have played for two weeks going. And today Saturday September 2 I have encountered over 10 hacked accounts during my 2 1/2 hours of gameplay today. This is completely unnacceptable I am a very good player but against a hacker with modded levels and weapons it is not a fair fight. Although I do find it quite enertaining that unless the hacker is using infinite health that I will usually still school them with my low level character weapons and vehicles.The report function is probably like most games abused to hell and against players that have not actually done anything wrong. I really hope that Rockstar gets it together but I know it's not going to happen.I sent Rockstar an email requesting a full refund of $30 for the game with continued access to the game not this t where Steam removes the game from my account.

The online experience whilst I did some cool stuff I must say I was very disappointed the missions lack any real depth. The single player version has a fairly good storyline some good missions and actually isnt bad. The one thing that really is missing is being able to steal cars and sell them like noones business you cant do that in single player unless its part of the mission to do that (I really dont understand that at all!!!). I mean for me that was the thing that made grand theft auto truely awesome so for me whilst this has some good bits its pretty mediocre and not worth more than 10 15 in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

I found the way how to enjoy online DON'T focus on the bank balance. Just dont the game is about having fun. Not on having the biggest cash! First fun and if the fun pays (mostly it does) then its good. And i also like(d) the story mode. When its hit 100% you cant really do something fun anymore. You are just sitting there with 20 mil in your hands and you cant do anything. There is where the online mode comes in hand! Cons Its hard to gain money in online mode. I personnely think the community is far from good the only thing you SEE is 10 year old that stole moms credit's card. ( And they just fly around in that one fliying car and they grief you every second. When the story mode is done there is almost nothing to do in ofline. The combat feels pretty hard out of place i think. Long loading screen and if you AFK for a sec you get kicked PLS ficks rockstar! Pro's Driving and cars are very ncie! You can customise a lot in your car and every car feels different and fun. The story mode is very fun.

If you enter the online game or switch session you basically have over 3 4 chance to get a lobby with a hacker.Even if your not hacking or modding yourself you can get banned for being in lobby with a hacker.Reporting a hacker doesn't help.Rockstar's client support doesn't really want to help you with any kind of issues. They don't even have a visible button to create a petiton on their website. Most of their answers are pure copy paste from already visible info on their page.The game STILL has memory leak problems that some people experience even on high end PC and some don't experience on low end.The updates require you a lot of in game currency to buy new stuff or anything while the payouts from anything is really small.

2016-06-27,0,0,57,False,Recommended,Love GTA V campaign but hate that rockstar clearly cares more about making money easy with the online mode then it does the campaign. Don't get me wrong online mode is great for those who like that it but GTA was became popular for its campaigns alone and so the campaigns deserves just as much support as online play does and i feel they surely could have added more DLC for it but didn't because they wanted to focus more on online mode instead of having to provide more content for campaign and its a shame in my opinion for such an epic GTA title. Having said that if you a fan of GTA games you will still love GTA V regardless of my one complaint above as its still a great game no matter what platform you play it on as i own on PC and consoles so i have to recommend the game regardless of that one issue i have with game and rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,Do not buy this game. Why? Two reasons GTA Online and Take Two's anti modding stance.GTA Online is completely awful. It has ceased being fun and has devolved into a grindfest filled with hackers as everything is stupidly expensive. Not to mention Shark Cards are stupidly overpriced for how much value you get out of them.As for the other thing Take Two recently shut down all modding for GTAV despite Rockstar saying that modding is okay. Do not buy this or any of Take Two's games.EDIT Another factor for this negative review is a new weapon that was added in the Gunrunning update The Explosive Rounds attachment for the Heavy Sniper. This turns the sniper rifle into a Railgun that one shots cars and players on foot and two shots planes. You don't even need to hit them since it's an explosion radius so you just need to hit near them. It's R8 Revolver level of broken and has made the game pay to win.,Grand Theft Auto V

This making the overall team experience amazing when playing heists with friends or a bunch of randoms.Character customization isn't huge but there are some options appearance wise when you first select to create a character basically it's just two sliders inbetween genetics from the parents but otherwise the clothes are abit out dated apart from the croptops. TBH Would be nice if there was more dress options or hair style options Ongoing to car customization New cars are constantly being added into the game but some are often released too early so they take the car down from the game causing it to disappear never happened to me but rumours . You can also add some mad rims spoilers skirts and neon kits for the car to make the ultimate ricer Ricer Good Some of the ""pearl"" touch paint is beautiful when mixed ontop of the right colour but you could just get a metallic paint job instead of all that if your not too bothered with how the paint is.Cons Some modders can be annoying but this is rare by annoying I mean freezing people for no reason and etc. which is avoidable just by going into another lobby so it doesn't affect the gameplay too much.Once again would like more options that are new.overall Sexy game would recommend.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-23,0,0,201,False,Recommended,IntroductionWhether you are purchasing GTAV for single player or online the most fun to be had in GTAV comes mostly from free roam breaking away from the various missions and modes to enjoy the world GTAV have to offer without worrying about the context of its plot. If you're still contemplating on whether to buy GTAV i will be highlighting significant pros and cons below. On a side note don't let the possibility of false ban deter you from playing GTAV. happens but you'll mostly be fine as long as you stay away from hacks and mods.Cons Long online loading screen (Ranging from 2 5minutes) Occassional modders in public free roam mode (Extremely annoying. They can temporarily alter your character without your acknowledgement if they wish to) Overpriced vehicles reaching 3m. (You earn an average of 10 20k per heist setup. But to be honest 1 kuruma is all you need) Cloud save errors once in a while. (Causes you to be unable to play online mode. If you encounter this look up for quickfix on google) Horrible support from Rockstar. (I've never actually submitted a support ticket but this is what most GTAV player feels) Having multiple expensive high end apartment is useless apart from the extra garage space. Repetitive online gameplays. (Grind heist non stop &gt Spend &gt Repeat because heist generates money fastest) Annoying free roam player killers. (Go passive mode to avoid them)Pros Amazing pacing of story and character development. Superb character customization. (I'm not kidding) Great all round control Stunning scenary Extremely impressive single player. (The single player alone is enough reason for you to buy GTAV)Value For Money?Yes definitely.ConclusionAll in all the game isn't as bad as what the negative reviews are saying. It should minimally provide you 100hours of immersive online gameplay and single player gameplay respectively.Overall Score77/100 (Pretty Mind Blowing),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,255,False,Not Recommended,Mods were like 60% of the game. They know that Open IV had nothing to do with online hackers and they were not ashamed to lie to us with straight face about this. GTA online is boring frustrating grindy piece of game that forces players to spend irl cash on in game currency since the ingame payouts are pretty much non existent compared to what the released content costs. Take2 and R have figured that mods are about 10 billion times better than their lazy cashgrab GTAO can ever be with its skewed up anti consumer business model (i.e. shark cards). Therefore they had to shut the mods down just to get people to play GTAO and buy shark cards.Imo tho they are shooting themselves in the leg in the long term. R had reputation of beeing one of the last really good and honest big companies in the gaming industry but they showed their true colours. They are no better than likes of EA Activision Ubisoft and all the others. Just a bunch of cashgrabing walking suits. But at the end of the day its gamer s fault. We cant fault a company for wanting to make more money. We are feeding them billions for their lazy overhyped and overpriced online DLC s and even when they do something like this there is an army of mindless fanboys to defend them. No wonder they think they can bend us over at their will.There is only one thing we can do to reverse this the only thing they will ever listen to their wallets. STOP feeding them cash stop buying shark cards it ruined GTAO and now it ruined mods too. And dont buy their games cancel the pre orders. Hit them where it hurts them.

2016-09-12,0,0,226,False,Recommended,This is a GTA main title.. that should say enough. This is an awesome game and it is amazingly ported to PC especially compared to 4. Rockstar stepped their game up for this port and it was working right out of the box for me. The 3 main characters are all likable in their individual ways and make for a really interesting story. Switching between all of them makes for a fun and unique gameplay experience since each character has a special ability that they can utilize in different situations. The world map is really big and has a lot of things to do and find even though it doesn't sprawl across the entire state like San Andreas did. Recommended to anyone who likes open world games or anyone who has played previous GTA games. The graphics look really great and there are mods online that allow you to crank them up even higher. The gameplay is also great it feels engaging and always keeps you finding more things to do especially if you play GTA Online. I recommend using a controller to play since driving is much cleaner with one but mouse and keyboard work fine as well.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,163,False,Recommended,"I delayed my review because I didn't want to review a game which I had only played for a few hours. This is all MY opinion and experiences with the game others may differ.1. PerformanceIn my 40+ hours of playing the game at max settings with a EVGA GeForce GTX 980 SC I have been able to run at 60 FPS with drops to 50 every once in a while when either in the middle of the city or around some parts of Trevors area. If I were to lower some settings which I have tested I would have a constant 60 FPS however the drops don't bother me that much. Other people have had issues with performance with the game and to my knowledge it seems to be random and not a certain combination between hardware. The only problem I have had with the games performance was crashing now and then which has since been fixed for me in the latest patch.2. GraphicsThe game is beautiful. The detail in the game is amazing in my opinion. I have had issues with textures loading slowly roads becoming invisible and textures popping in but this will hopefully be fixed in future patches and luckily it doesn't happen that often for me to get frustrated with it. Overall the graphics are great and this is how GTA should look.3. ControlsThis game has amazing KB/M optimization. Since it was launched on Tuesday I have had my Xbox 360 controller plugged in and next to my keyboard and since then I have picked it up once and that was when I was doing a mission where I had to fly and I didn't have time to learn the controls since then I have learnt all of the controls for flying driving and walking and they feel great. People are complaining with the controls for flying with the numpad but I think it works great yeah it's not as good as games like Battlefield but it is playable and there is always the option to have the Xbox controller plugged in and you can pick it up and start using it without having to change any settings.4. OnlineThis is probably where most people will get gametime out of. After completing the singleplayer there is so much to do in the Online that gives even more hours. The online is great. There is text and voice chat for in the lobbies and when you're doing missions and heists I didn't play GTA IV online so I don't know if that had this but the sound quality for voice chat is very good and you can change settings which lowers the game volume when someone speaks which is very helpful. Missions and Heists are in my opinion the best part of Online. The Heists are fun yet hard. There are many Elite challenges to complete to get bonus cash from Heists which gives a lot of replayability. Rockstar have implemented the singleplayer characters you meet into Online to give you Missions to do for cash and RP (exp). There are so many things to buy Online that it would probably take quite a while to build up the cash to buy them all the bonus cash for pre ordering was definitely a big help for me. Overall I think Online is probably the most appealing part of GTA V for some people and I would personally spend 40 just for GTA Online.5. SingleplayerI will update this when I have fully complete the singleplayer.In my opinion GTA V on PC is the way it is meant to be played. 60 FPS great graphics great KB/M support and mods in the future. If you are on the fence of buying this I recommend it. Many friends have asked me if it is worth it and I have said ""If you are someone who buys one game a year this should be that one game.""10/10",Grand Theft Auto V

Practically the whole concept of GTA Online came from modding. Many of the things Rockstar used for the ingame TV content included mods from GTA IV. I suppose that this is their way to say thank you.

2017-06-15,0,0,112,False,Not Recommended,TLDR The online is not something I recommend unless you have way to much money to just throw away. The single player was good until they screwed over basically the whole modding community. I can't recommend gta V. Gta V is one of the top 5 best selling games of all time and it made about one billion dollars in its first three days. So it is an ok game and I like(ed) the single player because of all of the modability. But the online is honestly just a money generator and a bad one at that. They have dulled it down so it's just a grind where you can't realistically have fun unless you spend real money. It's just an excuse for micro transactions. But they still think that they don't make enough money so what they do is they ruin the single player so that they can force more people on to the multiplayer where they can make you spend even more money to have some fun. Their last move to ruin single player was to send a cease and desist to OpenIV which basically every mod is based on and makes them possible. This was obviously done only to send more people to the multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

D You can't get bored with him only if u are some kind of pacifist or something /.The most interesting part is when Michael Trevor and Frankiln meet...you'll have to save one guy from FIB and then....kidnap him...really nice... .And now the most saddest part is when you have to choose what will you do....kill Trevor ( ma best frend ) or Michael or...The Third Way....if u choose the third way....you will fight with Merryweather Security and kill Devin and snipe a FIB guy....nice...SOOO if u want action and guns/sex...GET THIS! Now multiplayer....FOR F*CK SAY....full of russians and hackers...for me it's funny...because i have money for shark cards so gg hydra.If u don't have money....play heists or jobs ( with hackers 20% sure so good luck dude ). So when u play multiplayer the principal thing is to kill everyone and don't trust anybody...but if u are a good sport u will have chances to be in session with ""good players""just like you!And now the ban sistem....don't worry about it...First/second ban are not permanent so go with hack!but the third is so...GG.The multiplayer is more funny with friends....how it feels to be in an insurgent pick up with ur friends?doesn't feel good?or playing in ceo...funny to!( except when a ni*ga with hydra comes and destroy ur import/export missions D ). In conclusion....if u are psycho or a f*ckin f*cker and hacker....or a rich ni*ga....get this game it will help you a lot....Oh and i forgot...don't get this if u have a s*itty wooden pc...with i5 6600k and GTX 1060 GAMING X i have 70 90 fps on ultra setting so...minimum i3 and gtx 950 D Now I have to talk about the new updates....It will be sooo funny with sooo many war cars or tanks or all teh new battle s*its.if you don't have at least an APC or Opressor...You are dead D It will cost you a lot of money but ...this is gta5....and now everybody attacks everybody and this is really f*ckin' fun...ez 2.51 K/D Ratio )) At least the new missions and heists are OK.But the ban system still S*CKS.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-13,1,2,326,False,Recommended,Well... I bought the game on the weekend it came out and only played online for my first 165ish hours. I decided a couple days ago that I should probably play the story at some point and now that I had a computer that could run it better than when I first bought it I set in to the story of GTA V. The story was so great that I stayed up really late and got up early to play this game as if it was a novel I couldn't put down. After playing through the entire story I felt like I got the 60 dollars I dropped on this game over a year ago without thinking about all the fun I had had previously with friends in the online mode. I would 100% recommend this game for the story alone and online is an amazing bonus in my opinion. Let's see how long it takes me until restart the story just to play it a couple more times!,Grand Theft Auto V

Either he is in a mostly black area or well you can figure it out for yourself. There's a reason there's more black folks in prisons by percentage. They are committing crime at a higher percentage rate than whites or hispanics. Blacks comprise about 15 17 % of the population. Hispanics about 30 35%. Whites are about 50 55%. (+/ 5 8%) I'm doing all this from memory so my numbers aren't perfect but they're close.Blacks commit around 45 55% of the crimes that are committed. I don't like what that sounds like but instead of making excuses for bad behaviors lets reduce the numbers. Cause the numbers tell the truth rather we like it or not.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-17,0,0,1243,False,Not Recommended,"Awesome game but like many of the reviews here I also have had massive trouble with Rockstar Support.I got the game in April of 2015 when it came out on PC. I wasn't able to run it on my computer until July 3rd when my Dad brought home a new processor for me to play with. After that I played it almost every day. It was fun and super addictive. Then one day I picked up modding. I lasted a couple of months without being banned until January earlier this year. i was banned for ten days. Ok fair I WAS modding. But after that I decided ""Ok well modding was fun but let's just play the game normally from now on."" So I did. The day I was unbanned I returned with my friends to GTA Online and played for a few hours. Then as we went to a private session to have a melee battle I was without reason banned again. I was randomly banned without a reason the exact same day as getting unbanned. I had to wait an additional 30 days to play again. I submitted a ticket to Rockstar Support and was given an automated reply. Then they ignored me for the remaining time period. After the thirty days had ended I continued to play until June when (About a week or two from the release of ""Further Adventures in Finance and Felony"") I was banned AGAIN. Permenantly and once again without reason. I have submitted three requests since my ban two months ago. The first two were ignored by the Support team and the third one was DELETED from their forums. As of now I'm condemned to Single Player while my friends are free to have fun with the new DLCs.Overall I would recommend the game. It's fun and addictive and there's tons to do.But at the same time with Rockstar's awful support team it almost isn't worth it.EDIT BTW I have maxed over 1000 hours on this game which goes to show just how much I liked it before my experience with R* Support.",Grand Theft Auto V

But only use mods if you intend to play in singleplayer mods online will get you banned. Also you need a decent pc to play it check the system requirements before you buy this game and make sure your pc can run it. Hope this review helped! DD,Grand Theft Auto V

EXPECT NO HELP OR OVERTURNS EVEN IF YOU DID NOT ACTUALLY CHEAT.ONLINE PLAY Broke in game wallet without buying shark cards broke real life wallet with bought shark cards.Everything is expensive.Grinding for money is not fun.Modding cars is a blast.Free roam with friends total fun but you play in a friends only server otherwise people will cheat and blow you up constantly when you mind your own business. Other players will find a way to get you to lose your cool by following you around and blowing up every car that you get into or own. If you own it you call your insurance company using the in game phone and hope you arent blown up at the same time unable to attack others because you are on the phone sometimes you have to waste time driving to an impound lot to retrieve it and other times it ends back up in your garage but then if you want to drive it again you call your mechanic and wait for it to get delivered or go to your garage for somebody else blows it up soon repeat cycle.*Learn what a shark card is and if it is against your style of play.*Expect to be broke in GTA Online without shark cards even when doing heists and robbing banks as everything is out of proportion expensive. *Unless you plan on living in GTA Online and have no life outside of it find repeating heists fun after you finish each heist the first time are happy when people quit mid heist (making each step of the final piece to heist missions where you have to start from the beginning again) a great time I would not recommend this for game for anything other than Campaign. Not to mention people causing all mayhem right at you when you are minding your own business mixed with hacking airplanes and dead bodies wrapped in plastic inside of your character or turning you into a boulder until you change servers which wastes time and which causes you to lose job points.EXPECT HACKING ON EVERY SERVER!EXPECT TO GET BANNED AT SOME POINT 3 TIMES AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED INTO ONLINE GAMEPLAY AGAIN (which has plenty of obvious hacking).

The cost per unit of fun is extremely low.I purposely waited till I reached Level 100 in Experience points before reviewing this fantastic game because I wanted to be sure to know it well. Learning it is like peeling an onion in that new modes of play are discovered by the player and are periodically added by the on going development team.There are three main reasons to spend time in this game including just hanging around with other players Gun playMusic (changes with time as new songs are added)Vehicles (mostly cars but also includes motorcycles planes helicopters boats of all sizes buses Class 1 trucks even a research submarine although that s the least interesting vehicle)I suggest working through the solo Game mode as it has a compelling story line as you work through the three main characters.Choose your Online avatar wisely as you ll be living with it for a long time.The only negative I experience is the rather lengthy login which requires that you also log into RockStar Games the developers of this extraordinary game. If you have difficulty in the first attempt to go online try going into a solo session. From there it will be easier to join another session with other players which will add to the unpredictability and fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,Not the greatest and most optimized port but definetly still functional. Single player is fun from what I have experienced and from what others tell me it continues to be enjoyable.The biggest downside to this game is the ONLINE experience is HORRIBLE. The servers are quite often laggy because you are connected to random people from around the world. This means you will constantly be connected to lobbies where many people are using voice chat in a language you don't know. The matchmaking systems is one of the slowest and least functional I have ever seen. Unless you have a dedicated group on friends I wouldn't recommend it. You will wait half an hour to get a full group and then one of them will leave halfway through a heist forcing you to start the whole process over. Additionally I have run in to a new experience where after several hours of gameplay GTA V online has failed to save some of my online data. This of course happened after I purchased a very expensive vehicle I saved several hours of in game money to purchase. The game managed to lose the data on my character level but still remembered that I had spent the money somehow. I LOST MY LEVEL and MY MONEY due to this error. Rockstar support was kind enough to refund me this money and was very fast and courteous about the Process so at the very least my experience with rockstar support was very good.Pros Great single player Decent portCons Online servers laggy not localized Online matchmaking very time consuming and poorly functional Long load times for multiple processes (Load to get into online load to get into matchmaking load to boot up heist all of this usually followed by a lengthy in mission trip which can result in an hour from boot up of the game to the first sign of any actual gameplay)At the time I am updating this review Rockstar has fixed some issues and support was very helpful but the online matchmaking is still atrocious.

There are games with way better online support and banning systems where you can appeal bans and report people more effectively. What doesn't help is the overall community and its Hackers/Trolls plus players incessant begging for money and the toxic community that this game has created. As the anti cheat system goes it isn't good as there are countless cheaters online. They say that with every update that they bring out that there will be no more cheaters but every update halts them for only a few days. This is one of the replies I received after reporting three cheaters at once ""To keep the gameplay environment as fair as possible for legitimate players we routinely do sweeps to separate out cheaters and modders and to reverse any illegitimate transactions. These sweeps are based on in game automated detection examination of suspicious gameplay statistics and also manually reviewed evidence submitted by the Community. If you were not engaged in any willful cheating or exploiting yourself you do not need to worry about getting caught up in our work to separate out cheaters from the rest of the population. If you have any other issues please let us know. "" My thoughts when I read this was what routine sweeps? And that what I summited was evidence to help make the game fair but maybe that's just me.

2015-04-24,0,0,118,False,Recommended,I highly recommend getting GTA V on PC whether you have played any of the previous console releases of it or not. GTA V on PC is by far the definitive edition and the definitive experience.Gameplay is smooth and highly enjoyable load times and character swaps are relatively quick even though I personally have the game installed on an HDD. Shooting in first person view is not as fluid as you would expect from a dedicated PC fps but is nonetheless very nice to control with a mouse.Also included exclusively in the PC version of GTA V is the sufficiently capable Rockstar Editor/Director mode which allows you to make short films and machinima. Even though this isn't something I'd normally be interested in I have already spent a few hours messing around with it's features.All signs of a great PC release are present there are wide variety of options including settings for lower end PC's which allows the game to scale very well and cater to many different rigs. You should have no problem running at 60fps on nearly any PC after tweaking a few settings.For me it was definitely worth buying at full price but if you're not sure pick it up when a sale comes around and as long as you love the GTA formula you're not going to be disappointed with this title.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-08,0,0,192,False,Recommended,If you are interested in the online of the game I would recommend you only buy if you have at least one friend in it. There are a lot of hackers (or scripters if you prefer) in the free roam and the waiting period for people to join is considerable depending on the job you are trying to do. However most of the time the hackers won't disturb you so much that is impossible to play specially if you are just doing jobs and considering the passive mode. Sometimes though it's really annoying and it's something rockstar isn't close to solve just yet.Take those problems out it's a very fun experience the graphics are great the optimization is way better than most games you see around. Gameplay is swell and you have a lot of customization. And maybe one of the best things so far ALL the DLC's are free. ALL of them. It's very rare to see a game that put so many updates as GTA has with this many content without charging for them. For that alone this games deserves a thumbs up.About the offline this game is more than what i'd expect for a GTA.

2016-01-30,0,0,194,False,Recommended,I also made a video review https //www.youtube.com/watch?v AC4C6G84E5QGrand Theft Auto VSingleplayer PROS In game tips and hints saved me from being in so many of the typical frustrating and confusing points that I get stuck at in most games. Characters have very unique and distinct personalities absolutely blow away the characters seen in other games. Tons of good music and different genres to listen to on well made fake radio stations. Handheld style scenes looks very good. All around the cut scenes are quite cinematic and look great. No cutting corners on voice actors everyone sounds very unique and very convincing. Weather looks and sounds good. Phone mechanics are still easy to use and server as a great tool. Incredibly well done story overall one of the best I have ever experienced. Cash money. Tons of hilarious satires and societal criticisms thrown into the game. Rockstar is not afraid to be a true savage. Very in depth vehicle customization that allows you to essentially create your dream car. Combat is very well done always very exciting and fast paced while still requiring you to be a decent player.CONS First person POV is good for nothing at all it was probably the largest failure in the game. Graphics don't always hold up to expectation particularly large fires and some facial animations. Flying is incredibly hard to get used to on keyboard. The game starts out very slow the first 4 hours or so feel a little boring and hard to get into.Multiplayer PROS Not many games can compete with the amount of fun you can have while playing with friends in GTA V online. Tons of cool heists and gamemodes that will keep you entertained and wanting more for a very long time. Just wandering and driving around can have a lasting fun effect for a very long time. Tons of character and vehicle customization. You are forced to level up to buy many things which may seem very generic but surprisingly is works well and keeps people wanting to work towards their next level.CONS There are so many hackers online in this game it is absolutely ridiculous and Rockstar needs to crackdown on people. Many heists and gamemodes require very specific amounts of players which is very inconvenient and annoying when you do not have the right amount of players with you. Why must every big game developer try to make the next steam? Social Club is just dumb.

EVERYONE INVOLVED SHOULD DIE IN A FIRE!I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNLESS YOU USE MODS First I have to say that on its own its hard to recommend this game. The single player while fun is just too over the top and is a huge step down from the incredible story we were a part of in 4. The multiplayer is a mess with the heart of the problem lying in a slimy pay2win system because making over 1 billion in sales just wasnt enough... There are several more reasons I think rockstar absolutely failed with this mp but I dont want to write a book. With those nagging nitpicks out fo the way the world itself is incredible. Now a sandbox on its own isn't enough make a game fun. However with mods namely LSPDFR this becomes one of the greatest most infinitely fun games I think I've ever played and I'm a huge fan of games that dont ""end"". For instance ArmA series or Mount and Blade Elder Scrolls series etc. I'll admit the process to mod this game for lspdfr is tedious and somewhat challenging but it is ultimately worth it. Ripping around Las santos responding to gang violence pulling hummer drivers over chasing a meth head through the mountians.... Crime is fun but this game almost feels like it was intended to become a police sim. So theres my lspdfr fanboy 2 centsSo in conclusion I'd give the BASE game a 4/10 for SP feeling like a d list action script and MP being a pay2win rip off of PAYDAY.As a platform for mods however I give them 9.5/10 only losing points for seemingly going out of their way to make the game dificult to mod.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-08,0,0,81,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V plays very similarly to it's predecessors in single player albeit with some very noticeable &amp welcome improvements first person is now an option and vehicles have reasonably well detailed interiors the physics engine is quite detailed and vehicle handling is for the most part excellent visuals are an order of magnitude better than IV.If all that you want is a sexier version of GTA IV with a new map this game will serve your needs. Personally I was expecting better.Typical to every other GTA game single player content is gated behind story progression (though thank goodness areas of the map aren't arbitrarily blocked off until certain plot milestones are reached. We're finally beyond that). I've never enjoyed this model as the plot writing is usually bad (no exception here) and the mission design is mostly mediocre (Vice City remains the king of the franchise in this department). Heists are interesting but few and far between and some of them feel almost like MMO wave grinds. I've also never personally enjoyed GTA's hyper cynicism though these things will be a matter of taste. San Andreas remains the king of interactivity for the franchise a number of vehicles in GTA V are simply set decoration and the number of activities to partake in is roughly equivalent to GTA IV. I'm not terrible bent out of shape about this as I've always found the mini games to be a little lacking anyway. Police chases are very similar to IV. I appreciate the ability to lose the police but the lack of diversity among police units since Vice City still hurts (cars &gt SUVs / Helicopters &gt Vans / FBI SUVs). The days of high performance FBI cars PI sports cars rapelling special forces and tanks / army trucks seem to be behind us alas. The port quality is mediocre. Switching between different texture quality levels requires a reboot of the game as does any resolution change. This can be a pain as the initial loading of the game takes quite a bit of time. If you're running a muxless laptop set up (almost every modern gaming laptop is muxless) with an AMD card you'll have to run a third party hotfix alongside the game to get it running needless to say this feels like an oversight on Rockstar's end. Performance is okay and options are pretty barebones (on the plus side it gives you rough indicator in the options screen of what performance you can expect given the options you've selected). FoV is terrible and can't really be adjusted to an appropriate level. There are also the typical memory leak and CTD bugs that by now PC users have come to just begrudingly expect from any port.It's fine but disappointing for a product that was in development for so long.So what of GTA Online? If you're like me you bought the game just for this. Much better progression system personal avatar no story nonsense no milestone gated content this sounded pretty good to me. GTA Online is engaging and there are moments of fun to be had but there are so many horrific design decisions that I simply couldn't recommend it to anyone. The first thing to be said is that there's an element of pay to win here you may purchase 'Shark Cards' from Rockstar using real currency and these provide you with in game money for buying cars and weapons. In game money is hard to come by if you're just running missions yet character ranks which put the high end weaponry and vehicle upgrades behind a progression curve aren't which means player who purchase Shark Cards will have access to rocket launchers sticky bombs armored vehicles heavy body armor etc while anyone who just wants to play the game they already sunk 50 70 dollars on will be stuck with the lighter weapons &amp unmodded vehicles.You cannot hijack and keep super cars as a personal vehicle (you CAN just hijack them certainly and the spawn rates seem reasonable but you can't mod anything unless it's your personal vehicle can't take anything expect a PV on missions etc) you have to buy them with in game currency. Again this seems like a design decision intended to sell Shark Cards (the game even refers to super cars as 'premium vehicles'). Los Santos Airport in GTA Online is completely bereft of flyable vehicles. They simply don't spawn in. If you enjoy flying civilian prop planes or lear jets around you're SoL until you scrape together enough cash to buy a personal hangar &amp plane (or again unless you're willng to pay for Shark Cards). Compounding the above nonsense are two critical elements the game makes no effort at all to segregate the player population according to rank &amp available money / assets and the anti griefing option in the game is simply pants on head stupid. Putting griefers aside for the moment the structure of each mission is often this drive from A to B with some exposition along the way to explain your objectives. Once you get to B mission progression is triggered (often there is a shoot out of some description followed by a chase sequence of some description). When you're playing missions with players who have fully upgraded and armored super cars which is most of the time you will not have much fun &amp will feel like you're dead weight. Upgraded super cars move at least two orders of magnitude faster than the fastest possible stock starting vehicle handle as if they're magnetized to the road and are immune to small arms fire. On the plus side hey you'll get some mission money at the end anyway even if your teammates have blown through the entire thing by the time you've got from point A to point B. These problems are magnified with Heist and Set Up jobs which require everyone to get to the trigger locations before they progress. You will really feel like you're holding everyone back if you try to drive yourself and you'll otherwise just feel like someone along for the ride if you take the 'better' option of jumping into a passenger seat of your teammates' super car. It also makes the racing missions untenable racing missions that you are required to win by the way to unlock the engine upgrades necessary to compete against players who already have them. &gt .&lt So now let's talk about griefing. Griefing with this system is trivial. Low level players stand no chance against high level players and once killed you are spawn within 30 seconds or so driving time from your killer (often without even having access to the road and thus hijackable vehicles. Not that it would matter anyway).The implemented solution for this problem is 'passive mode' enabling it makes you tranparent to other players immune to weapons fire from them and immune to collisions with them (this comes at the cost of functionality on your end you cannot access any weapons even just to use them against NPCs. Passive mode is automatically disabled when you go on missions as a result and is not re enabled when you exit a mission and because it's buried in the escape menu UI you can often be killed before you have a chance to re enable it). While in passive mode however you're still vulnerable to NPC attacks including incidental fire from police units attempting to engage griefers. A griefer in an armored vehicle which are immune to police bullets &amp ramming damage can abuse this by simply driving over to you and killing you with police fire over and over again. This is reportable behavior but sending a report will not fix a session where this is happening to you and the report function is also buried in the damn escape UI. A decent griefer could easily kill you over and over before you can even access the menu to report them and then leave the session once they get bored (you can only report players so long as they're in the current session and Rockstar supports demands 'concrete proof' like video capture if you go to the trouble of sending an e mail report).It's a mess.,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are some of the best I've seen for an open world game. Simply beautiful car design 'MWAH' 'MWAH'. The realistic and dynamic city and it's inhabitants. The rocky mountains in the North harbouring all sorts of wildlife from deer and rabbits to cougars and coyotes. The deep blue sea you can go and explore as well as swim underwater with scuba gear anytime you want. The immense array of customisation items and weapons. This list can honestly go on forever.Everyone who had a hand in designing this immense and engaging world deserves a hefty raise and a pat on the back. Everyone except.....THAT ONE WHO DESIGNED GTA ONLINE'S TERRIBLE INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU!If you want to buy this game for online forget it. Just forget it. I feel sorry for everyone who bought this game in the sales after waiting so long for a discount. You just know there is that one guy who saved his money to finally buy this game and play it and this is the pile of he receives. Absolutely ing disgusting R*. Shame on you.So what is wrong with GTA Online I hear you ask? Cheaters. Those bastard cheaters. You cannot go into a single ing lobby without some blowing everyone up and pinning the blame on some random player making it rain and breaking the economy by straight up spawning millions upon millions of dollars automatically ejecting you out of your own damn car spawning objects like UFOs ferris wheels and massive rocks right in front of you setting fire to any player they want importing weapons like the rail gun into MP and killing people with it etc. etc. etc.This list could go on and on and on. What are R* doing about it though? JACK THAT'S WHAT. They got your money now so who gives a rat's right? that one guy who worked hard and saved up to buy the game. everyone who wants to play the game without someone setting fire to their hair every 5 seconds. Y'ALL AND DEAL WITH IT IS R*'S ANSWER TO HACKERS. Do not buy this game unless there is a heavy heavy heavy heavy heavy discount or unless you want to play single player only which is still the only reason I play this game.

You can even be banned for Friends only servers when using mods!Rockstar has blown a very good release seven years later. It seems almost enept at combating hackers which always seem to be on all online servers.Want to do a private server with friends to avoid the online S**t Show? You can do that. BUT.....Heist missions are not available for local servers only online. This means that as you finish a big hiest with no online players close enough to stop you all of a sudden a hacker on the online server will have a surprise for you ) Search 'GTA V Online Hacking' before you buy for online mode. It's not much to do on friend only servers and it gets boring quickly. I usually find killer clowns are teleported to me on missions who are invincible then they kill me. How about when hackers use a UFO that teleports above you and holds you captive? Nothing you can do. Lets not forget 'Insta Explode' where the server hacker(s) explodes you so many times your game crashes. I've seen nothing but pleas from the community to address the hacking issue and fix vairous graphic and performace issues. Rockstar has been mute to me personally (sent email and screenshots) and players who were loving the games initial release (Which was also bogged with Server Crashes due to overload). RS's inabilty to patch around OpenV Editting software to close the hacking issue is mind numbing though. Permabans seem not to work either. One hacker told me he remembered me trolled me the whole match. I lost thousands of dollars online to people like him. Everytime I try to have hope something is done and reinstall it I'm presented with the same unpatched issues that has been going on now over four years.SEVEN years later Why are there no New 'Official' Map(s) DLC???? No new maps or guns were introduced since release. They give you cars for days for DLC but they cost too much ingame money or hackers blow it up the minute you can afford it........Pay $19.99 and get a Shark Card ingame! Wait! They go up in price too! Too repetative after about 3 hours of play for about a month straight. Rockstar.....come on man.Thumbs down.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-26,0,0,511,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure video game with a single player and multiplayer mode. Sinlge player is great while multiplayer is terrible.At first I loved GTA online it was fun and there so many new things to do but now online has gone downhill and by downhill I mean hackers keep playing and destroying the game while innocent players (like me) getting banned PERMANENTLY. in addition to all this if you even try to contact R* support you will get nowhere. This leads me to my next point R* support is the worst thing you will come across. There is no way you can unbanned if you try to contact them here let me put it this way trying to get unbanned via R* support is like trying not to encounter a modder/hacker in your lobby it's impossible but possible.But minus modders/hackers and R* support the game offers incredible things aswell. Sinlge player is such a great aspect of GTA it has an amazing campaign which goes on for so long single player allows you add third party mods which are stunning and fun at first until you log onto online and get banned. You have three main characters to control with different missions and backgrounds of their lives.Lastly Online. GTA online is spectacular with friends because you can do races heists and so much more but if you have no friends who play online it can be a bit grindy trying to get the new cars and apartments which are extremely expensive like 2mill per car and up to 5mill for a CEO garage. since it can be a bit grindy and some people can be impatient they all go to modders and ask for money then all of a sudden money bags come raining from the sky and giving you like 2k per drop (do not ever pick up money bags) also the loading screens needs to improved it takes like 2mins to be load into online. In online I had reached rank 153 I had everything and had done everything so I was usually mucking around in online or helping friends. But today I got an email saying I was permanently banned I had no mods installed at all not even in single player but as the tradition continues R* bans innocent players during the holidays.Overall Grand Theft Auto V is an amazing game for single player which has countless things you can do in it. On the other hand online needs to be improved like the banning prices and loading screens.Single player 8.5/10Online 6/10 14.5/20 72.5%,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-12,0,0,848,False,Recommended,A great game that has plenty of content and stupidity. An example is when my friend and I pretended to be the KGB and secretly tried to eliminate people which somehow ended up in our discreet Mercedes looking shitboxes getting stuck in a subway and explode for no apparent reason. Very fun game and would definetly reccomend. However some part of the community is toxic but most is fine. Story mode is also great.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-05-25,0,0,1222,False,Not Recommended,The Grand Theft Auto Online part of the game is horrendous. The game makes you grind with no real incentive as the money you get from it can be gone in seconds adding little value to what you earn and your hours will feel wasted to get one thing for example a 5 million dollar car which is no better than the other cars you can buy except for a parachute and jump mechanic and they are much cheaper and you could just buy the Hydra instead as a means of transport and it is cheaper and arguably more deadly.What bugs me however is with every little update to Online singleplayer has been affected by adding content and ruining the immersiveness especially during cutscenes. For example scopes from snipers during cutscenes may appear transparent or flicker in and out of the scene and the magazines of certain guns will appear missing due to more magazine types added to the Online mode. Sometimes you can even get these magazines accidentally even though they are not purchasable in Ammunation as they can appear on your character's loadout for some players.Some cutscenes in singleplayer also suffer from optimisation issues even the best of systems show themselves choking to under 40fps at times during certain ones. The V Sync also is terrible don't use it it's not worth it stick to NVidia's Fast Sync (found in NVidia control panel on 9xx or 1xxx series) or AMD's FreeSync or NVidia's GSync. It is more than worth keeping off though as framerates vary wildly for many because of the difference in population and grass between the city Los Santos International Airport and Sandy Shores.The story itself has a lot of depth to it a lot of the things you can find out about the three characters are hinted at vaguely or found in side missions relating to their pasts and almost everything finds itself explained albeit in a hidden way and each character sort of resembles in ways each type of Grand Theft Auto game we have seen in the past. However one of the endings (B) which I won't spoil seems slightly out of character and ending A and C seem to make more sense however ending C to some could be considered a deus ex machina during a hopeless time in the story whether this type of ending is good is up to the user.The three characters I mentioned in the paragraph detailing some of the story's features come into play through a character switching system where you hold the ALT key and you can switch to control any three of them one resembling the classic gangster (similar to San Andreas in ways) another resembling the city crook doing bigger jobs and the third being an unhinged psychopath who uses people and also dares to do the unthinkable that being suicidal missions which appear a lot during the singleplayer. The switch between the characters is fluid and fast which I assume depends on hardware. Another thing to note is the other HD Universe game GTA IV is a lot different having a lot more car sway and the cars are much slower however I prefer V's physics as it is in a way is a balance between San Andreas and IV but is more like the former.An issue which wasn't really present in the car mechanics for the previous games is that your car in this game feels like it has a lot less mass it can't push other cars easily and your car feels very light with the smallest thing such as hitting the curb or a stop sign and breaking it causing it to spin out occasionally and other cars (civilians) feel like they push you easily but yours cannot push them.I'm not sure there is a way to do so but if there is I recommend you disable the GTA Online updates so they don't ruin your experience with the singleplayer.Grand Theft Auto V (singleplayer) is a once in a generation game and you should try to get the singleplayer if not at a too high price as the depth and replayability is more than worth it there are also mods which you can try so you will never run out of things to do until the community really stops making them.24/06/2017 OpenIV is back and an update is readily available to those who have the singleplayer modding tool installed.,Grand Theft Auto V

The storymode is mediocre in comparison to GTA IV and it's DLCs as well as most other retro GTA games. It is a disappointing ending for one of the GTA IV DLC protagonists and it is something I think Rockstar did very wrong. Killing him off is not my complaint but rather not giving him more depth as a character in the game made it look quite lazy from the developers sides. Singleplayer overall however is quite a nice experience that is offered to players and it lives up to the standards in many perpects.

Put this game onto max settings at 1080p and you could almost be fooled into thinking it was real life except when someone starts to fight you when you 'accidently' steal their car. As I have said I have the PS3 and PS4 versions of this game. Yes they are good. For PS3 GTA looked amazing considering it was running on almost 10 year old hardware. GTA PS4 is a huge step up from PS3 but it couldn't hold a candle to what GTA PC has to offer. I have an i5 4690k 8GB RAM and a GTX 970 and at 1080p this game runs like butter well used to I'll get to that soon. It runs at around 50 60FPS completely maxed and with some settings turned down to high but most still on ultra it runs at a constant 60FPS most of the time much higher in some places well into the 100s.So I have raved about this game a lot mostly for good reason but as with anything there is a down side. Well 3 in my case. 1. Glitches This game has a huge amount of glitches sometimes for good reason say that it crashes every once in a while that is fine. I can only really speak for myself here but I have only ever crashed 3 times in GTA PC once when I was in a heist very near to the end might I add and that really me off once when I was just driving around and another time that another glitch happened. This was a more 'catastrophic' glitch. This is when my GTA character temporarily lost their entire garage(s). This was when the game was only a couple of days old and I sort of forgive it and it did give me everything back after a patch but that was still worrying/annoying when it happened. 2. Rockstar's business strategy There has been many reviews souley focused on the Steam sale situation. That if you want to read just look around the reviews and shall give you an idea of what it is all about. This is more of a general look over. I'm probably going to end up ranting so you might not want to read my rant just skip a bit. Ok the game was a extreme commercial success on launch on PS3/ Xbox 360 and I imagine it didn't do too badly on PS4/Xbox One and PC either yet they still include micro transactions. On a mobile game a free one especially micro transactions are far from good but turning (sadly) into the norm but a game that costs a big some of money whichever way you look at it new it was 40 50 on PS3/Xbox 360 around the same foor PS4/Xbox One and 40 for PC yet they still charge real money to get virtual money in a game that costs 50 sodding ! Furthermore they charge insane amounts of money for DLC vehicles just to get you to spend more real money $85K for a smart car? $120K for a Skyline Peugeot 504 Lada hybrid? $400K for a FWD Citroen? No. No Rockstar no. I'm going to end this rant here before I fill up the entire page. 3. (yes this is still going and I want to finish what I started) Graphical issues I get a crap ton of micro stuttering and it has only been going on since May start of June ish and I couldn't name the update it started on because 1 its hard 2 I've been writing this for almost an hour 3 I really CBA but it is still really annoying making the game almost un playable. I happens mostly online so that might be something to do with the internet but that's by the by.Ok let's rap this up. I'm sure most people have given up reading this and have fallen asleep I sure would of but if you have made it this far then well done you. This game is definately worth getting but if you already have it then don't bother unless you are really unhappy with the console versions graphically. If you haven't bought it yet on consoles or PC get it. It is an amazing game and with friends for amusment I have racked up over 1000 hours on all the versions. That is one thing I would recommend with this game at least 1 friend I would say optimally 4 just for missions and things like that and this game will last you a long while and you will have a huge amount of fun playing it. Anyway I'm off to play GTA with self radio the one main feature I use on PC. Thank you Youtube MP3. Thank you.9/10 me.",Grand Theft Auto V

However how many bad critics are due to the game IS bad? Gentlemen so far I've seen none. And it's for a good damn reason Bioshock Infinite has a good story (well yes it does)? pfft! The last of us Game of the decade? pfft!Ladies and horses we have a game that truly goes into the interest of a gamer and I'm not referring to a fancy list of needs such as ""artistic"" ""inspiring"" or any liberal crap like that. We have a game that along with Mortal Kombat has been the king of controversy a game that allow us to become mr. Hide. A game that enforce us to torture some guantanamo style.A well done game that allow us to fulfill the basic needs of senseless violence with tons of complete fun. I'm not talking about saints row I'm not talking about Skyrim I'm not talking about Hatred I'm not even talking about Postal. Damn I am talking about mother ing GTA5.Many games sells by its name and company legacy but end up being anual crap like Call of Duty or Assassins Creed. The people in Rockstar they love us they don't do crap in any sense of the word. They even take many years and delays (to anger of many) just to polish better the diamond. They even do the sacrifice to put a 2 year beta on Consoles just to make for us (The PC race) a pure sexual experience.Nevertheless many could not run it on day one. I could and I have kind of a crappy PC. (AMD FX6300 at 3.5 GHz 4Gb DDr3 windows 7m a cheap gigabyte motherboard and a GeForce GT 640). I can run it decently. And I can tell that even when I played the game with my Xbox 360.The story is good you get killed without reason in the multiplayer tons of stereotypes if our modern society 1 black 1 middle aged 1 sociopath and lots of hookers. Explore a satirical (yet accurate) representation of a rotten modern society where people is moved like cattle. Politicians and religions throw out everybody believes. New generations are driving everything to Technologies are beyond human control and drugs are the the fastest growing market.Huge sandbox map with tons of random things and extras. A large single player campaign with tons of extra an immersive role play in the multiplayer (with an actual history development) that makes you feel you are part of the game.Cars tanks dogs and drugs you have it all!",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-18,0,0,33,False,Recommended,Update Game is finally functional. In order to get it to work I had to completely reformat my hard drive and do a clean install. I guess that Rockstar can't manage to get through the same compatibility issues that even small indie developers have long since figured out. I'm changing my recommendation because this game is amazing but I am seriously unhappy about the issues that arose during this whole process. 5 days and still no fix. Even though the game was purchased through Steam you're redirected to the Rockstar Social club in order to play the game. Whenever social club is launched it crashes before you ever get into game. I've spent a week attempting every voodoo fix people have conjoured up and nothing works.The biggest kicker is that once *just once* I got a little bit further than an immediate crash when I tried loading the game in Steam offline mode but the Rockstar DRM then indicated that I couldn't log in because I had to log in at least once in online mode before I could get into the offline version ...which is impossible due to the crashes.5 GD days guys. I understand that this effects a fairly small minority of people but you would think that with billions of dollars made off this game that you would be able to get people to actually play the #$% thing within the first week of release.Congrats on out Ubisofting Ubisoft,Grand Theft Auto V

If you're buying for the singleplayer get it on sale if nothing else.Now I think you should dodge the multiplayer altogether. The number one reason being modders. They're in at least half of the sessions you join using free mods that anyone can get their hands on and of course this means there are people that abuse this. Just now for instance I was in a session with 2 abusing modders blowing everyone up constantly trapping them destroying their vehicles etc. One even threatened to reset levels though I'm not sure if they can do that or not. But my character suddenly became unplayable after being disconnected from that session so...This game has been out for years yet online modding is STILL an issue which probably means Rockstar has just stopped giving a damn and moved on to other things people modding in GTA is the least of their concerns. Will also be avoiding future Rockstar titles if this is how they treat their games now. But hey at least the single player is semi decent.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-01,0,0,126,False,Recommended,This is quite honestly one of the best games I have played in my entire gaming career. It's up there with Half Life 2 for me. I originally played it on the PS3 for around 30 or so hours but the technical experience was rather dull due to the limitations of the console. Being a huge GTA fan I couldn't wait for the PC version so I caved in and bought it. I didn't finish it on console so I was pleased to get the full experience as it was meant to be played on the superior platform. Seriously this is worth the price of admission and even more. Campaign side missions random quests in game entertainment etc. etc. etc. I put in over 60 hours before even touching multi player and that is an entirely new game altogether. Your $60 dollars is well spent here and even better if you manage to get it during a sale. I'm already starting a new game for a second play through so I can properly short the market make my $2.5 billion dollars (or more) and take part in several Strangers and Freaks missions that I missed but they strangely disappear if you complete the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can grind thousands of tedious and boring missions to make a mere morsel to buy a selection of items so expensive and vast you'll cry. Cars can be seen flying from rooftops around the city from one of the games scenic hackers. Don't worry! Theres atleast 4 per lobby. Have all the enjoyment this season as you try to load into a decent lobby of players staring at the clouds. Once your rich you should have a large selection of OP vehicles to choose from. Kill everyone who can't fight back and watch as the complaints roll in! Fly a plane for less than a minute and get shot down by an undodgable homing missile or become a living ornament as someone spawns a chirstmas tree on your head! You don't even need hacks to cheat like everyone else in this game just go passive mode seconds from certain death! LSPD will hunt and kill you till the end of the earth as you try to deathmatch other players and you can even respawn with them on you! Theres just no beating GTAV for this holiday!

I purchased this while using my backup laptop with very horrible stats and I decided to install the game on this PC just for the hell of it. Well whaddya know? It runs flawlessly on my crappy laptop! I am so excited to see how it'll run on my primary laptop which has far better stats. The Witcher 3 and GTA IV were games I played on my computer but the FPS was always subpar. In this game? I see almost no issues with the FPS. The graphics are not that great but they still have their stunning moments. This is just to anyone who feels apprehensive about buying this game because they have a mid level budget laptop. The backup laptop I am currently running failed every single MINIMUM requirement for this game but it's playing extremely smoothly! I am pleasantly surprised and so exhilirated by this. Thank you Rockstar for not forcing all of your gamers to have insanely high end gaming rigs. All developers should follow suit immediately. Amazes me that the Witcher 3 thought they should make their game only compatible with high end gaming rigs even though it literally means less profit for them. Most people do not have a high end laptop. therefore developers should always strive to pander to the majority. More profit! I am so happy to see that flagship games are finally beginning to see the light. Sleeping Dogs the Witcher 3 and etc all need to take notes from these awesome developers.

2017-01-18,0,0,258,False,Not Recommended,I want to be able to recommend this game as a whole but I just can't. The singleplayer is fine from what I've played of it. The issue is not with singleplayer. My issue and reason for not recommending it is the multiplayer/GTA Online side of things. I started playing right before Christmas 2016. During that initial time things were fairly fun. Modders didn't show up too often at least they weren't using their mods in any overt way. There was an active ban wave going on then. But after it stopped... I've spent hours lobby hopping to find a modder free lobby. And sometimes I couldn't find one. See the problem with running into modders isn't that they're giving out free money. It's that they also tend to do crazy game experience breaking things like spawning in clowns with miniguns all over the place (that when you kill get you an instant 3 star wanted level). Or dropping tanks on people. Or causing all of the above to spawn in your in game properties making it impossible to move.Since the ban wave ended it has been hell trying to enjoy the online side of the game. I've spent more time in multiplayer than I have spent playing the singleplayer storyline. If I do keep playing the game I'll likely only play the singleplayer side. Which really sucks since I did invest in a few shark cards to boost my way towards properties in multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-25,0,0,86,False,Not Recommended,It would be a great game if it weren't stuttering horribly ever since the update before last. Rockstar claimed to fix it but the game's still broken.

2015-07-25,0,0,320,False,Not Recommended,EDIT BE VERY AWARE YOU CANT PLAY THE GAME WITHOUT ONLINE MOST GAMES MENTION THIS BUT NOT GTA V IF YOU ARE OFFLINE YOU HAVE TO PLAY SINGLE PLAYER FROM THE START.

DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IF YOU GET IT ON SALE ITS A ROBERRY AT FULL PRICE.Original Review I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you've already played it on the console. Sure the textures look much better and you get a proper framerate but this game is so horribly short. Last I checked I was 80 hours into IV and still about halfway done with the story I finished the story in V in about 10 hours on my 360. I was really hoping that they would do more with the campaign and not just make it 10 hours of driving to get to a 5 minute firefight like the older games and they didnt they made it 10 hours of driving to get to a 1 minute firefight. The intro was seriously the most exciting combat segment. Theres no real feel of progressing as about an hour in you get a ton of money and Trevor starts loaded. Also this games a massive cash grab every time you're low on money and try to buy something they ask you to buy shark cards. Waste of time and money. Only buy this on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-18,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,With the insane costs of GTAO items I could never hope to actually get to experience all of the content of a game I bought and that really bothers me. As a solo player who doesn't really have anyone to play with making decent money is extremly difficult. Random heists take FOREVER to actually find players and then 70% of the time you get a noob on the team who keeps dying and ruining it for everyone.I came into the came too late to have enough cash to become a CEO when that DLC arrived which is how most people make their money now since heists are dead. (with the exception of the Pacific Standard heist which you can only get to after clearing the other heists. Which only adds to the MASSIVE wealth gap between players who were there at the begining and newer players) Since then things have only been getting more expensive to the point of absurdity. Even if I bought shark cards things are so expensive now that you're looking at spending anywhere for $10 $100 of real money for ONE count them ONE in game car or apartment/office. All I have to say to that is f**k you Rockstar.Maybe pick it up if the single player intrests you but even then only do it on a big sale because they haven't touched the story mode or added anything to it since the game was released more than 3 years ago. Other than that very specific cercumstance can't recomend.Gameplay 9/10Storyline 7/10Online interaction 5/10Buisness Ethics 3/10 (and only getting worse),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,674,False,Not Recommended,ok so i suppose i should give an ACTUAL reason to not play it now that the whole mod meme is over.As a man who has sunk over ONE THOUSAND hours into a grindfest MMO (see my review on TERA) I feel I have the authority to say that this grind is absolutely absurd. Especially when you re just starting off it's just one store robbery after another one mission after another endless tedium working towards the big goal of actually being able to make money via heists. The system is designed to push players into either a. buying shark cards or b. sinking a rediculous amount of time into the game. And the worst part is it's not even FUN unless you're playing with friends (and even then friends only make the NON GRIND portion of online tolerable). At least TERA keeps me entertained with decent combat and skimpy cosmetics.Buy this for the single player avoid multiplayer. Even then I still can't reccomend it.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story is super addicting and missions get progressively difficult as you progress. Even if you don't do the main missions there's side missions and random events. You can even customize the three main protagonists with set hairstyles and clothes. In multiplayer your character is fully customizable and starts with low stats that you can then build up to make gameplay easier. Money is a major asset as you need it to do pretty much anything buying weapons cars and property customizing yourself and making yourself stronger. There's so many ways to make money but grinding takes a lot of time. Many people resort to Shark Cards which are not worth it for the price. Hackers and Modders can get you banned dropping money bags on you. Rockstar Support is rumored to be pretty careless and their anti cheat sucks. A lot of their updates and DLCs are only targeted towards older players with more time and money. Lastly you need a really decent computer for this. As they update the game it gets much more laggier and the more lag there is the more likely that you'll disconnect constantly. I'd recommend this game to anyone but it doesn't seem like the type of game that anyone would play say 5 years from now.,Grand Theft Auto V

Instead of addings a semi functional anti cheat tool like EasyAntiCheat or VAC you attacks your own customers and fans...

I thought people on STeam had more standards than that.This review is solely for GTA Online not the main game.It's a great game. While Rockstar does exploit the customers (Some like me had a crashing bug you had to pay to get fixed!) but it's very fun otherwise. Sure there's billions of hackers online and they are trolls to every person they meet but has anyone noticed the ""Find New Session"" Button? Easy fix! Okay now for the downsides The summer sale forces you to buy the bundled game. I pre ordered it. Online is nigh impossible to play due to hackers on some servers. Hasn't been fixed. Some of the jobs like ""Caught Napping"" are tedious and annoying to play sometimes involving stuff like chasing enemies across a city and then NOT destroying their car but killing the driver. The hackers. They are such a problem I will mention them several times. Voice chat. For younger players they can hardly use it because if they use it they will get insults about their youth left and right with people acting FAR dumber than them. Have you even TRIED to put up with some of the people on GTA Online? One person I know went into passive mode stole a bus and trashed my (very expensive and non insured) Personal Vehicle! Aircraft controls. *Sighs* Aircraft Controls. I wasted 40 000 dollars to begin the Prison Break Heist and nobody joined ever. Meaning? It's THAT easy to waste 40 000 good dollars and get nothing in return. Which idiot decided that you should add a one way telescope to high end apartments on ONE side of the building. I mean seriously?You might think ""Why is he recommending this game then?""Upsides Beautiful open worlds. Nigh infinite customization. Great graphics even at MINIMUM settings. Easy weapon controls. The ability to team up with other players and take down a griefer or something like that is fantastic. Innovative bounty system. You set the bounty your enemy pays for what they've done. Simple but fun. Incredibly detailed missions which are TYPICALLY well designed. (Typically.) Oh no the cops are chasing me. Well I'll have to pull out my NO LEVEL REQUIRED HOMING LAUNCHER! The guns. The guns are amazing. Job Creator means I can make a capture job based on The Walking Dead. (But I think you should be able to add actors to other kinds of jobs too just to spice it up you know.

2017-06-16,0,0,56,False,Not Recommended,The story was great. The multiplayer was great. But then it got boring really fast with obvious attempts by Rockstar/take 2 to FORCE you to buy sharkcards as the multiplayer game modes do not award you with enough in game money (like they once did at release but it was nerfed) so even with constant additions to the online mode you cannot afford any of the new things without repeating/grinding boring old missions over and over again until it sucks out all the fun (or you give in and buy in game currency so you can have fun with the game again for 20 seconds). It is all up to you if you want to spent more money on a game you have already paid for but this game does now completly rely on it. It didnt orginally but the game has taken a dark turn in order to just grab money off you and you could have more fun in other games without paying so much. I started playing this game on xbox at release so I do have much more hours on this game than my profile suggests. In addition the new move to esentially ban all mods is a further step they have taken to force more people away from the single player and into the multiplayer so they have to spend more money,Grand Theft Auto V

The story keeps me interested in single player when I would otherwise spend all of my time on the awesome online part of the game. The game is not perfect however. Here are some pros and cons of Grand Theft Auto V.Pros Good portAwesome graphicsGood single player storyGreat gameplay awesome customization (even more so in GTA Online)Enormous world full of content. Los Santos is a satire of Los Angeles and Hollywood and the world is full of snide remarks toward various things in the modern America from politics to the economy to 50 Shades of Grey.In game radio has good musicMore content than original Xbox360 and PS3 versions including first person mode.Cons Holy DRM Batman! You have to be connected to the internet to even play the single player as the game must be authenticated through Rockstar servers.Frequent disconnects in GTA Online. Not as bad as launch on consoles but there are definitely still server issues to be ironed out.8/10 There's a reason GTA V broke world records. It's the best GTA game yet and it's also the biggest by a very large margin. Unfortunately DRM is a pain in the neck and server issues in GTA Online where you'll spend a good portion of your time sometimes make the game frustrating to play.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-21,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,The worst of the series the world is nice but it's bland. It's missing all the nice touches from previous games.Cops are easy to evade by driving on railroads or heading to the beach. You only see cops when you've killed a few folk they're never just wandering around the city.Missions are all the same. Drive from A to B. Kill someone at B. Escape. On many of the missions they're as shallow as drive from A to B and back to A without doing anything at all. Poor indeed. Edit Have now finished the game so it's held my attention to the end however the original comments still stand.

2015-09-27,0,0,353,False,Recommended,I have spent over 10 days of my life in Grand Theft Auto V.I pre ordered it.I have played through the story twice and am almost Level 50 Online.With this in mind I can honestly say that Grnad Theft Auto V is a masterpeice. Every minute is fun and enjoyable. It is the best $60 I have ever spent on anything ever. In my opinion it is one of the greatest games of all time.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-06-19,0,0,451,False,Recommended,There is so much crazy you can do in this game jesus it's beautiful and fun. If you get to bored after a while which you probably will be don't worry there is new stuff coming out almost all the time so you can spend and get money either way.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-24,1,2,1103,False,Not Recommended,"Do you like games that have a story line equivelent to that of a bad soap opera? Do you enjoy games that are made by people who never knew that cars weigh more than a feather?Do you like microtransactions?Do you like loading screens?When you drive a tank are you sad because the tank doesnt feel like your driving around in a ballon?Do you enjoy prices in multiplayer to be hyper inflated to hell?If you answered yes to any of thes questions above. Well little boys and girls have I got a game for you. Grand Theft Auto V the game where Rockstar said ""F*CK IT"". But to be honest I wouldent recommend this game. I would much rather play GTA IV that this game. Why? This game to me just isnt as good as its predecessor. Dont get me wrong the game looks great but I'm afraid that the game fell victum to poor game design esspecially in the Online. There isnt much to say about the singleplayer so let me get to the Online.The Online mode of GTA V was in my opinion way over hyped after launch. But for now lets discuss the biggest problems with Online.1. The online currency is hype inflated In single player for example a car may cost around $100 000 but in Online the price is jacked up to around $350 000 for the same car. In single player a shirt may cost you around $24 but in Online the same shirt could cost upward of $300.2. No animals in Online A big improvement between GTA IV and GTA V is the inclusion of the animals. There are even entire mission based around animals. In single player you can litterally take your sniper into the woods and go hunting for Elk or Coyotes or rabbits. The inclusion of animals in single player really in my opinion bring the world to life and without having them in single player really make the world seem dead.3. No stock market in Online This is one that I think not a lot of people will know about but if you go to the stock market website in Online it will say ""STOCK MARKET NOT IN ONLINE YET"". What I dont understand is why arnt they here yet. The game has been out for well over 2 years now and we have heard nothing about stocks being added.4. You NEED money and A LOT OF IT If you plan on doing really anything in Online you better be ready to pay for it.5. The need to grind missions for scraps of money I feel that we shouldnt need to spend hours apon hours just grinding away in mission to get a little money or xp. This is GTA not a MMO.Trust me there is so much more wrong about this game but I just dont have to time to talk about.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-04,0,0,231,False,Not Recommended,"tldr Everything is great except some longer load times ""free"" content that practically requires spending money to avoid a massive grind and some minor concerns with griefers/cheaters online.Full Version If you don't know what GTA is or need a review of the game to decide you've probably been living under a rock. In short third person action game with driving flying boating and on foot mechanics. Plenty of good here and the environment is expertly crafted with tons of stuff to do. Graphics are solid story is solid gameplay is solid. It's a bit of a beast to run but well worth it.If you are interested in the single player experience buy it. It's worth it. If you are interested in the multiplayer experience well... here's the good the bad and the ugly.The Good Between online free roam heists missions and races there's something for everyone and the game is tons of fun with a few buddies. The stories that will come out of your online shenanigans are endless.The Bad Griefing and cheating is fairly common. They've implemented many controls to help cut down on it but in the end you'll likely find someone in free roam doing something you don't like. It's not hard to avoid but if you are the kind of person that likes to just fool around and enjoy things you might run into some issues. Especially since much of the newer gameplay content requires you to be in public sessions (though you can generally get around that too).The Ugly The game price is pretty standard fair. The extra content costs are not. Most newer cars and features have in game GTA$ costs. These costs are basically all 6 figures on up though most are over a million GTA$. Even on sale at $85 for GTA$8 000 000 which is your best deal that means for ONE new vehicle it will cost you $10.63. Yes you can earn GTA$ playing the game and there are numerous guides and tutorials for how to make money ""fast"". Yes you can find people to hack and give you money (or you can do it yourself) all at the risk of being banned. But for the casual player who doesn't have time to dump hours into grinding boring cargo deliveries or repetitive content the game makes it unfun and unreasonable to get any newer content. Most games will release DLC packs and new content and charge anywhere from $10 $30 for it. Rockstar has gone to a scheme that amounts to pay to win and made it near impossible for most people to enjoy the online game anymore without shelling out extra cash or resorting to cheats/hacking. The latest content? An orbital laser similar to the Command and Conquer GDI Ion Cannon that costs GTA$900 000 up front and at least GTA$500 000 to fire. Understandable that you want to limit its use to mitigate griefing but that amounts to $9.56 to purchase the item and $5.31 each time you fire it. Again yes you can earn money in game and not pay real cash to get there. Yes you want to limit griefing so you don't want someone spamming the ion cannon. However there are better ways to do that without resorting to such a blatant cash grab. I'd gladly shell out a few bucks for a season pass or a DLC pack but I'm not dropping $100 to pick up what amounts to basically 1 2 planes/cars. That's unreasonable. This is why I cannot recommend the game anymore.",Grand Theft Auto V

Annoying hackers that you cant avoid on public sessions Annoying notifications that you cant disable. Extremely overpriced weapons vehicals planes well everything is overpriced! Pay 2 Win Shark cards even when the game itself is overpriced (still 60) Maximum flight altitude of 8000ft (should be atleast 15 000ft) Maximum submarine depth is 65m (should be atleast 300m for crushing depth) Cars have a locked max speed all cars have roughly the same max speed. Counter intuitive controls when selecting seats in a large vehical Counter intuitive camera controls that locks to one position (no free camera) First person is useless FOV is stuck at 65 First person flying FOV is way too low. Impossible to use machine guns mounted on vehicals! Mediocre community Removed singleplayer modding support. Impossible to do missions for MC Club Company Bunker missions Facility setups when players are present on public sessions. 75GB filesize even Arma 3 uses less and has more content Useless customer serviceSave yourself the frustration and ignore GTA5GTA Online made me destroy 2 gaming keyboards....Rockstar owes me 2 keyboards for making the most cancerous control mechanics ever.... even Getting over it with Bennet Foddy had better controls!Bottomline Rockstar is a geedy company that only cares about the wallets of their customers but not the customer themselves.

She thumbed me down for about a quarter mile and I figured ""What the heck "" she seemed like a nice enough woman. She got in the car and enthusiastically thanked me for if it were not for me her knight in a shining pick up truck she would still be all alone out in the middle of nowhere and in potential danger. She hinted that if I were to take here home it would be ""worth my while"" so I headed down the highlighted path towards our far off destination. Then she spoke again but this time it was to herself. I mean everyone does it every now and again but with her it was a little different. She started speeding up her speech and what had started as a low murmer had soon grown to a loud stammering. She was arguing with herself going through about five different emotions all at once. I immediately took out my road map and marked a new location then we veered off of our original path and onto a new path...a path up a beautiful mountainside. She continued to yell at herself mentioning causing harm to others as well as herself. She starts crying about things her therapist told her to try that did not work. I tried to calm her down the best I could and she seemed to snap out of it once again trying to seduce me like she didn't just put on a bat crazy display in my front seat. I knew this woman was bat crazy I had to get rid of her. I pressed down harder on the gas pedal and took a quick few shortcuts off the trail. After a few miles up the mountain she finally came to her senses ""Where are we? I don't think this is the way to my house I don't remember ever coming this far out."" That was the most sensible thing she had said the entire drive. ""Oh no I know."" I said ""I know of this spot that is very remote I think you will really like it."" She relaxed ""Oh okay. Sounds like a good time."" We turned right and stopped at a giant gate. We got out of the parked car and I yelled through the gate ""I got another one for ya! To do with whatever it is that you do..."" Two men came out of the gate with assault rifles and rope and captured the woman who was now sobbing and looking back at me terrified. I asked one man for my payment and instead the other man jammed his rifle into my rib signaling me through the gate. I complied afterall I was unarmed and they had a whole community surrounding me. They took me to a rock and proceeded to kneel and pray to some unknown God so I took the opportunity to look around and spotted a rifle behind me on the rock. I climbed over and took hold of the rifle opening fire on the townspeople. After three minutes of a one on many firefight there was no more community left only myself. I slaughtered an entire village single handedly stole all of their money from their homes and saved zero hostages.""No God.""",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-08,0,0,57,False,Recommended,"** Strongly recommended for anyone loves GTA **Grand Theft Auto V is the best successor of the series since Vice City (which was my favorite). This you're listening (playing) stories of 3 different characters. Every single character is very ""unique"" and has a deep backstory. I loved the story of GTA V!What's good?Gameplay Classic GTA just betterGame Map Biggest GTA map ever this time it's Los Angeles. It's designed so well I could even find the Best Western Gateway in Santa Monica... Unbelievable!Game Length So long that I thought it's an unending game! I can be easily distracted by side quests or random grinding therefore it took me nearly 60 hours to finish the game. But if you just focus on main scenerio can take anyway 30 or more hours of gameplay. Online version and hundreds of random missions can me the game longer than 200 hours until you get bored I think.Story Detailed and carefully designed character backgrounds make the story very interesting. Unique skills and agendas of the characters makes you chose a ""favorite"" one. Mine was the Michael psyc family man. Oh man I want to play again now.What is bad? Online games are full of cheaters and not interesting to play. You just got harrassed killed and so on. Nothing there for me. Too many distracting side quests or random missions. Countless times I found myself completely lost like chasing a deer to hunt while actually I was trying to finish a main mission. Map is too big that's good but the quests can be really scattered far far away from each other. You should be ready for 10 minutes of drive to start another mission. AI is not very smart. You can easily outsmart them just by hiding behind walls or columns. Physics are out of World. Cars are flying 100 yards high jumping 2 miles away with your motorbike etc.",Grand Theft Auto V

Clumsy character control annoying menus and interface in general stupid radio comes on every time you enter a car no quick way to switch it off... and the missions are ok pretty boring overall but some missions are quite fun.Online mode 0/10 As a fan of APB Reloaded I bought GTAV mainly for the online mode but this is an awful experience. Lots of cheaters everywhere who make everything explode on the map! Try some car race? Think 2 34 was an amazing time? No the record is 14 seconds... obviously a cheater. Joining missions in general is very painful... it takes forever to start missions then takes a very long time to get back to the online session.. usually you get disconnected and end up in offline mode again and the issue is not with my internet connection it's the crappy R* servers. I hope these issues will get fixed and cheaters banned maybe playing with a good group can be as fun as APB Reloaded but I doubt this will happen as the hackers/cheaters issue seems totally out of control and R* too incompetent to fix it.I would definitely not pay the full price for such an overrated game full of bugs and cheaters but for $20 would be totally worth it for the single player story.,Grand Theft Auto V

Preps are ONLY allowed to be done in public freeroam lobbies with people trying to destroy your stuff for a bit of cash. You can skip them however so that good for only $95 000! It gets better trust me. No one makes money doing the prep mission everyone but the host makes money on the setups and for the host you must complete every act to make your money back from buying the CHEAPIST facility with NO extra features. The new vehicles are about $2 million $3 million each + the cost of upgrading them AND needing to own a facility with the cheapest being on the opposite end of the map from the city. The heists don t give that much money in comparison to other heists warehouses and the cost of entry to play them. And the laser beam of death? $900 000 to buy then $500 000 $750 000 each time to use it once.This is not just the heist. This problem is everywhere you go in the game. Bunkers are over $1 million without any upgrades. CEO offices and $1 million then you have to pay more for warehouses for cargo ($250 000 for 16 spaces a pain to complete with the biggest killer being boredom) and to steal + sell cars ($1.6 million cheapest + tons of time to set up to earn maximum money). Same problem for hangers same problem for any vehicle that does something more than move and researching upgrades in your $1 million + bunker has the same system as a free to play mobile game like clash of clans.The grind at this point is too much if you don t play this all the time as a new player don t even brother. Tons of better games out to buy and play that and I would go as far to say that MMO s past and present are less grindy than GTA online now to get all the different buildings and decent vehicles. Even on sale at 20 it only worth it for SP this game is not worth more than that. Over 20 for GTA is a scam and at that price it still a rip off in terms of value for money,Grand Theft Auto V

Now I must rant about online.Rockstar has the gall to keep this game at retail price 4 years after the game's release and charge microtransactions to such an extent that there is no way to keep up with all the cool stuff in the game.Every 3 months or so a big update happens where in order to use any of the stuff you need to buy in a couple million dollars or around 5 months of your life constantly grinding. Then it makes using the cool stuff you bought tedious by using bunkers garages and pegasus vehicles which operate on a timer.The worst part is the hacking. Rockstar does less than nothing to monitor people spawning in tanks and teleporting all over the map to troll you while you grind away to get a car that isn't very good. Then they spawn a guitar shoved directly up your that launches you into space. Guess what? That one follows you to other sessions. Meaning you have to completely leave and reenter online (a 10 minute process due to abysmal load times) only to get in a server with another hacker.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-19,0,0,361,False,Recommended,Single player is great so far from what I've been able to complete when I need to take a break from GTA Online. The attention to detail put into the game world is impressive. I'm kind of glad I didn't play the original versions on a console and held out for 2 years to have my first experience with the game as it was intended to be played. On the other hand I feel that people who have proverbial dusty PS3 or 360 copies sitting on a shelf would definitely be able to appreciate the visual upgrade compared to the last time they remember playing.I had an issue with my online account missing a vehicle and Rockstar support was great in resolving it and compensating me so they've earned my respect there as well. Online is pretty addicting but once you're high level there's really not a lot to do. After you do all the heists twice you get sick of them pretty quick and they turn into a money grind. More end game content for people who already have the best properties and vehicles would be interesting to see. The matchmaking system is still really bad though so try to play with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,4,9,878,False,Not Recommended,Great game well ported from Console to PC BUT are you a one of those Gamers like me that waited 2 years to play this game just for the mods because the modding community is awesome ! Yeah unfortunately RockStar because they are so cool and love the PC community they decited to banned anyone who users Mods Online and also Single Player ! So basically RockStar is forcing you to how you should play the game and if you dont Oops time to activate the banning button ! Rockstar i payed 60 $ for this game even though its the same game that came out back in 2013 and then came out again in 2014. I expect to have the ability to do whayever the heck i wanna do with the copy. What happens if I scratch my with my OWN Gta V copy ? Will i get arrested ?? I payed for it meaning i can do whatever the f*ck i want with the product. I feel like im just renting this game and not having 100% for myself and I. What happened to buy and then do whatever you want withv the product.... So because this game cost 60 $ and its the same game that you played back in September 2013 you ll get pretty bored pretty fast because one the story is short if you take your time to it and its not even as good as the Campaing in GTA 4 which was far more better then this one. Without the mods this game you ll get bored pretty fast that i can promise you.,Grand Theft Auto V

Do i really need to talk about graphics / gameplay / open world ? You aready know that its fabulous. Buy this game and you can spend half of your playtime in joy while in singleplayer.I havent tried the mods yet but heard from a lot and also saw a lot videos there are amazing mods available to try out once you have completed the game. This extends your playtime aswell. Mods like playing as a cop / superhero and many other insane onesAbout multiplayer ? It sucks. Stick to singleplayer. Only play online with friends if you have any playing this game. Do not play in open online sessions. You will load forever only to wait long enough to get put in a session with hackers. Its stupid.For enjoying multiplayer i ll suggest have 3 friends to enjoy the max out of this game's multiplayer features. with 4 players you can do 2 v 2 adversart modes jobs heists without having to rely on strangers. No threat of hackers. Just host your own session and play. Cons No singleplayer DLC no focus on singleplayer at allAll updates for Online features yet no efforts to get rid of hackersActually banned singleplayer modding moronsGTA 6 might come out to be a MMO judging by how much importance they give to GTA online.Game is 11/10 Awesome.

2018-06-28,0,0,90,False,Not Recommended,I buy this game a year ago but rarely play it ever since. I think it's best to separate the online and the offline story mode to give you better insight about where is the strongest point of the game and what could hold you off from buying it.STORY MODE (Offline) + Game PerformancesThe story mode is good but not great since the main missions are easy to finish. Contentwise it has plenty of things to explore with. Considering how big this game is the performance of this game is good when paired with a stronger PC. Graphically it looks good even though it's aging. I have to praise the devs effort for optimizing this game. It's one of the most optimized game. It still retains the classic GTA gameplay even though some cheats and features aren't as fun as GTA SA. The selection of music is like most of the time good. Instead of just one protagonist you had three here each with a different talents. And if you like mods or even modding this game is for you. The only negative is you should keep your internet alive at least when signing in for the rockstar account. They have some sort of DRM which is annoying. Bottom line is if you buy this for the story mode (offline) then it's good. Whether it's worth or not buying it for this sole purpose is up to you to rethink about it.ONLINEIt has the same city and anything inside is more or less the same with the story mode. But this time you are playing as your own character. You do jobs to earn money (beside thrifting at shops). The idea itself is perfectly executed but the implementation is lacklustre. First of all connecting to online server takes forever if you dont have good connection (which in my country Indonesia we have sluggish internet here). And it's more becoming a pay to win game because most of the time the gap of the levels in the server is too high and these powerful old players have a way too far advantage which can be used to abuse new players. For example they can withstand more damage and have a more powerful weapon. Some of these players are either toxic (like killing newbies whenever they found one) or they dont want to give the job to the new players because they didnt trust them. So yes it hurts to be a newcomer here unless you got money to spend or you cheat. And now words spread that the devs are hunting on innocent people to ban (alongside cheaters and abusers of course). Bottom line the environment isn't good if you're new here without the shark cards and even for the older players you can still get banned for doing nothing wrong. I don't reccomend playing this on online mode it's not that fun unless you have people to play with and to protect each other.CONCLUSIONI wanted to reccomend this but the plus side isn't really justifying enough to say so. It's good to play it offline in a story mode but yet you still have to sign in because of DRM. It seems the main features are the online one as devs wanted to push it that way but meh. I kinda regret it somehow even though i like the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-05,0,0,170,False,Recommended,As someone who played loads of GTA 4 and loved watching stuff from the previous installments I can totally recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun single player experience.I can't however recommend the multiplayer unless you play privately with several of your friends. Playing in a lobby full of randoms can be one of the most boring/infuriatinly stupid experiences you can have with this game.I personally haven't run into any hackers during my time playing but I've seen quite a bit of it captured for videos and such. but my limited knowledge on hackers aside you either leave your house to get immedietly gunned down chased down after you spawn again to get gunned down again if you don't have a quick enough reaction time and then once you finally kill them and or go into passive to do go where you wanted to go in the first place they continue to chase you around for about 20 minutes.Not to mention everybody buys the same apartment so it can end up being an absolute cluster on a very populated server.Now if it were just bad player experiences that would be one thing but the point of GTA online is to make money pimp out your favorite car get an outfit that you really like have a garage full of your favorite cars maybe and have loads of other expensive things that fill the empty void you have in your actual life and the systems they have in place to make sed money are mostly utter ing trash. Between getting kicked from missions and hiests for a number of different reasons to connection errors the host has it's pretty limited what you can do to make a reasonable amount of money. Now I know there's plenty of new ways to make money since the game first came out but between the sparce VIP body guard invites or missions that get really boring after a while that usually end up getting their payout reduced by more than half there's way too much tedium that goes into making a meagre amount of cash.Hopefully the update that comes out on the 7th of June will be something fun and fresh to make a more substancial amount of money if not well then nothing really changed I guess.oh yea and sharkcards are ing stupid and make me dislike microtransactions even more.I would say if you want this game for the single player and or multiplayer please wait for a decent sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is a testament to how video games can be just as culturally relevant as films and music as the entire game is simultaneously a remarkable piece of entertainment and a scathing satire of the modern American way of life. If only for the wealth of customizable settings and constant stream of free updates the PC version exceeds its console counterparts and should be your platform of choice however GTA online is still an unoptimized frustrating mess that is enjoyable with friends but an exercise in unenjoyable gameplay otherwise.PROS + Breathtaking visuals that have been significantly upgraded from the 2013 release+ A deep intriguing story spanning three very unique characters+ Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a game+ Dozens of hours of side missions and activities separate from the main story missions+ Significantly improved gunplay and cover mechanics from GTA IV+ A large detailed map that feels alive+ Heist missions+ Challenging and fun to battle police unitsCONS Painfully long loading times Playing GTA Online solo GTA Online hackers GTA Online connectivity issues GTA Online in general unless you're playing with friends Game affecting microtransactions in the form of Shark CardsOVERALL SCORE 8.5/10 GTA Online can largely be avoided unless you play it as it should be played with a group of your friends in a private session where you rampage through Los Santos and tackle the heists.

Make them look how you want and do what you want progress through the story in any degree of depth and you will definitely enjoy it. It's got the classic features you expect from the modern GTA games the ability to go on an endless siren filled rampage to the ability to do a triathalon (that is 30 RL minutes long).GTA Online is where I spend most of my time however as it opens the game to a 4th character YOU. You enter Los Santos (the game's main city) and progress as a master criminal completeing missions and heists and looking away from explosions. Beware the trolls hackers though they tend to just kill you mercilessly to enlarge their e peen. Don't fret just go passive mode you can ignore it or find a new sessions for you and your pals. If you want to completely lock out anyone from your session except your mates you can just start a private session from the single player side of the game.It's an amazing game that gets content updates every so often that are quite in depth especially the heist update (heavily delayed but ultimately worth it much like GTA V on PC).

2018-07-15,0,0,49,False,Recommended,(This is a GTA V Online review)GTA V Online is a fun game and you will have many hours of the game before it gets boring. One of the great things about the game is everything you can do! There are so many options. You can buy cars (huge range of cars) you can buy clothes (huge range of clothes) and you can become a ceo or a motorcycle club President. BUT there is a very bad thing there is a lot of hacks to the game that rockstar isn't patching (A LOT). I have meet a lot of hackers who just kill you for 30 min or spawn planes to get everything laggy. Another bad thing is the waiting time. The waiting time is long when you enter GTA V Online. When you enter online you have to wait when you enter a heist you have to wait when your done with the heist you have to wait or if you quit the heist before it's done you have to wait. The waiting time with medium internet (it's longer to enter gta v online then joining a heist or leaving a finished heist) so i would have to say entering online would be minimum 10 minutes and leaving a finished (or unfinished) heist would be minimum 3 4 minutes.Rating 7 10 8 10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,125,False,Not Recommended,I used to love GTA V. The open world interesting story and free multiplayer DLC were great. The game isn't perfect and by removing modding from single player I can't recommend this game. Modding is my favorite part about GTA it adds so much to the game and removing that is a slap in the face to PC gamers many of which bought the game for this reason and want to continue playing single player for the mods. Further the DLC they keep releasing is great but it's obvious they don't care about single player and haven't added any single player updates. It's sad that rockstar cares more about money than what their players want and until they bring back modding in single player I am giving this game a huge thumbs down.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-23,0,0,296,False,Recommended,Excellent game even in late 2017! The story is superb and even the multiplayer makes me constantly want to return for more.However for multiplayer keep in mind this 1. There will be a lot of waiting on loading screens when connecting to different activities!2. Main currency dollars can be bought for real money for very large sums of real money. It DOES NOT make a game p2w but prices are a bit higher then in f2p games.3. If you are not buying shark cards (real money &gt in game dollars) getting all of the cars you want (even if you want just a fraction of what is there for sale) will take A LOT of grinding meaning CRAZY amount of solo grinding.4. Game is most fun when you have a stable group of 4 friends always playing together you can play solo and with randoms but it is definitely LESS fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,795,False,Not Recommended,The singleplayer game itself is fantastic one of the best I've played. However the multiplayer is one of the worst microtransaction laden grind fest hellholes in a full priced game. This multiplayer mode has limited singleplayer already because new DLC vehicles no longer get added and you have to mod to spawn in the cars if you want to test them out. Because of GTA Online there won't be any singleplayer DLC that was promised. All of that would be easily ignorable because of the large modding community largely possible due to OpenIV. However Take Two have sent a cease and desist to OpenIV which would effectively kill all modding for GTA V including singleplayer. Because of this I cannot recommend this game.Edit after OpenIV's return still keeping it at negative because of the multiplayer being a grindy pay to win .,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,198,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is fairly good as long as you're playing the singleplayer story but after you're done with that Take Two's recent actions against OpenIV and the rampant cheating online has made this game lose quite a lot of its value and fun over the last few years.,Grand Theft Auto V

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Grand Theft Auto V

GTA IV had it too but in V it is on new higher level.I am not going to waste my time to give examples because they are so much and most of them people would not even notice.In the spirit of the previous parts of the series Rockstar creates a world with its own spirit and atmosphere copletley coherent with the story of the game.THE STORY The story reminds of big movie titles like ""HEAT"" ""Ocean's Eleven"" and ""The Score"" Tense action crazy heists and big scores. In contrast with GTA IV the story is way less dramatic.As opposing to dark tale of IV here we have one more light and simple story fitting the bright atmosphere of the game.The main characters are one of the best in GTA series even one of the best in world's gaming industry.I like the idea that You as a player can find yourself in one of the 3 main characters.THE GAMEPLAY As usual GTA V have simple and easy gameplay.Here we have a lot customizations and things to spend money for.And e missions... THEY ARE THE BEST in all GTA seryes.THE MULTIPLAYER It is all about the money.Missions Heists Races and more with the simple idea to make you rich and richer.Lots of content to spend money for and a lot to do in this big world.Of corse in multiplayer we have simple storyes with the missions and the heists and some of the characters of the main game story witch make things more real.ALL IN ALL Every cent and all those 6 years of waiting was worth it.The game is a masterpiece deserving the ""GOTY"" title.If You are fan or even not of GTA seryes I believe that You gonna love this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

However I think it is definitely getting the short end of the stick on some reviews. I have 20 hours on the PC version but I also owned this game the day it came out on Xbox 360 and spent countless hours on it. I intend to put many more on PC. People complain about the online (which is actually pretty poor I cannot lie) but it is still a ridiculously solid game. The single player alone is worth MUCH more than $60. You will get hours of well written story great cinematics beautiful looking gameplay and countless other things. The mod support (https //www.gta5 mods.com/ is a great site for mods) is very good and the modders are constantly adding new things. One thing that cannot be understated is the optimization of GTA V.

This game has not only open world but also lots of contents. Second it has great storylines. Many people think that GTA series' single player is boring but it is not. In this game three characters are assembled and they solve the problems among them. Third you can enjoy this game with your friends. There are many contents you can enjoy with your friends. For example you can do heist drive through Los Santos kill each other fight against the cops etc. Although this game is 69$ you won't regret of buying this game. Thank you.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-17,0,0,303,False,Not Recommended,I enjoy this game tremendously. However I cannot recommend it. Rockstar while a company that needs to turn a profit have failed to support and expand this game in a manner which expresses good faith to their player base. The have failed to create any meaningful single player DLC to police their servers or to provide for a complete player experience. They've engaged in price gouging for in game good to push their shark card horse And they've progressively locked the playing experience behind pay to play given the amount of time investment it would require to access in game content which is futher inhibited by the fact that many content items give those willing to spend the money an measurable advantage.

I wish more time was put into updating the SP and adding the ability to co op with friends. The game is riddled with hackers and it honestly feels like a grind to earn a meager amount of money to spend. There is so much you can buy but the amount of time you would have to grind for it is just staggering. Online just feels disorganized and disjointed. It does soo many things but it doesnt do any of them particularly well. It has been a couple years out on PC and the fact that they keep adding new stuff to buy but dont bother to fix and hone the already exisiting problems is what makes me not reccomend this game. It really does feel like they are just creating more stuff so people spend IRL money to buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,1,2,111,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be great. I remeber first playing GTA online with my buddies in middle school on my xbox 360. The first time I logged in nobody had a super garage with 64 vehicles stored inside. it was survival in the streets of Los Santos everyone was scrambling to create their gangs and there was a mad rush to get the more powerful vehicles in the game (buzzard rhino tank etc..) It was an environment unlike any other I had ever seen in the gaming world It was amazing. But alas all good things must come to an end. Once they started coming out with these ridiculous DLC's with blatantly op weapons guns vehicles and so on it really ruined the game. And now they outlawed our mods? these guys. They dont deserve any of the money they've earned and I have no clue why this game is #2 on global top sellers in 2017. Very sad.

2018-11-11,0,0,36,False,Recommended,GTA5 is possble one of the best games I have ever played and one of the best open world games I have ever played as well because there is so much to do and so much to see. The game lets you play as 3 characters Michael a man who wants to retire Franklin a gangster who wants to live the big life and Tervor a man who is crazy and is an old friend of Michael who finds out he is alive. The 3 team up and perform certain missions to fufill their goals and their needs ot to help the FIB to keep them alive and out of trouble the 3 characters have special abilty's with them Michael has the abilty which I did not used at all it can slow down time to get a better aim Franklin's abilty is that he can slow down time to get a better grip when driving which is very useful when ity comes to racing and driving as a whole and Trevor's is the one I used the most as he can go into a rage that makes him do double the damage and he can tank more hits. When you are not doing missions you can come across the many stranges and freaks throughout Los Santos as they have things for you too do and such. The world if Los Santos is big and there is lots to do in it you can go biking buy a boat to ride them get nice cars and so much more there is a lot to do in GTYA5 and that is why I like it since the freedom it gives you hell if you want to go and get the cops on you start a rampage. Now as for online I have played it a bit on PC but I did manage to play a lot of it at a friends house on his Xbox one and it was good on the there but on the PC is another story as there are a lot of hackers and most of the modding is now gone due to Rock Star and Take Two due to legal actions taken on them. All in all GTA5 is a great game single player wise and good mutilplayer when the hackers are not out to ruin your fun and such I recommend this game to anyone who wants a great open world game and the freedom to do what ever they want in the world of GTA5.,Grand Theft Auto V

A billion dollars made on release (FOR CONSOLE!!) and have surpassed expectations for every quarter since then. They are money grubs. They are crooks. They are insatiable.I can't in good conscience recommend this game at all.HOWEVER I can recommend that you keep an eye on EVERYWHERE the new game being worked on by Leslie Benzies and his coworkers that left from Rockstar!All that is left of Rockstar is a hollow shell that Take 2 tries to suck the remaining dollars from. You can bet your they will make more too. People continue to buy shark cards and promote Take 2's shady business actions.I will not be buying anymore of their products you should consider doing the same.Played on the 14th of November for 15 minutes went afk came back a few hours later to a one month ban and character wipe.

2017-06-15,0,0,432,False,Not Recommended,I will start off by saying that the single player is fantastic and I clearly love the game based on my time played but I do not recommend purchasing this game or its microtransactions.Take Two Interactive the owners of Rockstar Entertainment are a bunch of greedy s. For those of you that do not follow gaming news Take Two recently filed a Cease and Decist against the developers of OpenIV a modding tool for GTA V. This is an issue. Modding has kept these GTA games alive between updates. Sure you are not supposed to use them in the Online but that's where private servers come in. If Take Two is going to tell people they cannot mod this game and would rather flex it's legal muscles than look at their policies then who are we to support them? Not to mention at a conference not too long ago the CEO of Take Two Interactive essentially called the consumers freeloaders.tl dr Fantastic game if you can get past the microtransactions but the companies shady practices as well as refusal to allow modding even for singleplayer should not be supported.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-05-29,0,0,175,False,Not Recommended,Before I begin this review let me clarify this I bought this game to play online with my friend. I have NOT played the campaign. This is a big long complaint about the issues in GTA Online. I suggest you read this before buying if you're here to play online and don't want to be taken by surprise by the grind and savagery of the online.Now I absolutely love GTA online. I'm able to experience the joy of mass crime in the comfort of my computer chair and home without any real world consequences with other people.Currently I'm around level 40 with a good $3 000 000 in my bank. This is not just from being rich. This is about two week's worth of money which I have strictly ordered myself not to spend until I get enough to buy the thing(s) that I really want. Good vehicles.The game is chock full of cars bikes choppers and planes. And even submarines and boats are plenty. But a lot of these are standard civvie cars. The big boy cars are armored have a high seat count have weapons and/or can do something fancy and unique. Take the Stromberg for example. It's a regular fast car but it can go underwater firing torpedoes or missiles and machine guns on land. This car as of writing costs $3.1 MILLION undiscounted and without the special trade price. And even with the trade price it's ungodly expensive.Prices wouldn't be a problem if money was fun and easy to get. But getting money is a grind. Not quite Clash of Clans level as I can actually bear it to an extent but close enough.I'll find myself logging onto GTA Online and frantically scrambling to do the Doomsday Heist the highest paid heist currently in the game on Quick Job. I stare impatiently at the corner of my screen as the game searches for a lobby and then will immediately look for another lobby if it comes up with a setup. Setups are required before a heist as they're a (somewhat) fun in game way of collecting the things needed to act out a heist. But setups get tedious and uncreative as all the interesting bits are in the heist itself. And even the interesting setups though there aren't too many as most are just run in shoot and go or grab this and come back or a mix of those have basically no pay. Say $40 000 at most. That's a lot in real life but it's pocket change in the game.When you finally get to the heist there's a required feature. CUTS. This is a way to decide who gets however much money from doing the heist. Usually the leader will get 55% and the rest of the players will get 15% each on average though this varies sometimes due to player numbers how fair the heist leader is etc.I honestly hate this feature. I will admit I get a power rush deciding how poorly paid the snobby level 100 players get though it IS unfair on everyone including the leader. I get it it puts you into the mindset of a master criminal. Plotting how much money each member of the crew gets giving yourself way more because you need it to get that sweet car. It's realism and immersion. But do we need realism and immersion in a game with a flying car an amphibious muscle car and a bloody rocket powered motorbike? Yes obviously but not to the extent of making players' moneymaking endeavours tedious. It would be much better if heist payment was improved. And yes I'm aware of Shark Card purchases. Rockstar need money and they want money. Shark Cards are a core way to do that. But it's horrific how many players rely on them to get what they want to play with. Even my friend who is heavily against microtransactions (as am I) decided he should use a month's hard earned savings to buy a bit of dosh to buy a bunker to progress in the online game.Additionally the pricing is there for longevity in the game. It's hard to go from rich boy number one to a regular level 1 peasant if you're getting bored of having everything and Rockstar know this. But a fun longlasting game shouldn't be composed of grinding. It should be composed of a plethora of fun exciting ways to progress rather than one straight path of battling for the most money and the biggest cut and trying not to get bored doing so. Let's go over a few ways to get money and review their pros and cons.Heists the already mentioned primary way of earning money. A few hundred thousand at minimum as a final pay comes from these unless you're doing the Fleeca Job on easy. These payments as I have said are controlled by cuts which the host and leader of a heist session is able to control. This is to make up for the fact they get NO money from the setups (or preps in the Doomsday Heist.) and they will generally give themselves at least 40% of the total earnings. On top of this. there are NOT enough heists. I know full and well it takes time and effort lots of those to make things like this but I'm going to be blunt. Doing the same 10 15 heists over and over gets tedious especially when a lot of them barely have a good pay which then has to be cut down to even LESS. Heists are also impossible to get into as a low level player looking for quick money. Since I've started the game I've joined the heists of players level 100 and up and have been instantly kicked for my level effectively throwing me out of getting good pays until I myself can afford the facilities items and setup costs (Yes they exist) to host a heist myself. This isn't bad on the players. A lot of lower levels are incompetent. It's a flawed broken system to get players to buy Shark Cards.Next jobs. Jobs are small but fun little minigames such as battling it out with cars and powerups in the street or the sky or doing 3 lap races. But these are tediously long and give you a maximum of $20 000 and that's only on the highest paid ones if you play well. Jobs work like heists in that you can be kicked for your level too though thankfully the system to get to play these is less brutal. But that's only because of the peasant tier payment for it. I have played about three jobs in my time on GTA Online because I quickly learned they aren't worth the hassle at all.Next and most annoying. Killing. This is a realistic system designed to get players more engaged in PvP. If a player is carrying money in their pocket rather than in their Maze Bank account they can drop it on death and it can be picked up by other players. However this has caused the game to go south as now basically every player is hostile or paranoid as everyone wants each other's money. And I have seen on numerous occasions players being killed in the open seconds after loading back into Freemode after a heist. This can only be circumvented via Passive Mode essentially a no weapons godmode which is commonly seen as a cowardly thing to use as it breaks the flow of the gameplay and renders you invincible to the firepower of others' hard earned war machines. Additionally you can kill civilians and cops to get money but they only drop a tiny miniscule amount of money which isn't worth it.And finally the dreaded microtransactions. Also known as Shark Cards these are Rockstar's secondary source of money from GTAV the primary being game purchases. Shark Cards allow players to get in game money for ludicrous amounts of real money so that they can speed up their moneymaking. Want the Deluxo but don't want to spend a week grinding Doomsday? Shark Cards! Want to become a CEO gunrunner and motorcycle club president all at the same time but don't want to throw away loads of time? Shark Cards! Wave goodbye to your real money you don't need it when you have GTA Online's one and only grind prevention system!In conclusion I do enjoy this game's online mode but I'm going to rate negative due to the ungodly grinding. I won't get into the community whose toxicity can be compared to the Chernobyl reactor as that's nothing on Rockstar. The grind of this game ruins it. If it was more fun and/or less grindy I'd be voting this positive easily. I'd rate GTA Online 6/10.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-11,1,2,154,False,Not Recommended,It used to be good and story is still fun but online is just grinding now they don't care about you they only care about the money. They have a clever system in which you'd need hundreds of hours to actually have a good car a high end apartment and atleast a hydra it's getting annoying because this system unless you like grinding makes you wanna buy a shark card which is incredibly expensive especially for digital currency (no bitcoin go away this is a game you're actual currency). Since I've played the entire story twice I am now modding (singleplayer I don't wanna ruin other player's experience) and it's quite fun to be a police too. Other than that I do not recommend it if you're in for the multiplayer which suprise surprise is the only thing getting updated now.On singleplayer Rockstar has this damned feature that despawns all multiplayer cars such as the Deluxo if you're modding singleplayer it's as if they really want you to buy sharkcards to actually use the cars and the features.Another thing is balance recently in the Doomsday update (the heist is annoying btw i dont suggest you do it enemies constantly spawn and and it's infuriating if you're doing 3 players or less.) they added the orbital satellite thing in order to use it to kill people you must pay in game currency there is an auto lock way too which just aims at the target constantly assuring the target's death which by surprise costs more. There is no way of knowing if you're getting targeted and it's annoying since by experience I don't think destroying personal vehicles even costs you that way. It's basically like the tool that modders use on online you can kill anyone with mods (video as I said I don't mod online) and now they made it possible to the non modding community too. Sure you could make a private lobby and limit the things you do and also not have anyone to interact with and also the bad sport/good sport lobby seriously? In a game where all you do is crimes and killing you get into a bad sport lobby if you kill too many people/destroy too many personal vehicles it's a game where you're normally doing that for sakes! I really don't recommend this game if you're an online dude.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-13,0,0,197,False,Not Recommended,"Since I (mostly) don't much care about multiplayer 'new content' or whatever excuse companies make up to charge an extra buck GTA V was a solid though a bit disappointing experience. I felt GTA SA for one had a much more interesting world. GTA V is gorgeous and plays smoothly but there isn't much going on once you get tired of trivialities like investing in the stock market. For such a detailed world there's a suprisingly low number of places and people to interact with so this is definitely a step back in relation to SA (I never played GTA IV to tell). Doing missions I felt annoying spending a lot of the time simply going from one place to the next. To be sure a lot of what's fun in GTA is the little comic things in it but I think this game lacks depth despite the gorgeous layer (characters voice acting and so on). The radio frustrated me as well. I had great memories of San Andrea's talk shows (''poor people stop complaining start living!"") and had similar expectations for this one. In short my main problem with GTA V is that there isn't too much to it in the end and the world is actually quite boring since you can only interact with 1/100 of it. If you don't care much for analyzing things and really just want to have fun by all means buy it. If you're a sticker for details like me I don't recommend it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-15,0,0,267,False,Not Recommended,"Honestly just don't get it. Really not worth it anymore. The single player is fun but it gets repetitive quick around the time Trevor gets to Los Santos. The switching mechanic is slow and unintuitive on keyboard and mouse. Not only that but the game is frankly unoptimized especially for how ugly the game looks (at least in my opinion). For reference I have an i5 and MSI R9 390X. Not the best system but still there shouldn't be a reason for this game to be playing at 30 50 FPS (yes it is THAT inconsistent) on medium high. Now onto Multiplayer. Holy balls are the character models ugly. Mind you when GTA Online first got released the character customization was even WORSE. People looked like a mix between a crack addicted Ork from Warhammer and Gollum. it was bad. Now to their credit it *is* better now but it is still an excercise in patience trying to make your character even remotely attractive. I only put this first because character customization is a huge thing for me. I love spending time to make my character look awesome. It's almost impossible to do that here with the combination of ugly character models bad customization for the ugly character models and ugly fashion choices. There aren't a whole lot of clothing options that I can really guarantee will look good on anyone (why do the fitted suit pants make your character's feet look freaking massive???). Overall character customization is a HUGE minus. Gameplay is...meh. Honestly unimpressed. I honestly think Ubisoft (even though they have their own gameplay issues...) mastered 3rd Person shooting. Ghost Reco Wildlands and Watch_Dogs 2 have MUCH better shooting and movement mechanics compared to this and Watch_Dogs 2 has at least in my opinion better driving than this game. But that stuff isn't the focus of the multiplayer no.The focus of the multiplayer is actually an MMO style grind. Now personally I was never really into grinding. It just seemed tedious and boring to me. And this game proves no different. EVERYTHING is expensive. You get a car a 2 car garage a pistol and the clothes on your back for free but everything has else needs to be bought. This might sound easy but mind you the early game missions pay out maybe a couple grand. The less expensive houses (the next step up from your 2 car garage) are still around $35 000. That's 17 missions if you're lucky and those missions take up to half an hour at a time. It's probably not going to be 17 missions though seeing as you're probably going to be spending your money between missions either on ammo armor or character customization.Going back to the first point about character customization I have a HUGE problem with character customization being tied to level. It seems like a really stupid decision. Why limit what I can make my character look like? I can understand making certain clothing more expensive so you can't get it right away like making a 3 piece suit more expensive than sweatpants and a t shirt but the game doesn't do that at least not with base game clothing. No the grind really comes to a head with the free DLC. The DLC adds a lot of kind of cool stuff! Like a CEO office new houses (including mansions!) new cars and clothes biker clubhouses and more! Too bad most of it is $1 million+. If you buy now you are NOT going to be able to do that stuff even though it adds a couple of gigs onto the already monstrous 50 gigabyte install. It's not like you're missing out on much anyway. The new clothing options are still ugly the new cars are frankly underwhelming (even the ones with guns) and the CEO office clubhouse new garages and now the bunker ONLY add new missions. Missions which get you more money. Which you inevitably use to buy an office/clubhouse/garage/bunker. Which you'll do more missions for. To get more money. And the cycle repeats. The missions aren't fun either. No they're honestly quite boring and worst of all some are almost impossible without either a helping hand or a full crew. ""Fun"" for the whole family I guess. So you obviously want money becuase really those guns and cars *do* look *really* fun....so what do you do? Speaking from experience? Find a hacker. A lot of the hackers in GTA give you money and it's awesome. They're really the best part of the game and community because they let you bypass the slog that is the GTA Online experience. Best part is? Rockstar put an end to OpenIV which couldn't do anything to multiplayer...and did basically nothing to the trainers that *do* let you hack multiplayer. If you still buy this game you still stand a good chance to find a hacker or become one so go ahead and do that. Overall I'd say the main draw to this game for me was a game where I'd get to around an open world with a character I made. Go on road trips get into scraps basically what Final Fantasy XV is. So yeah go buy that instead. Or anything else really.TL DR Go find a better MMO.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-03,0,0,245,False,Not Recommended,The game itself is nice and I like it. The developers though do not care about it at all. There are two main issues 1) Hackers in online mode. They can instant kill whole session. Lock your client so you cannot change session. They can kill other players in your name. This has been continuing for a long time and Rockstar pretends nothing is happening.2) Stutter after a few hours of playing. This is also a known issue and has been for a long time. No fix available. It doesn't affect all systems so maybe you will be lucky and don't have this problem.In both cases Rockstar does not care or does not even acknowledge there is an issue. After they take your money they don't give a s**t so do not expect it to become better anytime soon.,Grand Theft Auto V

You are basically forced to buy shark cards grind for weeks or just use exploit killing any fun of the game.2. Griefers are way too common. 1 modder with invincibility can ruined the game for an entire lobby.3. The dev team is simply running out of new ideas. In the past there are heists CEO but now every updates are just powerful weapons for a few hundreds k powerful vehicles for a few millions and repetitive missions.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-04,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,I am insterested just in the online part of the game and this could be great game but there are two things that makes it unplayable for me.First is that this game is basically loading simulator I have the game on middle class SSD and it is almost 50 50 ration between actual gameplay and neverending loadings and connectings to servers. This is outrageous nonsense and I am far from being the only one experiincing that in my social bubble. It's basicaly same from everyone I know.Absolutely broken economy by no ability to stop cheaters. You can try to grind through very large grind or you can pretty easily get a mod that drops money from the sky makes you invicible etc. And it is sadly pretty comon thing to encounter not just some corner bussiness for a few outcasts. And it is like this for at least several months now and no visible action against it.So for me this could be one of the greates game I know but ignorance from publisher issuing prevalent loading/connection issues and cheaters on majority of servers this is a game that I don't want to even give a chance again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,360,False,Recommended,First bought this game as the Collectors Edition on xbox 360 was quite fun.Played it on PC a year and a half later and it seems like a completely new game.Graphics are awesome and the optimization is pretty much perfect. Running at 60fps+ is a dream in this game. Worth the wait! 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-17,0,0,134,False,Recommended,An utterly fantastic and monumental achievement a huge landscape that faithfully recreates and improves on GTA San Andreas and scope characters and gameplay that outdo every game beforehand. I've found it to be a great PC port although there are some that have had some issues starting the game. But once you're in it plays very well all things considered. Make no mistake though they've made this game customisable for all rigs and running this on absolute max settings requires a beast of a computer in order to get a steady 60fps. You will have to tinker with the many many graphics options as well as perhaps sacrifice quality in some areas in order to get a relatively steady frame rate and hitching and dropped frames are common if your settings are too high given that there are so many diverse areas with many different levels of complex objects to render.But that being said in my opinion it's by far the best of the GTA games and it seems the most suited to PC in terms of the quality of the upgrade from console to PC versions and the sheer amount of options regarding visual fidelity available. The attention to detail is stunning and finding little things like where to shoot a vehicle to make it leak gas is so much fun. On top of this GTA Online is well populated and balanced and really really fun when you get a good team of people working together. An absolute must own.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-28,0,0,107,False,Recommended,There isn't much to say since the title of the game speaks for itself. Basically GTA 5 is the GTA that we wanted for the next gen and the amount of things added makes it have a lot of replay especially for those who enjoy exploring and finding little easter eggs and things. I know I typically do longer reviews but for a game like this there is no need to really do one.If you enjoy GTA as a game then you will like this. The only things to keep into consideration si that the Online version where you play with other people is sometimes plagued with hackers and that is annoying. Also make sure your rig can handle this. The graphics are demanding and I can see its effects on my machine. If you can't run games like Skyrim at ultra without lag then you won't be able to handle this. Even on low the graphics while still good are demanding.Overall fun game so many things to do so many GTA things present and um yeah. Good game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-13,1,2,528,False,Recommended,First of all I have to say I loved the game when it came out in 2013 and I love it even more now! I played the Xbox 360 version for a while till the Xbox one came with GTA V so i had 2 copies of the game loved the detail in the next gen version! but was still waiting for the PC release! Its finally here Sadly my current build crashes a lot on the PC so I'm buying parts to Max it out and be able to play it. When the game was first released it had a lot of errors (Stuttering Crashing Low Fps etc) After 2 3 Patches everything seems to have been cleared up and it is very playable with drivers from both AMD and Nvidia. I Actually Rate this game as 9/10 because it is very different than GTA IV to mod (Somewhat). The game is fun Online and Offline (Mods) So you will never be bored of the game. If you have a console and just got a PC this would be a great game to buy! The Graphics are stunning and you do not need much VRAM (Graphics Memory to max out the game or even run it) for 720p you need around 3GB to max out the game and 850MB to run it at 1080p you need 3.5GB to max it and 1 GB to run it then at 4K it becomes hardcore 14GB to max it and i think 4 6 GB to run it.

So it used to be fun but now it isn't anymore. thanks take two!As for the online version it is utter snot. You get soooo many cheaters on it it isn't fun. It seems the only reason these cheaters are playing this is to agrivate other people getting some perverse pleasure out of it because their real life isn't worth all that much or isn't interesting enough. Thus they want to spread the hate a bit around....Now for the game itself 1) graphics ok BUT there are some nasty bugs in it that the devs havent addressed ( even though it has been reported since day one)2) great story line but a bit predictable.3) sometimes it just feels like grinding grinding and more grinding.4) fun level Not so much anymore.5) GTA online is utter guano. Ifyou want to have a MMORPG with action elements go to old republic LOTHRO or some other massive multiplayer. Either you make a fully operational MMO or a singleplay with co op not something half baked in betweenDo i recommend this game to others? In this current state seeing they devs haven't put in the effort to fix their broken game having a lot of difficulties with the bugs and the fact that they want to monetise their game more with micro transactions ( planned to be put in from what my sources say) taking away the mod oportunities etc I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO SNYONE IN THIS STATE!

However thumbs down because GTA Online is full of hackers/modders. If I had to review this a year ago it would have been thumbs up. I have played up to level 260 in GTA so it shows how much I do love the game I regularly play other games now and when I do comeback to GTA online I always get reminded why I don't play it anymore as a UFO spawns into me with no way of removing it unless I restart the game and waste another 20 minutes loading.

2017-11-05,0,0,2706,False,Not Recommended,"Let's be clear. I was NOT banned. Hell I even received a significant amount of illegal money which I personally view as making up for millions of in game $ being irreversibly squandered on things I could only describe as deliberately useless cash sink traps. But I wasn't banned. I quit for other reasons.Before we continue I will point out that the single player game is very good. It will never ever see an update because Rockstore wouldn't get a cashflow from it but if you want a solid SP game this one is pretty damn great.Reason GTA Online is trash #1 The game is deliberately balanced horrifyingly against the players in terms of time to payoff ratio. Look at my hour count. Even with that many hours I still only ranked about ""Upper middle"" as far as how much stuff I had compared to other players. Why? An economic system centered around getting players to buy into their shockingly expensive shark cards. Buy fake money with real money. And Rockstore has done an amazing job of making sure the things you want require ten to fifty hours of committed playtime to get them wihtout spending real money on fake money.Reason GTA Online is trash #2 Disastrously imbalanced weaponized vehicles and its only getting worse. You want to play with your freinds in relative peace? Or at the very least have a vaguely fair fight in the event someone wants to interfere? Too bad. Somone has a fliying motorcycle with front mounted homing missiles and there is little if anything you can do about it. I just fired up GTAO again for the first time in two months yesterday only to be relentlessly killed by one of these jackasses. What can you do about it? Nothing. you.Reason GTA Online is trash #3 The non free world missions are dead. Lobbies are empty. The free world missions are pretty lacking extremely repetitive and a favorite target for the jerks from reason #2.Reason GTA Online is trash #4 Cheaters. If you've been reading other reviews you already know about the cheaters. Moving on.Reason GTA Online is trash #5 Hearkens back to #1 With every new update comes out everything gets much MUCH more expensive. About two years ago an update released a car called the Warrener. It was a very regular car no batmobile bullshot cost $120 000 (Prices were already bloating at that point) Anyway a few months ago in a newer update they put out a new car that is basically the EXACT SAME car again only its a two door version and has a few race car looking liveries. The performance is about the same. This one costs well over $600 000. A new player couldn't make that much scratch in a whole 12 hour day of playtime. Holy ship guys. And thats for a basic useless car that isn't even fast.Reason GTA Online is trash #6 The free play shared world which has become the only way you can feasibly play with others online. New business option are touted like they're this big amazing thing but they aren't they're dirty math tricks. They're all reskinned versions of the first one which was terrible from the start. They cost extraordinary amounts of money to get started money you will never likely recover enough to justify. There is no winning. It's rigged against you forever. Even the businesses which can turn a viable profit take so long to do it that you will spend hundreds of hours just.... basically grinding. Every mission is shallow repetitive and either far too easy or just plain needlessly long. There is only one mission that has anything faintly resembling depth and that is Los Santos Connection in the contact missions which is among the non free world dead lobbies I mentioned earlier.I hate that I am becoming one of those people who has to regularly leave terrible negative reviews but the things these companies are doing is becoming disgusting and offensive. I've played every GTA title there is and loved them all. There is a very real possibility I won't play the next one. Rockstore has made it very clear what they have in mind for the future and I want no part of it.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-04,0,0,435,False,Not Recommended,"The game starts very strongly and especially shines when we do our first heist and are then introduced to Trevor because Trevor is a such a strong character.However after Trevor learns the spoiler the game just disintergrates. The team constantly bickers and the plot becomes aimless. The ending of the game could've happened right at that point without having the characters go through all the trouble of catering to those who try to control them and considering just how easy the ending was the player is left wondering why the heck it wasn't done right away in the first place. It feels like the writers came up with this idea of ridiculously twisted plot and they sacrificed everything just to have those twists. The game ends with a foul aftertaste. You're happy that you don't have to endure the characters fighting with each other anymore not that the characters defeat their enemies.A lot of the missions in the game are poorly thought through and simply make you move from one map marker to another without letting you stray from the course. You do a lot of the things that don't make any sense just because the game forces you to do them. The game's controls are clunky and constantly get in the way especially when you're flying or swimming. The gun choice is inconsequential. I played the entire game with the same weapons. At the end I bought all my characters a minigun but the game actually disables it in many missions because... you're not allowed to play the game the way you want to.Another annoying thing is cars your characters are forced to drive the same beaters they were driving at the start of the game. Any new car you get you lose during missions because... you're not allowed to play the game the way you want to. After the mission you have to drive to the cop station to retrieve your last nice car but you lose it again the next mission you start. It's bloody annoying.There's great voice acting and the world is pleasantly varied. However the game seems to constantly strive to interfere with your enjoyment of those things.I wish Steam had a ""meh"" button as this is what this game is but lacking that choice I'm going with a ""No"" for recommendation.",Grand Theft Auto V

I already had an account and it did not let me connect it to my Steam account until I separately launched the RS social club and reset all details. I should mention that this account is required even for single player so the issue was unavoidable. It also added an extra few minutes to the loading times because it always said ""Taking longer than usual to verify game ownership"" or something along those lines.I was looking forward very much to playing this game with my friends but thanks to what seemed like endless bugs loading times and DRM t I won't be doing that in this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

My crew and I often needed to use Net Limiter to try and keep the s away but after awhile even that didn't work.

I recommend this game to you the who loves to do nothing more than ruin everyone else's day. I recommend this game to you you masochists who love nothing more than to be hacked countless times and you you sadists who love to give the masochists exactly what they want. Someday I might actually get online again if the impotent tech support can ever get their nose out of the teir 1 support guide book where they copy and paste everything into the email they send you.

Yes online because everything in the game require's online even if you want to play single player have a slow connection?

2018-03-12,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Playing this game since day one on the 360 I can say that this was one of my favorite games the story was fun to play and interesting.I would reccomend this game for its single player 100% But for online it's a little different.Playing online back in the old days was fun everything was fairly priced and atleast achievable by new players now adays everything is in the millions range Starting this game on pc as a level 1 with nothing and getting all the way back up there is a absoulute grind not saying that its bad but it get's a bit repetitive.You could sit there grinding all day while someone can go out and buy a shark card or the new bundle.I understand that buisness and game developers need money but come on 100 for 8 Million Dollars!?Thats a absoulte rip off regarding the prices of everything now a days. I haven't had many expirence with modders so i'm a bit bias on this but I haven't seen any modders at all in all my hours of online so far maybe i'm just lucky.To sum it up The single player is great i would reccomend it but the online mode... Eh It's fun for a little bit but then you realize how much you have to do to catch up with everyone. If you don't agree with something I said tell me.

2017-11-08,0,0,1030,False,Not Recommended,The single player story is great and everyone should enjoy it.But the online component of the game is 98% of the content and unless you're willing to shell out literall hundreds of dollars on shark cards the grind in this game is terrible. There is no joy in the grind the missions avalible are a chore every thing you do outside of a mission or race is draining money like you'd never belive. Just loitering in free roam will cost you some amount of cash every in game day depending not how many and how big each of your garages or houses are. You can not sell a house you no longer use you can only replace it with a smaller one which will drain less money over time. I only play for the online racing and that is a chore as well unless you shell out a few million every time they add a new car you will not stand a chance. That's not to meantion all the trolls and hackers who will ram and intterupt the race just for the lulz. The online community is pure toxic hate you can't go for a bicycle ride without being gunned down by some pay to win kiddo in a super tank thing. The lovely world the original devs have created have been completely ignored with the commedically over powered weaponiezed everything with everyone with rocket launchers and explosive round guns.

This game is nothing but a bloody cashgrab. lets give example with new popular jet that costs something around 7M ingame money that is about 35 in real money if we convert it via shark cards. for 1 miserable jet. And there is more. To make money in this game you must spend money. It's utter garbage instead of DLCs that cost 10 you get ridiculously expensive stuff marketed as free dlc that you have to grind for 40 hours to get. They put new car as FREE when it's x mas and everyone still lost their money. This game isn't fun if you're not willing to spend real money to get fun stuff.

2017-11-11,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,The Good Excellent story mode Seemless swap between first and third person Online has its moments (seeing a big payday playing with a decent team)The Bad Inflated prices online for everything Unbalanced online play Long loading timesThe Ugly Pay to win microtransactions Faulty anti cheat system and incompetent support C&amp D orders for mod makers no single player modsThere are two parts to this game GTAV and GTAOnline. GTAV consists of the single player story with Franklin Michel and Trevor with their adventures in Los Santos and Blane County and is an excellent game. It works if you want a open world crime sandbox this is a great choice. I can ONLY recommend the game if you just want the single player.HOWEVER the biggest problem with this product is the part Rockstar have been devoting all their time to GTAOnline an interesting idea that almost works but the developers have utterly ruined.First off the economy is weighted in favor of purchacing Shark Cards the microtransactions everything is overly expencive. Add on that most things can be purchaced regardless of level if you can affoard the Shark Cards you can start with jet bikes tanks super cars and the best properties around it's pay to win at its worst.Next Rockstar forces players to depend on their anti cheat which on one hand fails to get rid of cheaters and on the other bans innocent players whom these cheaters have screwed with. Rockstar also fails to give any form of appeals system or any chance to recover your account once banned once you get the boot you could only buy the game again.And lastly Rockstar and their parent company Take Two Interactive have entirely shut down the modding scene for GTA as in all of them declairing GTA modding illegal. This includes single player GTAV which would be a very sketchy move in the best of times right now it shows how greedy they are. As far as I understand the matter anyway it seems they (being Rockstar and Take Two ) know how lucrative the Shark Cards are and they don't want anything infringing on that. To them any player having fun with mods on their own is a player who isn't spending money on cards. There is also talk about how Take Two want to have microtransactions in all of their future games but I can't cite this rather I'm too lazy right now.Ether way this paints a very bleak picture for the future of the gaming industry but that isn't relevent to this review. At the end of it get it for the single player and don't touch the online. If Rockstar and Take Two's caustic business practices don't turn you off then the mostly caustic players will. It is kinda to be expected GTA games have always been about toying with the helpless NPCs so given the chance to do so to actual people the expected result of course happened. But if you have some friends then it may be fun but I wouldn't get invested.I do suggest you take a look in to all the controversy Rockstar and Take Two are stiring up regardless of if you decide to get the game or not you know what they say about trainwrecks.TL DR Read the points at the top you nancy that's what they're for!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-11,0,0,366,False,Recommended,For me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent wickedly comic and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary post economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire it rips into the Millennial generation celebrities the far right the far left the middle class the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar s sharp tongue including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first person shooter called Righteous Slaughter ( Rated PG pretty much the same as the last game. ) It s not exactly subtle he literally has the word Entitled tattooed on his neck and the in game radio and TV s outright takes don t leave much to the imagination but it is often extremely funny and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto s San Andreas is a fantasy but the things it satirises greed corruption hypocrisy the abuse of power are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.Grand Theft Auto V s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains hijack military aircraft and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people albeit extraordinarily f***ed up people.Michael is a retired con man in his 40s filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son air headed daughter serially unfaithful wife and very expensive therapist all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang banger stereotype even as he s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there s Trevor a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed up childhood.The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three and it s a credit to GTA V s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times they re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.This three character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto s personality. In doing so it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here many of Michael s missions revolve around his family and his past Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills Franklin can to slow time while driving for example which gives them a unique touch. Narratively it s effective even off mission I found myself playing in character acting like a mid life crisis guy with anger issues as Michael a thrill seeker as Franklin and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car because I felt like that s what he d want.Trevor feels a like a bit of a get out of jail free card for Rockstar providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get out clauses go though it s pretty effective and Trevor s over the top missions are some of GTA V s action packed highlights. It s a successful way of solving a problem that s prevalent in open world games the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both masterfully allowing neither to undermine the other.The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their individual lives and habits fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the San Andreas map closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him or speeding along the motorway blasting 80s hits or having a cigarette at the golf club Franklin might be walking out of a strip club munching a bag of snacks at home or arguing with his ex girlfriend there s a good chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or on one memorable occasion drunk in a stolen police helicopter.It could be nearly anything because there is a bewildering multiplicity of things to do in the new San Andreas tennis yoga hiking racing on sea and on land flying planes golfing cycling diving hunting and more. The missions are an able guide to both San Andreas locations and its activities touring you around the map and whetting your appetite for independent exploration of it all. The way that we re introduced to San Andreas never feels artificial the map is completely open from the start for example which contributes to the impression that it s a real place somewhere you can get to know. If GTA IV s Liberty City feels like a living city San Andreas feels like a living world.

2015-12-11,0,0,93,False,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong the game is good not great but good nonetheless Rockstar and Take Two deciding to be a bunch of money s who care only about the multiplayer doesn't help.First of all the singleplayer doesn't a lot of content why can't we have the multiplayer content in the singleplayer part of the game?Why can't we have heists in singleplayer? Or at least bots for the heists in multiplayer and a offline mode.Second the game has microtransactions on a game that cost 69.99$ which is stealing.Unfortunately I was dumb enough to pre purchased it not having played it on consoles because I'm a PC guy I want to give the game a try and I was sure that It would be awesome.Well I was correct but and I also was wrong.I thought that the singleplayer would be fun enough to not get boring quickly I was wrong about that.The map isn't that big but it's a great and detailed map so there's nothing wrong about this but it could be even more detailed since the map isn't so big which means being able to get inside of almost every houses and buildings in the game.There is barely any gang action in this game unlike the previous Grand Theft Auto games which is kind of sad in my opinion.There are more vehicles in this game than the previous Grand Theft Auto games which is a plus.There are also more weapons in this one than the previous games and they are also way better to use.At least the DLCs are free especially since they don't add much and it's only multiplayer content.I'm giving this game a 5/10 and I'm giving Rockstar 4/10.I want to give this game a positive review but I can't.Singleplayer is the most important part of a video game if the game doesn't have a singleplayer mode (bots campaign survival etc etc) I don't even want to hear about it even if the game itself is good.If the game is principally multiplayer than singleplayer that ain't a good thing either.Video games were single player when they first appeared then they add the multiplayer but most of them had bots or some a great campaign to play if the singleplayer content sucked then the multiplayer was generally worse.So can I know what's wrong with this generation?Overpriced game let's be honest about it every games that exist on this World should be maximum 39.99$.Most of nowadays games are 110$ while it should be 9.99$ 29.99$ (depending on the game I'm looking at you Activision Infinity Ward Treyarch Ubisoft EA 2K and almost every nowadays developers/publishers).Microtransactions on a overpriced game.More of a multiplayer game than a single player game.Lot of content that is locked in the online and not available for the single player part of the game simply because R* want us to buy their crappy in game money (because they want your money for doing absolutely nothing).The cop's dispatch is unrealistic the cops are unrealistic in general.Silencers doesn't works nothing works the way it should.The driving is horrible.And I could go on all day.5/10 (mostly negative the game could have been so much better hopefully they don't make the same error with Grand Theft Auto 6 which will hopefully happen to be at Vice City).Also the online community is cancerous.They know that modders could do so much more that's why they hate mods they are scared they are a bunch of incompetents that are doing barely anything to the solo and heck even the online.Please never buy shark cards from them ever it's cancer and like every diseases we have to get rid of it.Your best bet is to buy the game while it's cheap (less than 15$ if that ever happens) and to mod it so you can have the multiplayer content available for the singleplayer part of the game.It's not a bad game but the developer is literally that's it I don't understand why R* is so praised.They hate mods because they know people can do better than them tha's it that's all.Seriously some times this game feels like an early access game that is not completed.And unfortunately Rockstar will never learn.Note from 2017/06/17 Don't buy this crap don't encourage R* nor Takes Two as far as I know 2K and R* are owned by Takes Two do you know how crap incompetent and greedy is 2K? Anyway my important point is that Takes Two has asked made a claim against OpenIV.You know how R* and most devleopers hate mods? You know why? Because they're incompetent that's a fact they know that people can do better than them they know that they can add more and better content and fixes most of their crap.They don't want that you know they want to be the very best even though most of nowadays devleopers and publishers are crap at everything they do at least when it comes to video games and programming that's a fact.Seriously do NOT encourage them stop buying their products don't even pirate them it's not worth it by pirating their games you'll be encouraging them in some kind of manner (pirating more popularity more popularity more buy) simply just ignore them until they decide to wake up and maybe learn how things works.Which probably won't ever happen just don't buy their games not if you are a true/an hardcore gamer who loves the PC gaming with all of its possibilities such as mods 2K R* Take0 Two and most of the other developers and publishers simply do not care. I can't believe that I have wasted 50$ on this crap.Edit 2017 06 26 Take Two reverse the ban of the mod OpenIV but since we have seen their true color you still should not encourage them.IMPORTANT Like many games nowadays this game has memory leaks because we know how developers are such worthless incompetents these days and how much they don't care about the consumers as long as they have money.This game has memory leaks and Rockstar doesn't give a crap about it.You can fix it but I have heard that some got banned for fixing the memory leaks (online gameplay).You see how much incompetent and brainless Rockstar is... Just don't buy their games anymore it is simply not worth it except if you want to affect your computer in the long term.That is up to you.Seriously when will they finally learn how to use their brain instead of being worthless incompetents only good at screwing over everything? That i wonder.I won't be buying any games from Take Two nor from Rockstar be it Grand Theft Auto VI Red Dead Redemption 2 be it whatever i won't buy it unless it is sold for about 3$. Not like they even deserve that much anyway.Simple tip Do NOT pay for shark cards mod the single player game and make all the online only content/vehicles available for single player and laugh at Rockstar and Take Two immaturity incompetence greediness and over exaggerated stupidity.,Grand Theft Auto V

There's honestly a lot of cool chill people who play. Overall I think anyone will have a great experience with GTA 5 whether it's story mode or online ),Grand Theft Auto V
2016-02-25,0,0,174,False,Recommended,Classic fun GTA and some decent new features. The storymode is not so great in this one and features excessive amounts of repetitive banter between the main characters and a story that feels like it goes on forever. Basically this story will leave you wondering where the writers for Vice City went.Online is fun however there is an excessive amount of loading it's filled with grind mechanics because Rockstar thought they could cash out on pay2win mechanics which was wrecked by people using trainers. Racing online is great but there's a lack of playerbase and a lack of people who would race competitively. So I do recommend it for fun but the fun will end eventually..

You'll make your own story.This amount of free content we got would've cost another couple hundred bucs from any other developer (screw you EA Paradox Ubisoft). And you can get it all now for 27.99 A game from 2013 that is still better than all AAA titles from 2017 and doesn't feel tired or outdated in 2018 what other game can boust that?Yes there is a lot of stuff to buy in GTA online but it's all for in game currency that is easy to earn and you'll even enjoy the process. I feel bad for the people that complain they can't buy the new content cause they don't have the time to earn the money but that's life my dudes people grow up and they have to make choices. Thankfully you'll always find people to play the online heists there's lots of players online at any hour have a hour or two to kill? Do a heist get yourself half a million of game currency. Easy. Don't have the time for heist but you want the content? Why do you need it if you don't have the time to enjoy it anyhow? I call t on that.Anyway stop reading and go buy it now and pay full price if you can this game will give you thousands of hours of joy.Have fun you antisocial psychos!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-09,0,0,179,False,Not Recommended,"I just bought this game and I'm almost regreting it... not quite but almost. Let me preface what I'm here to say with this I love this game so far. Story is great. Best GTA stories so far (Maybe second to San Andreas). The gameplay is great. The graphics are pretty awesome as well. I fully intend to play this game a lot and as I don't intend to use mods the whole banning people for mods thing (though stupid) doesn't affect me. There is however one major problem that makes the game almost unplayable. The graphics are great until I get in a car at high speeds or car accidents. They become choppy no matter what I set the graphics to... It will be fine one second then it practically becomes a powerpoint presentation for a moment then catches up with itself. This makes literally any time you drive a horrible experience. Given how much driving there is in this game that's a problem.Steam will say you have played ""5 hours"" of the game... In reality it's been more like 3 hours of gameplay and 2 hours of intermitent tinkering with setting to try and fix the problem. I figured maybe my computer just sucked but I looked online and I am apparently not the only one having this problem. Even people with ultra high end PCs built for smooth gaming are having this problem. Until they fix it I would not recommend anyone buy this game.

I also have this on the PS4 and the multiplayer environment there is also as bad as it is on the computer unless you have a group of friends you can form a gang with.

The watchdog alleges that US based Valve Corporation is contravening the county s consumer laws by not offering refunds on games sold via its digital distribution platform.In documents filed to the Federal Court in Sydney the organisation argues that Valve does not offer refunds on digital games restricts statutory guarantees and places itself under no obligation to repair or replace faulty downloads. The Australian Consumer Law applies to any business providing goods or services within Australia said ACCC chairman Rod Sims. Valve may be an American based company with no physical presence in Australia but it is carrying on business in Australia by selling to Australian consumers who are protected by the Australian Consumer Law. It is a breach of the Australian consumer law for businesses to state that they do not give refunds under any circumstances including for gifts and during sales. Under the Australian consumer law consumers can insist on a refund or replacement at their option if a product has a major fault. Valve has since responded to the allegations. In a statement to US game site Kotaku the spokesperson Doug Lombardi said We are making every effort to co operate with the Australian officials on this matter while continuing to provide Steam services to our customers across the world including Australian gamers. Launched in 2003 the Steam service has become the biggest digital store for PC game sales with over 65 million customers. In 2013 Valve was sued by a German consumer group over Steam s refusal to allow customers to re sell purchased games. However in that case the court ruled against the group.In the UK consumer contract regulations stipulate that purchasers must be given a 14 day cooling off period when buying goods online. However this only applies to tangible goods such as books CDs or clothing. Sites selling games music and other data downloads usually require the user to waive the rights to the cooling off period.In a press release the ACCC has stated that it is seeking declarations injunctions pecuniary penalties disclosure orders adverse publicity orders non party consumer redress a compliance program order and costs. A hearing has been set for 7 October.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,4422,False,Not Recommended,Having played GTA4 for over 1000 hours and then bought GTA5 I can say that I am left with distaste and dis satified.GTA5 is a open world first/third person shooter game. You get to control 3 characters one at a time. Each have a different personality and do not share money or items between each other.The story evolves performing mainly heists like bank robberies. There is barely any original missions to do besides do pre heist missions. I felt the game has been rushed. Copy and pasted missions with different routes.While I find the game a bit fun to play it gets very old fast. The world feels empty. The traffic have a tendency to drive into the path of the player especially when the player is racing on the motorways. I feel the storyline is very predictable just by judging the characters. I had the satisfaction of fooling about in GTA4 like inciting huge shootouts with random gangs and police it is nearly impossible to do the same in GTA5 and if you incite police you do not survive long. The enemies have bullseye precision even at long distances with even the shotguns and police respawn too soon. The police are more aggressive.Some random events are fun but can get repetitive. The weapons are excellent but under powered if equipped by the player. NPC have benefits of increased weapon stats as stated above with the police and their shotguns.Garages are very limited. You can only store about 5 in a shed and 1 at each safehouse.I would have though this game would have potential if it was a combined of Test Drive Unlimited (buying houses and garages) and Just Cause 2 and the older GTA games. But no. It just finds itself so serious and on par of realistic military shooters like ARMA vs Call of Duty.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-04,0,0,427,False,Recommended,Pros Lots of things to do. The side missions are enough to keep you busy/distracted from the main mission. Beautiful graphics and huge map. The biggest map I ever play so far. GTA V Online Plenty of updates (e.g. clothes weapons properties) to keep the game interesting. Cons The online version need patience since we have to wait and wait and wait for players to join. Updates make things worse. My expensive cars are missing and no solution given by the developer. NPCs only adult no kids unrealistic. NPCs also don't react to surroundings. E.g. literally no one use umbrella when raining. No wiper to clear the rain from the windshield. I don't think it's hard to implement. Overall Impressive game and by the time of writing the game is getting much cheaper. Definitely get it!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-27,1,2,314,False,Not Recommended,"0/10 will never buy a R* product again. Weather you are a cheater a modder or just a casual player. All three types of us players can agree. R* sucks. I do not mind modders. I do not mind casuals. I do not mind cheaters so long as they stay out of my way. But we can all agree R* sucks. I never got banned. I never got my chacters whiped. But I do hate the grind. That is why I am not recomending it. I play guild wars 2 swtor and WOW. None of them feel like a mindless unfun grind. Now those are MMOs so you expect a big long haul grind. But those you feel adventure fun and something to do while you grind. GTA Online. You just grind. You buy a lock up bunker VIP car export. Whatever. Point is you buy or steal supplies. You wait REAL hours maybe 4 8 10 depending on whatever thing. Some of these you just wait for the product to be made. Other you steal like cars or office warehouse missions. When you finally waited all those REAL hours waiting/grinding for. You go to do the mission and deliver the supplies. Then you get bombed by some dude in a jet. You lose ALL of those supplies/cars/whatever. You just lost all that. Time. Effort. Energy. Money. All that. Gone. All those hours of waiting gone because SOMEONE ELSE BLEW UP YOUR STUFF. In an MMO other players like in Guild Wars 2 are a pleasure to see. They can walk up and help you. And you both benifit. In SWTOR you see another player. You can help eachother or move on. No problem. In WOW depends what you were doing. Point is. All that mind numbing grind just wasted your time because someone pressed a button to kill you. All that effort destroyied by no effort at all. Imagine you played the game a life. You took all that time and luck to get that much money. You are about to win. Then some dude just randomly joined the game late. Killed you. And you lose everything. Basicly that. Now before I said in MMOs the grind is not so bad. Well that is true. For instance in swtor when you grind. You got interesting story and you can do multiple missions at once in the same area with hardly any loading. You get pretty good rewards for what you do. Lots of cosmetic stuff you can get on the cartel market. I won't even bother to describe the better system of the cartel market for cosmetic stuff vs the GTA Online shark cards for a straight up better gear. In swtor you can do space missions. PVP. PVE. Yes unlike GTA Online PVE and PVP are seperate. No freeroam where you stuff gets blown up after hours of grinding. In SWTOR you can play the entire base game level 50. Your personal character story. for FREE. And if you subscribe ONCE you get ALL the expasions. FOREVER. Good deal. Customer service for swtor is actually good in my case. They helped me get my account back after I lost my password. Very helpful and nice. There customer service saved me hours. They saved my 64 characters I got 64 on the East server because of the server merges. Yay united forces update! In swtor you can play the class story again and again and STILL FIND NEW STUFF YOU HAD NO IDEA ABOUT BEFORE. Many different choices. Basicly the grind in this game is not even noticeable. It is not important. You just think about having fun. You fight enemies. Not the game. In GTA Online you do everything for tiny bit of cash here and there. And still get no where after hours and hours of grinding. And that is what you focus on. The long. Unfun grind. While in swtor you focus on the many many many different things you can do. Like shoot down enemy ships. Do a fun heroic mission. Do an operation. Find datacrons I STILL HATE YOU JAWA BALLON! YOU ARE THE REASON I STILL HATE TATOOINE! I SEE YOU FLOATING UP THERE. MOCKING ME! I WOULD SHOOT YOU DOWN IF I COULD. Baisicly no need to worry about grind. Just have fun. Point of the game right? TO HAVE FUN?! NOT TO SIT AROUND FOR HOURS TO HAVE A CHANCE TO NOT BE BLOWN UP AND LOSE ALL THAT TIME WAITING RIGHT?!!??! Now as I said before. In MMOs like swtor guild wars 2 or WOW it is a blessing to see other players. In GTA Online they might just snip you for no reason other than being conditioned to out of fear of you being conditioned to snip them. In GTA Online they might blow up your cargo after hours of grinding and waiting. You lose everything. As I said many times. While in swtor guild wars 2 or WOW players from what i experinced the other players are eager to help you. They will often take time to teach you new things. They will help you. And you all benifit. In GTA Online one of the CEO things the one where you get cargo to a warehouse and sell it. From what I heard your friends if you got any barely get rewarded. While in the MMOs both YOU AND THEM get rewarded the same. And all of you have fun doing it. No setup no grind no waiting no long load screen in the clouds. Just the mission and the fun it brings. Yes I know I just compaired an online shooter with heists to that of MMOs. To me both are games. Both are things you can put money time and effort into. Both are things that you can play with friends. So in that regard I compared them. If you want your time to be worth it. You want to not worry about unfun grinding? You want something to do and not feel board in the endgame when you basicly got the best gear in the game ? Do you want good customer support? You want to have something where you and friends can pick up no charge no set up and all get equally rewarded? If you answered yes to any of those questions. I recomend MMOs. If your PC can handle GTA V. Then your PC damn well can handle an MMO. Baiscly. I do not recomend. You lose all your time and effort and time for a worthless grind. Yes I know I can make an online solo public session in GTA ONLINE. BUT WHAT IS THE POINT OF FU**ING MULTIPLAYER. THE ONLINE MODE. IF YOU PLAY FU**ING SOLO. I CAME FOR MULTIPLAYER. NOT FU**ING ""THIS GAME IS DESIGNED SO POORLY THAT I HAVE TO STAY AWAY FROM OTHER PLAYERS BY USEING TASK MANGER TO MAKE A SOLO ONLINE SESSION"".",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-15,1,2,105,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto SingleplayerThe story is amazing. I bought the collectors edition for the PS3 and finished the campign within a week. There is so much to do and lots of secrets to discover. There are some RPG like choices in the game that will effect all three characters. So repeated playthroughs or loading previous save files is a must to see all the endings. This is what the online should be however the online portion drags this review down.Grand Theft Auto OnlineThe game is an endless cycle of grind. There is no easy way to earn money without repeatedly doing the game missions over and over. Heists finales are the only way to earn actual money ($400k+) and that's if you host them. If you are part of the finales you would only get about $150k. This only happens if the servers are up and your internet connection is up to par. So many disconnections and failed setups due to timeouts from party memebers.The community is absolute trash. If there wasn't passive mode there would only be constant death. Everyone in the lobby tried to kill you. There is not friendly community in the game. Seems like the people who try to kill you are the people to dedicated their lives to the game. Each new update brings even more expensive items so the cycle of grinding never stops. The only way to keep up with the items if you want them is through the purchasing of shark cards. Which cost real money. There needs to be better ways to earn cash to spend in the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

So like every other normal person i contacted the support because hey they will help me right? Well you're dead wrong my friend.Making a long a story short i took them ONE YEAR to acknowledge my problem and fix it. But i wouldn't call it a fix at all.I got a new copy of the game which sounded nice at first. But when i asked if they can transfer my old online character to the new acc since all of my money cars and everything i own is on that Acc they said it isn't possible.So in the end i waited one year to get nothing. What good is the game if all your progress is lost forever.So in the i come to the conclusion that this is a great game but a pretty poorly runed customer support.The game is great but don't buy it.

2017-06-18,0,0,621,False,Not Recommended,Take my review with a grain of salt though I've played GTA in itself as a series from GTA 3 on. I've made my $70 CAD worth to the full extent in my opinion for this game. I've played both single player and multiplayer extensively on release dates both on PC and the Playstation 3. Modding Controversy I guess we need to shut down a community that existed since 3D GTA in itself existed that didn't even remotely lay a finger on the Online community because OpenIV was only based upon the Single Player sect of Grand Theft Auto 5. Not even doing a single bit of damage to the hackers of the game since OpenIV was a SINGLE PLAYER tool. Why would Take Two and Rockstar do this? Shark Cards.It's clear that they intend to make profit over paying attention to those who make content for free talented individuals who dedicate years of work. The Online game and the many flaws I guess we need to completely disregard the fanbase in which GTA V is based upon with a disappointing grindy gunrunning DLC making another good Shark Card cash farm going on upon ages and ages. Where did the common goal of the game go stealing and theft? This may be an argument to the whole foundation of GTA Online in itself but certain people tend to enjoy the MOBA elements so I won't criticize. However completely GOUGING players of their money releasing obscure cosmetic items and vehicles as opposed to certain TRUE forms of content only for grinding well.... That is another story. The missions for Gunrunning I/E and MC all were somewhat fun to an extent when you initially began. By then you'd have to deal with only playing on public lobbies with that nice warzone you had to go up against. Going explosion after crate explosion hacker after hacker. But lowering mission pays and releasing more and more cars and niche vehicles really do have a point do they? Making multiplayer a warzone full of nuisance vehicles? Hmmmm..... Again I wonder why Take Two and Rockstar would do this? Oh right of course Shark Cards!Removing the probability of Single Player modding forcing people to stick to the Multiplayer modes seems to be of Rockstar's interest. Even when they have some of the highest sales on Steam to ever be obtained all the profit they could ever want yet they still try to bite off of players for Shark Cards and grindy multiplayer. ConclusionDue to this I will no longer support Take Two or even Rockstar for that matter having these incredibly shoddy business practices. I'd suggest you do the same only until Take Two may halt these business practices and bring back the modding that redefined the entirity of the Grand Theft Auto franchise. If you are looking to enjoy the single player buy the game when it is on sale however low you can find it. A solution for Take Two and R* would be to maybe actually implement an anti cheat stop dividing the community and add more content alike to the heists update. Online is somewhat fun provided you are dedicating your time with friends in a private match are into races and heists and some sorts of things. Hackers toxic KOS players and all sorts of other characters are to be found otherwise.Yes I know I sucked at formatting. &lt 3,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-26,0,0,86,False,Recommended,I can't think of that many games that have such a high production value as GTAV has. It's unbelievable. The weather effects are much better than in most games where it actually matters. The storm in dessert is particularly atmospheric.The driving (online) is better than in most arcade racing games I've played. For me it's a great relax to get into a fast car and just drive around.The gun play is as good as in many shooters.The characters are better written than in most RPGs today (I love RPGs and this is a sad truth /). They are interesting and funny and I care about them. Voice acting is of course top notch.It's basically GTA IV on steroids. With character progression (back from San Andreas) with three interesting main characters instead of one. With references to previous games (someone will talk about certain Niko Bellic from Liberty City. There is a mission in the area where CJ from San Andreas lived. There is a character you've played in Lost and Damned DLC and stuff like that)There are even more activities you can do more vehicles bigger map ...It's a great achievement for games.The GTAV Online is a nice addition if it would work correctly.There is a huge problem witch cheaters. They are everywhere they can do anything and they will worsen your game experience. The loading times are terrible. My friend has this weird problem when he is sitting in car with me he has a huge lags. But it's only when he is in car with me.There is one game design problem. You gain ranks as you play in Online. And all the gear is dependent on that. So you can't buy a great weapon if you are not a certain rank. So the players who play for longer time have not only better statistics but also they have access to weapons which you don't have. And if you buy a good car and mod it you are nearly invincible while shooting from it.***SO If you are thinking about buying it just for the Online portion of the game I would do a research if I were you. There are problems and a lot of them. But if you also want to play the single player campaign then go for it. It's a great game and you'll enjoy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

No seamless switching of characters. No fun.If your buying it for online then dont. Heres why 1. The economy of GTA online is completely ruined. You have three options. A) Play normally/Make no money/Dont have fun B) Exploit Cheat/Make ALOT of money/Have fun C)Spend IRL money on SharkCards/Make no money/Lose real money/Lose your home and family2. The community is .

2018-04-18,0,0,15,False,Not Recommended,The story missions are fun. All single player content is great. The issue is if you're planning on playing anything online. Here's some issues. 1) Pay to win. If you cant drop $1000 USD the moment you log in to GTA V Online to get everything ( apartment armored vehicles etc ) then you wont have fun. The game is insanely toxic to an absurd degree. 2) Deathwish. The respawns have always been absolutely terrible. If you get gunneddown by someone it'll drop you fifty feet away. Or within quick driving distance you repeatedly kill you.3) Ammo drop. Every time you die ( and you will alot ) you drop ammo. Early on you'll find you have zero ammunition after getting killed by an edgy boi in an armored karuma. 4) Hackers. I have yet to play in a GTA online server that doesnt have some form of hacking in it. The big issue is if you do nothing wrong but a hacker ( script kiddie ) drops any money into your account Rockstar targets YOU not the hacker. 5) Slowest skill progression ever. It takes grinding and grinding and grinding to level up your max health driving handling etc. I spent maybe 200 hours on Xbox One GTA V and I barely hit level 70. 6) Pay to win. I already said it before but it's a massive problem Rockstar ignores. If you try to play the base game you get rolled. You will not have fun ( unless you're into that kinda stuff ) and you'll feel like there's no way to win. Especially when they introduce vehicles that take many RPG hits to destroy. My suggestion is never play GTA V Online. Play in your own private server maybe with some friends. But out in the regular servers you get demolished at every turn. Play the single player avoid the online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,828,False,Not Recommended,I've spent over 600 hours of my life in this game since December 2015 I think I have some weight when I want to stop and say for a moment that this game is not worth a single bit of that time. Everything is behind a paywall or timesink OR a level barrier first and foremost. You don't have access to everything at Ammunation until your character is level 120. A $2k vehicle modification that's considered 'expensive' in vanilla is at minimum in the $25k 50k range in online and there's no inflation to affect those prices. It takes you just as long in vanilla to earn $25k as it does in Online. You will not even begin to start having 'fun' until you breach the $10mil mark in total money accumulated on a character.Vehicle weapons are unbalanced to hell and back. The Hydra is broken beyond relief in terms of overpoweredness but it gets a lot of shark cards sold so it will never be properly nerfed. This goes for a lot of more minor stuff too but if you think you might enjoy open lobbies in this game the Hydra will make sure you won't. Ever. This game only appeals to the rich griefer genre of players. For Rockstar that means loads of money in shark card microtransactions as griefers will become impatient to get good griefing tech and a horrible time for the rest of us that just want to play this game. I would refund this game but by the time I realized the glaring problems with the Online community I was already knee deep at 15 hours. Don't buy this game.

Okay before we get into the whole modding crisis lets first talk about the dlc. A recent DLC in gta is Gunrunning. I wasnt even that hyped for it i just checked the date of release and marked it. I started grinding hard which is another completely part of this game. The cost of essential items are way to ing high. And at the rate you earn money you will be grinding AT LEAST 10 hours just for MABYE 3 mill. The only way to get money faster is to buy shark cards and/or get modded money. However the sharkcards are so ing overpriced like jeses christ. 8 million is $50USD. 8 million in gta wont even buy you a ing yatch. Yatchs are 12 million. And the expenses of cars houses clothes ITS ING BROKEN!!!!! An then modders half the ing time wont even drop money because they are to busy being so good on rockstar for taking them or most of them out. Now them for taking down OpenIV. I've been using OpenIv since it came out on singleplayer. Also why take it down? The system ALREADY automatically detected Singleplayer mods and OpenIV could only be used IN single player. And if you wanna get away from the compleitity of GTAV and play GTAIV well you ing cant because ING GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE DOESNT WORK ANY DAMN MORE.

you can make get your masters degree and die before the loading screeen ends. then you get killed by commie modders which put you in cage and beat you. proTurns all your friends into due to greed in heists allows you to turn low level into slaves for CEO work like my friend temmylenny did to my other friend DarkELk my brother got banned twice due to modding then he Rebought the game with another modded menu then he will most probably get banned again cons everything also the police raid your coke factories and steal your staff and turn into sex slaves.the game also reward you for not playting in lfor 2 year with a million dollers.the heist setups are crap due to randoms not f cking coordinating with you and they also f ckin compain they dont have enopught money from it also doesnt help that there is a pay 2 win option called sharkcards basically giving privileged russian fattys options to ing rek u with shark cards. well writing this beutiful ing review my friend is stuck in mobile operations centre ing t posing. also the game ing charges you nine hundred grand to fire a ing orbital cannon which YOU ing own. also the game has aim assist which is just gay we aint no console peasents. also the game price at the time 30 is just overpriced for this commie game which robs you blindly. u would gain more sense of achivement by whatching a fatty run a marathon well being set on fire and rolling down hiilll. #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA #NOTMYGTA

2016-06-11,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,Well let me begin with the fact that when this was released on PC (a year late) I was super pumped. The game was fun online was massive the story was immersive and the graphics took GTA to a new level. I loved playing with my friends through missions and just screwing around with each other in freeplay. Alas our fun was cut short when Rockstar decided that instead of having fun and be coming successful the player with either have to spend eternity grinding or BUY THEIR GOD FORSAKEN SHARK CARDS. Now online is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Rockstar does not care about the players. They keep raising prices on new items. They constantly see glitches in their game and just do not fix them. GTA V is ruined.It's a shame too because I loved the single player. I had tons of fun playing through the story and actually getting 100% completion. Everything about the story was fun the game took GTA where it had never been before. Also easter eggs and allusions foretold of great dlc to come... Whelp it is not happening. Rockstar doesn't give a damn and decided that those shark cards were the way to go.In conclsuion buy this game if it is on sale for less than $30. Anything more than that is not worth it. I love the game and wish it were still awesome. Watching what Rockstar has done is like watching a fun loving puppy grow old and slowly degrade into a tired worn out dog you still love it but just wish it was over.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-03,0,0,7,False,Not Recommended,I usually have no problem with DRM but when you're trying to play the game singleplayer (I use Xbox One to play this online/MP PC is for beautiful mods and playing in VR) and the launcher decides to break and the back up launcher won't install I guess you could say I have a problem with DRM.Bad developers using bad methods to fight cheaters. Actually I believe it's even more likely that they are trying to stop people making their own MP clients to justify their in world purchases with real money more so than cheaters because cheaters still happen even on consoles.GTA V in general though? It's been fun to play and I really appreciate the first person mode I would say I prefer it overall on my Xbox One because there's no obvious DRM BS but there's also no mods sadly.Should you buy it? I say no not until online dies and they relax the DRM crap or at least make it easier to play singleplayer / offline with mods without the launcher/social club.,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-08-09,0,0,2041,False,Not Recommended,This is just a review of gta online I've only bought this game for online and only played it for online so if you are going to buy this for Online then this might be for you.Gta is a ton of fun just getting it out there but.. the path gta online is taking on the other hand is the reason I stopped playing. I was lucky when I bought this game it was right before all the military DLC's so I had a chance to somewhat get the original gta online feeling by just playing as a criminal. Gta online at it's current state is a nightmare they keep releasing more sci fi military vehicles as a flying bike with missiles or just more military vehicles in general. Everything they release keep getting more and more expensive and it is still as hard to earn cash as it was a year ago. Let's get the ''Oh but you can just earn money by doing insert way to earn money to buy it'' t right away yes you could afford the things they release if you grind hard enough but there is a limit on how much of a grind a game can become and gta has reached that limit a long time ago. What's the fun in a game if you feel forced to earn money by cheating or just buying virtual cash with irl cash. That is coming from the guy who loves the feeling of accomplishment.Gta online's money system is what I could see a free game have but remember this game was a $60. But it gets worse then just the system gta online have lost the feel of you start as a small criminal to a crime lord you now become some hero saves that saves the world with sci fi equipments. The worse part is that they Rockstar keeps releasing more military vehicles that ruins the balance the combat system I've never actually seen Rockstar went back and re balance a vehicle when it is released it will stay like that. There are so many griefers now when you join a game now thanks to Rockstar releasing so much unbalanced vehicles. There is LITERALLY a satelite you buy and then pay 100k for a shot to kill any player you want one time. So? Would a recommend this game? No would I recommend it if we want back to 2013 Yes I would 100% Rockstar have ruined this amazing game's online mode for greed. It's as simple as that.,Grand Theft Auto V

What really grinds my gears is multiplayer and the fact that Rockstar has no sympathy towards their community. There are false ban reports being ignored massive waves of modders over taking servers without getting removed everything is over priced and over played (Literally when I say over played I can't emphasize it enough. Once you played all the heists (including doomsday) you will get sick of this game.) as well as Rockstar basically forcing Shark cards down our throats because ""If you don't buy this you won't make it."" Sadly this game has become a pi**ing contest whoever has the best sh*t gets respected and has authority over others. It's ridiculous really. Not even worth 60$ with how over priced the damn cards are. I would only ever recommend buying this garbage on G*2*A or wait till' they decide to throw it on a steam sale.I'll repeat this SINGLEPLAYER is really the only great thing about this garbage truck of a game.

The online is filled with hackers where if you're in a room with one you will be banned and then unable to play your game. So I don't play online. (Edit I played online for 15 minutes total as in that is my total online play time I immediately ran into a hacker and it ruined the entire session. So apparently this old review is still relevant so I will not be changing my review anytime soon. The game also crashes a lot for pretty much anyone I play with. Avoid this game for the online mode.)There are plenty of guns in the game so you can have lots of fun customizing them and then using them on endless helicopters that the police spam at you. Another police chopper literally respawns seconds after you destroy it. After a while they send two after you and yes the broken copter train never ends I swear I would invest in a company that made them in the game and never go broke. So the only attractive feature after you beat the missions in the game is having some fun with the cops until your just shooting down helicopters. It gets pretty old buy it on sale but I had my fun for about thirty dollars. Don't bother with online because it is completely riddled with modders and the gameplay is tilted in favor of getting you to buy overpriced ""shark cards"". Just imagine paying almost four dollars for only 100k in GTA money. Don't buy this game with online in mind.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-11-02,0,0,983,False,Not Recommended,Where to start.I am having a lot of fun with this game but theres just so much garbage to sift through to find anything redeemable about it. If you pay more than say 30 bucks for it though you might find yourself regretting it.First off Rockstar like almost every major company DOES. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. PC. USERS. This failure of a PC port is pretty solid evidence of that.Crashes every hour on the hour incompatible control schemes for some vehicles loads of out of boundry clip areas horrible kmb situations force you to switch to controller in some areas the aiming itself is god awful if you try and free aim vehicle inconsistency will have you pulling out your hair the ambient ai throughout the game is purely a nuisance and theres no god damn reason Rockstar should have programmed it that way. Oh it goes on for a little more but whats the point.This game actually has a pretty short single player which I find unusual since you have to spend a good chunk of the day downloading this game. The online experience is complete trash unless you spend time messing around friends. I would recommend purely playing the single player just for the story. You will be spending quite a bit of time grinding in the online portion. The characters themselves really have no flavor to them. This is where this game took a nosedive compared to its predecessors. I actually loathed the main characters in this game. The pacing of playthrough is simply switching back and forth between characters and setting up missions. It culminates to this mess of a few hours of time killing on this small island in the middle of nowhere. Basically you sink a bunch of cash for a few hours.The online aspect of the game is more toxic than a nuclear fallout zone. Rockstar does not moderate in the slightest. Cheaters with menu mods run this game no questions asked. I know a few new guys who pretty much gave up on this game because a combination of the update items/vehicles and the cheaters make it damn near impossible for new players to get solid footing.

2019-01-16,0,0,55,False,Not Recommended,I did not like this game as much as GTA 4. It clearly had more money poured into it higher production values and all but this is a prime example of the fact that more money ! better game.I found the story excessively ridiculous and over the top and the characters either unrelateable or simply despicable with no redeeming qualities. I had fun playing through the story the gameplay is fun enough but it didn't draw me in like GTA 4's story did. It was a decent length but I don't feel compelled to play through it ever again.The game has a nice big map with diverse areas to explore but I was disappointed with the lack of a snowy area past the very beginning of the story since that was very pretty. I was also irritated by the lack of any map icons for shops/restaurants for regaining health in the game. It's so much easier to lose health in this game but so much harder to replenish it because of this one oversight. It's a bloody simple thing that makes so much of a difference. I don't know why they changed that. To add insult to injury those map icons are displayed in multiplayer.The game also reeks of monetization. Multiplayer is clearly an overt cash grab with the money cards and it's clear that this game was made to bring in money through the online mode. I played very little of the multiplayer as it doesn't interest me so I don't have much to say about it except for my irritation at the scummy business practices surrounding it and the fact that it took resources and focus away from the singleplayer mode.I can't be bothered to install Windows on my computer to play this again so unless the next GTA game is either extremely good or gets ported to Linux I think this is the last GTA game I will have played and the last time I will have played it. Grand Theft Auto has no soul anymore it's a parody of itself. The series has come to embody the money whoring insipidity that it makes a point of satirizing. How ironic.,Grand Theft Auto V

You need to mod the single player to bring in any of the multiplayer DLC so this denys people of that experience forcing many to move onto the online and a certain percentage of them to pay real money for their in game millions.Considering they sold this game to people 3 times (360/PS3 PS4/One then PC) this is disgusting.

I've put more hours into the GTA franchise than I have multiple games put together (talking over 20 000 hours over the past decade and a half). I was eagerly awaiting the announcement and trailers of GTA6. I was looking forward to more Lazlo more shameless mocking of politics more blatant disregard for being politically correct more racial and class stereotypes because Rockstar are masters at delivering this stuff alongside an engaging story in a world where you can do almost anything you want.But Take Two Rockstar's publisher has made it clear they are Anti Gamer. They can dress it up however they want but removing the ability to mod the game after the option has been around for years IS Anti Gamer. At this stage of evolution of gaming modding is something developers especially AAA developers should be incorporating into their games as a default feature. And yet here we have a publisher who would rather remove an aspect of the game that's been around for years.If modding is not an option built in for GTA6 I will not be giving my money to Take Two. I don't want to stiff Rockstar but I will not give my money to a publisher who hates me. I will be looking up what other games Take Two publishes and if there's a title I want that they would get money for.... looks like I'll have to find another way to play it.You cannot take a deuce on your customers and expect to keep getting their money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-20,1,2,81,False,Recommended,IntroReview based soley on the single playerI spent years waiting to play this and I think I'm disappointed with it. Not majorly but it is a bit lacking. It's got the weakest characters and the weakest story I've played in a GTA game. I'm also not a big fan of the atmosphere.The first 15 or so hours are a blast though. My main issue with the game is that there's nothing to do in the world besides the missions. The open world itself is dull.The Great ++The game length is incredibly long in a good way. I have 54 hours or so and 50% completion. That's slightly more than an hour per percent. Not bad at all.++First person is an awesome huge addition to the series++Presentation is top knotch++Lots of vehicles and every different type of vehicleThe Good +Radio stations are awesome+Voice acting is amazing for the most part+The world looks and feels alive+The map is way better than GTA IV+Artstyle is a huge improvement from GTA IV+Optimization is a gigantic improvement from GTA IV. I get far more consistent framerates than GTA IV.+Changing your car is awesome+Weapon modifying is hell awesome+Cheats are coolThe Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal + Vehicle physics aren't great. Worse than GTA SA and I personally preferred GTA IV's. Not bad though. +Soundtrack sounds 80's and yet it isn't 80's?The Bad Game is graphically showing age Not a lot of music in the stations and the picks are trash The main characters are pretty 2D What's the point in upgrading and fancying up vehicles if when you destroy them they're gone forever? Besides the impound but there's no picture of the vehicle you're picking. What's the point in dressing up your character if they keep changing every time I swap to them? Game takes forever to start off Earning money is so goddamn boring and tedious There's barely anything to spend money on You take too much damage from falling out of vehicles. It makes driving bikes far more risky and there's a good chance you'll die from exiting your vehicle even at a slow speedThe Horrible The game and its world is so empty and boring no matter how real it looks The characters in this are easily the worst in the series. They're uninteresting and unoriginal. I actually don't like Trevor at all. His psychopathic tendencies and overacting get tiring quickly. Fire fights are easily the greatest aspect of this game and a big improvement from GTA IV or any other game in the series. And yet they're so rare in the missions. Missions are mind numbingly repetitive. Most of what you do is drive from point to point in this game. Not a lot else. Cops get on you way too easy and what's the point in fighting them if there's practically no way of winning besides running away? And running away from them is so annoying and goes away from where you're trying to go. Cops suck. It is truly a chore to explore the world because it's so easy to get caught by cops for nothing. While it's a fantastic addition first person is clunky and shooting is unenjoyable from odd movement camera and animations This game loves to introduce you to a bunch of interesting side chracters and then ditch them within a few hours. Annoying as hell.Sound 6.5/10Graphics 8.5/10Gameplay 7.5/10Content/Replayability 9/10Overall 7.5/10ConclusionAll there really is to do are the missions.

Want a car that can shoot rockets and fly? No problem that will be 5 million dollars and about 5 6 hours a day for a month of your time.The hackers and Rockstar itself ruined this game.

When playing online my game usually runs 50 60 fps but at times it has some insane fps drops that force me to play the game at 10 25 fps. Lately my game has been continuously crashing out of nowhere. Sometimes some objects won't load etc.I've tried numerous fixes some of which help a little some of which make it way worse this has been happening for over a year and there's still no patch.And they attempted to ban OpenIV some time ago. Ridiculous.It's quite clear the developers don't really care about the PC gaming community.This AAA game has worse optimization than a lot of survival Early Access indie titles.I'd love to recommend this game since when it works it's really fun but most of the time it barely works.If the numerous problems I've been having with this game ever get fixed I'll update this review but as of right now I highly doubt it.*UPDATE * Now I have a new PC the above issue never got solved BUT it STILL has major issues. Just recently I lost over 140k in game money because it kept crashing each time I bought supplies for my bussiness and then didn't even give me the supplies they simply disappeared.

No it's not about glamorous Sima are you dreaming about a game that would be a copy of real life with all its capabilities and freedoms? Where you can wake up watch a couple of minutes of TV then put on a suit and go to work then go to the bar skip one by one and finish the day with a beauty company. And tomorrow everything will turn completely differently. Surely yes. GTA5 a fundamental continuation of the series which is a perfect example of joint creative work of designers scriptwriters and programmers. Obviously the task of the authors was to transfer the user on the other side of the screen where the player gets so involved in the role of the character that he does not distinguish himself from it. GTA5 put everything in its place once again demonstrating to everyone a real sign of quality. Developers from Rockstar unconditional leaders and real geniuses in the field of the concept created by them. Each new part of the series raises the bar to a new level is it really that after GTA5 there will still be unconquered heights?

Nah i'm just playing I cheated that cash in so i'm not too butthurt but It doesn't change the fact that I seriously do not enjoy this game. The singleplayer is fun but not worth a whole purchase (maybe get it on sale). The Multiplayer which was the side I thought i'd spend hours with is such a boring grind there wasn't a single heist that was actually fun to do or even worth doing. So really it's no wonder I cheated and so many others did. They give you three options Waste your time grinding (worst option imo) Spend your (or your parents) hard earned cash or cheat. What option sounds the best to you when laid out? When all the fun stuff is locked behind money and levels that are so tedious to get it makes your game a chore.

If you don t have any real world money to spend on gta you cannot get anything new and you would have to spend hours grinding for cash. People who can spend money just sail right through everything. anytime something new arrives they can just buy it while regular players have to spend months or days.

2017-01-27,1,2,1630,False,Not Recommended,"Tl Dr Same old story of Singleplayer mode being great and GTAO being wackGTAO is hands down either the worst online multiplayer game (from technical not gameplay standpoint) or it is an alpha/beta stage game in disguise here's why (+ some other nuisances) 1. Sharkcards (ding!)2. Can get stuck during shoppingMost likely being caused by online service being temporarily down. Still for an AAA Rockstar game that's indie level game issues.3. People leaving during heistsPerhaps trolls but most likely victims of GTAO general connectivity issues which apparently will never get sorted out. Never. Truly a horrible practise. Apparently Rockstar doesn't know how it is to play with random people. No activity should end due to some player leaving the game. If the activity will prove too difficult/lame without the players who have left then the rest of players will decide by themselves whether they want to stay or not... But yeah let's keep slowing player's progress boyos. Gotta sell them Scamcards! 4. People can get stuck during heist setupsEspecially at the end cutscene of Pacific Standard Job forcing people to quit which MAY not reward the player. Happened to one of my buddy during the 12 000 000 challenge. Fortunately we've sorted it out by replaying PSJ which was the best thing we could have done...5. Strong emphasis on realism sacrifice of fun of certain elements.It's apparent that Rockstar wants to make GTA games seem realistic and that's generally not a bad thing but in Online it gets really tiresome fast.This also results in sluggish character movement Not actually speaking about the speed at which your character moves but all the ""realistic"" events like turning around climbing climbing ladders etc. Me no likey this in Online at all.Entering a narrow spaces like a doorway does prove difficult at times especially when turning around is involved.6. civilian AIThe highly unrealistic driving experience AI drivers provide is nowhere as bad as in this GTA instalment. NPCs' mind turns to the one of a scared deer upon gunshot. This results in NPCs running into everything even doing U turns to follow their threat (instead of escaping it duh). Undoubtedly a game mechanic for making player's life harder but a really stupid looking one.7. Inventory messThere is too many guns that act very much the same (ARs pistols SMGs in particular) which only makes a huge mess in inventory. This can be sorted out by having a. CEO officeb. A Gunlocker...which would cost roughly GTAO$ 1.500.000 and doesn't seem to work in Missions and Heists.8. NPC immunity to headshots after being bodyshotOnce you bodyshot an NPC headshot damage no one shot kills them. If they hide behind an obstacle it may take even a minute to kill someone. Have I mentioned this game is slow?9. Broken progress trackingManaged to accomplish Criminal Mastermind challenge twice but received $10 000 000 instead of $12 000 000. The reason behind this is (according to the game) that I haven't done All in Order and Loyalty challenges which is IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS while attempting Criminal Mastermind. Out of all people I've managed to accomplish the challenge with only I was met with yet another of Noobstar's result of incompetent programming for their ever broken online service. They're like DarkSydePhil of programming ""There was nothing we could do""10. Long loading timesStarting the game joining online joining most of majority online activities cutscenes... and eventually some stupid glitch prolonging even more. Have I mentioned this game is slow as ?11. Soon after finishing a heist setup an online error occurred which put me back to singleplayer. On top of that I was no longer able to open main menu resulting in qutting and wasting time on loading even more. Happened once though.12. Unnecessary AFK counter in certain activitiesThat's an ok practise in particular activities but why in freemode and activities done solo? Also why kicking from online is even faster when one minimizes the game?13. Unexplainable temporary game freezing during online (lasting 1 5 secs up to a minute). Supposedly caused by having custom soundtracks but I've learned that's not actually the case. The game runs at 80 100 fps for me so it is not an performance issue. It's just programming again. No other game I own has such a thing not even a GTA game not even GTA4/ELFC which supposedly runs on the same/similar game engine.14. Heists are randomly unavailableSometimes when you want to launch a heist as a leader you simply can't. Either join somebody's heist or restart the darn game AGAIN. Happened numerous times for me and my buddies.15. Cargobob may drop a carried tank (usually when a player is inside it) during resupply missions in Gunrunning which may result in failure.16. Lazy attempt at saving GTAO from cheaters by shutting down OpenIV. Fortunately TakeTwoMiddleFingerUpTheAss and OpenIV devs came to some sort of agreement which is a ing miracle.17. Joining GTAO directly instead of going into singleplayer first takes much much longer to load. Personally it never loaded into GTAO for me. Gotta take the longer path but longer path also means a longer path to Scamcards. Rock$tar you better fix this.18. During Pacific Standard Job finale the job randomly fails right upon entering the bank quite often. Not a biggie but it still delays stuff and simply shouldn't be present by now.19. All Cunning Stunt vehicles performance has been lowered significantly in order for Fraudstar to sell whatever new is added which after a while will be nerfed once again (obviously) to sell newer models. What a shameless dishonest practise you got there Jewstar. Granted you want people to pay the full game price + 15 euro for $GTAO 8 000 000 this shouldn't be surprising to anyone. 20. Entering warehouse while requesting your personal car won't be delivered however the cooldown will still apply. Not a biggie. You just gotta wait. Did I mentioned this game tries to be the slowest AAA action game on the market?21. Sometimes NPCs armed with assault rifles can occasionally shoot in bursts with much increased rate of fire usually resulting in cheap deaths if not behind a cover. Homage to cheaters? Perhaps...22. During Import/Export if your game will hang for mere seconds your car that is being imported to the warehouse may simply go off for no reason at all. Oh I know why to hinder player's progress that's why... Happened twice so far23. GTAO service may be down for a moment which is something that has right to happen. What shouldn't happen is the money player is earning that moment that MAY be completely void. Happened twice during car export. $GTAO 160 000 down the . This is an equivalent of one day of work and all you get at the end is a middle finger.24. Ruiner 2000 can't be used in Missions and Heists but a more lethal Weaponized Tampa can. Unexplainable.25. Whatever Rockstar's result of incompetence will show as next. Stay tuned for more.Conclusion It all points out toward the fact that Rockstar is either highly incompetent when it comes to online games or GTAO is at alpha/beta stage of development. There's no other reasonable explanation for this. And they expect people to buy Scamcards for online quality this pathetic? Seriously. Cease the idea of including multiplayer in your games and stick to what you guys truly prow at. If people want online they will make one themselves. Look at SAMP MTA or even FiveM which all provide a complete freedom unlike your grindy embarrassing mess. Ever wondered why people tend to cheat $GTAO? Because GTAO's premise was a mistake from the very start...I shouldn't really have given this review a negative review since it's ""roughly half of the content"" that blows so so much but the level of ttery present in it is in inacceptable level.",Grand Theft Auto V

You're forced to be in an open session with a bunch of idiots if you want to earn some money and a fair amount of those idiots are PayToWin. So in order to make money you have to try to avoid people who spent actual money to get items to with people trying to grind up money in a long and not so fun way. Rockstar keeps adding more and more crazy to the only online. That's good but the fact that akmost every new item always costs somewhere above one million is insane and just plain stupid. Not to mention the horrible ceo work. Go fetch this package far at sea while getting shot at by a helicopter while you're trying to fetch just one package so you can go put that in your storage. Then sit through two loading screens as you need to go both in and out of the storage. Then go do the same with the other packages but beware there might be a flying delorean out to get you because some PayToWin doesn't have anything better to do.

2017-05-12,0,0,19,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a sequel to the masterpiece known as Shaq Fu for the Sega Genesis and Super NES in 1994. It expanded on the wonderlustful gameplay of the original and has added wonderful additions to the combat system such as the contriversal L button targetting system originating from the Zelda video game series. I especially love the new gamemodes such as the turn based strategy sections of the game that give me fond callbacks of the Fire emblem series or the puzzle game sections reminicient of Huniepop for the Vitual Boy. And man the online mode for GTA5 is without a doubt the best online that has ever existed in a video game not including the online mode for Matrix Online because of its godlike exclusive tier in the brilliance of server technology. The story mode of Grand Theft Auto V is lacking in areas and i feel could have touched more on the size of franklins massive dong however i feel that because of the lack of such the game stops itself from being a 10/10.8/10 needs more franklin dong,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-10,0,0,185,False,Recommended,Rockstar Games has had a successful Grand Theft Auto franchise for over a decade. With the release of Grand Theft Auto V the franchise became an international phenomena. Featuring Online play Heists and the most ambitious storyline/gameplay experience yet Grand Theft Auto V has shattered all expectations and raised the bar for the future of the series.In Grand Theft Auto V you play as several different characters transferring between them to accomplish various tasks. Each Character has their own storyline side quests and contribution to the over arching story within Grand Theft Auto V. Familiar features such as Flying Lung Capacity Stamina Strength Driving Skill all make a return requiring you to manage each characters individual traits. Heists are performed using a combination of player characters whom you switch between for various tasks within the Heist as well as an NPC Crew you must select based on their skill and/or share of the profit their assistance will cost. An Active stock market manipulated through various side quests will grow your bank and let you live in the lap of luxury.Grand Theft Auto V also had a complete online setup allowing players to create their own Avatars who can do Missions Heists and Challenges with other online players. Owning Property vehicles and more allows players to customize their Grand Theft Auto Online experience and while there occasional problems with other players online using cheats/hacks the overall experience can be enjoyable. Even 2 years after it's release Grand Theft Auto V is still a fun dynamic game offering hours of enjoyable gameplay. For those who wish to experience 100% completion you will find the sheer amount of content to be more than adequate.

2015-05-06,1,25,62,False,Not Recommended,While the game is fun I don't think it warrants its $60 price point. This was yet another buggy Rockstar tittle this time after waiting over a year and a half for the PC version and it comes out with the broken mouse sensitivity affected by frame rate bug that previous Rockstar titles have had which I find unacceptable. Support tickets go weeks unanswered and when they do get answered its just a generic response that has nothing to do with the issue.Bottom line Between the banning of players for the use of mods in singleplayer (like the FOV fix) and lack of proper mouse support I can't recommend this game.https //youtu.be/oMOyvl R83U,Grand Theft Auto V

Even new players are getting banned so I suggest you don't buy this game yet and wait for Rockstar to fix that.

As a veteran of this game being Suspended once and having my Level 130 Character Office MC Garages Properties Etc. wiped thanks to Hackers and Online Modders once due to no fault of my own and having to build one back up all over again once this game really isn't all that fun to play anymore. Recently since the update all the MCs are buggy and you WILL LOSE your product if you sell due to some random game glitch or session error or the like. Import Export will also give you issues when trying to sell getting stuck and forcing you to close the game. The Game Randomly Crashes a lot also. Coupled with the fact that they at any time can do as they please without you having any recourse just goes to show how much they care about the players. Open up a ticket in support and they will tell you to restart your connection or provide a video of the already occurred issue. Or better yet waste your time again to satisfy them that the problem is with the game only for them to say we are looking into the issue further as a result and never contact you back secretly closing the ticket. I have lost personal vehicles product items etc. and if you dare ask them for compensation their response is we need a verified loss Really? This was the last straw GREED is what Rockstar and Take Two are all about I am done with them and any future games.UPDATE 7/11/17 So it turns out the MC missions glitch is acutally a failure of Rockstar Quality Control when they released this new DLC update.

2017-06-17,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,I wasn't going to follow in the trend of leaving a negative review on behalf of OpenIV. In fact but I've found more reason to dislike Take Two. This began when Take Two announced that they thought GTA 5 was undermonetised. Anyone who has visited the store page can tell this is false and anyone who has played knows this is outrageous. It pisses me off more than it should because the existing (and extreme) monetisation is for GTA Online which is why I haven't seen story mode updates that I've been wishing for since Day 1. On top of this the game is four years old and is still generating income from the current monetisation which is of course orchestrated with their outrageous pricing and constant introduction of even more expensive content. To declare this undermonetisation is ridiculous. Skyrim is only two years older than GTA 5. I guarantee Take Two has received more money from the current monetisation than Bethesda has seen from the Special Edition or any sales in a while for that matter. Now is this the result of greed or just a stupid person in a position to make decisions? I got my answer when Take Two attacked OpenIV. There is no possible way an intelligent person would make such an advance on the very community that generates the constant flow of income. And so maybe when Take Two notices the drop in sales they will realise that this will not just blow over. But even when that happens I'm not going to forgive Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

No Grand Theft Auto 5 is more than that it is a game which creates a huge expansive open world for the player to explore a game that is both funny enjoyable and excruciatingly brutal. A game which manages to be an amazingly entertaining parody of not only other games but also movies consumerism social media conflicting ideologies government and much more. Grand Theft Auto 5 is not just a video game. No. This is the single greatest parody of modern day America found within the interactive medium.

2017-09-04,0,0,582,False,Not Recommended,"I'll continue to play this game off and on but I can't recommend it to new players because their ""free"" DLC is about as free as Cheez Its are made of real cheese.I'll explain the microtransaction problem using their Gunrunner's DLC...To participate in gunrunners you need to buy a bunker (starts at $1.16mil). This will let you sell guns and unlock parts for the other DLC in the set. However they've come up with a new discount mechanic where if you do the gunrunning missions you get a $500k $1mil price break on the vehicles (which seems nice until you realize the new vehidles are $500k $1mil more expensive than previous dlc). Except to do those missions you'll need a moblie operations center which is another $1.25mil. Oh and if you want to actually use any of the extra unlocks you've been researching expect to pay another $995k for the weapon+vehicle workshop (you could pay just $245k for the weapon workshop but then you'd lose out on half the unlocks).All told it's a minimum $3.41mil to get up and running with the DLC and that's before you've bought any of the new weapons or vehicles. Now while you *could* grind for in game cash that usually averages around $200k/hr so you're looking at 17hrs of grinding (this assumes you're stuck in public lobbies. the only way to get those numbers up without cheating is to find a gang that only does missions). Orrr you could get a whale shark card for USD$49.99 that (conveniently) gets you $3.5mil. Is that worth it? Well even if you make minimum wage ($7.25 in the US) you'd still gross $123.25 in 17hrs so technically yes. Then again the game itself is $59.99 so you're also practially buying the game all over again.At any rate now that you've gotten it all setup here's where the real kicking begins. Even after doing the missions and getting the discounts you're still looking at $800k to $2.6mil EACH to buy the new vehicles and that doesn't include any of their upgrades. Not only that but you only get the discount if you started the mission. Did the mission as an associate? Too bad. You've got to pony up the bunker money and run the mission again yourself. Oh any don't expect a heist style payout either. These missions pay the same $10 $20k as as any other mission. (and one more little poke in the eye is that the bunker's daily maintenance fee is over $9k.)Unfortunately their newest Smuggler's Run dlc is shaping up to be the exact same thing and I don't expect them to move away from this model going forward. The finance and felony dlc started the trend with adding ceos then the import/export and biker dlcs each expanded on it with the need for buying new separate bases to access new dlc features and now with ""discount"" vehicle prices the push for microtransactions is getting worse and worse.When you add this to the fact that hacking is still rampant and the public lobbies are like walking face first into a hornet's nest the time you have to invest just isn't worth it. It's a shame because the game is a hell of a lot of fun to play when it's not comlpletely ing you over.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-26,1,3,352,False,Recommended,"Product received for free. GTA V is a child of a society of pop culture and the popular media. And Rockstar knows about all kinds of pop culture. And with their budget and the massive franchise that is GTA they've given themselves a real wide pallette to play with. It's all over this game. There are moments of greatness and even beauty in this game and then some of it is the same old same old. But the game really really really is fun. Rockstar are trying to raise the bar. No one's near what they are doing other open world games aren't even on the same planet.People look at this game as a kind of playground and yeah that's right. But playing it feels like more. Take the first open world mission you steal a car drive it to a parking lot the same old. You get in the car drive forward and the sense of open world freedom is familiar. But while you drive towards that lot you look around and see a world which truly does feel alive. Such an enormous amount of work went into creating the game's environment. Each street is alive.Actually that first drive is only a taste. Los Santos is like an actual city teeming with detail the world feels real. This is not like other open worlds lifeless and lazy.Very often the crowd of people forming outside a building will make you wonder what's going on inside. You walk through a shopping street and suddenly you're biking in Vinewood Hills. Then night comes and the game feels new and absolutely incredible. That's design that's effort Rockstar seriously polished this world beyond any other world I've seen so far in games. Each district feels different and each building has a place. Each house road even ing lampposts are meticulously crafted. That's what I call an open ""world"".""Look here go there come here look around"". That's all over this game. And then flying a helicopter as high as you can just to see what happens then jumping out for the first time all of Los Santos thousands of yards beneath you it's devastating. Absolutely majestic.It's as great a playground as any.I have never thought of games as stories some games can be story focused some are about setting high scores gaming is a medium not a scripture. When I played Uncharted 2 I was impressed by the set pieces and couldn't put it down. I thought of it like a type of movie/game hybrid. GTA has a story behind it and the 3 characters are brought to life yes. There are some moments that make you laugh some spectacular ones too. But make no mistake the star of this game is the world.That explains the simple gameplay. Ammo is plentiful guns are easy to aim and everything feels easy crisp and effortless. It's well designed and never challenging. Rockstar didn't make this game to challenge. I think of it like ""let's just create an amazing living world and give players freedom. They can do whatever they want and we'll make it easy for them"". Everything from the ground up feels simple and intuitive I was never puzzled or frustrated with game mechanics for a second. Everything Rockstar made in this game feels like they did it because it's what they do and they love it.Many of the side missions seem like the same old BS. Maybe because they were tacked on who knows. But it's the game behind it the craft. Usually the side missions I like are funny and some are very funny here. Although there are the obligatory filler missions which make you feel like an errand boy but they have nothing to do with me. You can brush them over when the world's this well made.Gameplay wise Rockstar nails it beyond belief with the driving. Arcadey enough for the casual gamer to like there's enough depth and realism in the way every vehicle feels to keep players wanting to try different ones. Often I would see a car which I wanted to try driving or a plane which I would want to fly just to see how it ""felt"". It literally is addictive. It's gameplay in it's simplest most endearing form just overwhelmingly playable. I drove with no destination for hours and hours. (A side note here the Stinger GT sometimes makes me want to fire up the game only to drive it around just the way it handles is gold).At so many points in this game something happens and grabs your attention. And I mean grabs. Rockstar has to know that why else would they do it? They aren't just churning out installments in the ""GTA franchise"" but they don't care. There's a love and a craft behind this game which could be precious and pretentious but instead Rockstar just aimed for quality.And sometimes you wish every game had this much freedom. I've never played a game like it I've played a lot games which try to do it but no way it just comes out lazy and dead. GTAV is there. It's like the mission where Michael goes for a bike ride with his son on the beach it's like look out this beach feels alive. The graphics aren't great but functional. You could make a beautiful beach with amazing graphics but what makes it feel alive is how the NPCs move act what they're doing a set of shopfronts which wouldn't look out of place in LA and Rockstar knew that and prioritised it. They obviously spent their budget in the right places the parts which aren't as flashy but on a deeper level are more important. It's still GTA it's still a game and that's what makes Rockstar's titles great. If you like games play what they've made. Majestic and captivating.",Grand Theft Auto V

If you're looking for this type of solo experience and will be satisfied with just that go ahead and get it.HOWEVER if you are considering for the online aspect don't buy. Here are just a few of the issues that make it a terrible idea Toxic online community Rampant and unchecked cheating / modding to the point where modders have openly admitted during gameplay they were cheating and said there was nothing anyone could do about it even threatening to report a player who called them out on it and get them banned instead Griefers and trolls in every form imaginable No real storyline to speak of Not enough willing players for missions Customer support that only exists to give you the middle finger Greedy company that promises to stop online support as soon as it's not as disgustingly profitable as it is now Delayed (or cancelled?) DLC in favor of ""double $ &amp RP"" events that get players doing the same boring races over and over Rules that actively support unfair advantages like using custom cars in racesThere have been brief enjoyable experiences in the online portion but nothing even close to what it should be and easily could be if R* spent as much time making the community better as they do promoting pointless new cars to buy.TL DR Buy for single player only.

2015-05-09,0,0,55,False,Not Recommended,Not recommended not because this is not a good game but ths is NOT a good GTA game. GTA V is a brilliant open world game but somewhere in the amazing graphics it lacks the spirit of grand theft auto. Note I only play single player.1.The missions feel the same. It did not provide the feeling of apprehension at the beginning and neither any form of satisfaction at the end. Secondly it lacked variety. While playing this game i was remembering all the unique missions from san andreas vice city and gta IV and thinking where are all those missions.2. Though the three characer switching was innovative and i did enjoy each of their storyline but I did not feel attached to any of the characters since i was not playing with any of them for long.3. The game lacked a sense of progression. I believe this is the biggest flaw in the game maybe because of the above mentioned problem.I wanted to like this game so bad but was left deeply sad and underwhelmed. I have been waiting for this game on PC since i do not play on consoles. After reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews I am left shocked. How did people find this so good.This is a very good game if it did not have GTA on it. Maybe its just me. I just feel so sad after playing the game. My apologies.,Grand Theft Auto V

They would have to change a lot in GTA VI for me to play it whenever it comes out but until then no more GTA V for me. I guess while i'm writing a review ontop of that the community is super cancerous but that's with most games with a lot of players. You're forced to play with other people and with a lot of missions you have to move crates or planes you sink money into that can be potentially blow up there's a way to disconnect your internet when loading into a session that puts you in a ""private public"" session where you can still do missions and not worry about people blowing up your sh!t but other than doing that you're probably going to have a bad time.If you want this short and simple Pros Amazing Graphics Can be fun fighting other people Good car customization you can make some pretty sick rides.

Modding singleplayer is just insane.. I thought it would be a little ""meh"" and somewhat fun but after spending 90% of my singleplayer game time just messing round with mods I've found so much fun in them however I do still enjoy just being a taxi driver.. It's rather sad.Multiplayer is just far too much fun if you got friends then time flies! 2 of my friends made new characters (I ported mine from xbox) and honestly it has taken them very little time to get the money they need for a high end house and a few other things Heisting is so much fun it's honestly worth trying it out it's even more of a blast with friends however just becareful.. some of your ""friends"" will turn out to be thieves and take most of the money from heists! But hey.. that's just Grand Theft Auto for you. The recent patch has caused a lot of bugs but putting them a side it's been extremely fun playing on PC and honestly this PC port is just damn amazing I'm still breath taken by the damn puddles.. also to add the controls aren't as bad as I thought they would've been I thought it would be clunky and stupid to try but honestly? It's simple and fun my only problem is flying.. You have to use Numpad 8 5 4 and 6 to pitch the plane / helicopter.. which is a little annoying but honestly.. the rest of this game just makes me over look it when playing if you got friends this is a great game if you want to make friends of be a trolly person going round shooting everyone multiplayer is the damn way to go or just do it all in one. )",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar did try to diffuse the situation and has gotten Take Two to agree that it ""generally will not take legal action against third party projects involving Rockstar s PC games that are single player non commercial and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties "" but it's far too late and the damage is well said and done.What a shame I can no longer in good faith recommend this game to anyone (not that there isn't anyone left who hasn't played the thing).

Complete with 69 story missions (yes it is actually 69..)The graphics are beautiful they run smooth and they look amazing.But the Online portion of the game is sometimes unsatisfying.There can be connection issues for instance several people in one server (session) could leave not because they want to but because the servers sometimes are wonky.And the Online portion of the game also boasts with hundreds of things to buy.. from apartments to forclosures to cars to guns to offices to bikes to FLYING CARS litterally.This game has Micro Transactions. These micro transactions are called ""Shark cards"" these cards can give you in game money for real money although this game might be playable without buying any it is hard to do so.I have had this game on a last generation console before it was released for pc before shark cards where a thing and when the shark cards where released i find it hard not to pay up cash in real life to get that dream car i always wanted or to buy that Drug manufacturing place i always wanted or that garage that can store 50+ cars.I do reccomend this game but if you hate micro transactions good luck having to play Gta Online!",Grand Theft Auto V

A few graphical errors Misleading Minimum Requirements you need atleast 6 GB of RAM in order to make sure that this game runs smoothlyOnlineOnline is basically the multiplayer mode of GTA V and is also the reason why most people are buying the game though if you're planning to play the game only for its Online mode you should really consider playing Single Player too.+ It's fun messing around with people in free roam+ 4 game modes Missions Heists Versus Races and Adversary Modes (excluding Freemode events and VIP Work since they're both in free roam) Repetitive missions+ Adversary Modes has a variety of different PvP modes which are all enjoyable It's full of Hackers who ruin the game. They strip your weapons money and kill you. There are some nice hackers out there who give you free money but where's the fun in that? Online servers occasionally go on maintainence but I'm fine with it. Long loading time compared to Single Player. I usually go to Single Player first and switch to Online after.In ConclusionThe game is a fantastic game but it does not live up to its name. It's called Grand Theft Auto but most missions do not involve stealing cars and there's also a chance of getting a bounty on your head for stealing cars off NPC's Online. I do recommend this game but you're better off buying this game during a sale.Story Mode 9/10Graphics 9.5/10Optimization 10/10Soundtrack 9/10Gameplay 8/10Online 7/10Overall 8/10",Grand Theft Auto V

(or you can pay for the money but i dont think its worth it) i play since 2013 and i still cant believe it takes so f****** long to load i think almost half of my hours played were shift tab while waiting for game to load. money making gets so repetitive you have to exploit whatever is the most profitable way at the moment at the beginning the missions were more fun for example martin's missions are good but not worth if you want to get cash. its really sad that rockstar is so into the money that they dont even try to hide it some things are just unbelievable like in the pacific standard finale they fixed the kuruma glitch 3 4 years later after it came out and now its the heli glitch that its even FASTER and SAFER like... rockstar pls xdand the endless list of bugs this game has its just amazing it can be fun and frustrating sometimes but well they dont care that much i feel like its a battle between rockstar v users when it comes to bugs glitchs exploits etc.. and i think people always trying to find this stuff bc what i said about economysome are good like the kuruma glitch when it was working but there are some ones that are disgusting and they must be patched everytime like car duplication or things like that in MY experience the community is not that badi can count with my fingers the times i saw cheatersmost of the people let you do your business but when you resupply or sell stuff there is always the chance that there is one bored a***ole/low lvl that doesnt understand/autistic kid that comes and tries to destroy your stuff but its a small %if you wanna pvp in public sessions it can be so fun except you dont want to and you get in the middle of the warzone doing heists/missions solo it can be so frustrating because1 for setups you usually have to wait a long time to get people to join2 50/50 chance you get a low lvl joining and you wanna kick em bc in most cases you end regreting you started the mission with them3 people that dont understand how to do the mission and you have to coach them and they dont always listen4 selling stock from your business requires more than one vehicle most of the times so you need someone to help you or a calm/solo public session and you can be up to 30m doing the delivery.....but what makes me recommend this game to someone is that if you play with friends you can have a nice time and have so much fun with this game but it makes me sad about the game decisions rockstar made the online had much more potential..,Grand Theft Auto V

The story and the way you can change between characters is clever but so far there isn't a likebale character in the roster. I know its GTA but it all just seems so familiar. I'm not looking forward to replaying the missions that I've already completed mainly because they weren't that entertaining to beging with but so far I'm going to with a no on the recommendation on this one.

2017-01-13,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,"If you've read my past review of Max Payne 3 you probably know what I think of Rockstar recent streak of games.For those among you who don't let's just say I've been waiting since Bully or San Andreas if you prefer for Rockstar to actually produce a quality game which isn't about the american dream AGAIN.And so far my expectations have been met with disappointement a fact GTA V certainly couldn't manage to change.GTA V is I have to admit it a bad game.Let's start with the controls and initial feel. The first thing you immediatly notice is the driving controls are bad. They basically slightly improved the controls from GTA IV which were absolutely terrible and a huge disappointement literally forcing you to use cabs to go anywhere because driving was such a pain. GTA V driving is at least mediocre but it goes from a faux realist style of driving where most cars handle like huge boxes of mass on wheels over or underturning sliding spinning flipping and overall making the driving disappointing.On foot they kept the ""realist"" animations which makes you go at a crawling pace when you climb or go down stairs or when you bonk into a car even slightly moving. Ennemies you shoot when not killed by a headshot tend to fall down and proceed to take an incredible amount of bullets to die if you don't hit the head. Gunfights in general tend to be extremely lethal for you ennemies tend to have pinpoint accuracy and bullets hurt like hell.While airplane controls are correct helicopters controls are downward attrocious and feel like they obviously were made with a controller scheme in mind meaning when the game was ported on PC artefact of that control scheme remained and helicopters controls are a nightmare.So as far as gameplay goes it's not fully enjoyable like Saints Row games are. Ergonomy is mostly ignored which means in some cases fighting the controls and the animations. Plus you have this stupid cellphone system which comes back with a vengeance and is an annoyance to use. The cellphone is used for far too much gimmicky things and of course lock you into an animation of using it when you do.Now let's move to the main story. Main characters are overall pretty good in their own styles. I won't jump on the bandwagon who think Trevor is the best thing since sliced bread. Trevor is a correct quirky character but he often goes in the ""too much"" in a way which isn't funny. We are far from the humor of the old GTAs giving you the feeling they weren't taking themselves seriously and were in the parody. Here the humor is more about making political and social statements and badmouthing groups of types of people. And it's done in such a way which is just not funny. It's not handled with tact it's not handled in a childish way. It's handled like it would be in say a Family Guy episode. Overly gross and provocative made only to shock without even the comedy.Then you have the secondary characters... It takes a very very short amount of time to want to kill the vast majority of them. Lamar is a terrible gangstah wannabe which can't even be a Ryder. Franklyn's aunt is ignoble. Michael's entire family is a torture. Trevor's friends are mostly annoying. I think Lester is probably the only major secondary character which is kinda nice.As if it wasn't enough the game is unrewarding as hell. In past GTA(3 Vice City San Andreas) you got rewarded with a nice sum of money after each mission. Here? You barely get paid anything when you do get paid. The game throws a lot of goodies and customisations options for you to buy... Well when I mean a lot it's relative. Saints Rows 2 this game is not. At least a decent amount of them. But without money? You don't even get to mess with them. While Vice City and San Andreas had properties which generated money over time here most properties don't do that. They only generate money under certain precises circumstances and for some only offer you the capacity to make some extra cash by grinding repetitive and unrewarding tasks. And you can also get phone calls asking you to drop everything to accomplish said tasks or you don't get paid at all!So what does that leave you heists of which there are 5 in the whole game one of them not giving any money at all an other only giving money to one character and the last one being at the complete end of the game. And there is also stock market rigging and profiting but well... That takes a lot of save scumming even if let's face it it will be how most of your money will be made.And the whole not getting rewarded for what you do is a constant theme of the story. Which is pretty much a lot of jumping in hoops doing nothing of consequences and making lot of errors the final morale of the story being it would have been a LOT easier if they had killed everyone looking at them the wrong way from the start.Lot of side missions are incredibly annoying to boot. For me the kicker was the submarine collectibles which have you spend a lot of time in a mini sub going aaaaall over the playing zone to pick up underwater crates. All that for after hours of tedious boredom being paid 1000 dollars by the person who gave you the task... The real reward being her car when you kill her which is a pretty bad one anyway and one which even if rare can be found in traffic.As for missions themselves some of them are legitimately hard for the wrong reasons like terrible controls time limits escort missions killzones placed around the area making you fail if you go too far from the railroads the game want you to follow etc. An other review said things well writing ""For every time you feel like fist pumping because of how great the situation is you have 10 which make you want to scream at your computer"". That's pretty much GTA V story in a nutshell.The soundtrack is overall bad. After the pleasure that were GTA 3 Vice City in particular and San Andreas sountrack GTA V is a huge letdown. You have maybe 4 5 good songs and the enjoyable funk radio maybe and that's it pretty much. So of course you mostly use your own music because you can't really trust the game to give you quality. Then you have the multiplayer... Ooooooh boy...A lot have already been said about it. It's full of hackers. Rockstar does very little to punish them. Mistakes have been made punishing people who got victims of hackers and did nothing wrong. It's full PVP on open servers meaning you will usually get shot at just for crossing the street unless you wall yourself on a private server with friends. There is no real Grand Theft Auto. All the cars a little good must be purchased. Same for planes helicopters and boats. The reason given is that they have a GPS tracker preventing you from keeping them.Truth is Rockstar sells multiplayer money for real money and at a very high price I must add. Therefore they made everything interesting locked behind money requirement and made money very hard and grindy to get. It's either some very precise coop missions or the hardest heists.

2017-12-08,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,The single player game is fairly good for a GTA game. Worth $30 40 and your time I'd say. The world itself is fun to explore and the typical GTA shenanigans are as ever a staple to laugh yourself silly with. The driving fighting and gunning are all satisfying. The single player falls flat when it comes to the characters. They are all hateful spiteful human garbage. That wouldn't be so bad but this game feels too over the top in terms of the humour. There are no sympathetic characters there are no grounded interactions and the entirety of the world itself is one giant sardonic orifice raining down diatribes of hate and sarcastic drivel on your head. In past games we've had anchors (straight men) to help us realise the audacity of our characters as well as the lunacy of some of our friends. But this game is missing any sense of the mundane in favour of the constantly ridiculous. This feels more like a Saints Row game than a GTA game. I still mostly enjoyed the single player experience even if the game was trying to constantly cut me with it's supposedly sharp socioeconomic and political mini rants. I got tired of the writing and the characters but I was still (mostly) interested to see their stories pan out. That's the single player. The online or GTA Online is a mess. The loads are ludicrous even on a fast connection and the game installed on an SSD and are a near constant issue with jobs/missions often requiring a load. If you're not waiting for your own game to load then you're likely waiting for someone else to load into the mission. It feels like you spend more time waiting for things to happen than you do making things happen. The online economy is a heavy grind. It would be considered a heavy grind in a free to play game. But it's not a free to play game it is a full price game that demands that you either play dozens of hours to achieve the tiniest of gains or to pay real money for shark cards. Poorly named. They ought to be named whale cards. The game demands an extreme amount of grinding to achieve much of anything. Dozens of hours are a drop in the bucket for this grind. The game does not respect your time and is balanced around you buying in game cash with real money. Surely for all that grind you have some assurances of a stable cheat free product? Nope. The game is riddled with hackers who will kill everyone in a match with the stroke of a button or they'll lock your character so you cannot move they'll empty your inventory of all of your hard earned weapons and such they'll crash the server or they'll crash your game or they'll shower your character with items or money in such a way that they'll get you banned for a few days or weeks. That's right the greedy publisher and devs of this game have offloaded most of the stress of the multiplayer onto their customers without sufficient checks to keep the integrity of the game itself secure and so have rendered the experience moot. When hackers can permanently ruin a character you've made leaving you with no recourse what are you supposed to do? The PR and marketing for this game avoids the tough questions while shoving more micro transactions down your throat. GTA Online is a disgrace. I reinstalled for the first time since release and played some hours to see what was new. I had missed most of the new content 'till now and was curious to see if the game had finally reached a worthwhile state. As you can tell from my above comments I am not pleased. Things are worse. The lobbies always have a few cheaters in them about half of the remaining players will hunt you without reason and the remainder will keep to themselves. Rarely you'll meet some nice seeming folks but any crew will quickly fall apart as the missions require a high degree of coordination. Unless you have friends to play with don't waste your time. The online is a mish mash of ideas but none are very well implemented. GTA Online is the fixture of GTA V. There are no expansions or DLC coming for the single player game. If you can find the game for cheap buy it and play the campaign.Ignore the online component it exists to part you from your cash. All of the added content in GTA Online is grind heavy expensive and ultimately not worthy of your time. Play a game that respects your time and isn't just trying to get into your wallet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-28,0,0,1814,False,Not Recommended,"After 1500 hours of playing this game I think I am able to do a review on it.Firstly I would like to start on the gameplay itself. The game is pretty basic when it comes to gameplay as it should be for every GTA game out there. It comes down to three different gameplay characteristics Character movement Driving and Shooting.The Character movement is not bad it's pretty decent. Using third person gives you that authentic GTA feeling to it but first person is a new addition to the GTA universe which at the moment is very broken. The mobility is way faster for a player in first person compared to one in third person but the first person player has a worse surroundings aware compared to the third person. The difference can be seen during combat however.The Driving is basic it's for the casual player not very difficult to control compared to previous games.The Shooting is very easy the guns almost have no recoil whatsoever and they're not difficult to use. Sadly the main thing about being better is having the gun with the faster fire rate. The weapon selection is pretty big but in the end it comes down to few weapons such as the Special Carbine Heavy Sniper AP Pistol and Heavy Revolver. The melee system is very broken and except the Knuckle Duster the melee weapons are just for the giggles not for efficiency. The shooting becomes more broken when a player is using first person because it gives him a huge mobility advantage over the other player if he would be in third person. Due to the easy shooting mechanics the game is having a community of players formed of people killing other players for no reason and resorting to scummy tactics called ""Tryhards"".Secondly I would like to have my own opinion on the community playing the game.It's no secret the game is dying at the moment because of the prices or the game's age so the players are separated in groups Tryhards Modders Bikers etcetera. If you want to start playing the game now you should be prepared to be a target for every player looking to boost their Kill/Death Ratio because for some people that actually matters.Unless you have a group of friends to play with or find as quick as possible a community to join I'd say it's pretty pointless to start playing now because of the prices in game which is a topic I will get on now.The prices have suddenly increased since the VIP DLC which was after the Heists DLC. People used to have in game currency back then due to the Heists being new and people used to grind them for currency.After that R* has used the same strategy for future DLCs such as the Biker DLC. It feels like R* has turned lazy which it did a long time ago.Throught the months the DLCs' content was more focused on militarized vehicles which are expensive not fun and it takes away from the core gameplay GTA used to be about. Long have past the days where you were just a criminal stealing cars for a living now R* has offered us militarized vehicles and nuclear missiles to fight each other which in the end benefits them if you think about it.Thirdly I would like to talk about the story line. The story line was very blank compared to the previous games and it's pretty stupid. It was also easy.Since 2013 this story line never got any updates as well. The online is infested with DLCs' which are adding stuff the game didn't need and the story was the same for ever no one is even playing it anymore unless they use mods to customize their single player experience.To end it I'm not recommanding the game for anyone who wants to start now because it would turn out in a waste of time because you would need a lot of grinding for basic needs such as the Bunker the Clubhouse decent vehicles and what not and all of this just so you can add a few bucks in R*'s pocket.",Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-07,0,0,529,False,Not Recommended,"If you're looking at buying this game for the Story Mode gameplay I would kinda sorta recommend it. They have definately met or exceeded previous titles but it's still GTA it's only going to take you so far. However if you are interested in getting into online play I would absolutle not recommend it. The number one reason would be ""modders"" or ""hackers"". Considering the amount of money Rockstar has made off this game let alone the amount loyal fans like myself have paid them over the years having purhased ALL of the previous titles the lack of actual moderation in online sessions allows hackers to basically get away with ruining entire sessions for thousands of players everyday. If I had known how rampant this issue was I would not have bought the game initially. While there are improvements in the Story Mode it's GTA... I was interested in online. Now TBF there are ways of working around some of the hacking issues but they also block off access to money making missions or include running a ""glitch"" session which I'm sure at any point Rockstar is going to try and do away with even if it's the only way to ensure you can play the game fairly without hackers. DO NOT BUY SHARKCARDS I was foolish enough to do so myself and it was the ONLY reason I kept coming back for more punishment from the hackers I had more than just the price of the game into it so I convinced myself to get my moneys worth. I still feel like I have not despite 100's of hours into the game... Simply due to the hacking issue and Rockstars absolute lack of dealing with it. At least with ""DayZ Mod"" I could excuse it coming from the server side they didn't get paid by players they were running a game that they didn't develop using mods they didn't write.

2015-04-14,0,0,104,False,Recommended,Many questioned if Rockstar would be up to the task with this release given how GTA IV turned out.I am happy to report that Rockstar nailed it. Yes there were launch day issues but what game doesn't have those?EDIT Okay lets take this a bit more seriously.If you've watched TB's Port Report on GTA V then you already know what to expect as far as options go so anything I say would be redundent. If you haven't watched that video go do so.Gameplay wise running on my rig (i5 4670 8GB DDR3 R9 270X) and the settings mostly on normal/high I get 60fps 90% of the time. Again as TB said in his video there are times when the FPS drops to 40 in large areas because of everything that's loading. This has yet to cause problems when on heists or jobs so I generally ignore it.As far as controls go usualy with this type of game I'll use a controller as driving with the keyboard is often hampered by shoddy controls. Thankfully that doesn't seem to be the case here as I have no issue driving with the keyboard outside of how long the camera takes to recenter when the mouse moves so I drive in 1st person (which is honestly kinda fun).There's a level of detail here that is really impressive to behold. Get into a car in 1st person mode and hit that gas. The tac and spedo needles move. Change the radio station and most will show which station you're on and sometimes what song is playing.If I have one gripe it's one that I've had with games like GTA for years now and that's how it handles the music. I'm all for all those stations and GabeN knows I take full advantage when a game lets me use my own music collection in place of whatever they provide. But we've had smart phones for years now and many people use them as music players either with apps like Spotify or just putting their own music on them so why not take advantage of that? Put in a small animation of the player puting on headphones and just let the phone be the radio/music player.Other than that the game is a gem. Being able to switch between the main game and GTA Online at will without needing to exit is perfect (although the load times are annoying).,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-27,0,0,110,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar has sucked all the fun out of a game that at one point was insanely fun. Not to mention they have ATTROCIOUS anti consumer policies including their horrendous ham fisted approach to banning. Break two of ANY rules no matter how far apart these occurances are and you're permenantly banned from online. Forever. And you can't appeal the ban so if their 100% automated algorithm makes a mistake and flags you for mass banning which was known for happening for over half a year you can never appeal the wrongful ban and your years of patronage and 100+ dollars is wasted for good. Out the window.Rockstar is honestly a horrible horrible company.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-07-04,0,0,39,False,Not Recommended,"Single Player Campaign is shallow clique and boring. The first hour or two of single player is really fun and then it becomes a boring repeatitive and overly dull grind. For an RPG game you don't find yourself getting around much in the shell of an ""open world"" in comparision to GTA IV where there was many side missions and random events as well as activities. This game is lifeless filled with characters and story that have comprehensive ideas built into them but with no build up you will rarely care about the characters making this playthrough beyong boring since there is no fun things like side missions and activities as with the previous title in the series. The lack of money you will make in the short campaign means buying weaponry or doing the 'online' activities and even car customization are impossible though the story is that short you wont find yourself with much time or need to do any of this. So then the single player sucks and is a shell of what GTA IV offered that must mean that GTA Online got all the attention from developers. Well let me tell you if you weren't in it since day 1 + you don't have 3 other friends with the game around the same level as you + you don't plan on buying any of the microtransaction in game currency then you're gonna have a bad time. This game is nothing without 3 friends to play with you and any online interaction with random people is going to make your day or you off completely. Also you should really read through the entire wiki if you wanna have any idea of how to get around and make any money so you can buy the ridiculously over priced garbage they have to offer. Literally all the clothing cars and property/bussinesses are so unaffordable that Online isn't worth a dime of your time. I'd rather invest in World of Warcraft than this sadness. I do not recommend this game. Go buy GTA IV and watch some guides on how to mod that game and it'll be much more value for this money. Online isn't worth buying this game for. Online gets out dated way too fast their events and additions give no traction to the landslide this game is taking down the toilet.",Grand Theft Auto V

Go there enter car lose cops. Some missions are so simple that you only have to press a key here and there the rest just goes on. Moreover lots of missions which looks interesting turns out to be scripted. It is like watching a film which stops here and there until I press the continue button. there isn't really anything to do besides missions. Sure there is tennis and golf and so on but why would I want to play those? All those are very basic mini games which has nothing to do with the core of the game. It is like when I was playing golf on c64 back in my childhood. In just cause 2 I had tons of activities which wasn't separated from the core game. I needed to destroy statues explore military bases.Bottom line I only recommend this game if you can buy it as part of a good sale. Not worth the full price in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-11-02,0,0,113,False,Recommended,In short Campaign mode well worth it. The game itself is incredible even nearly 5 years after being published has a vast open world that will keep giving after hundreds of hours of gameplay. I currently have 100 hours on record and still feel like I've nearly begun playing. The storyline is brilliant missions that are unrivaled by V's predecessors. The little details will surprise you over and over again the places you can find Mike Trevor and Franklin at the diallogues that you will wait to be over with even though you have basically reached your destination. The game really is a gem and it's well worth the money.Why it's currently got lots of negative reviews is well explained by the people who put them.The online mode is... Horrendous. I guarantee you half the time in online you'll spend enjoying it and using the most of it it has even more missions great stunt races heists even more things to do than in story mode. However the other half the time spent (and I'm not even kidding if you're lucky it will be less than 50% of the time) will be either on loading screens to and from sessions disconnecting from sessions which will make it very frustrating if you are looking to buy the top vehicles a yacht or even a decent property that would be only half a million. It will take you ages just because of it. On some occasions I spend up to 2 hours in this game trying to do a single heist but being unable to because of people disconnecting (then having to do the loading screen again) and only get to spend 30 minutes out of it playing the game itself. Also the community is beginning to be You will need to be coordinated most of the time (and have a great knowledge in English that most people seem to neglect) and it's really hard once a Russian 13 year olds join you in your missions. (don't mean to be racist nearly all the kids in this game will be the same spoiled brats. Make them non english speaking spoiled brats in an English game a +18 one... You won't have a good time.)So should you or should you not buy this game?Absolutely. Grand Theft Auto V is a piece of art that you really need to experience. It will provide you with lots of hours of pure fun and enjoyment if you're gonna stick with the exploring and storyline. You will feel the game paying off in the first 5 10 hours of playing.However unless you have a *really* good internet you're near to wherever the servers are and have some real life friends you think you can enjoy the online part with I don't think you should feel much of the Online mode. In years time the servers have (from what I could feel) only gotten worse which is an indicator they probably won't do much about it any time soon (if ever that is.) You shouldn't completely neglect it but do have low expectations on it. You'll either have quite a fun time or quite a frustrating one the later mostly. Unless you have A LOT of the time in your hands don't expect to grind much.And grinding is not an important part of the game. There is literally so much to do don't let the frustrating online mode occasionally stop you in it.TLDR Online not worth. If you're someone who will appreciate the online most of the time this isn't a game for you.Offline must buy. Details the story the message it sends etc. Enjoy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-24,1,3,539,False,Not Recommended,best game ever last year now its ruined toxiq community microtransactions and servers made from potatoes. in order to enjoy the game you need in game cash and to get in game cash you need to do either missions or heists. doing missions takes forever if you want a car for example and heists are pure cancer the comunity is toxiq as and you are required to have 3 others to start the heist. after 20 minutes you might have 3 other players they will then either 1. suck 2. troll 3. leave. so no cash there. there used to be hackers you could ask for money and that worked out just fine! but now rockstar ban them all and ban people at random aswell. rockstar wants you to buy so called shark cards wich is just in game money for real money. greedy rockstar has ruind the game with microtransitions and ban waves. do not buy because you will also have to wait 10 minutes to join a server wich is full of 12 year olds who just you up with insurgents and hydras.Rockstars greed have ruind their own game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-26,5,3,237,False,Recommended,"Donald J. Trump is the very definition of the American success story continually setting the standards of excellence while expanding his interests in real estate sports and entertainment. He is the archetypal businessman a deal maker without peer.Mr. Trump started his business career in an office he shared with his father in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn New York. He worked with his father for five years where they were busy making deals together. Mr. Trump has been quoted as saying ""My father was my mentor and I learned a tremendous amount about every aspect of the construction industry from him. "" Likewise Fred C. Trump often stated that ""some of my best deals were made by my son Donald...everything he touches seems to turn to gold. "" Mr. Trump then entered the very different world of Manhattan real estate.In New York City and around the world the Trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses. Among them are the world renowned Fifth Avenue skyscraper Trump Tower and the luxury residential buildings Trump Parc Trump Palace Trump Plaza 610 Park Avenue The Trump World Tower (the tallest building on the East Side of Manhattan) and Trump Park Avenue. Mr. Trump was also responsible for the designation and construction of the Jacob Javits Convention Center on land controlled by him known as the West 34th Street Railroad Yards and the total exterior restoration of the Grand Central Terminal as part of his conversion of the neighboring Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The development is considered one of the most successful restorations in the City and earned Mr. Trump an award from Manhattan 's Community Board Five for the "" tasteful and creative recycling of a distinguished hotel."" Over the years Mr. Trump has owned and sold many great buildings in New York including the Plaza Hotel (which he renovated and brought back to its original grandeur as heralded by the New York Times Magazine) the St. Moritz Hotel (three times and now called the Ritz Carlton on Central Park South) and until 2002 the land under the Empire State Building (which allowed the land and lease to be merged together for the first time in over 50 years).Additionally the NikeTown store is owned by Mr. Trump on East 57th Street and adjacent to Tiffany's. In early 2008 Gucci opened their largest store in the world in Trump Tower.In 1997 the Trump International Hotel &amp Tower opened its doors to the world. This 52 story mixed use super luxury hotel and residential building is located on the crossroads of Manhattan's West Side on Central Park West at Columbus Circle. It was designed by the world famous architect Philip Johnson and has achieved some of the highest sales prices and rentals in the United States. As one of only three hotels in the nation to have received a double Forbes Five Star rating for both the hotel and its restaurant Jean Georges it has also received the Five Star Diamond Award from the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences and was voted the number one business hotel in New York City by Travel + Leisure Magazine. Conde Nast Traveler Magazine has named it the number one hotel in the US and its innovative concept has been copied worldwide. It has won the Forbes Five Star Hotel Award each year from 2009 to 2015 and ranked in the Conde Nast Traveler ""Readers' Choice"" awards every year since 2010. This year marks the eighteenth anniversary of this Trump Hotel Collection gem.Mr. Trump was also the developer of the largest parcel of land in New York City the former West Side Rail Yards which is now Trump Place. On this 100 acre property fronting along the Hudson River from 59th Street to 72nd Street is the largest development ever approved by the New York City Planning Commission. There are a total of 16 buildings on the site with Mr. Trump building the first nine buildings and the other portion of land being sold for a substantial amount. Mr. Trump also donated a 25 acre waterfront park on Trump Place and a 700 foot sculptured pier to the city of New York.Other acquisitions in New York City include The Trump Building at 40 Wall Street the landmark 1.3 million square foot 72 story building located in Manhattan's Financial District directly across from the New York Stock Exchange and the tallest building in downtown Manhattan. This purchase which took place at the depths of the New York City real estate market is said to be one of the best real estate deals made in the last twenty five years and is considered to have one of the most beautiful ""Tops"" of any building in the country. In addition Mr. Trump built 610 Park Avenue (at 64th Street) formerly known as the Mayfair Regent Hotel which was very successfully converted into super luxury condominium apartments achieving at that time the highest prices on Park Avenue. Further east adjacent to the United Nations sits the spectacular Trump World Tower a 90 story luxury residential building and one of the tallest residential towers in the world. The Trump World Tower has received rave reviews from the architectural critics with Herbert Muschamp of the New York Times calling it ""a handsome hunk of a glass tower."" Likewise Trump World Tower is considered one of the most successful condominium towers ever built in the United States.In 2001 Mr. Trump announced plans for his first foray into Chicago where he planned to build the Trump International Hotel &amp Tower/Chicago. The 2.7 million square foot 92 story mixed use tower is located on the banks of the Chicago River directly west of Michigan Avenue (the most prominent site in Chicago) and is one of the tallest residences in the world and the ninth tallest building in the world. The architect is Skidmore Owings &amp Merrill Chicago and the tower also includes four levels of retail shops. The hotel opened in January of 2008 to great acclaim and in 2010 received Travel + Leisure Magazine's award as the #1 Hotel in the US and Canada as well as their ""World's Best Business Hotel"" Award in 2014. Conde Nast Traveler ranked the hotel in its ""Readers' Choice Awards"" every year since 2011. The hotel has earned Five Star ratings for hotel and restaurant in the Forbes Travel Guide Awards in 2014 and 2015 and has been a AAA Five Diamond Hotel award winner since 2011.In 2002 Mr. Trump purchased the fabled Delmonico Hotel located at 59th Street and Park Avenue and re developed it into a state of the art luxury 35 story condominium named Trump Park Avenue. It was Mr. Trump's desire to make this one of the most luxurious buildings in New York City which was achieved. Mr. Trump has been lauded by a multitude of publications for having retained the grandeur and charm of the building while incorporating 21st century services and amenities. Mr. Trump is co owner with Vornado Realty Trust of the iconic 555 California Street Tower (The Bank of America building) in San Francisco one of the most important office buildings on the West Coast of the U.S. and the prized 1290 Avenue of the Americas building one of New York's biggest buildings with the largest office floorplates in New York.Mr. Trump's portfolio of holdings also includes Trump National Golf Club in Westchester NY a signature Fazio golf course and residential development and a 250 acre estate known as the Mansion at Seven Springs the former home of Katharine Graham (of The Washington Post and Rockefeller University) which will be developed into a world class luxury housing development. Mr. Trump also purchased one of the largest parcels of land in California which fronts for two and a half miles along the Pacific Ocean. A Donald J. Trump championship golf course called Trump National Golf Club/Los Angeles has been built on this site and it has been voted the number one golf course in California. Seventy five luxury estates will follow.",Grand Theft Auto V

I heard warnings that patches had somehow made the game's performance which was initially pretty good much much worse. Thanks to the safety all consumers should have finally being available on Steam a refund I bought it to find out. They were true.I'm running a pretty high end system with a GTX 980. Even on medium and low settings turning AA and AO off the framerate kept dropping every few seconds in a very jarring way. I assure you I did everything I could think of within two hours of playtime to fix it. It was unfixed.This may not be the case for you but it was my main problem. Then there's the Rockstar Social Club the way it forced you to accept a restrictive ToS agreement and won't even let you rebind keys to get rid of their t DRM/social media whatever integration.So if you want to buy the game and see if it manages to work on your system go ahead.

Trevor is a fun character but overall it's just about regular bank robbers doing generic things.Online is a free to play microtransaction infused pay to win mess. Some good elements some bad. Regular pay to win elements such as the most powerful items being locked behind hundreds and hundreds of hours of grind (or cheating or paying real money) is bad. Cheater tools being incorporated in the game where people can blow someone up anywhere at any time for 10 are worse. What really takes the price are missions that are purposefully designed to be so boring/frustrating that you will want to skip them and of course you can... for money. Also do not buy the starter pack. The alleged value is a total scam. You are way better off buying a shark card although for the reasons above I don't recommend that neither.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,521,False,Not Recommended,"I use to love this game got it when it released on PS3 then on PS4 and finally on PC. Played through the campaign each time. Obviously I enjoy the campaign a few boring and bland missions but I think a lot of the main quests good at developing the characters. I'd give the campaign a 8/10Now why I gave this a negative review is because of the multiplayer. I havent played it in awhile so I dont know exactly how everything plays out but what ive seen for updates just seem The game gets boring after awhile especially by yourself. I have very few memmories of exciting events happening in this game with other players. They also just stopped allowing weapons in online be used in single player dont know why but its ing stupid.The loading time very everything was terrible mutliple times it took me 10 and up to 30 minutes waiting to just play a mission. I'd also wait about 5 10 minutes to get into just regular open world and be put in an EU server. When I use to play combat was awful and I was quite good at it but some people you just could not hit and they weren't cheating.The way updates occur in this game are Rockstar puts it out and everything is extremely expensive. So you have 3 options and 2 of them arent really going to work. You could either 1. Cheat 2. Grind the ing out of missions or 3. Spend your money on those precious shark cards. Now obviously cheating will most likely end in a ban so no point in doing it. Now i never really played missions so i dont know if there are some missions that dish out a ton of money the ones I did play barely gave anything especially not for how much the cars/buildings cost in the game. Now I dont know how true this is but a friend told me that back when GTA5 came out on PC and when it went on sale during the summer sale it was priced down to 40$ but forced you to buy the 20$ shark card so it was 60$ anyways. Which sure is still ""technically"" a deal but when people were probably waiting for it to go on sale just for it to be 60$ anyways is a kick in the face.Now I havent played online in this game since about mid last year so stuff may be changed and I might have missed stuff or just be flat out wrong. But this is how I remember the game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar/Take Two have shown to be very anti consumer after the release of GTA V. This further cements the notion and I and many others are not having it.You do not flat out blanket ban the use of mods. If your company as a whole does not like modding fine but do not use measures to prevent it. PC gaming is about freedom and employing these practices are scummy.I do not recommend until they fix this. Even then the Online is a broken pile of crap. It's essentially a free to play (or moreso pay to win) game that you actually have to buy. Every aspect of the Online mode is meant to milk as much money from you. Whether it's $500 at a time or $10 000. Everything is ridiculously expensive and comes with a price.I seriously hate post GTA V Rockstar.

Download the game via torrent or somehow and enjoy.Only reason to buy this game for me was multiplayer and here my opinion about it. But in fact it's dead. Low online lots of lags/disconnects etc.You mostly can't find a normal team for a heist sometimes because of noobs (it's okay for gta if 1lvl joining a party of 100lvls randomly just for example) but mostly because of low online i mentioned earlier. You will sit about 30min and wait for last player or for any player. And you won't be able to minimize the game because you will be kicked for inactivity (even for 2mins). Noobs will fail your missions and you will replay it again and again. Cheaters in free mode will spam explosions crash your game spawn tons of different (like ferris wheel buildings or plains) on you or steal all your weapons when you attack them.A big world with nothing to explore or mostly to do (only multiplayer one). Everything is boring and predictable.Developers put their large ""body part"" on multiplayer its anticheat its optimization (not of whole gta v cause it's okay). They mostly add some new useless crap like cars clothes flats. But all of these... it's nothing when cheater says you ""I will crash your game"" and Bam! you're on your desktop with ""GTAV.exe not responding"".

Joining a lobby is a lot faster however you might end up either kicked cause you're fairly low level or simply kicked by rockstar because the lobby's full (why am i joining it the first place?). Insane loading screens bugs/glitches everywhere hit register/servers since you might end up with brazilians which means you have a huge difference in ping between the two players meaning you simply cant shoot each other.I've played with a few friends and well it gets boring very fast since it's always the same pattern.

2017-01-13,0,0,206,False,Recommended,To everyone that actually wants a real review of the game itself.P.S The 36hours are from online only.So from where to start... the story mode is amazing i've completed it on other platform and it's just awesome. You have a lot of different missions the story changes in a good pace and u are incontroll of everything. You can do basicly anything from getting a 6star wanted level to parachuting from Mount Chiliad. And no it doesn't get repetitive. There are just so much things u can do that will keep u play at least 100h which in my opinion is worth the money i got the game on sale.The mighty online that everyone hates. The online mode isn't that bad at all. There are lots of activities to do. Heists are fun.(for everyone complaining that people leave non stop from their heists there is a site gtavlfh from where u can find people to play with or simply play with ur friends). From all the dlc(updates they are free) they bring even more things to do. Lets say u love motorcycles go and buy a clubhouse and start doing mc missions or maybe save up for a office and become a CEO do VIP missions buy a warehouse deliver stuff buy a vehicle warehouse export and import vehicles sale them for money. And not to mention all the races deathmatches contract missions and adversary modes to play. If that is not enough for you you can always just stay in the freeroam of the online session and rob stores or be that guy and prevent other people from delivering their stuff. The options are a lot. And actually most of the times i've met someone in the streets they would just mind their thing and not shoot me there aren't so much modders at all. From 36hours of online only i've seen a modder only once and you can always change online sessions. The online is fun. You can play it alone yea it's better with friends but there are lots of things u can do solo aswell. So if u aren't sure to buy the game just BUY it. It's worth it. And to whoever actually wasted his precious time to read this. Here are some tips for the online. They aren't in order!!1.Buy a high end appartement with a 10spaces garage.(you need this to host heists when u unlock them at lvl12)2.Buy a armored kuruma( u first need to unlock it by beating the first heist which is very easy and then u can buy it for 470k the car is fully armored and is quite fast. The only way to kill it is to use explosives or to shoot thru the windows.3.Buy the office for 1million i think its the Maze bank west. It's the cheapest office. You can renovate it with other furnitures later on so don't worry about that.4.Buy a buzzard attack chopper( this will save u a lot of time for doing the vip missions. Yes it costs a lot but it will pay it's price later on. When u have a office you can spawn it for like 100$ at the roof of ur office.I hope u found this review helpfull now go and buy the damn game.,Grand Theft Auto V

There are only 2 ways to get money to grind it for 1 week and spend all of it on one car or to buy shark cards which is even worse. If you think that heists in this game are fun then let me tell you this it takes so long to find crew and when you finaly find one you will fail heist about 10 times and then someone will leave.

2017-09-04,0,0,264,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is still $60 and it feels like a free to play game. The grinding is in fact worse then most free to play games that Ive played. However the painful amount of grinding could be avoided if you decide just give Rockstar all of your money. I would say that for a $100 shark card you will have enough money to get started with the basics of the game. A game which is fun if you play it will friends. Heists and missions are an enjoyable and just messing around in freeroam is worth the $60 that this game costs. It is not worth the grind or the extra shark card money. I guess what I'm saying is if you have alot of money to spend and friends to play with this game is great. If you are a normal person who doesn't want to spend all of their card earned cash for a virtual apartment ware house car warhouse office bunker motorcycle clubhouse and hangar to enjoy the multiplayer content of this game then it isn't for you.,Grand Theft Auto V

So be prepared for a repetetive simple SP game that takes place in a great looking world. and for those who say hey just play with your freinds well some dont like waiting around all day for when a couple people on your freinds list are online to go fight ai. It is like a IP LAN only game then which is not always the most exciting thing to wait around to play.If they were able to get rid of most of the hackers i would give it a thumbs up.

2017-05-21,0,0,200,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT buy this game unless you plan on exclusively playing story mode. Every time I've played this game I am kicked out of a multiplayer session 15 minutes in because of Rockstar's servers. The game shows that EVERYONE in the server left but in reality it just removed me. This isn't a connection issue on my part either if it was I would be kicked into story mode.I checked to see if anyone else was dealing with this and no big surprise TONS of people are. This problem has persisted with players for three years and Rockstar hasn't done jack about it. This is not acceptable. Charging 59.99 is an outrageous price when your multiplayer's connectivity is as trash as it is. I am not only furious that I spent 60 dollars on this game but the fact that Rockstar hasn't done anything about this problem for 3 years is even more insulting. Countless players have complained of this issue on the Rockstar forums and NO SOLUTION has been given.To add insult to injury when the servers aren't removing you from sessions randomly hackers with godmode teleport you and everyone in your session to one spot and kill everyone instantly. This happens WAY more than you'd think. The multiplayer is INFESTED with hackers. You'll find one in nearly every session you join.If you're not a multiplayer fan then the price is worth it. If you planned on trying the multiplayer don't bother. You'll be removed from sessions every 10 15 minutes. There is no excuse for this. I do not recommend this game to anyone who wants a memorable multiplayer experience. You'll find nothing but frustration here.,Grand Theft Auto V

In this time I was only level 3 and I finish the task by myself not in the public situation and I did not use the VPN and did not cheat nor modify memory. By the way the teaching tasks told me to rob a store and I was killed by a shop assistant when I finished my teaching tasks. Do you think it's funny I think I'm more ridiculous of got a ban. Finally got a thirty day ban I just play for an hour online mode there is no absolute income and expenditure and abnormal cheating move. I had heard a lot of examples of being banned and trying to avoid them. But just completed a teaching task and play GTAonline for only one hour let me think no solution. I wonder why I was banned.

2017-08-21,1,20,441,False,Not Recommended,MP is such a greed fest that in the game called GRAND THEFT AUTO you cant ing save in your garage a car you stole and only should buy overpriced cars this brakes very core of that GTA used to be and pretty much contradicts single player core mechanics. Also they ruin immersion of SP by adding unrealistic game items modes and activities and all that crazy stuff that turns GTA online into some sort of Saints Row 4 and they does not bother anymore to implement it realistically into game (like you know explaining that these ar in game world VR games). And worst part there is nothing to do besides missions most of them are isolated in small areas while whole world online part is boring as hell people just shooting each other for no reason... you can get into bar cant get into club and other indoor areas cant spend time with friends like you can in single player or in online games like Second Life. Online is reallly lacking simulation aspect and peaceful activities and when you not on a missions you would prefer ghost mode to preven others from attacking you. Also there is not much of police to punish people for shooting each other without reason.I really expected online to be something like this you make friends hang out with them in game you make gang in game or join one you try to make agreement with or destroy rival gangs you protect territories or your business from rivals and do things like this with a sense but no all you can do just shoot strangers for no reason or be shot. Even idea of crews is ruined by the fact there are public crews like IGN everyone just join biggest crew and thats it. Crews should be like clans in cybersports you can join only by invite or by sending request to members of crew and waiting for validation public crews must be removed as a class otherewise there is not even point to get on top of leaderboards with your crew as some big crews like IGN would aways on top because everyone join them (same applies to Max Payne 3 as well).Dont get me wron I love Single player its one of the best games ever... but when it comes to Multiplayer and fact that Rockstart does not care to fix single player and core engine issues (like black box of cascade shadow maps and low remder distance lack of PSS shadows at nights and indoors very low first person FOV broken Phone Stats app that show MP activities in SP until you are in offline mode and so on including lack of online DLC content in SP) you starting to feel very dissapointed about this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-27,0,0,382,False,Recommended,"Overall this is my general review on this game GTA 5 Single player A lot of fun storyline is OK but not really good but you must remember this game came out in 2013 which is 4 years ago so there are drawbacks GTA Online really really fun IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS to play with or else it is very grindy and you'll get frustrated because of the hackers/cheatersHere's the in depth review GTA 5 was a masterful game when it came out in 2013. It still is but now it is not as good as new games that came out more recently (or maybe because I have played this game too much so that affects me).Still it is one of the best open world game out there so I would still recommend buying it.GTA Online however...is another storyWhat I have always wanted since I was younger (back when we used to play GTA SA Multiplayer mod) was to have a truely open world online game that I can play with my friends to do whatever we want that we can't in real life and have fun in it.GTA Online promises thatNow that I have found 3 friends to play with it kinna is fun. However...apart from the time that I play with my friends GTA Online is pretty boring grindy and frustrating.First of all money and level is TOO important in this game. You need to gain levels to unlock weapons and you need money to buy cars houses planes ...And the process to gain money is really slow. I have played 200 hours (only Online) and I still cannot buy most of the new things that came out in the new DLCs.Secondly one of the reason why everything takes so long is because of the LOADING TIME.I feel like out of my 200 hours 1/3 of that is just for loading...Rockstar does this thing where when you join a game you will be put into ""Sessions"" of many players then when you join a mission it will take the people in the mission into another Session with only them...then when the mission is finished they have to move all of the players back into another Public sessions.All of that moving from one session to another TAKES AGES...Finally because all of that...comes the hackers and cheaters. And Rockstar's anti cheating engine is so s h i t that you will constantly see players with 1000+ levels and all kind of weapons/vehicles hunt you down.These hackers/cheaters only play this game to destroy the FUN from anyone else.So what did Rockstar do about this? Upgrade their anti cheat system? NO. They decided to ban modding altogether.Which of course affected ALL of the modding community and custom servers ...In conclusion Is GTA 5 worth buying? YES.This game is still one of the best games you can play out there. Despite all of the bad things I listed above this game still brings me more fun than frustration. And now since it is on sale it's a good time to pick it up.If you're reading this right now and planning on buying the game...maybe add me on Steam and we can play together D I'll help you out if you're new.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-27,0,0,316,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE Most of my original review still stands the same but I'll make a few updates as it's been a few years. On the plus side Rockstar has been giving regular content upgrades to the game and there's a lot to do. They also have been banning some cheaters and hackers. The bad side Hackers still show up in 1/2 the sessions you'll play and the system to report them is so bad it's pathetic hampered even more by the terrible user interface. (The hackers can literally just kill you to prevent you from using the UI at all and that's the only way to report them.) Bugs are still rampant some of which can easily erase hours of work you put in. (The Motorcycle Club businesses especially.) The systems in place to connect game lobbies with players are still terrible. (If you try to join a lobby and cancel get ready for it to reload everything.) Unless you're doing something popular at the time don't expect people to populate your lobby. (I've joined another player in a lobby waited 5 10 minutes then actually got up went and made dinner sat down and finished it all got back up and made coffee drank it and even after all that we were still waiting for players.) And to top it all off even the ""pay to win"" aspect of the game the shark cards are laughably overpriced for what you get. ($10 for 500k in game which won't even buy you a decent car anymore or any of the recent game content.) Even if I liked P2W stuff they're just not worth it.The online game can be a lot of fun but if you want in be ready for a LOT of waiting glitches and headaches. Get the game on sale and by all means do NOT buy those shark cards unless you genuinely enjoy wasting money. END UPDATE GTA V is in and of itself a pretty amazing game. The gameplay is fun and if you've played other GTA games you'll feel right at home here. Graphics are really solid as well. (Though most of the people in the game are ugly as a bulldog's butt.)The shooting is decent not the greatest but it works. Missions are quite amusing and the storyline is probably the best yet for a GTA game.There's also a lot to be said for the sheer detail of the world. It's amazingly immersive.If you intend to play the game single player get it. It's a great game. I'd easily say you should get it.""So why the negative review?"" You may ask.Well unfortunately as solid as the game is in single player everything changes when you go online.To start off this is basically lobby waiting simulator 2015. Prepare to spend more time sitting in lobbies waiting for a mission or event to start than actually playing the game. No really it's that bad.Many of the missions REQUIRE four players to even get started. This can take 10 30 minutes just to get enough people to actually join and be patient enough to wait for all 4 slots to fill. Sometimes even longer.Got enough players finally? Great! Welcome to headache #2.If one player screws up the mission fails and you all get kicked back to the lobby. The players get a chance to choose if they want to try again or if they want to leave. If someone leaves tough luck it's back to the starting lobby and starting all over again.Also get ready to get killed for your lunch money over and over again generally speaking the player base is about as friendly as a roided up environmental activist on speed in a pit full of seal clubbing ants. It's worse than kill on sight because you show up on radar so they'll literally go out of their way to hunt you down. I've met a few people that are nice enough on here but they're easily the ""less than 1%."" Fortunately the game will give you the option of switching to ""passive"" mode after you get thrashed so players can't kill you anymore but it also means you can't use any weapons. Cops on your tail? Too bad. You can no longer fight back as long as you stay in passive mode.I've saved the worst for last... hackers. Always out to ruin the day for someone GTA Online is brimming with hackers and Rockstar doesn't seem to be doing much of anything about it. There's a hack that's been going around for months that instantly kills all players in a play session and can be set to make any player look like the killer. It also makes it almost impossible to access your menu because for whatever reason Rockstar decided that it was so important to watch yourself die that it cancels out all the menus until you respawn. (At which point you then instantly die again to all the hacks.) These creeps make the game flat out unplayable unless you switch to a solo or invite only mode. (provided you can get into the menu fast enough to pull it off.)This is something that's needed to be fixed for ages now but Rockstar is presumably too busy swimming in their money vault or something.IF you can get a group of buddies together to play and IF you play outside of the public sessions then online can be a lot of fun but there's a helluva lot of trouble involved and things that should have just been fixed by now.So TLDR If you want to play single player it's great. Get it.If you're looking to play online Prepare to wait for headaches and for hackers.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-07,1,4,560,False,Recommended,"The game it self is a good experiance I would recommend the story as it has a lot of fun activities. The Multiplayer is a good idea and if you have some friends to play with I would recommend playing with them in a private session and just mess around in the open world or do some private activities.However there are a lot of problems in the online public Grand Theft Auto sessions (and some general online problems). One problem some people talk about is the price of everything in the online version of the game. Everything that has some cool features is overpriced as heck which makes no sence. Its not because I am lazy and think that everything is too hard to get. It's because they want you to buy their ""SharkCards"". Which I can understand that for an online game developers would like some income from the online servers. But as someone who has bought some of the features with the in game money. You don't get a lot out of it which kind of disapoints me.Moving on to the next subject which I can assume a lot of people are going to expect. The Hacker problem in GTA V is a HUGE problem. 3/10 times I join a session I experiance people hacking in some sort of way or another. That may seem like that its not a big problem because it happens so little. I have only noticed ""hackers"" or script kiddies when they go on giant teleport and exposion sprees and when they do it spoils the experiance for the game for me and my friends. Sometimes money drops happens (when this happens I try to leave the session quickly. I will explain later why) and it makes it seem like your earnings that you have been spending hours to get seem usless. Only recently RockStar have added something for players to help spot script kiddies and it sucks. The options are not to do anything about reporting script kiddies (the griefing option seems like it was intended for people repeatingly killing players) and when you select the ""Other"" option It gives you a character limit of something like 50 80 characters which in my opinion is NOT enough characters to explain why you are making a report on this player. I made a report saying ""Killing passive players invisable spawning npcs explo"" because the character limit stopped me from explaining the full story I had yet to say that he teleported players out of vechicles and also giving everyone 5 star rating.The worst thing about it RockStar does not seem to give any sort of responce to this at all. RockStar seems to not care about the community opinions. One big reason leading to this is the recent trifle about banning a lot of mods from GTA V. A while back RockStar tried to take a step in and put a hault to the script kiddies. By shutting down a popular mod launcher. This was a good idea on the scriptkiddies thought But a jaw dropping terrible idea for the general modding community. A lot of people who used that launcher were using it for fun in singleplayer.Another example of what they seem to not see is the banning problem in the online session. There was a reason I said I leave the session when money drops happen. RockStar have made it so that anyone who gets a large sum of money without legit ingame ways will be banned. This seemed like a good idea. But then people realised that when they collect money from stuff like money drops (which a lot of the times they are stuck in place to be given money by force) bans them from the GTA V online experiance. This is not how it should work at ALL. RockStar needs to look at the source of the problem and not the results that come from it. Some of you might think that this was to show that they were trying to fix the problem. I say that they could have had an announcement or an interview about this problem. Not a small 2 paragraph talk but a full 2 4 pages about the problem letting everyone know the issues with this problem. I know its difficult to solve these problems and I respect that they are actually trying. But they seem to be taking a less than preffered route to the problem.I could talk about more but right now its a bit long for this review and also the other problems I have have a big chance of being patched in later updates. I do say that you should get the game the singleplayer is a great experiance. But the multiplayer needs to be fixed before I can say that its a decent experiance.Thank you for reading this!

As for the multiplayer it's also pretty fun before I inevitably get bamboozled by some guy who thinks he's a part of the tokyo drift cast and drives down the street at the speed of Mach 10 hitting me harder than reality.Overall a good game if you can ignore the fact that it's owned by a bunch of clowns.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,545,False,Not Recommended,This game was great when it came out. Heck I bought it for 360 and again for PC and have since gotten well over my money's worth. However two years have passed and its become apparent that Rockstar cares little to none about the single player experience. Instead they've been releasing increasingly expensive multiplayer DLCs for people to spend money on.In fact I remember that in the 360 version any vehicles that came out with the multiplayer DLCs were usable for free in single player. This feature was mysteriously missing from the PC port. The only way to access them in single player now is through modding which due to recent events seems like a questionable idea at best.The pleasure of playing online has died out. The best part about online was freeroam which provided my first disappointment long ago when I discovered that no wild animals spawn online. Now its been overloaded with missions and activities that force you to complete them in public lobbies. Sure there are cool new toys and things to do but the only way to afford them is to purchase shark cards or grind until you're tired of playing. It's like Rockstar wanted to suck the fun out of the game while lining their pockets.The worst part is that they could have built a whole new city to play in by now if they directed half their efforts from designing more online content. I once had dreams of seeing San Fierro or Las Venturas brought to life in the HD universe but they've long since faded away.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-10-18,0,0,52,False,Recommended,GTAV is not a great game. It s not even a good game. GTAV is the industry standard for virtuosity and it is the kind of game that most other developers envy in that they wish they had the time money and talent to produce. I do not say this to be hyperbolic because the production values in GTAV are excellent and there are dozens of small details that were intentionally programmed into it such as the nuanced animations for when player characters walk run jump or climb up and down hills stairs or other various elevations that would be impossible to enumerate comprehensively here. Despite its magnificence it is not without flaws. One plays a GTA game expecting ridiculous character archetypes but this does not pardon them from being tiresome cliches. The vexatious DRM known as Rockstar Social Club was not popular with GTAIV and the sentiments remain with GTAV. And as well optimized as the game is with its dozens of options for tweaking on rare occasion GTAV would fail to load on startup or crash while in game.That said GTAV represents the zenith of the sandbox genre and its mere existence is feat that every person who calls themselves a gamer should experience even if in moderation.

2015-05-02,0,0,1382,False,Recommended,This game truly is the 'Ultimate version' The way I see it far more superior than it's console versions (X360/One &amp PS3/4). Graphics are gorgeous the city is beautifull the story is excellent wildlife is fantastic as well as Blaine county.. And Trevor is crazy as hell! But of course there are a few flaws such as the need to add more bars and strip clubs... or the ability to enter bars such as Tequila la or the other minor strip clubs around Los Santos. Period.. also would be nice if first person could be improved a bit. Oh and its been so many GTAs allready and not a single one has added the ability to simply 'sit down' on the benches out in the city and just watch people mind their own business (except GTA IV but with mods only) and I think thats it.

2015-04-13,2,13,229,False,Recommended,I've played GTA 5 from the console release to the next gen release. Now finally and most importantly I have begun to play the PC release. The differences were subtle from console to console but to go from that to the PC those differences are now striking.With almost every graphical option any PC gamer would hope for and a framerate to boot what is old is new again.

2015-12-19,0,0,883,False,Recommended,In this review of Grand Theft Auto V I will explain all the details of this game. PART 1 The CommunityThe GTA V community is complete trash (Just want to put that out there). Every single individual that plays the game is either a tryhard or a little toxic degenerate that has nothing better to do other than to waste your time. Don't even bother with them as you will have a very difficult time trying to reason with them. The worst people are toxic tryhards now that's something you don't want to face. PART 2 The grind (Cheaters)Everyone in the GTA V community knows that getting money and RP is difficult. Everyone also knows that grinding money and RP legit is a joke. So it's guaranteed you'll either find three types of cheaters. They are some legit people though but it's more common to see a cheater then a legit person grinding.i) The nice one Friendly to the players by offering money. usually gets banned fast though.ii) The trolling Dumbasses that like to fool around and off others.iii) The devil of cheaters In other words they're toxic and love to make others lose their minds. (They also deny cheating right infront of the whole lobby) PART 3 My personal opinion on the gameI personally love this game. It's balanced in some aspects but every game has some broken thing about it. Other than that really it's enjoyable with friends or even alone. When none of my friends are one I tend to join random heists and help out others. The GTA V devs add FREE dlc and so no one can complain about that. If this game was 14 years old I'd still come back and play it maybe not as much but I'd still play it and remember old memories.Thank you for reading my review. If you are considering buying the game give it a shot. But don't say I didn't warn you. There are A LOT of toxic degenerates waiting to make you angry.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-21,0,0,511,False,Recommended,Extremely Entertaining Excellent Graphics complemented by a seamless user experience. Overall a fantastic game that can be played on both laptops and desktops. With all settings on 'High' and getting 60+ FPS its a major update from the PS4 version. My verdict is simple It was worth the wait the long wait.P.S. Well done Rockstar on this spectacular user experience and graphics you have managed to pull off!,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-07-09,0,0,412,False,Not Recommended,It breaks my heart to do this but there is no way I can recommend this game in the state it's in. Let's be clear the point of buying GTA V is to play GTA Online. If you want to play GTA single player then go and buy IV the story is better and the characters more likeable.Online is just a hot mess of cheaters and loading screens (no it took me ten minutes to get into the game yesterday) random acts of trolling are the order of the day and if you haven't been PKed for no reason then you clearly haven't played more than ten minutes.So no don't buy it. I love it but I can't recommend anyone actually pay money for this steaming pile.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-15,0,0,521,False,Recommended,This game is no doubt game of the year 2013 2015 for me. I started playing when it was released back in 2013 on the PS3 and finished the singleplayer+sidequests up to 90% in about 90 hours. Now on the PC i'm finally enjoying GTA Online with friends. The PC version had a rough start for me though since i started playing on a laptop with switchable graphics.But first the good stuff Huge open world Lots of activity (Cars pedestrians animals story mode sidequests etc) Tons of stuff to do (Minigames like Darts Tennis Yoga Golf &amp Activities like Bars Strip Clubs Shops etc) Transportation (Cars Planes Boats Jets Taxi's) Guns! Pew pew Radio stations Great graphics for a console port (but note the negative*)Some negative's that could use improvement * Support for switchable graphics (laptops). There are HUGE game stopping bugs for a lot of people and after a whole month R* has still not fixed this. See https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/communities/public/questions/203308668 GTA V on Laptop Issues Intel AMDA HOTFIX is available which makes the game somewhat playable but still not the same experience as a normal desktop pc with the same specs. See https //www.youtube.com/watch?v VeelGDyaI0g Console UI/Gameplay. The graphics where ported really well but i can't say the same for the UI. It seems like they put zero extra effort in for PC users. All menu's are still console orientated with just controller &gt keyboard key mappings applied. And i don't count first person mode because that's just a gimmick. Steam cloud. There is no Steam cloud (or any cloud save for singleplayer) in this game. Steam workshop. Modding could be great for this game if it had built in support for the workshop like many other games. Now people got banned for using mods in multiplayer because it's a lot of work to disable them after use in singleplayer. A good modding system could really help here!,Grand Theft Auto V

Took hours to download. 3. took roughly 30 minutes to troubleshoot the game to work in ""safe mode"" that it showed the game worked but didn't with just trying it normally.My gameplay experience 1. I played the GTA V not online version for about 30 minutes to learn how the game worked( i.e. controls ).2. I then played GTA Online for about 3 hours during which i met someone who drove me around in his cool fast car i stole a car i did a couple open world missions. I then left that person and went to do a multiplayer mission which it took about 15 minutes for loading and queing of players. played for about 10 minutes. mission over.3. found another multiplayer car mission via some invite on my in game cell phone. that took about 15 minutes for loading and queing of players played for about an hour. made like $77 000 or something. mission over. during this mission i experienced lots of lag and delay in car actions such as braking or even just turning left and right. I streamed for about 20 minutes with Xsplit Gamecaster then i stopped cause i thought I was lagging but it wasn't cause of that program!4. played for about 15 more minutes then left the game.5. returned 15 20 minutes and took about 20 minutes to log in to GTA Online again and it said i was suspended and i couldn't play GTA Online for a 30 days and i could play regular GTA V.Final Issues 1. took me an hour to find out how to get support on the rockstargames website to address the suspension.2. the rockstargames support doesn't allow new accounts to post threads for help you must be a member for 30 days.3. rockstargames doesn't allow repeals of suspensions no matter what.4. rockstargames doesn't have an online chat to speak to someone live you must call their support phone number.5. the support phone number for rockstargames personnel cannot do anything for you and will only repeat the same notification you get in game about a suspension and tell you that you cannot get a repeal of your suspension. 6. rockstargames customer support really sucks and is pretty much non existent. they rely on players to give other players support for their games.PROS good open worldI like GTA games ( maybe not anymore after this experience)CONS 1. need to load additional stuff for jobs and queing with other players... takes about 15 minutes to load one of these multiplayer jobs2. takes about 20 minutes to connect to GTA Online3. took me about 30 minutes to troubleshoot the game with the ""safe mode"" it provides. 4. not compatible with Windows 10 need to run game in compatibility mode with Windows 7.5. automatic suspending system suspends innocent players for a minimum of 30 days.6. customer support number is technicial support and cant help you with anything. they repeat back the warnings you got when attempting to log into a suspended account.7. suspensions of even innocent suspensions are not repealable.8. all sales final because by time you get the game working and decide you dont like the game you've already played 2 hours.9. all in game money that is purchased is not refundable no matter what.10. think you're safe cause you live in EU and can use the EU Right of Withdrawal? think again they dont care.11. Steam support AND rockstargames support cant help you with your problems.12. you want to post a thread on rockstargames support but your a new account? well you cant post for help for 30 days. good luck!13. takes hours to download this game its 67GB.Not even owned this game for 12 hours and I've experienced horrible lag bad customer support by not only rockstargames but also Steam in not being understanding of my situation by either unsuspending my account or providing a refund.

GTA IV felt like dragging you feet through mud while driving cars but that made it a lot more fun in retrospect. This handling feels as generic as i can make it more usable definetly but less enjoyableMaybe it's the fact that standing still for more than 2 seconds somewhere will make random people open fire on you for being suspiciousMaybe it's the more generic combat similar to the driving change all the iconic ragdoll based FUN of 4 is replaced with COVER SHOOTER 2017The online is a flamming mess don't even try it. Take two steps away from it and it's microtransactionsBut even after all this... i can still see why people enjoyed it didn't bother writing a review because it was very mixed for me. BUT HERE WE AREMods improved GTA 4 to the point of godlike status for me car handling even better amazing graphics tons of FUN and SILLY mods that made the singleplayer from a 6 to a 8 for me personally.The idea that the developers would take away their BIGGEST point of sale on PC.. just to make sure nobody cheats in money in the online. a pure cashgrab against PC gamers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-15,2,4,540,False,Recommended,"It's not as charming and wonderful as GTA IV was when it was first announced and later on released for PC but it is really great!The world feels and is a lot bigger but GTA IVs Liberty City felt somewhat more like an actual city it felt like home whilst GTA V only feels like California (which San Andreas is based on). The characters are really great but somewhat boring if you think of it. Michael is a burnt out bank robber with tons of cash and still wants/needs more and has the family drama of a housewife of what ever state show on TV.Franklin is a *clears throat* ""gangbanger"" who doesn't want to be one but still ends up being one whom later ends up *SPOILER but duh* robbing banks and is the only sensible of the three.And Trevor is the psycho we all end up loving because of his rather peculiar way of being a person. Don't take me wrong here the story is great but I never felt it being a movie or a game rather something you go through and forget bigger parts of the story only remembering one or two heists. This game is really great but I feel kinda burned out on games like these. GTA V put my enjoyment barrier through the roof as it has made it hard for me to actually touch any other game in the Third Person ""Anarchy Sim"" genre."" Was it worth the wait?""Yes yes it was."" Was it worth playing?""Yes and no yes because I ing love the GTA series and no because now I don't feel like playing anything else. Plus the driving is just tedious comparing to the heavy and ""hard"" driving in GTA IV which I enjoyed A LOT. I'll still have that big chunk of room in my heart for GTA IV GTA V did not steal it as GTA IV did.Other than what I said this is the game we've all been waiting for since it was first announced but it made me into a spoiled little gamer that probably will never ever play any other Third Person Free Roaming Sandox game.Oh and Online it's only fun with some pals pubs are either you ending up dead in the gutter or your car somewhere in the ocean making you have to pay for it...",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,209,False,Not Recommended,The single player mode is excellent. It has very good writing.However overall the game has been d out for money via it's online mode. Incentives to play the game modes is close to none because the reward is so miniscule that it would take ages to work up to the vehicles that most people seek to get.They make ingame money easier to get via real money transactions because seemingly they didn't get enough money from their record sales of the game on multiple platforms and two console generations (over 80 million copies sold).The game is centered around it's online mode. What about the single player DLC promised it could make the game so much better. GTA 4's DLC The Ballad of Gay Tony was a complete shift of the core game and was a complete work of art in it's own.I hope the developers see their mistakes.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-20,0,0,357,False,Recommended,GTA V is a tale of three criminals Michael Franklin and Trevor. Michael is a retired bank robber living a life of luxury with his family in witness protection but who misses the excitement of his old life. Franklin is a streetwise repo man who wants a better life for himself. Trevor is an unhinged meth dealer with a seriously broken moral compass. They re three very different characters brought together by a shared desire to break as many laws and make as much money as possible. All in all this game has its pros and its cons with some of the pros being the all new first person mode and a incredibly detailed open world with the cons being the occasional GTA Online connection problems and the odd bit of pop in But overall the game is Brilliant and is a solid 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-12,0,0,316,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a decent game with a superb singleplayer campaign and an outrageously fun multiplayer option. You'll notice everyone is complaining about mods not longer working or such I myself never used mods because I didn't fancy them. I have no say in the matter I just don't agree that everyone should down vote the game based on those reasons. I also found it astonishingly moronic that they also down voted other games like L.A Noire simply because it's a Rockstar title. The game includes a little bit of everything I myself find flaws every playthrough nothing too huge for me too list. I'm going to have to give the game a 4/5. I could see a 5/5 if the following DLC's are interesting. GTA V CAMPAIGN Pros + Weapon variations (Huge range of different weapons from Pistols to launchers.)+ Free DLC (Allows you to build unique tank builds.)+ Huge Collection of Vehicles (All sorts of terrain with color options.)+ Fun Missions + 3 playable characters (fun and when learned a whole new game)+ Achievements + Self Radio + Character Custimization + Humorous Dialogue + Great range with characters (Oldie gangster psychopath) Cons Glitches (Random deaths etc.) Ridiculous police (Police immediately become hostile by just standing next to them?) Absurd amount of similar missions with Franklin (Too many horde mode type missions.) Side missions are not as important as they should be (The game adds rather interesting side quests that you can just completely ignore and miss out on.) GTA ONLINE PROS/CONS Pros + Weapon variations (Huge range of different weapons from kitty bombs to guppies)+ Free DLC (Allows you to build unique tank builds.)+ Huge Collection of Vehicles (All sorts of terrain with color options.)+ Fun Missions + Crews (fun and when learned a whole new game)+ Great game to play with friends + Self Radio + Character Custimization + Great game to play with friends + Stores/places (StripClub 24/7 carwash gunstore clothestore and modshop) Cons Cheaters Bans are Ridiculous Toxic Community Graveyard for noobs (The game is either grind or Pay to win people with 60 hours have incredible weapons compared to beginners. People with $60 have even heavier armories.),Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-09,0,0,1,False,Not Recommended,Hello If you ve read my serious reviews in the past you know that I have a general format with it but now I am updating it and will be updating my other serious reviews to use the new format. This new format will have different categories weighed differently depending on what type of game it isGameplay 4/10*5 20pts/50ptsThe gameplay isn t really all that fun or interesting. Seems more or less like any another crime simulator. Does it have the worst gameplay I ve ever seen? No but with my experience with the game this is just meh level enjoyment.Story 6.37/10 *3 19.11pts/30ptsHaven t really played much of it yet but it looks like it will evolve into a cliché crime simulator type story.Don t really know what else to say about it. Take this with a grain of salt as I said before I have not played very much of GTA V but I can't shake that feeling. Graphics 9.75/10*1 9.75pts/10ptsThe graphics are amazing the texture details are incredible and so is the lighting. Truly a work of art to look at. It would be in my Top 5 as far as graphics go.Mechanics and Controlls 5/10*2 10pts/20ptsGTA V also falls flat here. Most of the game is fine most of it. However driving a integral part to GTA V is one of the worst things to do in the game. Driving is clunky and the cars in it are hard to control.Value 4/10*3 12/30ptsThis game is not worth the sale price of $14.99 CAD and certainly not worth the full $30 price. For that money I could buy DOOM EUIV an older CoD game ect. Of course however take that list with a grain of salt as these are the kinds of games I would much preferred to buy now getting a taste of GTA 5. Hell even Saints Row IV is better in my opinion (sure it might not be as polished as GTA V but is a lot more fun to me) and it is the closest non GTA game that I own. Overall 5.0/10 70.86/140pts Would I call it bad? Depends. It depends on who you are. I know people who would love to play GTA V and love these kind of crime simulator games. However I am not one of them but I can t say that it s a bad use of my money It was a game I never tried and a genre that I haven t really experienced other then the rather silly SR4. GTA V is a much more serious game compared to SR4 and it happens that this is just not for me. The story to me was meh the controls in a vehicle were harder then they should have been and this game is priced quite high (which is kinda understandable considering the budget that Rockstar blew away on this game),Grand Theft Auto V

There's so much to do party at night clubs fight off waves of cops race motorbikes go skydiving screw around at the pier amusement park or go full criminal and run from the cops through the high end Hollywood neighborhoods. The NPC interaction is amazing. If you steal a car from a tough guy there's a chance he'll pull you out of it and beat you up or even set a bounty on your head. Heck you can even ride up to streetwalkers in your muscle car and shell over $50 for sucky suck.The game's PvP does not shine. Certain PvP gamemodes involving shooting each other can be fun but for the most part the open world pvp is pretty fruity. There's a lot of modders and hackers who roam in flying cars and bikes and shoot rockets at you and there's not much you can do about it. There's armored cars that will charge you and blow you up and you can't really shoot the drivers out. You can enable passive mode to get around safely but that takes away your ability to shoot or even ride with friends so it's not very effective. At the end of the day the game's so fun that getting blown up or harassed every once in a while isn't that big a deal. You can always just start a lobby with friends. Plus most of their new content is free and at least just costs a lot of in game money to get started.Plus the graphics are pretty good.,Grand Theft Auto V

These airy delicate and crisp edged waffles are so fabulous yet so simple to throw together they're destined to become part of your weekend breakfast routine. Freeze leftovers if you have any in Ziplock bags and serve them during the week. You can pop them in the toaster to reheat (use a light setting) and they come out nearly as well as freshly made maybe even slightly crunchier.For a lighter fluffier waffle separate the eggs beat the whites until stiff then fold into the batter. For whole grain waffles use 1 1/3 cup all purpose flour and 2/3 cup whole wheat flour. You can also substitute brown sugar for the granulated.// Ingredients 6 tablespoons unsalted butter more for waffle iron 2 cups/240 grams all purpose flour 1 tablespoon/15 grams sugar 1 teaspoon/8 grams baking powder 1 teaspoon/5 grams fine sea salt ½ teaspoon/3 grams baking soda 1 cup plain yogurt (or see note) 1 cup milk 4 large eggs// PreparationMelt butter either on the stove or in the microwave.

The single player campaign is amazing and you are in for easily a good 70 hours of gameplay alone.Unfortunately the multiplayer lacks polishing...

I am guilty of modding and I thought it was acceptable to recieve a 1 month ban. But after that month I came back to play expecting that my money would be decreased and some of my recent purchases would be revoked instead my charachter was full blown deleted.... So I guess it was fun while it lasted but im not about to restart to get back where I left off now that I'm in college and will probably just get baned again regardless if I use the mods.

Then i robbed a few stores and got $3000 when suddenly a guy appeared and made me get in his lambo and then took me to his garage followed by a visit to his apartment. He then says ""i've called someone to keep us company"" while i'm taking a few puffs from a bong and then a hooker walks through the door and gives me a quick 10 minute lap dance. She says ""do you want me to get naked"" when i tell this to the guy who i've barely spoken to at this point he says ""nah bruv tities are at the strip club"".

2015-06-22,16,5,610,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V broke my heart.It was 11 30 in the morning. Or maybe it was night I don't remember the time of my tragedy. I was liesurely cruising through Los Santos in my Army jeep when BEHOLD! I found another player! She was friendly and shot me in the foot. So being friendly back I shot her in the foot. After having a laugh about it we got together and did missions. We spent countless hours together having fun and bonding. This girl was amazing! Finally I invited her back to my place. She accepted and we spent the night drinking together smoking weed and dancing by running around the couch. After enough was enough she asked to back to her apartment. We were both wasted off our asses but our love shone through it all like a lighthouse through fog. Getting into my car I got my bearings and pulled out of my garage. She gave me a waypoint to her house and I quick took off for it! We got good speed going but then.... because of all the drinking and smoking... the game took control of the wheel from my hands and gave it to Jesus! And he promptly smashed my car into a light pole! I survived with very little health but my female friend... was killed on impact. I tried to shake her body but the game took it as me wanting to shove her body out of my car which is what happened! Her body then promptly was run over by several SUVs killing her further into death.Unable to bear with having killed my friend I quickly jumped off an overpass into oncoming traffic and got run over by a firetruck. But even in death we could not be together. As she was tired and disconnected before I could add her.tl dr i missed a chance to score due to drunk driving.Best game ever 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-03,0,0,91,False,Not Recommended,"It's not often that I will negatively review a game but I feel as if it'd be nice for people like me to get my thoughts across on the state of the game right now.First of all don't get me wrong I loved the single player of this game so much it really was a lot of fun the story was decent and the gameplay was fluid and enjoyable. Graphics and sounds were also very well done.However multiplayer is stale and boring. It's very repetitive and in my opinion doesn't compare to the quality of the story mode whatsoever R* has in fact updated it multiple times the only really noticeable one in my opinion being heists they're not too bad but the rest such as the cars bikes etc. ""free dlcs"" are just a waste of time.This is my gripe with the game R* have barely touched single player. Imagine how awesome a single player expansion similar to GTA IV TBOGT/TLAD would be. They have showed little to no care in terms of single player and just out free ""content"" for multiplayer while promoting their cash cards to make money. I'd really like to see them expand on the multiplayer but at this point it does seem extremely unlikely.My verdict Disappointed as time passed on.There's also plenty of issues with multiplayer discussed further in other reviews such as random bans and a lot of technical issues etc.Don't get me wrong this game is good if you want to playthrough the story and maybe have a bit of fun in free roam but in my opinion it could have been a whole lot more improved if they didn't keep churning out ""content"" for multiplayer.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-24,0,0,617,False,Not Recommended,"I should note that OpenIV the main thing that caused this review to be written has had it's Cease and Desist notion backed away so I guess it is back and running? Not too sure take a look for yourself.Right I believe I should post a review about the game considering the recent controversy that has put GTA in a bit of a spotlight this time negative imstead of positive.As folks know already the modding tool OpenIV has recieved a Cease and Desist notice essentially terminating Singleplayer modifications (Important note Singleplayer)This essentially makes the singleplayer component of the game stuck with essentially the same old same old that being the same game with the same protagonists with the same you know already. No room for customization like that Rick Sanchez mod that was a thing.I will admit it has been noted that Modding was not exactly a welcome sight due to Take Two (Mostly them) and their concern that Singleplayer modding would leak in to their Online portion. Something that was pretty much impossible with OpenIV as it was not designed to cheat in the game.So of course that is the whole backlash thing. I guess I can also talk about the game since this is a review after all Singleplayer Everyone and their amoeba probably know what the singleplayer is about at this point in time so no need to talk about it. Except that it used to have extensive modification options but not really now.Multiplayer Something that is literary the only reason most people play the game for except some people still on the Singleplayer (Because honestly SP is still a pretty solid story to play through) as it is the main thing that is being supported by the developers. Although I would say that ovee time it started from what sounded like a good time in to a game of ""Whoever has the biggest gun"". I started it off as a street urchin and I gotta say it was pretty exciting but now that my character is quite a high level I feel like it is no longer a fun game but more of a slog of ""Eh another day another dude with a fighter jet nuking me"".Not to mention that hackers/cheaters are also quite frequent folks running scripts that make them immirtal make money drops or just screw with people. It is something that is simply not fun.This was written on a quick notice so some things might sound a bit odd so there's that.Anyway would I recommend the game? For the singleplayer I would say yes as it is a pretty solid experience. For Multiplayer? I would say no because it is a dismal place that multiplayer where you are forced to either grind for a long time to get somewhere or spend hundreds of your money to get something nice and pretty. Not to mention Take Two's controversy being a sore thing.Overall No I wouldn't say that the game should be purchased.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-18,6,56,220,False,Recommended,Its a shame you can only give one review per game as this really does need two. Firstly Single player. There is not much to say about it that hasnt already been said. It is one of the best I have ever played. I am not new to the GTA franchise and have always held San Andreas on a ridiculously high pedastal but I would say that this game has exceeded everything San Andreas held for me. The story is immersive the characters are unique insane and well built. There is plenty to do and more than enough to keep you coming back way after the final heist is complete. It is one of the best games of all time and every gamer should have this in their library (I somehow own it over 2 consoles plus PC).However I also have to include a review of online play in here too. Which is where I become torn. I have spent many hours online doing various heists with friends completed CM grinding CEO MC bunkers hangers ... grinding endlessly.The problem is that everything in the game is now so expensive that its becoming obvious Rockstar are trying to push people into buying Shark Cards to be able to afford everything the game has to offer without spending days/weeks/months killing your soul with grinds or cheat.Leading me on to issue number two with online play other people. Hackers cheaters trolls idiots. EVERYWHERE. And with the introduction of the new prep missions for the new heists involving running around in free mode fully visable to all of the above you have to luck out and find yourself in a session with some reasonable and quiet people if not some idiot with a tank/hydra/other form of destruction will float in and mess up your day or cost you all the supplies youve spent hours grinding (did i mention grinding?). Oh or hit you with the unavoidable death ray from his/her facility. I love playing the heists with my friends I enjoy the odd supply run to kill time and dont get me wrong online play is ok. But .... *sigh*I want to both thumbs up and down this game. For different reason. However in the end I do think there is enjoyment to online if youre lucky. But the overall near perfection of the single player mode means I cant not recommend GTA V.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,149,False,Recommended,"GTA V is a game that we have waited two years for to be ported and was it worth it? I can tell you hell yes with the additional graphics improvements made to the game along with the 60 frames the game feels a lot more smoother and richer visually essentially they have taken their time with this port and if you was to ask me would I buy it again I would say yes yes and yes.Along with the improvements being made to the games visuals we also have the online where 30 players can be on the same server including two spectators. You will also be able to import your character from the previous versions of GTA rather ""Inferior"" versions of GTA into the PC port.Personally with the time I have spent on it so far it feels and looks like a different game with me having played the 360 Xbox One and now PC versions of the game. and if you are contemplating on whether you should get this game then I would strongly recommend that you do as you will not regret it at all.Finally in terms of hardware requirements I feel that Rockstar have done what most publishers haven't. They have considered everyone who cannot afford a high end system and with that in mind their minimum specifications are not very demanding the only demanding aspect of this game will be its 4K resolutions. And the game is generally one of the best ports that I have ever played on PC.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-09-18,1,5,866,False,Not Recommended,I really really wanted to love this game. I really did. I preordered the damn thing endured three release date pushbacks and played almost 700 hours on the game that's not even counting the hours I spent playing on the Xbox 360 version. Despite being my most played game on Steam perhaps on any platform I really can't recommend this game to anyone I'd only recommend it to the clinically insane because that's what you'd have to be in order to want to sink thousands upon thousands of your hard earned dollarydoos into GTA Online to have any fun whatsoever.I am aware that Rockstar's plans for GTA Online DLC extend until 2020 but you'd think that they'd have made enough money off of the sales of one of the best selling games of all time to continue with said plans but no Rockstar rely on mindless idiots to buy multiple 60 Shark Cards every time a new update drops just to have a decent car and a military vehicle to muck about in. Everything is way too expensive even to the point where grinding the game to get what you want just stops being fun. And trust me I'd prefer to grind for the stuff I want and I would if I didn't have to carry out a month long chore every time I wanted to upgrade my vehicle.Nevertheless this isn't why I'm writing this review.Take Two Interactive the publishers of the game after ten years decide to be right s and order a cease &amp desist on the popular modding tool OpenIV you know the tool that's been actively used to create and install probably 90% of the mods in GTA IV and V?Especially with GTA games the modding community is what supports the lifespan and popularity of any PC game that gets sold. Just look at the games from way back when that started as mods and have now grown into even more popular fully fledged games. You still see this today with a few games so I'm really confused as to why the hell you would stop that from happening on your own...Nice one T2. On behalf of OpenIV you.I'm glad the Take Two modding debacle has been resolved but after visiting GTA Online after the Doomsday Heist has been released I can still say that this game is terrible. It's fun when you're not in a loading screen however being in a loading screen seems to be 75% of the actual gameplay.Don't buy this.,Grand Theft Auto V

I didn't have to buy it because I already have the game on Xbox but I spent my hard earned money on a full priced re release for the one fact that someday when i have a PC that can run this game I can mod the hell out of it and have a blast with it. You can see my new loathment for a game I used to love here.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,1,6,84,False,Recommended,"Great game as we all know it by now playing on consoles before (I only played it on 360 just for the sake of finishing it and then waited for PC release.)The game came with some issues for some people such as the username having special characters. However mine is my Microsoft Account with my email in there it didn't seem to caused any issues in launching the game. I did have some issue launching it at start as I would click on the play button and it would show for couple second on Steam that I'm ""in game"" but then it'd go away for no reason. The fix for that I found that you need to manually install the installers from ""Installers"" and ""_CommonRedist"" folder if you had an issue like mine where it didn't auto installed it.I am having another issue now the game crashing it only crashed twice so far in my almost 2hr of game play but still is annoying. I am hoping for it to be working fine with couple updates.So once you're past that and can launch the game successfully. It's a gorgeous looking one to say the least in my opinion PC port is better than Max Payne 3 for me. I'm playing it on 4K with 50 60 fps constantly in closed locaitons or while fighting and 45 50 while driving at everything max on 970 SLI setup. It's doing rather well and you'll get steady FPS with something like this setup.All in all .. the game is totally worth it's price I didn't like these launch issues that I had which were minor but the game crashing and saying ""GTA V has stopped working"" is making me mad to say the least and others are still facing some other issues.Maybe .. wait a while until they fix it at least they're not UbiSoft and I have high hopes from Rockstar to fix their mistakes.Launch issues aside game is very well optimized and well worth the price.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,2,19,702,False,Not Recommended,They created a wonderfully optimized port of the game and It had me thinking wow! Rockstar has finally gotten their together and realized how to cater to and capitalize off of the PC gaming market. Boy was I wrong! Yes the game runs AMAZING yes the gameplay both singleplayer and multiplayer is quite phenomenal yet they decide to make practically the worst mistake they could possibly make at this point. Banning for hacking/cheating ok I understand that that is in the most cases a positive selling point. Yet rockstar believes that it's a great idea to ban its players for the use of both harmless fixes to certain aspects of multiplayer and even singleplayer modifications. This has completley killed any form of modding community that could have came about from this game and I would say a good one third of the games population has already been banned. I have no idea what Rockstar was thinking when they made this desicion if not reverted this will be the last nail in the coffin for the relationship between Rockstar and the PC gaming and modding community. Now we get to sit and watch this game get downvoted into oblivion!tread carefully Rockstar your actions from this point forward are going to be crucial to both your future game sales and player population Wise revisions are in order if you wish to keep a salvagable reputation.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-14,0,0,228,False,Recommended,"Due to Rockstar and Take Two withdrawing the legal threat OpenIV is back. This negative review is now null and void.I will keep this review up as a record of what happened. however I will change the rating to a positive one.Just to show that indeed OpenIV has been updated http //i.imgur.com/tsb3RXG.png I used to like GTA I used to like Rockstar but time and time again they treat us the gamers like Today Rockstar Games and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and it's all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propeled grindfest.Once upon a time I would have recommended this game I would have recommended any Rockstar game but not anymore.Edit I know none of you want to believe your precious Rockstar is at fault here I know you want to put blame solely on Take Two but that isn't the bloody case. Rockstar Games is the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series Take Two owns Rockstar Games but they infact give a lot of autonomy to Rockstar Games. The people that initiated the C&amp D were Rockstar Games AND Take Two despite what you want to believe that is the way it is. The people you think support mods no longer exist. Management changes in companies and the last time I can recall Rockstar ""supporting mods"" was back in the GTA IV days which is a long time ago.Stop defending Rockstar.

I've played nearly all GTA games and this is one of the ones that I have thoroughly enjoyed the online aspect really does add extra depth It brings new things to do and own that aren't in Story mode.

2017-02-25,0,0,154,False,Not Recommended,I will start off saying that while this game worked i had a blast playing with my friends in a closed friend session never really bothered with open online as its just a mess of strangers as a group we put alot of hours into it and recently convinced two more friends to buy the game to play along too until one day out of the blue i recived a 30 day suspension and a complete character wipe safe to say i was not overly impressed after hunting around for a number i called rockstar support only to be told to read the EULA and that is all they could do for me. they could give me no reason for the ban and i read through the EULA and found that i had broke none of their terms i couldnt have been reported as i only play with my friends away from strangers. i was angry but as they could do nothing acepted it as a system glitch and just waited out the ban two days ago it lifted so i thought id test it out with a friend to see if it worked okay absolutely no problems so i logged off with the intention of getting the whole gang together the next evening only to find once id gathered everyone that i had been permenantly banned aka no acess to online whatsoever story mode only. i called up again and i got the same response read the EULA not exactly helpful i would absoloutely not reccomend this game to anyone unless youre willing to roll the dice on weather or not you can keep the online feature after 2 sessions. unless rockstar release an apology and a patch to the automatic banning system do not buy this game if you intend on playing online unless of course you want to pay 40 every week to keep playing with new characters.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,0,0,328,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.That s still where we stand on it today. And whether you agree that it s a masterpiece or not the PC version is definitely the best way to play GTA 5. Developer Rockstar has taken full advantage of the technical power of the platform and made GTA feel right at home here. It s well optimized and the frame rate and resolution will go as high as your hardware can handle including 4K/UHD resolutions and multi display setups. Maxed out the enormous and incredibly detailed open world region of San Andreas looks more amazing than ever thanks to long draw distances and enhanced effects. This is the only place you can play GTA 5 at 60 frames per second (or higher) and with all the high speed driving and shooting it definitely benefits from that smoothness.Graphics options are plentiful and powerful with everything from standard quality and view distance adjustments to a field of view slider (though it s more limited than discriminating FOV players might want modders have already remedied that). Controls are customizable and you can play your own music library on the in game radio. It s hard to complain much about that.For the most part the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. That s best exemplified with the web browser which feels like you d expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus it s a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation gun store s wares with the mouse than it is with a D pad or arrow keys but it s still totally workable. It s simply a small reminder that this wasn t originally a PC game.Using a mouse to shoot on the other hand is good enough that it risks making combat feel a little too easy. I don t pretend to be a brilliant marksman but if you re a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when I m using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head especially when playing in first person mode. That doesn t mean I felt invincible though because the authorities will never stop coming until you give up and run away or die they re always going to give you a challenging fight through the weight of sheer numbers.Nice PC specific control touches like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You don t get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions either.One of my favorite things about the control setup though is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap just push a button on one or the other and all on screen prompts change to reflect what you re using. It s a fantastic thing for a game like this where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick. You can even use both at once if you like.Then there s GTA Online which has been very well behaved this week (I m as surprised as you!). Though I ve experienced the occasional disconnect or bout of lag it s nothing out of the ordinary for an online game that matches up groups of up to 30 players. What is out of the ordinary is how diverse and varied the available activities are dozens of different types of deathmatches co op missions (including the all new and very impressive multi stage heists) races over land sea and air (some of which involving combat) and general open world chaos like spontaneous drive by shootings (or strafing runs) of other players. The online version of San Andreas is a place where anything can happen at any time and it s fantastic to watch people make use of that freedom even if the majority of it is the inherent humor of crashing things into other things.The main PC specific feature is the Rockstar Editor movie tool and its associated Director Mode which gives you access to a wide spectrum of playable character models. It s a powerful creative tool that lets you easily capture gameplay clips and then edit and export them into what can end up as extremely elaborate movies. I did experience a crash that robbed me of about an hour s work on a classy short film about a man in an alien costume who punches people on a beach without provocation. I love the flexibility of the camera and the simplicity of the editing controls they make me wish I had a finer eye for filmmaking as I go for easy laughs with a montage of slow motion close ups of fists hitting faces. Fortunately there are far more creatively talented folks out there who will entertain us for years to come with GTA 5 made machinima.The VerdictGrand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open world games aspire and it s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do explore and play with both in single player and multiplayer plus great creative tools it s truly amazing on multiple levels.,Grand Theft Auto V

However Take 2 a company that do not care about you and just see you as big bags of money have riddled the multiplayer with microtransactions and therefore the multiplayer is Take 2's main method of earning money from gta 5. This has resulted in the main singleplayer version of the game missing content such as the hydra other vehicles and jobs even though the singleplayer is better. Take 2 have done this in order to gain more money from people playing the multiplayer version and buying microtransactions.But of course it does not stop there. Just recently Take 2 have decided to take away the main mod that was the backbone of the gta 5 singleplayer modding. This has effectively destroyed the gta modding community. But what has Take 2 gain from effectively destroying the community? Well due to the missing mods the singleplayer is now missing even more content and that of course means more people will play the online version and buy the microtransactions.I don't really mind Rockstar but seriously it seems like everyone at gta dont care about us and just want money.

2015-05-21,0,0,155,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is the long awaited PC port of the best selling gaming series but was it worth the wait ? The answer is yes it was worth it. In Grand Theft Auto 5 we play as not 1 but as 3 characters at once. Michael is a retired bank robber who settles down for a normal life with his family in the sun soaked city of Los Santos Trevor is Michael's best friend who is also a psychopath meth dealer who tries to run his business in the small town of Sandy Shores and Franklin a repo man who tries to go up the criminal food chain. All things are set into motion when Michael levels a house he believes belongs to his wife's lover but really belongs to drug cartel. After that he is put back into the game going into increasingly dangerous heists. The story is the best story for a GTA game. As with the other ones I couldn't push myself to finish the story this time I enjoyed this a lot. The main characters all have different abilities that change up the gameplay. Franklin can slow down time when driving a car to go through some of the tougher corners Michael can slow down time like Max from Max Payne while shooting and Trevor can go into rampage mode where he takes less and does more damage. The gameplay is the same thing you see in the previous games. This game is huge and there is a lot of stuff to do. You can play Tennis go skydiving race cars boats bikes. This game is huge and you will need a lot of time before you are able to do everything the game has to offer. The multiplayer is pretty much the same as the single player so i won't talk about it too much. But there are a few negatives I want to shine some light on. The game has a nasty memory leak which Rockstar haven't fixed since launch there are still a lot of bugs in both the Single Player and Multi Player. Overall this game is amazing and if you do get it you will love every second of it. Get this game straight away. I give Grand Theft Auto V a 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2019-02-08,0,0,40,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto the series of my childhood I couldn't miss this one. Let me talk about single player first.GTA5 takes place in San Andreas just like GTA San Andreas released back in 2004. Rockstar tried hard to make GTA5 as good as possible and it's indeed a fantastic game and a worthy addition to the series and my Steam library. It took me about 40 hours to finish it including side missions.It's much better than GTA4 at least when it comes to graphics map design missions vehicles... planes are back trains are back parachutes are back.. and almost everything is better except damage system (which is undoubtedly worse). The whole time I was unsure if this is really better than the original San Andreas and honestly I can't tell 9 years passed between both games the gameplay and style has changed both are a bit different but in my opinion equally good.They still didn't get rid of the old bugs like missing cars (your fully upgraded car can disappear anytime unless you watch it 24/7). It's better every character has his own car that can be modified and whenever you leave it it will just respawn near your savehouse but sometimes it just disappears randomly just like the normal cars.it was fun it's a must have for everyone who likes open world games. Definitely one of my top 10 games. Now about multiplayer... it's... unique. Seriously there's nothing like this out there. GTA Online offers a new open world+coop experience it's amazing. Loading times are horrible even on SSDs but the experience is fantastic.What else to say just get it. If you like open world games you'll love it.

2018-03-24,8,98,12,False,Recommended,I have no opinion on GTA Online or the recent mass ban controversy. I don't generally play multiplayer games usually only single player.GTA V (single player) is absolutely amazing one of the funnest open world games I've ever played. I played the disc version prior to buying it on Steam and I can't wait to dive back in. I've been playing GTA since GTA III launched in 2001 and GTA V surpasses them all even though the older ones are classics (yes even IV). The older games are better in some areas (radio stations humor etc.) but GTA V is better in gameplay and the sheer massiveness of the open world is pretty awesome. You can easily log 60+ hours in the single player campaign alone probably much more.

The graphics are amazing and extremly customizable so it can fit any computer. I really have no complains about the story so far and the game itself is really amazing. You can literally do anything! I mean you can play golf tennis and other sports you can do heists online you can play races customize cars buy apartments buy luxury yachts and MUCH MORE! Pros VS ConsPROS GRAPHICS! STORY! Updates. The offline mode hasen't really got any updates but the Online version gets atleast one update a month! That's nice!CONS The loading times. Sometimes it can take up to 1 5 minutes to load online (I don't have a bad computer go to my profile for specs). I know this is something they really can't fix because this game is HUGE. (63GB) Hackers. There are tons of hackers in the online version and Rockstar isn't really doing a great job in banning them. Also if you pick upp hacked money you will likely get banned.Well I can only say that this game is worth the money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-29,0,0,478,False,Not Recommended,"Edit Recommendation switched to NOT recommended. The recent update made it too difficult to look past the blatant attempts to force you into giving them more money with their shark cards. It is completely and absolutely impossible to achieve anything of note in the multiplayer without spending hundreds of hours grinding it. Whoever is in charge of pricing and all kinds of balance needs to be immediately fired. They are clearly not doing their job.I've seen korean games with cash shops treat their players with more respect than this. And with more sane economy balancing.GTA V is two games in one A single player game with a storyline and GTA online named so for reasons one may assume to be obvious. As such this review will mainly focus on the online as that is what I have mostly played and why I purchased it. With that said there are obvious similarities in it and many of the things I will mention apply to both.In Grand Theft Auto you mainly start the game small Whether homeless or with just a small house there is very little you can lose. And from there you begin your adventure in crime and moneymaking. With what appears to be an anarchocapitalist society filled with well made backstory and world complete with multiple full series of cartoons mock TV channels(Better than real TV!) and radio stations. There is an internet ingame with plenty of often humour filled websites along with useful ones that you will find to be genuinely interesting on their own.In short The worldbuilding is top quality there is a lot of effort and attention in it and it shows that it was a great priority when it was madeIn contrast the controls are not very well thought through. Aside from the car and boat controls they are very clunky and questionable with movement being difficult to get right and taking cover means you will stick to the wall too long when you want to get going to other cover and you will not stick to cover when you actually want to stay in it. I've found the movement and cover to be questionable at best. Switching weapon is a massive pain and will generally not be viable unless you are not actively in combat. For airplanes and helicopters there is no joystick support at all.Following what they did right with vehicles is the damage model for cars. As may be expected from a GTA game the cars can be damaged destroyed and otherwise have their function impeded. Though it isn't massively realistic it is good enough to give you natural damage effects such as veering to the left or right or the engine beginning to break and give less power. It is then a shame that this will almost never show up in multiplayer unless you are a terrible driver because a thing that they clearly did not think about for the multiplayerNamely the balance. Everyone gets a homing rocket launcher no matter their level. This rocket launcher will destroy most cars in one hit and blows anything flying out of the air with a little aim and luck. This means that while you can put armour on your car to protect it from bullets your vehicle's function is more along the lines of ""Has it exploded? Yes or no"" than anything else. Similar for non vehicle pvp. You will be either dead in seconds or your enemy is dead no long firefights with players here. Pvp modes are a bit better but still often feel unfair. Much like this the rest of the online balance is out the window with many things costing a large amount of money and income being generally very low even for things with several millions of input needed to set them up. If you want anything more than just a gun and a random car you can still from the street you are going to have to actively grind for money or play for a very long time without spending on anything.The loading and in general connecting to the online servers for a first time in a session(Or when switching session) takes a truly massive amount of time though I have been told it is much less in single player I will still say it is unreasonably long You can go do the dishes and return in time to catch the end of the loading screen. Something I know because I've done that. I have no idea how they thought this was acceptable.With that said the rest of it is mostly good Sound and looks are pretty decent the map seems very nicely made with lots of interesting details and plenty of hidden spots. Someone seems to have thought about everything on the mapIn the end what really sells GTA isn't the pvp and fighting other people online. What is good about it is the single player the missions and the world. For online the one thing that is much more interesting than any of the official selling points is the fact that it is a world you can hop into with your friends and drive around together do a few missions or just decide to take everyone on a race go parachuting or even just play a round of golf. There may not be a real grouping up mechanic and there are a large amount of flaws in multiplayer but as just a world for you and your friends to hang out in and do whatever you want to do it does incredibly well.I certainly got my money worth even if it would have been full price. It has a fair amount of technical issues with it but the design is great for many things and there is almost always something to do. Sadly it seems a large part of it is just flat out bad so maybe wait for a sale just in caseEdit Not worth it if you're looking for multiplayer. I've tried really hard to enjoy it but it's just not possible. The income rate you get even if you grind is not going to get you anything of note. Don't bother with it except for single player",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,1,3,1080,False,Not Recommended,I have a LOT of hours in this game. Most of it has been fun. The single player version of this game is fantastic. Sadly Rockstar has turned into a largely money hungry company and ruined the online play. Everything is pay to win now. Every update they release tons of new content which is awesome. The new content would cost you over 1000 dollars of REAL MONEY to get all the items. I was lucky enough to have a lot of spare cash from previous events and such to get SOME of the new items but it would take you a very very long time to get enough money to buy any of the items legit. I do wish rockstar would focus on adding some more single player content. I also wish they would stop harassing the modding community and let them have their fun.

2015-08-26,0,0,281,False,Recommended,Before I get to the big negative I'll just say that I love this game I consider it to be a nearly perfect homage to the entire GTA series taking bits and pieces from GTA 3 Vice City San Andreas and IV blending them into what is (imo) a great ending to the entire series. Even though there will certainly be more GTA games after this one no doubt I still think this game feels like an ending to the series really brings everything full circle. If they for some reason stopped after 5 I would be cool with that I mean what a good note to end it all on especially in contrast to IV and even San Andreas. Now for the negative be warned the PC version of this game is extremely flawed in fact some folks got really unlucky including myself. I've personally experienced the worst memory leak I've ever seen in a PC game now I've met plenty of people that don't experience it and good for them I hope most people don't experience it but I think people should be warned about this when purchasing GTA 5 that this could become a game breaking problem for them. For me the memory leak actually got so bad at one point that the game was using almost all of my memory causing my OS to crashed and I had to power button it after a few hours of playing that's really bad. Luckily upgrading to windows 10 fixed the memory leak for me but with that came new problems the game stutters a lot now especially in the lost MC trailer park and plenty of other random areas. So sadly I'm now I'm at the point where I uninstall this oversized 60 gig game and never play it again on pc. I mean come on guys GTA 4 was a horrible port but the 20 25 fps drops didn't stop me from putting 700+ hours into it GTA 5 is a different story though there is no excuse for me running out of ram while playing this game when I have 8 gigs what kind of a game uses that much and on low settings too. Sorry Rockstar but it really did feel like a punch in the stomach to wait on the pc version for nearly 2 years just to run into this massive road block that never got fixed even after contacting customer support. I give up I guess I'll have to just stick with the ps3 version. UPDATE I've tried out a program called cacheboost and it seems to have fixed or at least greatly improved the memory leak the game still stutters a lot in giant gunfights but it's playable.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-10,0,0,173,False,Not Recommended,"GTA Online is garbage and is full of cheaters who's only goal is to make you angry. The only way to get money is to grind for hours and then spend it all on a single car or buy shark cards which is what they want. Single player is horrifically boring once you 100% it which doesn't take long. Where is the single player DLC that has been rumored and teased over the years? It's not going to happen. And even if it did happen it'd be just a big old money grab SEga does it with the total war series so i'd be surprised if they released DLC for 60 Bucks ontop of GTAO. GTA Online is Take Two's cash cow. They won't release SP DLC because then people will stop playing online which will stop shark card purchases. Mods are the reason I still play this game. Playing LSPDFR is the most fun I've ever had in this. Playing in my world is what I enjoy not playing in a microtransaction filled fest.GooD NTS has not released a statement about OpenIV so far other than the initial one when this happened but OpenIV was updated recently to remove the ""Uninstall Later"" message. It has also been put up again on the official site which can be found here http //openiv.com/ THough i do love the game i do not approve of what they're doing or were trying to do.

2017-06-16,0,0,207,False,Not Recommended,When this was released this game was amazing unfortunately over time the single player has clearly been neglected in favour of the online multiplayer. What is worse is that the online mode has become a micro transaction hell hole where you either grind for several hours a day just to afford a new vehicle or spend a fortune on Shark Cards. Many of the best vehicles aren't available in single player and online has become a playground for those with the most money. It's a shame because it had such promise.R* make the game equal for single players and I'll change this back to a positive review.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-23,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,There's not much to say about single player it's a masterpiece.Howewer gta online is a disaster of similar proportions.Heists are absurdly hard. With enemies coming in dozens being able to hit you from 300 meters with a pistol and destroy your super heavy armor in one shot. Playing on easy is in turn boring and unrewarding. Devs just tried to inflate play time by inadequate difficulty All non heist missions are just state of the art BS consisting mainly of driving a car while fighting off endless floods of enemies who appear from nowhere just to shoot you and disappear into the blue if you manage to outrun them. this is also the case for some heists.As if this wasn't enough lobby system designed by a complete moron if someone leaves or disconnects game disbands whole lobby forcing an entire team to watch unbearably long loading screens not once but several times. If lobby is full game only tells you about it after you guessed it a loading screen! And then yet another loading screen.Open world is meaningless. Because of the reasons mentioned above it is filled with angry players too tired from lobby torture so they are just kill and explode everything in vicinity. the rest are cheaters who can do just about anything to spoil the fun from exploding everybody to turning everyone into a hobo asking for money. situation only changed a bit with release of open world events.Right now online is a gimmick a failed attempt to create an mmo game would look much more consistent with the saint's row style coop with three characters it would be much more interesting.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-04,0,0,714,False,Not Recommended,At first it was great. Single player was perfect. Everyone was having fun.Then they released a patch that ed up the FPS. Online was decent. Everyone was still having fun.Then they added more and more DLC. Single player was alright. Online was Pacific Standard. Everyone was grinding.Then they added the overpriced offices/yachts/recycled warehouses with their useless customization. Single player was forgotten. Online was shark cards. Everyone was bored.This continued for the past year with more and more useless events that didn't pay enough more and more money wasting products that were forgotten in 2 weeks and less and less players to play Online with.This was all because of how much money R* was making with the Shark Card microtransactions.You pay like 75 euros and get 8 million in GTA Online. Those 8 mil can get you 2 Pegasus vehicles 4 cars and clothes that you will never use again.Problem is if you really wanted to get lots of money in Online you could just ask someone with cheats to drop you like 50 million or even do it yourself with another copy of GTA 5.R* doesn't like people circumventing their microtransaction system so instead of going after those who create the cheats and use them (which there were plenty of) they went for the shortcut and shut down the entire modding scene including the single player modders(which there were way more of than in Online). A large selling point of GTA 5 on PC was mods. And now that selling point is gone.I will not be buying anything from them ever again and I hope that you won't be too.Good job tar.,Grand Theft Auto V

It just seems so dumb and unreasonable.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-22,0,0,430,False,Not Recommended,I'm going to start off by saying that this game is fun immersive and addictive. It can be a ton of fun. The reason I'm currently not reccomending this game is because of the recent events that took place in both online and single player. As many people may know many Rockstar and Take Two games have suffered from their recent choices which was to basically hunt down and crucify ALL modders. I'm not talking about those little s**** on GTAV online who teleport you under the map. I'm talking about every single one. Even the people who just mod in single player. Also tons of other people who aren't even modders are being punished. For example someone who recieves 1000 dollars from a modder has 100000 dollars subtracted from their in game balance. The thing that gets under my skin the most is the single player mod ban. It's not even impacting anyone. It's basically saying that someone can't build a house on their own land. Many people exclusively played GTAV for the mods. Mods were a crucial part of GTAV because you could change it into a different game. You could go from Portal 2 to Tsunami simulator. The mods and the people who made them were truly amazing because it ment GTA was not just one game. It could be configured and modified to be qny game where only the sky was the limit. Rockstar not only restricts it now but will punish you if you do mod anywhere which in my opinion is outrageous.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,216,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar and Take2 (the companies who own the GTA IP) have really done nothing but proven themselves to be user hostile greedy businessmen with the release of this game. Please allow me to enumerate just a smidge of the countless issues that have come from this game's four year lifespan in chronological order.1) Console Exclusivity multiple delays for PC release.All of the PC gamers who were excited for the fifth rendition of the GTA franchise were put on hold a number of times delaying the release of the PC version of the game by 2 whole years after the original release on the XBox and PS3 in 2013.2) Post release game development issuesLoading screens for this gigantic (70gb+ game) last into the 10s of minutes even with it being loaded on my SSD in my $1200+ rig and my 400Mbps+ internet. That is for EVERYTHING. Going into online itself joining races heists your apartment etc. This is not a localized issue I see this complained about everywhere. Adding to the overall clunkiness of the online scene of this game is the poorly developed netcode for the online mode. Rockstar used a meshnet esque connection type instead of localized dedicated servers because running servers is expensive. The choice of using such a connection means almost all checks for hacks and cheats for multiplayer are client side (essentially meaning anyone can gain access to cheats for this game with little to no experience required.)3) Singleplayer not being on par with multiplayer.There are multiple examples of this but one that is very prominant is the fact that you cannot get the Hydra (a very popular jet) in singleplayer. The Hydra is only found in the Online mode.4) In game text is censored.I have and always will be baffled by the absurdity of this part. You cannot say any sort of curse word in the game's text chat. They are automatically censored. You also cannot say rockstar or R* or any major online company in the chat. I find it so bewildering that a rated M game featuring hookers strip clubs extreme violence and even cutscenes with those same banned curse words in them would not allow players to communicate with each other in such a way. This doesn't seem like a big deal but you cannot even say something like West Virginia without it being censored. Why? Because 'virgin' is a naughty word according to rockstar. My personal opinion of this is that it is a cash grab it allows parents to feel safe that their 12 year old is playing a game because ""other people aren't saying naughty things to them"". Just a possibility.5) Toxic community.Adding onto my previous point the fanbase for this sort of game is a bunch of hormonal 14 year olds who have no maturity and make their only goal in the game to upset you as much as possible. I can't even explain how many times I have had to use the ""Find New Session"" button only to be joined with a new lobby containing even more toxicity or even the same people who were bothering me before. It's awful.6) Microtransactions and pure cash grabs.Users who play this game will find everything to be extremely overpriced. 1 million dollars in this game can get you one low end apartment. No cars. No decent weapons etc. How much does it cost in real money to get 1 million in game? $20 (well $19.99). The ""shark cards"" in this game cost up to $100usd and can give you up to $8 million. Earning money in this game is extremely difficult and time consuming. a full set of heists (around 4 hours of gameplay) will earn you around $700 000. Insanity. Rockstar and Take2 are all about double dipping into their consumer's wallets with this game having microtransactions on top of a $60 (despite it being 4 years old) game. 7) All steam sales have been screwy with this game.Rockstar has never let this game dip below $39.99. When it goes on sale instead of lowering the price they just bundle in $1mil in game money and call it good. This combined with microtransactions and the fact that it was released on console for full price and then on pc for full price just creates a triple dip that Rockstar and Take2 have been loving to take advantage of. 8) This game is filled with constant hackers.Rockstar and Take2 have further proven their apathy when it concerns customers by their actions about online hacking in the game. Hacking is so prevalent that I have had only about 1 in 6 sessions where there is NOT a hacker present in the game. Hackers have full control over everything including wiping your hard earned cash and cash that you have paid for via shark cards(for good thanks to the awful netcode and development for the online platform of this game) killing you crashing your game and/or computer DDoSing you and more.9) Take2 has sent Private Investigators to mod creator's homes.This one is honestly pretty self explanatory.10) Take2's CEO has said that they have ""intentionally UNDERmonetized"" their users. So $60 for the four year old game endless microtransactions and a double release is UNDERmonetizing your users? I don't think so Take2.11) Take2 has sent Cease and Decist letters to the creators of OpenIV a mod that allows for the creation of singleplayer only mods for this game. Take2 does not care about the creative community behind its own games simple as that. OpenIV did absolutely nothing wrong and Take2 decided they didn't want to deal with it. This review is honestly only covering the surface of this game's issues. I really would like to see some improvement on Take2 and Rockstar's side before I changed my review.",Grand Theft Auto V

But because there is money involved thing change radicaly. When banning modding you take away the fun you can have with non vanilla software. By doing this you are forcing your buyers (players) to play what you have created. If you are paying money for something you should have the right to alter it in a little way.

EDIT take two reverted their decision. what a big ing shocker. it couldn't possibly have anything to do with the entire world being on them for it.i'm still gonna leave this as a negative review because honestly the game sucks regardless.am i a proper reviewer? am i a person who enjoys modifying my singleplayer experience with third party addons? i'm neither i'll be honest. but that doesn't mean i won't stand up with what is currently the commotion that's been plaguing my feeds and my conversations for a while now.i'm not a person who normally takes the time to type out long reviews but this is one exception i will gladly make. the issues i will address here are of course the situation with OpenIV and my own issues that i think are worth the mention.if you're going to take legal action against supremely innocent modding stuff made by the fans who genuinely enjoy this game just in an attempt to stop the negative outcome of it then that's just sad. maybe invest in an anti cheat that isn't faulty yeah? the amount of illicit players in GTA Online (at least when i played) makes the public session experience an absolute torm. then there's the actual base game with some extremely unbalanced weaponry that requires you to basically pay out the just to find a half decent counter for *cough* hydras.the game was a gem upon initial release but unfortunately it has gotten worse and worse over time. adding more and more content doesn't always make it better when the brand new additions completely trump the previous ones you worked so hard to gain access to.shark cards are an option and that's perfectly understandable. what isn't understandable is that the game requires you to go into public sessions (again a disaster of modders mostly with ill intent) and yet they are either not moderated to the extent that is necessary or are not moderated at all. in the midst of all of that you're expected to carry out a lengthy task that is 0% fun and 100% tedious with the hope of making profit before inevitably having them shattered by either a loser in a hydra or a modder who just outright explodes you and your shipment. this is really the true reason why i believe shark cards are even bothered to be looked at by the community let alone purchased at their ridiculous price.with 100 dollars in my pocket i could either buy a shark card that makes me an instant virtual millionaire or i could buy a game bundle that satisfies me with new experiences to venture into.did i enjoy this game? initially i truly did. for a short time.the game for me quickly gets stale. i give it 10 minutes on most runs. public sessions previously gave me a thrill and i enjoyed having shootouts or bouts with another player at sniping (which with the heavy sniper is truly a joke). i had a fun time with the game. even though i mostly spent my time fighting with some other players at least they were legitimate and they got me righteously. i can tolerate an RPG in a one on one i can tolerate a tank. however what is intolerable is the sheer destruction of the experience performed by your friendly local modder (the not friendly ones). but hey at least they pay better than the awfully executed jobs. when the memeatic youtuber notorious for his GTA V content decides to livestream a fidget spinner for 24 hours then something's gone horribly wrong.i feel sincerely sorry for my friend who spent 60 bucks to get me this game. he scarcely touches this title and i basically just never play it. if you like this game that's fine. you go have some fun and just sign off this shoddily done review. our tastes are different and that's respectable. i'm not even sure if modders exist online at this point i'm just letting prior experience speak for me.TL DR the ill willed modding performed online is a complete disaster the base game is like a massive ocean that is extremely shallow and taketwo's decision was really bad.as for rockstar deepest condolences. i know you aren't a totally evil company. at least.. i hope. you can thank your publishers for tarnishing your title to the rest of the world.just please please don't screw up with red dead 2.edit at least the single player is decent.also to solve public match issues take a gander at port blockers like Guardian. it'll save you a massive headache from the complete how that is this game's anti cheat and give you a way to actually have some fun with some pals.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-08,0,0,287,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V a single and multiplayer game deep at the core with many hours of gameplay seriously is a good game and worth picking up if you can get it on sale for $30 or less. The story is fun and the game is balanced and rather optimized. However there are some things I and others don't like GTA Online is the very definition of toxic and isn't worth the pay to win grind unless you dream of bullying newcomers in the future. You will be killed repeatedly until you figure out how to do it to others. To make any reasonable amount of money you need a squad or you'll be left in the dirt mind you everything costs money in GTA. The rest of this isn't for Online though personally I think GTA 5 is unenjoyable without mods. Back in June Take Two Interactive sent a Cease and Desist letter to the team behind OpenIV a modding software for GTA with the hopes that it would severely slow modders from messing with Online. They have since taken it back but the scar will remain hence my negative review.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-16,0,0,380,False,Not Recommended,"preordered the game and played it for a long time WITH MODS. Then Take two came and made modding ILLEGAL...UPDATE 25/6/2017So apparently mods are back. Of course i'm happy about these news but i won't change my review to positive. Take Two screwed up big time and i won't forgive them.UPDATE 17/7/2018It has been more than a year since the modding thing happened. No further actions were taken towards banning single player mods but like I said before I won't be changing this review. Main reasons for not changing it are 1. Take Two screwd up once and could do it again2. GTA ONLINE is a mess (more on this down below)3. Lack of love for the SP side of the game REVIEW GTA V is an amazing game. I've played it through multiple times and the story still feels fresh. However there are some issues later on. After completing the singleplayer campaign the game slowly turns boring. Rockstar has not added anything new to the SP side of the game for the last few months while the online side of the game receives massive amounts of new content every few months.Now this is my main complaint about GTA V and GTA ONLINE. Money has too much power. If you haven't played the online mode since the release you will struggle to get into it. The newest planes and other toys cost way too much. One of the planes even costs as much as the game itself! The online mode just isn't enjoyable as it has devolved into a PAY TO WIN paradise. Due to the massive amount of ""optional"" microtransactions the online mode is riddled with hackers aswell because grinding is so slow that even a normal gamer would quickly download hacks or open their wallets and go bankrupt. Besides greedu developers and hackers there is a third group of people who ruin the online for new players and that is griefers. Have you ever wanted to get blown up by a 13 yo screamer who bought a fighter jet with her mommy's credit card? In that case GTA ONLINE is for you!Ok so you might think that's ok. You might say that you can play with the planes and stuff in singleplayer arn you don't have to use money on microtransactions. WRONG! Rockstar was kidn enough to NOT add the newest vehicles and guns to singleplayer so you're stuck with the old things that we've seen a million times before. They even went as far as adding a script that automatically DELETES any DLC vehicles you might try to spawn with trainers. From the things I've said in this review you could easily get a very negative picture of the game and while that picture is an accurate representation of the game it doesn't tell the truth. GTA V is a good game that has been ruined by greed and bad business practices but there is yet hope. The modding community is active and the mods being made make the game exciting to play again. So if you want a great sandbox to mess around in GTA V is for you. If you want a great multiplayer game...you better look elsewhere or hope that your wallet has infinite money in it.",Grand Theft Auto V

Online is using P2P services to run the online play and it is awful. Loads of people are having serious connection problems and timing out all the time after a few minutes. There are fixes but it is seriously annoying that Rockstar cant get there ducks in order to fix it. Another huge problem is the amount of hackers online. I have played loads of games in the last 20 years and i got to say this is the worse game for hacking i have ever seen. Its worse then Counter strick or Dayz when they both first came out. There is literally hackers in nearly every server or at least in every 1/2 servers. It is awful and they do everything from taking all your money and weapons to other stuff. I have met one hacker them seemed friendly and started shooting cats out of his minigun but most of them are out to grief people as they know rockstar wont do nothing to them.

At first I thought its was bad refresh rate but then I realised its his shirt fluttering in the wind. Holy **** that's awesome that they included stuff like that. The list goes on about little things but their are a few cons. The only cons I could really find is crashing issues. Now this is different person to person. It's not my system either because I have a very powerful computer. It's just launch bugs which every game has.

2015-05-13,2,13,129,False,Recommended,This game is absolutely amazing! The one that immediately became one of my top favorites which I wanna play over and over again. Los Santos awesome city. It is so beautifully designed with so much attention to details that I could probably live there. If you like hot pursuits cop chases with shooting you've got it. Whether you want to take a relaxing ride in a super car on city and country roads with spectacular views fly a plane copter sail a boat ride a bike and so on you've got it. If you're a fan of some sports activities you can play golf tennis darts run a triathlon jump with parachute. And of course many many different customizable cars and weapons at your disposal. Everyone can find some tasks of their interest. Gripping storyline missions is mixed with many other activities which will never make you bored. I've played around 65 hours so far and still only 55% done. All this comes with really awesome graphical performance city looks almost like real pretty good music great voice acting and many funny dialogs.And this is only single player. In GTA online you can do all this stuff together with your friends. Not to mention new heists which are also awesomely designed as far as everybody says (Yeah I ve not played them yet but really looking forward to). Or you can just roam the city and cause mass destruction to everything around. It is big sandbox and what you can do there is limited only with your imagination.To sum up this is one of the best games in my whole steam library. Definitely recommended.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-18,1,13,685,False,Recommended,I see a lot of negativity surrounding the game and rightfully so lets start with my NEGATIVE take away from GTA V P2W super hard If you're not paying for the shark cards or hacking you're not gonna make money that fast I can understand Micro trans to an extent but i feel like Rockstar is pushing too hard... then again online is free all the new content has been free so i dont have that much of a problem with it. That being said ive been playing for a long time and I dont have any issues with money anymore now that my character is more established... more on that later. Load times I have this game running on a Samsung Evo 960 Pro M.2 Drive. While it fixed a lot of the long load screens i feel like theres too much of it still especially online... Servers are Dog Not much else to say here wether youre on fiber or dialup youre gonna have issues at some point or another... Rockstar your servers suck. lack of Story Mode DLC where you at rockstar? is redead really taking that much time?Now lets go over my positives The game is freaking huge Map is awesome in my opinion. I like the attention to detail the ammount of stuff to do online and in story mode is pretty awesome dispite the somewhat shallow ammount of story mode content. Online is hard as it should be most definatly not a game for the feint of heart rockstar designed this game to be hard and it is. its hard to make money its hard to do heists and its hard to level up. That being said I feel ive gotten more in the 400+ hours in this game for my $60 than i have many many other games subscription based included. Its competative and cut throat and the world events are making that clear. A LOT of people have complained about this but thats what online is about kill kill kill. Money is difficult to make the game doesnt just hand it too you but it does present you with ample oppertunity to make it once you figure things out. Get businesses make money its that simple. If youre a fan of difficulty curve this is the online experience for you. Other people always have more money guns and cars than you. just like real life. Characters are wonderful I grew up in a pretty enviornment as a kid straight out of breaking bad not kidding. so seeing all the wonderful characters and their personalities reminds me of that in a way. I used to step over methheads to get to work in highschool now i get to watch meth head bikers and crazy wannabe gangbangers ( looking at you Lamar) but heads. Really has a nostalgic felling to it.... not sure if thats good or bad.... XD Shooting and Driving are drastically improved from previous titles taking a few pages out of Max Payne the shooting is immaculent given the game style I mean theres gonna be a bit of lag online but thats how it is. The driving is really crisp and reasonably tuned... Especially for GTA. All the cars handle and accelerate significantly differently and the Special vehicles are very well done. Though ill admit the jet bike it free mode is a bit cartoony for my taste but maybe thats just because they keep blowing up my supply runs..... maybe im just a salty piece of who knows. p this game is like 5 ing years old say what you want about GTA V theres issues as there are in every game and i think rockstar could have done a lot better with the online servers but I feel like thats in the works with Red Dead on the way and i think we'll see the effects carry over into GTA and beyond. but for being as old as it is its standing the test of time incredibly well. All in all I'd give the game 4 out of 5 stars tighten up the issues online and dial back the shark card t and you have one hell of a game. If you like Difficulty competative openworld pvp an obsurd story and a variety minigames GTA V is most certainly the game for you. If you're the type of person that likes the game to drop in your lap go play something else as youre going to have a bad time spew nonsensical reviews on steam and ruin everyones day. p.s. the golf is just like mario golf!!! good looking out Rockstar!,Grand Theft Auto V

Ambitions of the city like the star of its inhabitants does not become smaller but in terms of economic instability all think first of all about their own well being and even just survival.In this complex world we teamed up three different people which connects except the desire to survive and trouble with the law. Each of them has its own way of life but one road to the goal. Franklin simple pickpocket with far reaching plans. Michael the man who broke the prison life.

THAT IS NOT THE PROPER EXPERIENCE YOU MUST WAIT!"" and with that I waited...A year later the ""Next Gen"" experience released on the ""Next Gen"" consoles and when I started thinking maybe this is what I should go for the voices came back kicking and yelling and hollering ""NO! DO NOT GIVE IN! YOU MUST BE PATIENT!"". Again I obeyed them...When it was possible to pre purchase said game on steam the voices had calmed down and only one of them was talking..""Now is the time you know what must be done."" ..they were right...I moved my mouse as fast as possible to add the game to my cart and make the purchase. It was over before I could even fully comprehend what came over me. Had I made the right decision to pre purchase? What if it's GTA IV all over again?Launch day at last everything preloaded and ready waiting for the game to unpack. The voices now seemed to be at 200% volume barking away the same two words repeatedly ""IT'S HERE!"".Finally I'm in the game. Everything is running smoothly there are so many options and settings...so many choices. The Frames Per Second were too high oh so too high to be true. I played for hours and hours not encountering any bugs any glitches even after that magnificent day passed I still cannot find any major bugs. It's like they all crawled away and made refugee in EA's next big title.If time travel was made possible. I would go back in time and pre purchase this game all over again and again and again. I would never once regret it. I really do find it funny how the top reviews are all ""Rockstar has shady business practices"" and before that it was ""I got banned for the FOV Mod"".The first one is a misconception and the second is a flat out lie.

Great story fantastic characters and great game play. I love the interaction between the three main characters and the primary support characters like Lester and Lamar. There are some laugh out loud moments and situations sprinkled in sometimes in a point where you'd least expect it.As for the Online if you can get a group of friends together (at least 4 for most missions) the Online is a total blast.

GTA V is probably the biggest PC release for a while and the fact that the servers didn't go down is an achievement far greater the any console could achieve (im not biased to PC I play on XBOX and PS as well). The graphics and outstanding and my cheap PC can run the game and a stable 59.999 fps shows how hard they worked on this game I run ArmA III on 30 fps on medium high and have regular frame drops. The heists so far have been great and i've only experienced a few very comical glitches the pay is great and really helps to fund your online murdering needs.

2017-06-15,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,"So I'll start off with a simple opening. GTA has been the element of ""Subversion"" sinces it consept. Addictive crime filled missions and mayham that was set around various time periods with varying fun and interesting charaters. But games only have so long of a play time and we of the PC world have a way to improve and even lengthen our playtime for games.That way? Mods. For as long as PC gaming has existed talented modders have poured years into modding games to expand their playtime. Everything from simple bug fixes all the way to damn near complete overhauls. Mods have become such a life blood for PC gaming that half the industry supports them. Valve (our overlords) even go out of their way to hire talented modders sometimes.Mods add a range of fun to the games and for a game that boasts its open world ""fun"" to do as you like you'd think they would be all for this. Rockstar even endorsed modding on several cases and yet here we stand in 2017. Rockstars parent company has choosen to blindside the community its game has built by starting with the big guns. Take two (T2) sent a C&amp D to the modding tools ""OpenIV"" which has been apart of our community for years now professionally ensuring mods of all kinds could be enjoyed and expand the playtime of many of the GTA games.One of the major selling points to being a PC game is the mods to the point even Consoles are starting to join in and this has effectively ended that for GTA. Will more tools spring up? Of course. But how many of those tools will go as far as OpenIV went to play by the very rules laid out by T2 and the law. How long until T2 shuts them down too?I'll be honest I wasn't much of a single player in this game. I loved the online play even with all its hack filled trash. The problem is though T2 decided to hit a legit modder not one making hacktools. I can google whose making the hacks right now easily if they're releasing them. But now like the promised single player DLC mods have been met with an axe for many players. So if you're here for the chance to mod the game and enjoy the singleplayer world while ignoring the online play? I have to say move on. Besthesda supports their community much better even with the insanity that is creation kit. Valve supports their community better so many other companies do as well. I'm sad to say it but move on to the greener games this company decided to suddenly pull support after years of endorsing it without warning.",Grand Theft Auto V

All expansions are included with the game (offline and online) for free. Story rich campaign. Diverse player base. Various game modes. Microtransactions are not harmful to the community. It is optional to make purchase for in game currency in exchange for real currency which can also be acquired via playing the game. There is only one in game currency which prevents complications and pay to win.Cons Story mode no longer receives updates. Profanity filters are compulsory in a game rated for mature players.

Yet I barely play it anymore due to my obsession for other games )Since I don't have good imagination to put up a awesome essay for how good the game is I will just make a list a list of pros and cons ) PROS Graphics can still stand up to many newer games. Continually updated with new content since release Extremely fun with friends Great story mode with characters I still remember even tho I don't play SP any moreThere are many more pros I could add to this list but I'm afraid I'll hit the character limit of Steam reviews so with that said I guess I'll have to move on to the cons then CONS Have had plenty of issues with hackers Lacks proper mod support (Even tho there's a tonne of them out now) Can be quite demanding even if you have a good system Has a launch issue that is only fixable via the settings config fileSame goes here. I could add many more cons But who would want to listen to that for hours and ours. It's a fun game and get it! Just don't buy Shark Cards will you?

2015-08-09,0,0,95,False,Recommended,This game is GREAT... when it wants to work. I love how open it is and the online play is fantastic. I only have two issues with it. The first is obviously that it crashes all the time and now that I have installed Windows 10 the damn thing doesn't even want to open anymore so I'll have to figure out why. Before it would crash randomly all the time but there were moments where I could play for hours with no issue so I wasn't really sure what the cause was. The second issue I have is that playing GTA online you WILL find people that mod which isn't even really an issue unless they are modding just to troll which is the underlying proplem. Normal modders online aren't a problem. They make the game fun like spawning money bags for you if you are really hurting for it (and it can be rather entertaining seeing them shoot money bags from a mini gun). The problem modders (is what I call them) are the ones that blow you up even right when you spawn. I had one blow me up while I was in the metro tunnels! I guess I figured I would have been safe down there but that wasn't the case. Anyways overall the game is amazing but banning the good modders and the people that play with the good modders is just flat out wrong. Also Rockstar really needs to get off there and start fixing some of these crash issues. In all honosty I don't know wether to give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down because of the issues. If they fixed them the game would be a huge success in my book. So I guess I'll give them that under the assumption that they may fix it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-27,0,0,553,False,Recommended,After playing 100 hours in the past two weeks i can safely say this game is great and looks wonderful. The PC release of GTA V has it's issues now and then online but singleplayer seems to be perfectly fine. I highly recomend playing through the singleplayer campain at least once before going online i had played through it at least 5 times on console and it was worth it now with the PC version there are mods allthough they are not as impressive as GTA IV mods yet this is only the beginning. Also i must note the game is optimized great as you can see in various other reviews it runs smooth i rarely have problems with my FPS even though i have a mid range PC. I am currently using intel i5 4590 with a AMD 280 3gb and 8gb of kingston Hyper X Ram. The Load times could be improved as a 60gb game would take up alot of space on a cheap SSD so i'm still question buying an SSD just for this and my OS maybe i will maybe i won't.Now back to online about 80% of my game time is probably online i have not finished the singleplayer as of yet on PC but i plan to 100% the game later on. Online is great with the $1 000 000 cash bonus rockstar had given me for preordering the game early i had been able to buy a new apartment fill up half my 10 car garage with customized vehicles and get a decent inventory of weapons. Heist are a great way to make money and rank up as you can replay the 6 heist with freinds. I would belive rockstar will release more heist aa ther is such a high demand hopefully in a DLC later this year.Now to finish of this review if you want a game to play around with mods in singleplayer ONLY hint no one likes online cheaters maybe you should wait for a wider variety of mods or you could get it now mods are really starting to pick up even if you don't mod right now no rush their is still plenty of thing to do while you wait in the the world of Los Santos. If you want a game to play online level up online get this best stuff i'm sure online will keep you busy for a while personlly i say to buy shark cards to get everything allthough i got $1 000 000 online for pre ordering 20$ is a bit to much for $1 250 000 in game and $5 for $250 000 is kinda of waste as that can be easily achieved through a heist or two. Even if you were to get the game just to play online with freinds well i say get it. I have been playing online with freinds for awhile now and by the gods it's fun. Sometimes we have lag issues here and there but that shall be fixed later and for now we can deal with it.Im going to rate this game a 9.8 out of ten because nothing is perfect but this is near perfect with my online issues being some lag online.,Grand Theft Auto V

Also though this is late the fact that Take Two had the audacity to take down open IV back in June was absouletly a red flag for the community...

But I cannot recommend you give Rockstar your money because of their horrible business practices.Rockstar has spoken out about the EULA and have clarified that they are NOT banning for single player modifications. However any modification installed even a singleplayer only one is still detected when going online and they are pretty much banning indiscriminately. Also players have been given two week bans for having money forced on them by modders. That is unacceptable and Rockstar refuses to lift their bans. I'm changing my review to positive but tentatively. If Rockstar doesn't clean up their act soon this will return to a negative review and stay that way.,Grand Theft Auto V

This game is addictive in ways that even World of Warcraft cannot fathom. The joy the pure unadulterated joy of unloading a clip into an unsuspecting player's face and seeing the screen flash white indicating you've ended his life is uncomparable in almost any video game. Hearing the anger through the surprisingly decent in game VOIP from the poor bastard you just decimated just adds to that joy. Everything about this game is perfect. The visuals are stunning. The sounds are on point gunshots are crisp and clear vehicles sound like actual cars / planes / boats and not lawn mowers Moments in the singleplayer game have an eery sounding backdrop that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. At one point during the story I switched to Trevor. Trevor is a psycopathic businessman to put that kindly. Upon switching Trevor woke up. I had no clue where in the world I was but the game made it feel as if it was extremely cold and windy. Looking around I found myself atop a mountain with a few dirt trails leading in different directions. I thought to myself ""damn this guy really got himself in a pinch here."" I had no clue that it was about to get much much worse.Trevor was wearing nothing but hiking boots and a frilly dress with flowers on it. The dress was rather soiled but I'd rather not speculate as to why. I decided to start heading down one of the trails that seemed to lead back towards civilization and stumbled falling face first down the trail. My health depleting I gathered myself at the bottom of my 50 50 facegrind and Trevor dusted himself off. I took a little bit more caution this time going it a bit slower but albeit not losing the little bit of health I had left on the side of a cliff. Two elk (elk? white tail deer? gazelle? I don't know what they are) ran past me in what seemed to be a hurry. I was wondering if maybe I had spooked them when falling but soon realized that it was not me at all that had spooked them. I heard the whine cry growl of the mountain lion before it was upon me. I jumped in my computer chair as the mountain lion leapt. I died.10/10 would play with wildlife again",Grand Theft Auto V

This game is fantasticly well done. Even with my less than ideal GPU I can run the game on ultra settings at 45FPS as the game is so well optimized that my CPU and RAM can pick up any of the slack.It is beautiful the story is exceptional thus far the characters feel real and their emotions and tibulations carry over to your own state of mind and the weapons enemies buildings planes trains and automobiles are so very well designed and balanced. Every weapon is viable in the field and the first person modes available make this game feel not only like an RPG but an FPS as well with elements of racing an track games.To put it bluntly Rockstar has released one of the most balanced and well thought out and executed games of all time. Add the fact that it is balanced and feels like you're actually in that reality at some points and you've got yourself a classic people will still be referencing in 10 20 even 30 years. Grandparents will be telling their grandchildren how they slew a horde of psychadelic aliens with a minigun in a city park. That alone makes this worth the expense and time.

Now with the new Gun Gunning DLC Take Two has decided to declare single player mods ""illegal"" yet online modding still exists.

2017-04-02,0,0,139,False,Recommended,This game has such great potential and such a great world. If the developers would just put a little more effort into fixing bugs and reducing loading time this would be one of the greatest games. The loading times especially and the game constantly reloading bugging or suddenly closing is absolutely horrible and ruins the whole game experience. I've tried several important heists with sudden bugs or close of the game. In ing HEISTS? Like heists are supposed to have been tested several times how can you NOT have fixed bugs yet? It seems like you have 2 3 developers in the company who needs to do everything because you never get anything fixed. It's actually oblivious.Man I love this game but it can just destroy so much in GTA Online when the game crashes. Please man focus more on this.,Grand Theft Auto V

If there were no mods I would have stopped playing a long time ago. As Nerd3 said in his video ""Take Two have this massive throbbing erection for microtransactions."" Which has completly ruined GTA Online. Which could have been so much more than it is (See FiveM for example.) But the greed of Take Two didn't let that happen. GTA is honetly one of my favourite games ever but I am slowly losing respect for Rockstar as they turned a masterpiece of a game into a microtransaction laiden cesspit from hell. GTA Online plays more like a Free to Play. Since GTA V has been released in 2013 (Xbox 360 and PS3) 2014 (Xbox One and PS4) and 2015 (PC) the only reason why a lot of people picked up the PC version is to mod it. I know I did. Another thing thats annoying about this is the fact that the victim of this OpenIV which not only has it been around for 10 years but it also has absolutly NOTHING I repeat NOTHING to do with Online. Which is filled with modders everywhere. And it's not just me. Check out the current reviews on Steam. All negitive. Paid mods were bad enough but taking them away all together? IMO its worse.I know this review may have seemed a bit like a rant and thats because it was. We cannot let Take Two and Rockstar to get away with this. If you aree thinking of buying this game. Don't. Pirate it and mod the crap out of it. Online isn't worth it. Thank you for reading and leave a negitive review explaing your feelings.

2017-06-15,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,After a few hundred hours in the console version i just bought this on PC so i could finally play GTA V with mods. Now i just read you took down OpenIV the program essential to modding and essentially made modding forbidden. Screw you i just want to play some fun modded GTA V at the end of the day when im tired as hell. What i don't want to do is grind for hours to play with the fun content that is now also restricted from the single player and only available in the terrible grindy microtransaction filled multiplayer. I can't mod in the multiplayer stuff into the singleplayer anymore and this right after a new bunch of vehicles got released in multiplayer.Let me make a list of all the things i cant to anymore now that mods are forbidden. Play with multiplayer vehicles without grinding for hours upon hours which is time spent on the multiplayer content i DONT enjoy playing. Play with a decent first person FOV remove noise and chromattic abbaration two effects i think are really really ugly and only can be removed through modding Become a police officer Become The Hulk Rico Rodriguez or any other fun modded character Shoot cars out of my gun Have a gravity gun Spawn in vehicles guns and object to play around with in the great sandbox world Turn my character into any NPC in the game Play with brand new cars made by the community Make it snow just like the christmas event without having to play this game when i want to be with my family Make the game look better through graphics mods Make cars jump Remove all water for east exploration of the big ocean floor of Los Santos Make it so animals can't call the police (i am sirious they ed that up) Give my character telekenetic powers CARMAGEDDON Create a tsunami/flooding Give the vehicles more realistic/simulator like handling and much much moreScrew you Take Two.,Grand Theft Auto V

You ban single player modding to try to push players who want more content to multiplayer because you refuse to make single player content/ DLC preferring to instead make the multiplayer even more of a grindfest so people buy your Shark Cards just so they can have an excessively overpriced virtual car. Your business practices are at best completely unforgivable and at worst actively attempting to harm the players and push away those that are ""only"" willing to pay full price for the game.

After the update EVERYONE has flying bikes with missiles ruining your fun.The online has become horribly bloated with heavily armed vehicles. Take Two could ban all the modders now and it wouldn't change a thing. New/poor/lone players don't stand a chance in the online community with veteran/rich/grouped players running rampant with APCs and heavy snipers with exploding rounds. Selling product and cars successfully have become a distant memory requiring convoys consisting of the same vehicles you're defending against. Offensive players who used to be a nuisance have become a nightmare now that they have fast moving heavily armored SAM spamming vehicles. If someone decides to focus you have fun dying repeatedly as you try to navigate the menus and find a new session before dying again.The game is no longer fun.

It just so happens that people who I play with do not necessarily agree with me at that particular moment.As far as the game goes apart from the stunning graphics (which I am not fully aware of considering my crap laptop) the small details are what makes it even more fun. Be it the animals (SP only) or the chair lift on top of that mountain. Oh boy. This review probably becomes redundant considering how old this game is but yeah good to know is it not?Edit They ban you for reporting hackers and actually reset your hard earned cash to 0 regardless of whether or not you purchased shark cards or not so beware!

2017-06-25,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,The game is great once you get a lobby where you are happy which is rare. I write this because I just got blown up as i flew a Buzzard chopper and then had my game crashed by a random modder after i got spawn killed by a guy in a tank that was invincible.In short its a good game its adictive but its very much broken. then cash i mean you buy the game you get 10k and a pistol whilst all the others have modded money into billions in some cases plus you die 5 times faster then level 100. the odd are against you. buy it on console not pc unless you have a lot of friend and you know who is gonna be in the lobby which I dont like because then its boring if you cant kill eachother sometimes. If i was new and buying for online i advise against it if you are alone you will need a mod menu to play the game as modder are everywhere you will need a defence against modder sticking things to you taking your guns blowing everyone up and blaming you and you can identify the modder and kick them before the do it to you.But yea best off with console but be happy grinding as money is tight in this game. 7k for a pip wrench for example lol. 1 time i filled a plane with 4 million worth of crates i defended as my bro flew. the game kicked him and my 4 mill crashed to the ground. it takes a solid effort to fill a warehouse but in delivering if players dont screw you generally the game has bugs that will destroy things for you also.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's impossible to make money online unless you dedicate days of grinding on BS minigames online. Heists take longer to make money and are ridiculously tedious and the most effective way to make money in the game other than cheating is by spending at least a couple million in one of the online businesses.

2017-06-27,1,2,752,False,Recommended,"I've been playing Grand Theft Auto V for nearly 4 years now. Originally on Xbox 360 upgraded to Xbox One then finally upgraded to PC when it was released. The 484 hours I have currently are just a fraction of the time I've put into the game between both single player and multiplayer.GTAV has been one of the most interactive and compelling games I've played ever. Free content drops on a fairly regular basis keep the game alive and keep me and my friends coming back. The single player experience was fantastic but wasn't without it's faults. The 3 character story was interesting but I feel like it forced the story to be split up too much. I did come to enjoy Trevor Michael and Franklin as characters but I never felt as connected to them as I did with Tommy Vercetti CJ and definitely not as much as Niko Bellic. I do REALLY wish there was single player DLC but It doesn't bother me too much.GTA Online is fantastic. You may get the occasional hacker or two that can ruin the experience but you can always just find a new session. Over the years R* has released huge updates adding new missions adding to the ""story"" of Online. New cars new guns and new ways to play make this one of consistently fresh games I've been able to experience. I don't feel like the game is meant for super casual players though. The people who complain about shark cards existing and feel like they don't have enough money for anything either don't play enough or they want too much and aren't willing to actually play for it.My one real advice for people to have the most fun is to give yourself a goal in Online. It's easy to make money but you need to decide on what you want. The game is fun enough just messing around with friends but I feel like aiming for a certain apartment or car betters the experience. You can always play one of the hundreds of gamemodes that R* has created OR you can play any of the game modes community members have made and posted onto Social Club.The game has gotten a whole lot of flack because of Take Two's actions but it really speaks for itself. While I do think it's still worth $60 because of all the content added over the years you might now so I'd suggest waiting for sales.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-24,0,0,251,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 Well.. First of all it's a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles it's definatley worth the purchase If you have a couple of friends too this game becomes too fun! I have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. So yes I highly recommend this game!So the downsides to GTA V on the PC that I have found so far. Unexpected Game crashes Yes I have the latest drivers. Random FPS drops.. That could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1 3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. Final bad point that I can think of the servers even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. The same for AI Traffic too!Overall I rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

Grand Theft Auto V is one of the only games i can buy 3 times and still have fun both online and offline (story). In The Story Mode you can play from three unique intresting characters. Franklin Trevor and Michele. In online mode you can jump on and play with your freinds from going around killing people in the open world to doing 1 million doller heist.

2015-08-13,2,2,199,False,Recommended,This game is probably my favorite game of all time. After buying it for the 360 I bought it again for PC.First this game looks amazing. I've yet to see any textures that look out of place or too blurry in my 135 hours of play time. Plus the world is absolutely huge so theres always something new to see. There are tons of hidden easter eggs put in by the developers to find especially in the ocean.Second the single player/campaign is really fun. All the missions are very entertaining and enjoyable. The diolague for the characters is absolutely genius especially Trevor's witty remarks. Since the world is so big the only way to run out of things to do is if you actually try to complete every single one of them. In single player you may randomly run in to a character who will send you on a mission not related to the main storyline. These are very fun too and keep you from finishing the game's main story too fast. Third online can be fun but I prefer the single player. Everything on online is far more expensive than anything in the single player game. This means you need to do a lot of missions or the heists to be able to afford you. If you don't want to do that you can purchase in game cash with real money. Although the heists don't have much of a story to them they can be especially fun playing through one for a few hours with your friends. My favorite part of online is probably the community made maps. Theres plenty of insane races with loops deathmatches on sky platforms and unique player made games. If you can afford this game buy it. I didn't particularly like a few of the other games in the series but this is by far is the best one. Although mods are just starting be created a few months from now I can imagine there will be plenty of high quality ones.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,1245,False,Not Recommended,"So In light of the recent crap thats went on in regards with OpenIV Take 2/ R* have really lost my respect as of right now and a reason only now as to why I'm writing a review after nearly 900 hours on PC.First off OpenIV was made for singleplayer modding in mind and was not meant for use in Online. So before you even remotely say its going to stop Script kiddies in Online don't bother even replying that it will. The mod menus like Menyoo and Force Mod are still around causing havoc because I /STILL/ see them after the Gunrunning update dropping dirty money. Its a scumbag move on their part and R*'s damage control statment is not enough of a good reason.My overall review however of the game besides modding is as this however.Single Player I have played this on both 360 and PC and the story is pretty good for to keep you playing at the start but once you get into it it becomes pretty generic Old fart who done bad stuff wondering what to do while dealing with a pretty crazy family. A gangbanger who wants to be different and gets along with old fart to pull off a heist in a jewelery store to pay off some russian drug guy and a crazy motherf***er who is pretty much every GTA player gets wiff of his old fart friend and finds him and the 3 team up and you get the rest at this point because spoilers n stuff.The real fun is the world itself and the many little details that R* have put into this fantastic game without it being modded to begin with the cars for instance shoot the gas tank and it leaks fuel until it runs out and the car is done. Peds comment if you drive past in a fancy car cops drag eachother to safety when they are downed and there is wildlife that either kill you or avoid you as well as the many side activitys present in the game. Compared to GTA4 however there are some dumbed down things Paramedics don't revive anyone who was killed. The car handling is too goddamm grippy and the roll over thing is stupid. Oh and if you get rammed by cops your steering automatically jerks to the side even if they didn't bother pitting you which is lazy. There are many more but these are some examples.I rate this a 8/10 since you HAVE to play it for the single player because they did an amazing job at it at least.Online NOW the more worser experience with GTAV is its multiplayer and I've been playing GTA O since November 2013 and it has pretty much gone down hill in its quality. For one this game is NOT a F2P. You have to own GTAV before you can even access it and it is not a MMO since it does NOT use servers(Except for Cloud save data thats it) they cheaped out and used P2P meaning you will see laggy players cheesing headshots from a .50 cal from time to time and it has very annoying load times where you'll get stuck in the ""clouds"" often(I would have rathered a goddamm loading screen at least instead of the annoying skycam).GTA O is more dumbed down from Single player and has less world details such as the gas tank leak as I mentioned earlier oh and no animals. Besides that the main problems with GTA O stems from its playerbase microtransactions and freemode itself.These problems are due to the following K/D ratio counting in freeroam instead of the PVP jobs like it is supposed to meaning players out to kill have a reason to do it to an exessive extent at some points. Weapons are unbalanced and every freemode battle is revolved around long range sniping RPG's and general spam of explosives that insta kill within a certian radius compared to GTA4 where you could survive in some cases but with little health depending on where the splash damage hit. Certian activities and jobs are really underplayed now and they are never really endorsed and have very very VERY low pay out for its worth. An example of this is parachute jobs which are fun but pay absolute crap.The recent updates STINK of moblie game like waiting times for your freeroam businesses. Why I say this? After you collect Cargo/Car/Supplies you have a wait timer. Sold your stuff? Gotta wait another while before you can sell again. On top of that it resorts to ""go here shoot people steal this"" every goddamm resupply which only makes it more boring as you play them.On the topic of freeroam businesses they are pretty much moneysinks and take a long while to get money back off them once you invest in them. And it doesn't help when the game automatically shows you on radar when you do a sell or resupply. Because that draws in every annoying person to just blast your into next century with an unbalanced jet with cannons or again cheap out by using explosives and that makes the taking the risk more irritating than a fair chase that makes that risk more rewarding.Shark cards are badly priced for its worth since the ""free"" extras have inflated prices the most expensive Shark Card will get you a glorified boat appartment that gives you one crappy freeroam mission and thats $8 000 000 GTA Dollars the ""free"" content is a grindfest to get to if you are a completely new player who doesn't know what they're doing + at this point they aren't even hiding the fact that they are shoving them in peoples faces with ingame advertisements and special one time offers to selected player to entice you to buy them. (Please don't for the love of god it is not worth your time wasting money on them.)The Playerbase is often a toxic mess at times where its practically shoot everything going on even when there are people having a meet up for a car meet for instance at any point there is always one person/group who just want to start trouble and ruin others fun. Passive mode does nothing to prevent this really and is often abused by those same people. And for nearly 4 years there has been no map expansion to freshen the experience and barely any game changers relating to Online's ""Story"".Oh and uh patching harmless glitches when they said they wouldn't. (RIP Cop Outfit glitch because no fun allowed. &lt )To be honest I would not recommend playing Online in its current state its a solid 3/10 from me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Now with the stand they are taking to open 4 which is the backbone of most mods there is ZERO reason to pick this up. It is an obvious attack on single player so you have to go to GTA online for any new and interesting content which is riddled with microtransactions. This stand shows the greed of take two interactive (which controls rockstar and 2k) and I will be damned if I come back for any of their games if they insist on the blatant monney grabbing attitude of this C&amp D on pretty much the whole modding community. You would think that the 4th best selling game in history would make them more than enough but apparently they are out of ideas since they have to attack what they see as a competitor for dlc.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-12,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,"Play a Saint's Row game instead. Sadly Rockstar seems to be forgetting what makes games like GTA fun. Each version they seem to want to make it harder and harder to go around and cause havoc and instead focus on more irrelevant crap and putting more things in the game to interrupt your fun. For example in GTA 5 your characters are usually too stupid to put on their seatbelts. So if you get in an accident which you will since driving like a maniac is half the fun you often go flying through the windshield and die instantly. Likewise the police have been way beefed up and are widely regarded to be an ""anti fun patrol"" to the point one of the top mods is to nerf them.So save yourself the money and get one of the many Saint's Row titles instead. They understand that the proper application of a sandbox game is to let the player run around and cause havoc to their heart's content.It's sad since tehcnially GTA 5 is great. It runs well looks beautiful and has good voice acting. However it just isn't near as much fun as other games of its type.

I mean the game is great the story is rich and interesting but the online is a deep deadly and un fair whole of micro transactions and the only way to enjoy the game after the story is on the single player with mods. Letting you be some from freaking Iron Man to role play as a cop or add the vechicle's they put in to multiplayer knowing they'd have more people pouring money into it to get the stuff. Because to get ANYTHING in GTA Online is either 1. A massive grind which only leads to more grinding or 2. just a pit of shark cards haha. I'm not saying the Online is completely crap with some mates on the small game modes or even doing the missions as an MC or heists Super fun but no mission gives you enough money to do anything. I just think removing the mod the single mod that lets the communtiy enjoy gta the way they want is just bad its simply because they want more money. I dunno it's just annoying and will probably stop me playing as much so yeah I don't recommend this Unless they change there decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

I bought GTA V on PC for the modding Community. i saw in GTA IV how fun the mods were and how amazing they seemed and hoped that in this new Gen it'd be better. Take Two's greed has now been known. Being forced to play a broken online that's only fun when you use MicroTransactions and modes that equally suck. I will not support TakeTwo or Rockstar ever again. In fact I encourge those to stand up and protest against this form of tyranny. Let's fight woth our wallets an never again support these fatcats who hold no regard for us gamers.

Mods expand the scope of the game infinitely limited only by the imaginations of the mod community. Take Two just eliminated that option from GTA V this week.

Why PC over other consoles?Because what made this game great was the modding community.I remember at launch mods were still allowed online with a simple file swap everyone was using trainers and no one in any lobby ever died because they were all immortal. The reason I have so many hours on this game is not because I enjoyed grinding out heists and/or buying shark cards so that I could have a baller car It was because when we were broke we'd spawn more cash. When our car got scuffed we'd fix it with one button. When we were behind in a bike race we'd hold NUMPAD_9 and zoom off into the sunset.Once they took mods away from online I took a ban (or two) and moved to the other fun modding adventures.GTA RP was really fun and absorbed quite a few hours of my time.LSPDFR showed a lot of promise and I followed that mod from square one until a few months back.Single player was also a ton of fun with all sorts of sandbox type adventures to be had.Then they do this.They discontinue support for OpenIV and deem it illegal.This not only ruins the chances that future PC gamers have to enjoy the sandbox that GTAV was but it also means that OpenIV needs to shut the doors on their whole operation.This is a great game and hell it might even be fun without mods but if we let Take Two get away with this it hurts other games too.Do the right thing.Vote on the petition here.https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv,Grand Theft Auto V

The game has degenerated from a fun free roaming experience where you can off with stuff you find (from previous titles) to money laundering cash grinding . Atleast the story was somewhat fun but seeing as that has to be done over if you ever move the installation folder or decide to uninstall reinstall there is no point in doing that either. The whole game is money grinding and playing the same ing introduction mission a billion times. By far the worst GTA game I have ever played controlled by a company that somehow manages to be worse than Emother ingA. And the worst part is.

So I decided to compile a list of all of the completely reasonable things that you have to do to not get banned from online that you totally have to do in pretty much every other game that has multiplayer. This list was taken from my post asking for help from /r/GTAV.1. Don't have Discord open.2. Avoid any graphics card overlays (IE. AMD gaming evolved or geforce experience)3. Don't mod your singleplayer. (even your UI)4. Don't mod your multiplayer. (even your UI)5. If there is a person on a multiplayer server who might be cheating leave that server.6. Get goat blood.7. Get virgin soul.8. Get chicken.9. Climb to the top of Mt. Everest until you lose consciousness due to lack of oxygen.10. Speak to the mountain spirits while you are close to death.11. If they deem you worthy they will resurrect you.12. They will also tell you to draw a pentagram with the goat blood and to spill the guts of the chicken out into the center.13. Flay your own wrist open and allow your blood to quench the chicken guts.14. Release the virgin soul from your unholy vessel of choice.15. Now you have a chance of not getting banned if you can make it back down the mountain.Totally reasonable no idea why everyone is complaining.Edit I left a negative review on GTA V before it was cool.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-28,0,0,174,False,Recommended,The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below) but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths. In doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gaming s towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-22,0,0,446,False,Recommended,The pinnacle of the series. GTA V is a solid game in every respect. Seamlessly ported from console on to PC (1.5 Years later) it provides the player with an extension of the GTA franchise' unique gameplay. This title in particular is potentially the GTA series at its finest. The game has at least 70 hours playability in the Single Player campaign not to mention the countless more to be found in its MP mode. One unique feature in GTA V is the ability to control 3 main characters (one at a time) and play through an interweaving storyline... This is both unique to the series and I haven't seen it in too many other titles.The vehicle mechanics have since improved from the disastrous feel of GTA IV's cars. First person driving has since been added. The quality of the dash graphically varies from car to car I have found. No doubt this will be fixed in future patches.Flight plays a bigger role in this game which is also a redeeming feature for those who were fond of its prevalence in San Andreas. The game also introduced Heists where players can target particular buildings and choose from a number of options of attack when conducting heists in the main story line. Property is of course back and each character is able to purchase properties unique to them. I found great humour in being able to purchase a medicinal marijuana dispensary. Also stock trading has made an appearance via the characters mobile phone. The markets change throughout the story dependant on what events have occured. You can also trade within a global network with other GTA V players. The Engine of GTA V is Rockstars greatest to date. Never before have you been able to interact with the world in such a way as GTA V. GTA V has more complexities than if you were to merge the last few games in this regard. The architecture and level design is second to none. It is probably the most dynamic engine Rockstar have created in terms of character design and acting processes as well. The cutscenes are done beautifully throughout the game with humour as a constant companion to dialogue. The game is quite deep and it can at times be slow moving disengaging the player and making them want to alt tab and play something else in between. Besides this it is the greatest GTA V to have come yet!I highly recommend a play.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,188,False,Not Recommended,Given that the Grand Theft auto series is my namesake my recommendation of the game should be a surprise. Let me explain I was on strike 2 of 3 for modding online which is fair enough the game had little content at the time and I had done everything there was to do so I was a little bored of GTA V at the time but after that 2nd ban I come completely clean given that the game had a lot more new things to do and I enjoyed the game as is once more.Suddenly I discovered that shader mods were a thing and I decided to try one out being careful to not even begin loading Online while having this shader mod installed. I decided that it was hindering my performance too much so I got rid of the mod and decided to completely reinstall GTA V and proceed to play Online. I was met with a screen that informed me that I was permanently banned from playing Online. Because of a SHADER MOD. ON SINGLE PLAYER.And now reading more recent reviews it seems Rockstar and Take Two have banned modding in the game as a whole. Including single player. I simply cannot recommend a game that doesn't even allow modding single player.I'm no longer going to support Rockstar or Take Two. This is an astronimical let down for me.Go ahead and tell me I deserve my ban considering I modded in Online before but that still doesn't excuse Rockstar and Take Two's decision to put an end to all modding.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,1,2,1448,False,Not Recommended,Up until about 2 weeks ago I would have had positive things to say for GTA. The SP campaign is fun there's cool easter eggs and despite godawful loading times a terrible p2p design and hackers galore due to a fairly shoddy anti cheat (zeroing your bank accounts and seizing all your ammunition) Online was still a pretty fun way to spend an evening with your buds.However in light of this OpenIV debacle which struck me as a poorly thought out attempt to fix the hacker issue and the massive banwave on the 25th which resulted in a lot of unmerited bans suspensions and account resets (myself included in the latter despite having never modded my install and having bought over 16M in shark cards) it is painfully obvious that the team behind this game has management that would make Pierre Beaudoin look good in comparison. TL DR buy the game for it's singleplayer if anything you can sink countless hours into it and still find new stuff. Online mode is an absolute trainwreck and it now appears that Rockstar will ban you for landing in the same lobby as an active hacker as such definitely make sure you don't pay full retail if you do buy it for multiplayer and be ready to get destroyed by teleporting and aimbotting godmode hackers...,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-27,0,0,124,False,Not Recommended,I loved playing this game on the Xbox but always wanted to play it on the PC so I can play with mods and make the game just a bit more fun.I'm not big on playing games online (A bit old school I guess). But when I did play online for a total of 10 hours I gave up because there is no place for broke people like myself that just want to have fun playing a game but don't have cash to waist on digital currency. So after 10 hours of online play I have the following opinions 1) The amount of money you earn online is so little that it is a pointless waist of your time to play legitimately. Buying in game cash is not an option for me and will never happen so this breaks the game for me.2) During my time online I was unnecessarily targeted over and over and over again for the amusement of a bully again breaking the game for me. This happened nearly every time I chose to participate online so I found myself playing most of the time in passive mode making the whole online thing a nullified and useless endeavor.3) The only reason I chose to play online was so I could play with the content that is ONLY available when playing online. Which is not achievable unless you buy the in game currency because everything online is 2 4x the price of the exact same thing in single player mode which being as I can t afford that will never happen. So again useless.4) And for the final nail in the coffin. When I am playing the single player mode I like to mod so I can enjoy the entire game when I do actually choose to play. Since RockStar has banned the use of these modding tools it has broken the game and will no longer let me play while I have modified files in the game folder the entire reason for me even getting this game on my PC has been destroyed.No more fun for those of us that could care less for the unfair online gameplay.Over all I think my biggest disappointment has to be that I will never be able to play with any of the awesome online content because I can t afford to play ball with RockStar and I really don t like playing with people because they ruin everything.So big waste of time and money but at least I get better graphics so that s a plus I guess.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't think Rockstar isn't ok with this though because they've been banning single player modders and people who HAD to mod the game in order to run it on their PC's since launch the OpenIV cease and desist was probably welcomed in the R* offices.Don't support this t don't buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-06,0,0,277,False,Recommended,Review update 5/16/15The game has changed and Rockstar Games has cleared up confusion on mods on GTA V pc i assure you SP mods work fine and will NOT get you banned however ANY mods in multiplayer will get you banned from the game(i still think this is bad but i can see where they are coming from) anyways i have been a big gta fan since early 2003 and cannot fathom anymore at how great the series is i have played all including gta 5 on XB360 XB1 and now at glorious 60FPS 1080p on my pc i will recommend this game to anybody looking for a sick game to do fun things in and very fun to play with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-01-03,0,0,186,False,Recommended,GTA V My Experrience So first off all i need to say that's the best OPEN WORLD game that i played and if you gonna read this review probably you'll buy this game too ! So let's begin with the MOST FREQUENTLY questions from people who want to buy this game ! DOES IT WORK ON MY PC !? You can see the minimun requirements here www.systemrequirementslab.com but belive me if you have a low medium PC it will work because New updates and patches almost every day and that's why GTA ( Online ) is never boring ! This game is the most optimized game that i've ever seen so you don't need to worry about your PC specifications ! Summary You don't need to have a good PC to play this game because it's optimized and Updates/Patches almost every day ! IT IS BORING AFTER I PLAY MORE THAN 100 HOURS !? Even if i didn't play that much ( 100 hours ) i'm always find a way to JUST PLAY IT . This game is never boring you have so much to do in it like Heists Steal money / cars / planes and it's necessary to be 2 or 4 online players . Missions Something like heists but more shortly . Races Race with cars planes boats ( etc .. ) and it can be played even with 30 players . Deathmatch Need to kill everyone from a MAP ( Something like Team Deathmatch ) . There are the most importants game modes in the GTA ( Online ) but there are others custom game modes more funny like Cops vs Robbers . Truck ramp jumping race . Zombies mode . ( here www.gta5 mods.com ) This game modes are much more than that and are downloadable here www.gta5 mods.com ! Summary You'll not be bored even after 100 hours of gameplay and you have so much things to play ! ) IT IS FUNNY IF I PLAY ALONE !? I guess i played this game 10/20 hours alone and it can't be more great . You can find FAST JOBS from your phone ( On GTA Online ) and play Races Heists Missons ( etc .. ) and you won't regret it ! Also if you are bored off missions and just want to relex you just can put some music and drive something it's really relaxing especially if you have a steering wheel and First Person activated .Summary If you don't have friends who play this game ( GTA Online ) it's not a problem because it's funny even if you are alone but belive me you can make new friends on GTA i already did three ! DOES IT WORTH !? I don't know when you watch this review but in the period of 25 december 4 january this game is 36$ ! But anyway even if it's 60$ it's worth ! This game is the best game ever from Rockstar and when i have free time i'm just playing it with some friends and relax ! THE BIG SUMMARY This game doesn't have big requirements so you can play it easy with a low medium PC ! This game is not boring with every new patch and challanges almost every day ! This game is not boring if you don't have friends who have it so you can play it alone ! This game is the most optimized game ever from Rockstar so it's worth all the money ! This game is the best . Just buy it already ! ),Grand Theft Auto V

I warn you ahead of time most of this review is based upon my own experience and should not be taken into by your view under any comments stating to and I do quote many steam users ""git gooder"" like the 12 year old you may or may not be. I have 274.5 hours on record and I love GTA V. However I must do the right thing by making my voice heard. If you are a YouTuber don't do modding videos where you showcase mods and joke about GTA V and Rockstar Games North or San Diego. I was in single player and for no reason had recieved a pop up under my Rockstar Games Social Club Panel after pressing my Home key I had been perma banned. Mind you I don't even use mods. I did once and had done a fresh install. Yet all this ban hammer t came about from a joke I had made and I will now quote my joke from a video of which I have already taken down. ""I am starting to think that Rockstar is biased towards any and all Americans."" Now surely if you weren't born yesterday or haven't played GTA ever you might believe this statement however you might also believe that guns kill people and spoons make people fat. Grand Theft Auto Five is a good time waster but no one truly needs to know how long someones stared at pixelated That's just too much information of what thirteen year olds do. I haven't launched GTA Online in a good while only for the reason everytime I do I get banned within a matter of hours. None of that started until after my brief statemental joke towards Rockstar. I know the GTA Franchise is supposed to make America and it's protagonists look like psychotic s who would shag a corpse of a hooker after killing half the police department with a knife because we farted the wrong way within twenty centimeters of a fire hydrant after dropping a cheap beer in front of a store. Or on the complete opposite end of the spectrum of which is coherent stupid as Anyone who is twelve with access to an adults credit card or cash knows this. It isn't hard to comprehend. The bottom line is that I must veto this . DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL IF YOU VALUE YOUR MONEY! I have put WELL OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS (USD) INTO ROCKSTAR AND THIS IS WHAT I GET AFTER SUPPORT?! A YOU AND UH HAVE A NICE DAY!? Under what grounds must I be banned? Over a joke. Sketch Scale 20/10. Would not play again.",Grand Theft Auto V

They pretty much combined the story with mp and it is amazing.If you have other friends that have GTA V you can be sure that you will have a very good time playing this game because the missions are good the heist amazing th physics are the best and of course all the challanges that can be done around the world of Los Santos and Blaine County.Altho if you don't have much freetime I don't recommend getting this game cause once you enter it the time is just gonna fly you won't even observe.

If you have friends bring them along too the fun just gets that much better the more creative you and your friends are.single player is a completely different experience than multiplayer and I recommend newcomers to GTA put some hours into single player to get familiar with this virtual world prior to exposure with the crazy in GTA online.GTA online is best played with friends.

Everything in the game is ridiculously expensive (i.e. A haircut costs about $200) Rockstar still treating PC gamers like second class citizen (Still waiting for Red Dead Redemption).The game in general is really fun especially when playing with friends (on a private server on which you're still not safe from server time out and random disconnects) but after what Rockstar tried to pull this past summer sale I'd say pick the game up when it's at least below $15.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-21,0,0,185,False,Not Recommended,What I talk about after this paragraph has happened a while ago since then Rockstar and Take Two have retracted their decision and Open IV still lives. I personally would say that the game is definitely worth it even without the mods that are offered by Open IV but removing them is a low blow and this is why I can't push myself to recommend this game because this decision might come back later to haunt the player in the GTA V universe. Lucky for us that day is not today.Open IV was a popular tool that a lot of modders used to make their mods for GTA V. Note that the developer of Open IV himself had to confirm that the mod/tweak DOESN'T allow you to CHEAT online. If the game was modded GTA ONLINE simply WOULDN'T LAUNCH.Both Take Two and Rockstar used cheaters as an excuse for taking down this tool because it is bad for their shark card business. If you have a game that is modded to why would you play online? You have fun in single player so you won't get into the grindfest that is GTA online. Take Two and Rockstar know that and they have excuse to ban the tool.TotalBiscuit made a great video talking about this and even comparing the decision to Bethesda's creator club.https //youtu.be/8hLmM6pK0wg?t 28m33s,Grand Theft Auto V

They just want people to get out of the singleplayerand into the online where you can microtransaction yourself bankrupt.

2017-06-22,0,0,633,False,Not Recommended,It's great to know that a company values money over the satisfaction of their customers (sarcasm). It was a blast to play through the singleplayer mode bacause it offered a cool storyline. What made singleplayer even better was the ability to add mods to the game that basically just continued the game past its storymode whether it be adding cool new cars that the COMMUNITY has taken the time to make or even just messing around with a menu that can change the gravity change the playermodel and do many other things. Recently I have been playing online with my friends and I am just amazed at how each update added to multiplayer includes cars or property that is well over 2 million in game dollars. When you complete all of the heists you can get up to around 3 million as long as it's your first time. That sounds like a lot of cash until you see the reveal of a new update that introduces trucks with guns and supercars that are priced at over 2 mil. Or you could spend your money on some of the new ways to make money through dlc such as exporting cars or gunrunning. Through many weeks of grinding to make money you can finally purchase just one of the things that allow you to purchase something along the lines of a rocket bike. You could easily feel proud of your progress or you could also come to the realization that all of those weeks of grinding gave you absolutely no entertainment but rather just stress. What many people have already done inside of Grand Theft Auto V is cheat in cash online just so they can keep up with the numerous updates. It was understandable that Rockstar has tried their best to remove modders and hackers in ONLINE mode but removing mods in singleplayer? That's just taking it too far. What I have come to realize about this game is that it is fun only if you have money. Call me poor but Rockstar seriously needs to come out with a update that improves the game itself by adding abilities and usefulness of the iFruit phone apps that is of no cost to the player for example the kicking and melee feature in the biker update. We need more updates and less DLC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-30,0,0,326,False,Recommended,The legend of Grand Theft Auto V. Where do I begin?let's start with the storyline I won't spoil anything but it is great. Especially if you have some fun with various PC mods. It doesn't have that endless grind feel that other games have either. It is very well thought out and it is easy to tell that a lot of time effort and money went into this game. Graphics Very good if your PC can handle the stress. The amount of customization is amazing as well allowing less than legendary computers attempt to tackle the game.The M Rating Despite what many would tell you you can play the game without getting too deep into the graphic content. If you only play in online mode you will occasionally have the choice to participate in the form of the strip clubs but it is completely unecessary. There is a lot of killing however. Most of the online mode revolves around hunting down other players and other game modes. I first got this game about 2 years ago on the Xbox 360 when I was 11 and I only wanted it because of the car customization. If that is all you want to do there will be extremely rare graphic content. Overall I would definitely recommend this game. The graphics storyline and overall feel just can't be beat by other similar games.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-28,2,2,339,False,Recommended,Single player One of the best storytelling games that a Grand Theft Auto has done. With multiple main characters Rockstar have managed to tell individual characters stories whilst having the main plot which links them all together. It has a long story mode which is good because it means that there are a lot of gameplay hours to be played. However it can be said that a reasonable amount is filler moments. This is due to driving from point A to B especially if you don't have a fast car and enemies that keep spawning in only for you to easily shoot them as they basically run into your line of fire. There are so many side activities which can be played such as tennis golf races movies robbing trucks and even investing in a stock market. These activities are lots of fun to play and it adds to the overall experience of the game in a positive way. If you take the time to fully explore the world of Los Santos then it can be found to be very atmospheric. The cover system has been redone and it plays a big part in the combat mechanics of the game which is a nice addition.Multi player It is great fun to play with friends. The new addition of heists mode is a great way to add to the game and when a heist is completed there is a good level of satisfaction upon completing it. The free roam is great fun as you can cause a lot of chaos There is a huge range of customizable options for your character as well as the vehicles that you own.OverallBoth the single player and multi player experiences are great fun for their own reasons and if you get bored of one you can always flip over to the other as they are both awesome!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,37,False,Recommended,this game eats system ram for breakfast i recommend 16gb for this game.(had an issue with stuttering and it turned out to be my 8gb DDR4 others with same specs as I with 16gb have no issues the game uses around 8 10gb at very high settings) But thats not a big deal really because most games dont use resources as well as this game does. It has got to be the most amazing pc port....... neh pc game ever optimized. yeah you heard me PC GAME. the scaling and smoothness was worth the delay and def huge leaps in looks from its console counterparts. I can not even beleive im saying this but Rockstar nailed it. Regardless the story is fun and endulging and exciting theres LOADS and i do mean loads of graphics settings to cator to your systems needs. The graphics scaling and resource handling is out of this world!!....This is literally the most my PC's hardware has ever been used! and efficiently and responsibly as well. The games detail is just out of this world! Walking around the city every nook and crany is filled with random detail and the roads are just spectacular makes the city seem so real how used the roads are and thats just a small part. I am just incredibly mindblown how Rockstar was able to pull this off....now I will be BEGGING for Red Dead even more!!!just to give some facts for a few people maybe wondering theres no mouse acceleration the controls are seemless controller support (if wierdly you want that) is seemlessly there. FOV is decently implemented (not perfect in FPS but im sure mods will change that) it supports ultra widescreen (most cutscenes were made at 16 9 though). the First person functions perfectly. all controls are customizable. and based on low graphics settings most peoples systems will probably run it well and low settings still look pretty decent. oh and NO FRAME RATE CAP!

2016-02-21,0,0,1999,False,Not Recommended,"GTA 5 Online makes me think it must be designed by malicious or mentally challenged farm animals and it is by far the worst large scale online game I have ever played (I've played lots of games.) I dont recommend anyone buying *anything* from rockstar games at this rate they deserve to go out of business.The game has a story mode and an online mode. Story mode should take you about a week to finish I guess and it's fun but if you feel the need to do more together with intelligent beings prepare to get annoyed. Its online mode is by far the worst online game I have ever played not because it's not fun to play but many mechanics leading to having a good time in this game is so terribly designed it wastes more than half your game time. You'll be cursing its developers a lot if you buy this like I did. Also the way the game deals with leavers griefers cheaters and other plainly unintelligent ppl is... well the game doesn't deal with them. You do. You'll have to sort through hundreds of undesirables to find a handful you can play with.Some problems with GTA5 Online 1) There are some types of instances you can join public / friends only / crew only. When you first boot up the game it either loads into story mode or an online public instance. If you want to join a private instance you can only do that after it loads into story mode. I prefer loading crew only instances in online mode loads fast. In there after you accept a job invitation and finish the job the game usually puts you in a public instance with murderous characters and cheaters instead of the type of *private* instance you were in. (I've seen 20 players getting continuously teleported to a spot and getting bombed continuously which is not something a player can normally do btw and makes the user interface just block your controls and you won't even be able to report anything. What's *cheating* in an online game anyway right? Rockstar allows it. They suck.)Instead it should put you back in the type of instance it took you from while you joined others to do a job. Or it should ask you wth you want to do now. So what ends up happening is it tries to put you in an instance with 20 people in it which takes way longer to load than your solo instance then you quit online mode to be able to select an instance type again then it says ""Leaving instance.."" you wait then it loads into story mode automatically then you select the type of instance you wanna get into in the online mode again and finally go back to where the game should have sent you in the first place after wasting like 3 4 mins every ffing time (unless it even fails at that saying ""failed to find a suitable instance"" and loads back into story mode again.)All this unnecessary and outrageously long loading business eats up all your game time. It could easily be avoided by letting the users decide what to load.2) In the online part first you appear in the same world that's in story mode with some minor changes. That's called ""free mode"". You may do some stuff in free mode steal cars drive around rob shops beat up pedestrians take your shiny new tank for a test drive start a 5 star cop chase / rampage etc. The point is you may be doing something there. While in free mode you get job invitations to your phone from other players and npcs. You try to join those and most of the time it just unloads your current freemode instance without checking if you can actually join that (yes ""most of the time"" because sometimes it even fails at that after making you wait for about a minute) The game immediately takes you to loading screens saying ""Leaving instance..."" ""Joining instance..."" ""That job is now full of players"" ""Loading..."" ""Loading..."" And then you watch your apartment building's side wall for 10 secs and then you finally appear in your apartment and watch useless game notifications (which block your ability to start a heist btw) saying ""You can redesign your interior decorations"" etc every time before you can restart a heist.Instead it could and should first check if the job you're trying to join is full or not before jumping to all those needless loading screens then reserve a place for you there and only then make your game client leave the game instance you're in to safely join that other one.3) In the online part jobs/heists/races etc have a *number of players* restriction. For instance for a typical heist you need 4 people and if one of them leaves while you're in there the game disbands the whole team even if you're 5 seconds away from success. And the game automatically takes you back to free mode where you can start from the beginning finding people.If there aren't any mission specific tasks left that the leaver still has to accomplish it should just let you go on instead. Or in any case it should at least take you back to the part where you're just about to start the mission. Then you'd only be looking for one more player instead of 3 more which usually takes forever mind you. It has so much good and fun content (voice actored characters stories cutscenes land water and air vehicles jobs etc) which would put this game in the definitely buy list if it wasn't for the numerous design problems about which I can almost say ""show me something in there I'll tell you something wrong with it"" Ofc I don't care to explain everything while Rockstar apparently isn't even in the business of fixing stuff (years old bugs still there) or doing things correctly in the first place so there isn't much point in hoping it'll ever get better either.So long story short in the online mode 1) Your 20 mins of perfect runs or any other effort will get wasted because someone leaves intentionally or due to server issues *so many times* that you'll give up looking for people.2) You'll end up watching the game waste your time with needless loading screens making you try to join jobs you cannot taking you places which you'll leave.Obviously this game's developers are as malicious or as stupid as they come making such game breaking simple design mistakes... You'll end up trying to join jobs you actually can't hundreds of times and waste many hours looking at stupid loading screens. Anyone with mediocre intelligence would think of the design faults that lead to the above mentioned problems and correct them before even publishing them. So don't buy this cr p if you're buying for online play and you don't have a bunch of guys from irl you can play with.Oh yea btw currently the game doesn't let you play the offline ""story"" mode unless you have an internet connection you can connect to steam with. It used to let you play offline in story mode with steam in offline mode but now it says it cant connect to rockstar servers you need an internet connection to ""activate"" your product. You used to only need to activate it once to play offline later on but they apparently changed that now. Totally sux balls.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,0,0,243,False,Not Recommended,"First off I just want to say that the multiplayer in this game has some problems subjectivly they could be major problems for some that could ruin the experience completely 1. The load times for every thing you do races heists missions loading into a different online session. Its all in the same world space yet you get over 2 minute loads sometimes longer than that.2. The community is toxic as all hell with name calling racial slurs weird threats trolls (everywhere). It's like the perfect place for these things to fester and grow.3. The slow grind to make money. In this game everything is expensive as And you make money so slow that you end up doing the same over and over and over and over and over just to get a car or an apartment things you need to make more money at a slightly ""faster"" pace.4.The fact that the ""success"" of the multiplayer drained all future plans to add anything to the singleplayer. You go onto the multiplayer and theres cool cars and planes with people shooting at you from them around every corner but none of these cool things had been added to the singleplayer! None of them! You had to mod just to spawn them (using by chance the mod that is now illegal by the way) like for example the Hydra a VTOL jet aircraft. Not in the SP. A cool super car that had a rocket engine strapped to the back of it. Not in the SP. You get the gist of it.Now that I've said that the singleplayer is exceptional. The story the characters how the characters change and adapt to each other. It is one of the best narratives i've had the pleasure to play through and is better than a lot of films I have seen (I mean the game is an actually interactive movie that you get to play through with three characters). On the topic of modding it would seem that Take two has relaxed on the matter and OpenIV is back up.If you are looking for an exceptional singleplayer and a somewhat large modding scene then I can say go for it but the multiplayer is shockingly bad.",Grand Theft Auto V

When I say ""in it's prime"" I mean the classic console versions not this PC version.Multiplayer There are many aspects I would talk about like the long long loading screens or the non existent balancing between high levels and low levels. But the problem that made me stop playing is that the concentration of cheaters is embarrassingly high I would join a open world server and I would say there's a 50/50 chance to meet a cheater. They would often be invincible and once in a while the cheater would annihilate EVERYBODY at the same time which could be up to 30 players depending if the server was full. Sometimes you would get lucky and get a friendly cheater who gives free money but that ruins the whole point of the game to earn money by doing jobs and spend it on upgrading your stuff. Now I also hear the game's developer firm ""Rockstar"" is trying to get rid of cheaters and removing ""illegitimately"" obtained money by going on a banning spree which resulted in innocent players getting banned as well as their in game money. Online GTA on PC is just unplayable.Singleplayer The singleplayer is what the past GTA games were but better. Big open world to explore with several different environments long and entertaining story to play through.

2016-06-27,2,2,372,False,Recommended,After so many hours in this game I've come to the conclussion that without a moder giving you money or buying shark cards the grind you have to go through in order to get a CEO office a (at least) medium Warehouse a vehicle warehouse a Bunker and a Coccaine lab is literally H E L L. It is a gigantic enormous tremendous grind. Until you get those the only option you have for making money is to spam the pacific Standard heist as the host over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. It is an absolutely terrible experience with random people. The heist as well as the setups take around 2 hours to finish regularly but with randoms...no no no...forget about it. You'll just sit there all day and do a couple setups.However after you get all the businesses I mentioned above everything becomes so much more easier and actually fun. You do resupply and crate missions which can be done on your own and the only times when you might need help is when you're about to sell or if you want to get more supplies out of 1 resupply mission (more people more supplies in one run).Obviously everything new that comes out is overpriced as hell. You will soon realise that most of the cool new vehicles and new armed vehicles that get released with every DLC are pretty much useless since they cannot be used in heists just freemode. Unless you find griefing useful then all the new stuff that gets released is useless. On second thought the only use they might have is when you use those vehicles to protect your cargo when selling or resupplying but for that to happen you need at least 2 more people to operate the vehicle.The anti cheat is dreadful an utter disaster bans innocent players removes legitimate money and when it comes to bans and other similar stuff R* support is as supportive as.....emmmm......something not supportive at all.The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs up is because it is very fun with friends. Like I said above if you are playing on your own you will soon realise that since the new vehicles that are being released are pretty much useless then so are your grinding efforts. Unless of course you grind just for the fun of it (which I do which means that it's not a grind at that point just missions for fun).Finally a word about the story mode It s amazing!!P.S.

Story mode is very fun to play and is made better with mods. This game is very well optimized but likes to hog alot of storage.

The reason I give it a negative review is because of the online it's fun if you have friends to play with but playing with random people just isn't fun because they're either hackers or people who have poured money into the game to buy all the best stuff and so you can't really beat them. The DLC model was great at first because it was just free content added to the multiplayer but the last few updates have been clear cash grabs that basically force you to use the microtransactions if you want to get any of it (which can cost more than the actual game) unless you want to grind endlessly.,Grand Theft Auto V

The online is basically like story mode except with other players and some additional features. Everything is overpriced so 3 options apply. You grind your existance out to make some money (still not enough) buy shark cards (Rockstar's cash grab) or get (intentionally or unintentionally) modded money. None of are 'good'. The third may well get you banned. The online community is toxic and full of cheaters. The security measures rockstar has implemented has unfortunately banned innocent players myself included. My first ban was permanent. FIRST BAN. Not even a suspension. Just a permanent game ending ban. I picked up modded money unintentionally. Given their security measures are nowhere near perfect you also can't appeal bans. Awful support too when it comes to bans. If you don't get banned congratulations! You'll enjoy more sessions full of cheaters and awful players who (with or without cheats) will try to ruin your game.

The sheer scale of the game packed with so much minute detail it makes the mind boggle with how much effort and co ordination must have been requried to complete this masterpiece. And it's apparently never complete with continuous updates for GTA Online. Single player gives you many hours of great story telling and unique experiences. GTA Online is where the beauty of co operative team play shines. Missions are great but GTA Online's brilliance is bound by the amazing story driven Heists. Forced co op where multiple players usually performing different tasks either in pairs or alone with the succesful outcome dependent on all parties.

2017-10-06,19,2,210,False,Recommended,The fact that any PC version is sold later than the console counter does not surprise anyone today. It's the case that consoles often take precedence. However the game is getting old very quickly even in terms of technical advancement. A few months' delay is not yet a reason for pouring tears but when it comes to games a year and a half ago it may be different. However theoretically the long publishing process allows us to hope that the PC version will be improved. The title of the title which due to its popularity however hit the tins is Grand Theft Auto V. Rockstar Games crew is not a skin to share information about their products. It is not known whether the PC version was in the plan from the beginning or whether the decision was made only after some time in any case we have finally waited. What's more the very high notes they've received from the console versions even for a moment did not let GTA V forget about it and they even tightened their appetite for the series.Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto parts in GTA V you can control not one character and three different ones. They are diametrically different and perfectly complement each other. Franklin is a young black street thief who along with a friend works for a certain Armenian owner of several car dealerships. Michael in turn is a retired thief who has already earned his living. Now instead of robbing banks he faces the problem of a faithful wife and a pair of non living offspring. Apparently it goes hand in hand with the crisis of middle age in signs also gives him an all encompassing boredom. The last character is Trevor a true psychopath unpredictable man. He used to work with Michael and their paths were split in unfavorable circumstances. Now he is trying to trade with metaamfetamine in one of the deadly holes in the desert inhabited by gangsters and a variety of suspicious elements. Even in such an environment people are genuinely afraid of Trevor. But he is not afraid of anyone and nothing. I do not want to give too much detail but I will say that this peculiar three will finally meet and will have full hands.ust Grand Theft Auto V is a mole. Rockstar puts the bar high for other studios doing action games. After this game nothing from this shelf will taste the same. Anyone who has a console and has not bought GTA V must fix this bug. Who does not have a console he has to expect that the port on the PC will leave the team with R * better than last ... Its just the best game D,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,1,2,1062,False,Not Recommended,I've been a fan of the series especially for Grand Theft Auto V but ever since Take Two decided to illegalize modding I've been starting to loose respect for them as this massively affects player freedom as even I personally spent both a lot of time in Story Mode and Online but Story Mode gets bland after you achieve the 100% complention rate so I resorted to mods to get a ton of more fun from the game such as the LSPDFR mod as an example. Rockstar's explanation regarding OpenIV was that the software was used to cheat in GTA Online which is a huge false statement. OpenIV is only able to modify things within Story Mode what cheaters use for GTA Online is .DLL INJECTORS which inject the cheating scripts directly into the game as you load into GTA Online no Open IV involved.To me what this looks like is Rockstar Games being desperate for money as they want as many players to play GTA Online 24/7 as possible to get all of the Sharkcard microtrans cash they can which is really to the average consumer so they attempt to make singleplayer as boring as possible another key sign of that being the fact that most of the newer DLCs don't have their content in Story Mode.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,0,0,100,False,Recommended,"I have been playing this game since it's original launch I went to the midnight release for the 360 and powered through story mode/single player and all it had to offer it for nearly a week. I played online mode the minute it was released suffering through the crippling server issues that it had. With all of the problems during it's launch aside I had an amazing experience. I felt this was really the first ""next gen"" game that I had the chance to play. The PS4 had launched shortly after in November and I awaited its release. Again I played this game religiously on the PS4 during it's debut.With all of the being said I pre ordered this game for the PC (the third time for me) and patiently awaited it's release. Thus far I am having an amazing time. The game is polished great fun and runs flawlessly on my setup. The heists are amazing and social club is integrated nicely into the game. My only complaint would be that I wish there would have been a small tutorial or side note stating how to access the social club menu and that friends/crews can be modified only via the social club menu.A note for the people giving it negative reviews For the people who cannot run this due to your hardware not being able to handle the game. Plain and simple you should have read the requirements. This game is graphics intensive and requires a PC that can handle it. I personally would not try to run this game on laptop unless I was running an i7 with dedicated video cards. For the people who are complaining about the crappy community. This is GTA. If you are looking for a peaceful hand holding experience there are many casual and team oriented games on steam that might suit you better. You can also trigger online solo play via the single player online options.For the people who simply cannot play this game due to crashes and other things that are beyond your control. I can understand your frustration and hope that the game will be able to be ran for you in the future. It really is a great experience and it would be shame that a rocky launch would sully the potential experience.Thank you Rockstar for another great game in a franchise that has kept me entertained since 2001.

The world is filled with amazing environments that never seem to fail. The mountains for example are amazing and graphically pleasing. Playing with friends especially in an 'Invite only session' is truely a great way to avoid any trolls wanting to ruin your experience. Definitely the best open world game there is and multiplayer experience. Thought I've heard many negative reviews of the online community and Rockstar's banning system I can say that if you're hesistant towards GTA 5 Online and you're reluctant on the constant banning I definitely suggest going on a 'Solo session' or if you have some buddies a 'Invite only session'.

2016-01-22,0,0,29,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game but also an intelligent and sharp tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way but it s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling unpredictable and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self directed adventures through San Andreas.In my opinion it is one of the very best video games ever made.,Grand Theft Auto V

Its well made and I had tons of fun with it in the past but I can't see myself telling others to purchase this game. The way the online mode is made to either make you farm money for hours in order to buy anything remotly fun is comletely insane. the game hopes that you will give in to the microtransactions. Furthermore the recent actions that the publisher has taken against the modding community combined with what was said in a recent interview with their CEO is insulting to the people who purchased their game we aren't meant to have fun we are a product and they want our money if we dont give them more money after the initial purchase then we can off. This kind of mentality ruins games (as shown by their god awful boring grindy online mode) and shouldnt be accepted especially in a game where people have already paid full price initially. It is purely unethical from them to treat gamers this way and to actively try and stop fun things just so they may have more microtransaction money. Dont buy this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-05,0,0,296,False,Recommended,TL DR I think this is a very good game imo though I believe in order to unlock the full potential of fun in this game you need to have friends to interact and play with.I first got this game on the xbox 360 and was amazed at the time as I have never seen anything quite like. Rockstar blew my socks off. As time passed I got it on the Xbox One and then finally once I joined the master race I was absolutley stunned. (2560x1080 with a 980ti) This game is absolutley beatiful and it is one of my favorite games in my library. The Storyline is one of great detail that kept me intertained for a long time. I personally enjoy to play online more but it is nice to go back to storymode every once in a while. The way that Rockstar have implemented characters from the campaign into online is another thing I love making the game not feel so different in online mode. As with most open world games you have the potential to do anything. And trust me everytime you log in it will be something different. While I do think the game is enriched when you are with freinds as almost everything it is better with freinds. The game although has included ways to stay intrigued playing solo and I often play by myself. The two problems or gripes I have with this game is one the evident problem of modders. Whenever you are in an online lobby (public) there is a pretty substantial chance that you will come in contact with a modder. This is kind of a double edged sword though and some modders are cool and will make it a fun time with them. On the other hand though some modders ruin the experience for others by killing them all and making the game literally unplayable where you cannot move your character. The one other problem I have is that Rockstar has made this game so based around moneywhere players who buy sharkcards have in an advantage in certain things. While others have the ability to buy those things it would take a ridicously long amount of time. Overall I love this game dearly and I would not trade it for anything. I have learned to deal with the inconviences and once you are able to do that you are able to enjoy a wicked game that will continue to make you smile for hours on end.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-02-09,0,0,748,False,Recommended,GTA V... One of the best games of the past 5 years and is greatly enjoyed by many. But like most games people find ways to tarnish and ruin players experiences. I myself feel that my gameplay mainly online has been comprimised not just by players but by rockstar itself. Rockstar has done a great job at packaging and delivering GTA V and GTA Online for the last 4 years or so but I now feel that they have become slack and sloppy with their newer updates. For example the Executives and other Criminals update has added exciting new items and modes into what was already a well planed game. However it also brought with it some major set backs. In game $$$ is the first one that comes to mind. Everything added is just a way for those select players who dedicate hours of time playing the game. This has made it extremely hard for new players to make their way up the ranks as VIPs have now got personal bodygaurds and heavily defended vehicles. Having these over powered and expensive items has also brought in a huge amount of hacking and cheating. Some new players or players who have been playing GTA Online for some time and are not earning the big ones have turned to hacking as a way to get these luxurious items that everyone wants. Players are now also using hacks like God mode and teleportation to troll and grief other players. Dont get me wrong the storymode of GTA V is well planned and the featuers that have been added to the game have made it the biggest GTA Franchise yet. But if you are planing on purchasing this game prepare yourself for living hell when it comes to multiplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-25,0,0,312,False,Recommended,I didn't originally want to get this game but was strongly urged by my friend to get it when it came out on the PC. I'd never played a Grand Theft Auto game before but had definitely seen gameplay before and had been interested in the series. Ended up putting 100 hours into online the first week I had it. It was such a great open world experience with friends. Alone however the game ends up stale and with not much to do. I wasn't a fan of the single player in this game. I'm sure the story is great but after playing 100+ hours of online the story mode just felt too lonely and empty for me so I couldn't get into it. Even with friends though the game certainly gets boring after a while when all you do is the same set of stuff over and over. The game doesn't get nearly as many content updates as it should have and that to me is enough to make the game feel slightly half even though they did a phenomenal job with the rest of the game. I definitely recommend this game though.,Grand Theft Auto V

Probably my favorite video game of all time I have close to 980 hours on xbox 360 and over a thousand hour on xbox one. I recently got my new graphics card and got GTA for PC. It's a great game I have quite a bit of time put into it on PC as well but it has SO MANY PROBLEMS.If you want to play GTAV go for console. I know you can't get mods and all that but seriously you're only going to regret getting it on PC. I've had to reinstall it at least 4 times due to errors that kept me from behind able to play the game at all. This wouldn't be a problem if I had standard internet and GTAV is a game that's over 60GB in size. Taking nearly 2 3 days to install it's the most aggravating feeling when you find an unfixable error.Rockstar Games has awful support I have a lot of respect for them but honestly they're technical support is just dreadful. I had one error with the game at one point where I reinstalled the game reinstalled rockstar social club nothing would work. I actually REINSTALLED WINDOWS just to play GTA and again I'm already having errors and what does Rockstar Games tell me? They say ""Pleasae reinstall the game to get rid of these errors"".It really is a great game but you're just going to end up beating your head against your keyboard until you slowly die from internal bleeding.

2015-07-12,0,0,243,False,Recommended,I've been playing and enjoying this game for more than few months on and off finished main story and some side missions I am glad that I've bought this game.So I've tried GTA online for like a week and so completed every heist and some mini games it was the best and worst moments because you do get loading screens often I mean you'll have to wait about 3 5mins to GTA online then if you're playing with someone you will be leaving the session which mean loading again then again to rejoin one of the friend's session. Therefore everytime you join a heist or mini game it takes about 2 4mins depending on the server and players bad thing is you will back to loading screen again once a player left the heist that's what annoys me because you have to literally drive back to your apartment and start a new heist you know invite people again and wait for it to load again! Shouldn't be like that it has no or little help with good system great SSD and CPU won't get faster loading time.What's breaking the game is when you're trying to do your progress hackers will come on and kill the game what I've seen so far hackers drop booms to everyone money hack god mode teleport hack etc..I would still recommend this game on single player mode which is finest game they've made by Rockstar although I hope they will fix or change something on online mode matter of loading moments or hacks. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-12,0,0,69,False,Not Recommended,To start with I'll say the only reason I'm not recommending this game right now is because it crashes consistently on Windows 10. Otherwise it's a great game and I suggest picking it up once Rockstar gets off their asses and fixes this. I'll also update my review at that point too.The game starts and runs really well but will eventually crash within 5 30 mins. I've tried compatibility mode for Win7 and Win8 and running as admin with and without compatibility. The bigger issue is Rockstar's response to this problem is that they don't support Win10 and to roll back your OS. Now I agree installing to a brand new OS on release isn't a great idea but the preview ISO was available for nearly half a year and all my other games run fine on Win10. It's ridiculous this is still an issue after so many have reported it.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA V get it to the next level great crafted world lively city and the beautiful ocean everything is so great.

It also introduce the new 3 main characters system that work so great.CharactersAll the 3 main characters are so great. However I have to give the award of the greatest character to Trevor. The design of Trevor character is so interesting and make me feel so excited. His unpredictable actions with such a sensitive heart were a wierd but strangely harnomized combination.

Granted most games fail due to cheaters and toxic community. Anyways I am very much enjoying the game GTA Online I havn't played the solo part at all as I'm not really into Single player games unless its gamecube. The only complaint I think I have is the party system theres no way to make a group or party and thats really annoying when the load times are forever then you have to re load forever again to get on the same session with your crew or friends. If they had a good grouping up option this game would be so great and I'd probably play it way more then I do. Due to the long loading and the frusterating group setup I can't give this game 10/10. It gets 7/10 from me. The community is only so so its full of idiots who try and act tough but seem to forget that its a game and acting tough online is about as logical as well lets put it this way acting mean and rude dosn't make anyone look cool makes em look stupid and pathetic. Community for the most part is stupid and pathetic. Every once in a while you meet someone worth gaming with though and it's really fun. I recomment playing with friends as its very fun that way. There is alot to do and things to interact with. Humor in the game is great. Overall score 7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

As some one who has completed the campaign the missions are very interesting and don't feel repetitive as some games. The multiplayers is also very fun mode to play with new DLC's being added. What I would like to see is for more heists to be added in multiplayer as the heists get boring after a while.,Grand Theft Auto V

Online Multiplayer alows for alot of fun with friends even if it is full of hackers.Cons As stated before online mode is absolutely full of hackers. 1 in every 2 full lobbies will have atleast 1 hacker. It seems like instead of preventing hackers R* is just banning anyone they find modding even if you do it in single player. the game could really use a good cheat prevention system.

Every time something violent happens in the world someone somewhere instead of pin pointing the actual problem blames video games. Especially this one or this franchise in particular.Well screw that. It's games like this that allow us all to do some pretty f'ed up stuff we wouldn't normally do that keep most of us from doing violent things in real life. Thanks to GTA I'm not out there banging hookers or running them over in my car. I'm not killing random amounts of police just to see how many more will show up to try to kill me. I don't run my car off the bridge to see how many barrel rolls I can do before I hit the ground or to see if I can land on the wheels and ride off in to the sunset like the mofo'ing badass I am...... seriously..... countless barrel rolls and landing on the wheels and driving off that's beast what up suckas?!?! Try that in real life.... DEAD!!But I digress. If you want some good clean.....err umm....bad dirty dirty violent borderline psychotic fun at the end of your hard day in real life. If you want something to blow off steam that won't put you in jail for acting out those road rage thoughts you had when that dill hole in the Audi cut you off on the freeway during rush hour this morning. If you don't want to be plastered all over the 5 o'clock news and labled a psycho just cause your way of blowing off steam was a mass killing spree for no apparent reason.... then GTA V is for you.So grab this game!!

Well deserving of its ratings on meta critic and accoladesThe online experience i wasn't happy with trying to coordinate with friends to meet up after 1 was stuck in the tutorial was a nightmare with no option to create a clan within the game itself. I needed to physically go to social club website to create one a obvious oversight.GTA online still seems abit clunky compared to the single player experience. however if you finally manage to begin a heist with your buddies without one being left behind its incredibly fun and challenging.Overall GTA V is a big contender for game of the year for me even with the 2 year wait and delays Rockstar did deliver.Heres looking forward to a great yeat in game titles!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,99,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing gtav since it came out on ps3 over 5 years ago. I got it on ps4 as soon as it came out and dumped another 100 hours into the game. Finally I bought it on sale for pc and it was the superior version of the game simply because of the ability to mod. I beat the story twice and it was good. My only complaints on single player are 1. how hard maintaining your custom cars can be an 2. Rockstar has neglected to add any single player content to the game. I ONLY recommend this game if you wanna play single player with mods. If you're coming for the multiplayer STAY AWAY. I've invested over 150 hours easilly and I can say the most fun I ever had in that entire time was messing around with new purchases with money I got through duplication glitches. Actuallly making money in this game is a RIDICULOUS GRIND and Rockstar knew exactly what they were doing when they made it this way. The biggest payout you can make on the hardest heist in the game is $5 000 000 and thats after you've gotten a A good car $1 000 000 $4 000 000High end apartment atleast $800 000New DLC Bunker atleast $1 300 000A bunch of good weapons $1 500 000The average payout of missions and races in this game is $20 000 if you're lucky. OR you can do what Rockstar really wants you to do and take a big dip into their sweet sweet nectar of MICROTRANSACTIONS. Microtransactions have ruined gta online. Everytime Rockstar adds content it's around $20 000 000 worth of content and you know what $100 of REAL MONEY gets you? Only $8 000 000. It's goddam highway robbery. Like paying $100 for a glass of water in the gold rush the ingame economy is completely screwed in favor coercing a select few into dumping hundreds of dollars into ingame content. It's just sad and it makes me scared for any future online implementation Rockstar comes up with. It's everything wrong with the game industry and why this game has less than a 70% review. TakeTwo the company pulling Rockstars strings doesn't care if this game leaves any legacy behind they made their cash grab and proved microtransactions are the most profitable way to do it. They recieved little more than a slap on the hand with some negative reviews while they're rolling in money. In retrospect all those hours I dumped into gta online were all a waste. The community is full of hackers and modders and all the regular players are ABSOLUTE CANCER of humanity. Most people will kill you on sight to boost their K/D and all the most fun content is gated behind microtransaction paywalls. If it weren't for duplication glitches I used back in the day to get a bunch of content I would have dropped the game AGES AGO. It's just sad how fun and fulfilling the game could have been if it weren't for the pure greed behind the terrible ingame economy of this game.TL DR You wanna just have fun in gta5? get it on sale and play single player with mods for one of the most fun games on pc. You wanna have fun with other people? You're SOL with gta because Rockstar would rather gate of content with ridiculous pricing in order to push microtransactions and make the game a boring grind.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-14,1,1,119,False,Not Recommended,GTA V is a stellar game that I would be proud to put forward as the representative for games in general. The story is fantastic the characters are great the dialogue feels natural and is well written the controls and movement are really nice the driving is good the graphics still hold up amazingly the world is a perfect balance hilarious and ed the animations are soooo slick and just the general level of polish on just about every aspect is astounding. I've probably missed aspects that deserve mentioning but basically GTA V is a fantastic game that everyone who loves games should play. Nuff' said.Now GTA Online is a whole other beast. Upon releasing Online GTA V or Story Mode was basically abandoned. Promised updates were scrapped or diverted to Online and Story Mode was left to sit as this shining finished awesome work of art. But it was 'finished' which really stings. Once you've had your fill of Story Mode that's it and you know it because Rockstar and TakeTwo are too greedy to put resources into a less profitable game. And it is like a seperate game. Story Mode and Online are like polar opposites. If you come out of Story Mode with the splendor of what you just experienced fresh in your mind prepare for that memory to have the beaten out of it over and over and over again. GTA Online is the epitome of what bad multiplayer looks like. It took everything that was great about Story Mode and on it. Blow up someone else's car? Pay for it. Want to buy guns? Play the game for hours just to unlock the guns and then spend as much as a small house for ammo and sure. Want to buy clothes? $2k for a pair of pants.Kill someone? They go into passive mode and cant be hurt or hurt others. Want to do literally anything? Stare at a loading screen (with an ad for more that costs heaps) for five minutes each way and you're there. Want to swear at people? Text chat is censored. Want that awesome new car? Play 10000 rounds of stagnant repetetive 'jobs' or gamemodes (because anything more advanced would make less money) or pay $100 of real money and get enough Online currency for like 3 nice new cars. That cost doesnt include the apartment and garage you have to buy obviously.Do you want to do anything that isnt racing or shooting eachother? off. To become the CEO of a criminal orginisation is at least $1m of ingame money for the bare minimum which is barely fun. Biker gang? Same story. It's sickening. The only jobs people play are missions which are SINGLEPLAYER. Except for when a new iteration of the same comes out. Then you get full lobbies every ten seconds but only because of the cash and xp boost Online needs to get people to play their lame gamemodes.There is so much more that is just so fundamentally wrong with GTA Online that I could list but I'd need to play it to refresh my memory which I will never do. What you pay for when you buy GTA V is half masterpiece and half bloatware. If it goes on sale for 50% off go for it. You'll be paying for the only half worth playing.So all in all don't play Online and you'll have one of the best game experiences of your life. Otherwise I can't guarantee you'll like it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-31,1,1,46,False,Recommended,I love the GTA V Singelplayer Mode! (and only the Singleplayer) No Spoilers Here's the deal you can do basically anything in this game just like Just Cause but it feels very real.It's not solely you against the world with nothing but Robots but you can interact with any of the other people in this world just like you would in real life. Often times you find yourself facing real life scenarios such as a robbery a stand off or just driving around drunk or lost civilians and you can interact with them in different ways or just leave them. It's awesome.This game is so unique you can control 3 main characters with awesome background stories and totally different settings and morals each can do different jobs have different skill sets and own seperate businesses.However so far I do not like the Online Mode at all. Hackers toxic players Pay 2 Win System. I have played it for several hours but I couldnt get into it. I have put the game down for half a year just because I hated the Multiplayer Mode so much and just picked it up again for the Singleplayer and boy is it worth it!I recommend it for anyone who loves a great Singleplayer experience but I can't recommend Multiplayer at all so far.,Grand Theft Auto V

Darth take two was a dark lord of capitaliosm so corrupt and powerful he could use the shark cards to influence the wallets to create profit. He had such a knowledge of the shark cards he could even keep the ones he cared about from playing modded games. The modded side of games is a pathway many consider to be better than the base game. Take two became so corrupt the only thing he was araid of was losing his players which eventually of coure he did. Ironic he could save other games but not himself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,0,0,58,False,Recommended,I'm gonna be blunt the game looks even better then I recall it looking on the current and last gen versions. Running at a smooth 60 the driving is a very different experience and with the simple capture gameplay element along with being able to add your own mp3's to the radio it was worth a return. If you liked GTAV before then you'll love it now... if of course you're able to run it. My current build is a GTX 970 with a i7 4790k running at 4.0 GHz with 16 GB of RAM. On this I can run close to Ultra settings at a clean frame rate and I haven't had a drop yet. This game is well optimized despite the 65 GB install you can see why it's so goddamn big.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-05-25,2,1,1086,False,Recommended,Hands down one of the best games I have ever played. This game is worth so much more than the $60 it's been at since it was released.

Thanks Rockstar keep up the good work.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-14,0,0,238,False,Recommended,Pros graphicly excellent fps mode adds alot to the game For the most part good port seemless use of controller and keyboard/mouse Director mode is a feature that will add lots of replay valueCons a few peopke having loading people (most people have no problems just a vocal minority) A few fps issues when on full greaphics even with high end cards minor camera control issues in fps (but that could me being an TL DR Great port (if it loads) highly recomend but turn down shaddows a little. The FPS mode adds a great new perspective that works perfectly with keyboard and mouse but have a controller ready for driving.For me this game works a treat. I have played the 360 version and this is deffinatly just as fun. The use of first person mode makes the game epic. Gun fights are better and more seamless with the ability to aim now a thing. I personalynuse a 360 controller and keyboard and mouse somi get the best of both worlds and i would recomend this. I'm using a nvidia 970 and the game is on near full graphics and well my fps is somewhere between 25 45 fps which would imply the game has a little work to do in regards to graphical bugs. Yes it looks tones better than 360 but not that much better i dread to see what 4k monitors look like in regards to full graphics. So i hope an update comes out to improve this. Either way the game looks good and super high quality shaddows are not hugely necessary and turning them down a little improves the frame rate alot.For those who have been having issues loading that gota suck and there is little i can say about that but it works well for me first time so I have to highly recomend this game and while it is technicaly a port its a fairly good one and think its worth all the money.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-23,0,0,286,False,Recommended,I have loads of memories of this game. Amazing single player. And trying to level my character in October of 2013 when the game got released on gta online on my Xbox 360. grinding survival missions for 20 grand a victory. I even remember getting a 100 million bounty set on me when that exploit was first found. And having to sell my whole garage to get most of my legit earned money as rockstar had removed most of it while trying to get rid of the exploited cash. I would grind gta online constantly all day every day. It was truly enjoyable. Then the pc version was released and i imported my character and didnt touch the game until CEO missions. And left because of the hackers rockstar failed to ban. I am loyal to this game and it was great back in the day. But after hundreds of hours of play the online got stale quickly repeating missions over and over. and getting killed by hackers spawning UFOs in.Great game ok longevity. But if you love the game as much as I did. You can admit it had its issues that rockstar ignored. I am scared to touch the game after reading the reviews of people getting hours of hard work wiped because rockstar are cucks. And I dont think unless they add lots of new content i will ever be going to be giving this game another go.If I could give this game a mixed review I would.

Why is it that I have the fear of gettingbanned for no reason while all the other hackers can easily roam freely without a carein the world?

I've played through the story twice once on Xbox 360 and once on PC however after that it just gets boring. The story mode isn't what keeps me playing.The main reason to buy this game is for GTA Online. It's amazing. Loads of customization options for cars bikes boats planes helicopters characters houses and now even yachts. Yes the prices are hefty and investing in a shark card will set you back but the ability to earn money with heists and side missions is becoming easier. One downside is that online doesn't allow mods. I was part of LCPDFR clan back on GTA IV which we used mods online. If there was some way to host private ""freemode"" servers seperate from GTA Online that did allow mods then this game would be even more amazingAll in all though GTA Online is the reason why you should buy this game hands down.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,41,False,Not Recommended,The incredibly hostile attitude of Rockstar and Take2 towards the PC community has led me to give this game a negative review. First GTA Online is a poor experience as it's a grind fest which encourages its players to pay for shark cards which buy you in game currency which is the goal of the experience. It punishes players who just want to have fun. They also insta ban people who have simple mods online. But most importantly they have sent cease and desist notices to OpenIV a modding tool for GTA games which is incredibly anti consumer. The modding community for GTA has been massive and has added life to the GTA franchise on PC. Being hostile towards modders is inexcusable when it's the reason when many players such as myself play this game. I get banning people who mod single player and then play online to an extent as you can't take any risk but this is just stupid. This won't affect cheaters on GTA Online as they don't even use OpenIV. You're just screwing with the average player of GTA. I won't buy your next product even if it is the best ing game ever because it's clear you guys are incredibly greedy and don't give a damn about your playerbase. If you guys can reverse order then I will gladly change my review. But until then this is my last Rockstar/Take2 game.EDIT They removed the C&amp D from OpenIV but removed a lot of mods that altered map assets.

Killing mod support by issuing cease and desist letters is just despicable and a blatant screw you to their PC community.

Keeping the above text as we can't forget about that.I've thoroughly enjoyed the game both single player and Online. Online does get very grindy and you will be tempted to purchase shark cards that's just the business model one I do disagree with. Other than that hours of fun to be had here.Luckily Take Two decided to reverse their stance on mods and allow them.

SocialClub with crews friend list and the feature to share photos that you've taken with the in game phone camera.HUGE MAP!There are a buch of stuff in GTA V that you've not seen the previus games of the GTA series. Rockstar made a great job!The games looks very good with a pretty steady FPS (I have an AVG of 90 100 FPS on a 970 card) and that is so perfect when you take a helicopter and decide to just fly over the HUGE map.

Loved the chance to attack the enemy from different angles.Also nice that you can hang out with them by calling them up. The game looked great.3.I loved how the gangs. actually think when you get into a fight with them. In San Andreas they would just line up in a row and it would be to easy. I use to run around just to make it harder to take the lands.The gangs on this hide like they don t want to die. They come from all sides and even send their dogs.Negatives 1. I try to log and it tells me Activation of GTAV requires an internet connection.Thing is I do have internet and when I google this issue other people have experienced the same issue. Why should I even need internet to play offline.2.Have also had problems getting online when it does let me play offline.In game negatives 1.The gang zone is every limited. The Ballers territory alone was bigger than all the gang zones on GTA 5. The gangs don t cross turf. You never see them at war with each other.Not really a thumbs up or down more like side ways.

It's a fun and great game but it's a shame that the developers don't know how to keep the game even remotely functional. In an attempt to get rid of cheating they break the game more they take away mods they ban people who don't even cheat. The gameplay is fun and there is so much to do. I want to love this game but in the end you spend more time trying to avoid hackers and toxic squeakers than actually playing with friends. Speaking of playing with friends it is an absolute mess. It takes forever to load into a friends freeroam game much less try to go into a versus mode with a group. Getting together with friends is what I loved this game for and the developers can't even make that work. Find another game. FIND ANOTHER DEVELOPER. They don't deserve your support they don't deserve your money and they definitely don't deserve to get away with this steaming pile of trash.

2015-05-12,0,0,649,False,Recommended,"A few gamers worldwide have had an experience with the Grand Theft Auto franchise at some level. Whether it's from the bird's eye point of view perspective to the current industry trend that is first person.This franchise has definitely taken a couple of years of my life.From the Franchise debut to GTA 5's PC release (excluding GTA 2 and GTA China town Wars unfortunately).I've put countless hours into this series and enjoyed each and every sociopathic moment. Story (Spoilers) Micheal Townl.. I mean DeSanta Franklin Clinton and Trevor ""TP industries"" Phillips are the protagonists. Which brings variety to the gameplay with the new character switching feature a delightful addition in contrast to the previous one man army formula. Shouts out Niko Bellic!! It gives a thrilling dynamic to missions and the opportunity to use each character to their strengths and ability. Micheal with his Max Payne style slow motion gun play Franklin with his ronin driving skills and Trevor with his super saiyan rage where he can mow down whoever or whatever has a pulse.Micheal is your slightly beyond middle aged early retired bank robber turnt aspiring family man living with the odd midlife crisis. Franklin the youngster of the trio is your everyday gang affiliate / car thief with an above average potential. With something to prove. Not forgeting he also has a dog named Chop.Trevor on the other hand he's something else. I'd say that he's more nuts than your local peanut factory! Frankly He's the type of crazy that begs for the lethal injection. I do feel a touch of guilt considering that he's almost my favorite GTA protagoninst of the series. (Victor Vance baby).So Micheal is in debt to the boss of the mexican drug cartel.With his and his beloved families necks at risk he needs cash. A sexy amount of money at that.So long early retirement hello Heat the movie the video game. It's time to run some heists. The heists are easily the strongest elements in the story including Lamar with his punch lines.GamePlay The world that RockStarGames has created is phenomenal with stunning attention to detail a world that is seemingly living. The sense of immersion and atmosphere is superb the map is fair in size. From the dence city to the sprawling mountains various wildlife vast ocean and desert.Los Santos is a joy to explore. At your disposal are a number of vehicles from the all new submarine helicopters planes boats cars motorbikes and bicycles. Extending to in depth customisation options such as vehicle mods weapon mods clothing barbers and tattoos. There is a whole host of content on offer here that extends the gamplay value.However I am slightly disapointed by GTA 5's car handling Something seems a little bit off in comparision to GTA 4's driving mechanic's which were in my opinion vastly superior. The first person mode after tinkering with the sensitivity settings enchances the gun play giving the missions an added replay value. I'm Thouroughly enjoying driving in first person with fully functional speedometers exploring the world as well as when visiting certain gentlemen's clubs huh hmm. The LSPD Los Santos Police Department are hyper realistic in many ways although are more than a bit sensitive to your criminal activity when you're in isolated no witness areas like a mountain top. The music selection is on the weaker side in contrast to that in GTA 4. The Lab which is the PC exclusive radio station is a decent addition.PerformanceMany graphical options are availible that are on par with the excellent PC version of Max Payne 3 GTA 5 has kept up to standard.Texture quality shadows ambient occulsion ect. I'm having solid performance of 40+ to 60 fps with all options set to high on my 2GB Radeon R9 270x.For me Coming from the ps3 version which considering it's hardware was solid. To the PC release it's pretty.VeredictStory 75/100Gameplay 100/100Sound 90/100Graphics 95/100Overall 95/100",Grand Theft Auto V

I have to switch my graphics level to medium so i dont have any frame drops. I have friends with GTX 970's and GTx 760's and they also have this problem. A GTX 970!!!!!!!!

What did you try to do to them Rockstar? Cease and Desist.Fortunately back then your attempts failed and SA MP persisted and because they persisted there are still 50 000+ players using GTA SA a game that is over a decade old.

All I can say is that it was worth the wait! 10/10Only down side is that there are a few bugs in the game when doing hiests / missions when you freeze up on one screen.

2015-04-15,0,0,165,False,Recommended,Absolutely amazing. Everything is fun from the missions and heists that you do to the fun mini games that you can play like tennis darts parachuting and racing. What makes this GTA stand out most is its brand online gaming mode which enables players to play a wide variety of different game modes and earn levels and money. It's an incredibly polished game and a huge leap from GTA IV which was also an excellent game. If you're a fan of GTA you must get this.

Online's golden age was from 2013 to mid 2015 buy it for the mods and for the amazing story mode if you can have fun with that then go for it on a sale it's a great game with very good optmization.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-31,0,0,438,False,Not Recommended,This game runs like absolute garbage. I purchased this game from gamestop for the PS3 and waited at midnight for it and loved every minute of the game on console. If I had a current gen console I would have re purchased it and waited at midnight again. That's what I attempted to do with the PC version. I have the EXACT reccomended specs and I get unplayable stuttering after 20 30 minutes of gameplay. The FPS will drop to literally 2 3 FPS and shoot back up to the usual 20 30. I should mention that when I first load up the game it runs a perfectly smooth 60 FPS but due to a memory leak that Rockstar has yet to adress or even acknowledge exists it gradually drops until the stuttering starts. Every update they release seems to make my playtime drop about 5 minutes. It actually got slightly better after they removed the junk code designed to keep mods out of multiplayer but they've updated it about 5 times (as of writing) since then and each one has made my FPS worse. I wish I could refund this and get my wasted 60 dollars back.Update I recently upgraded my graphics card to a GTX 970 and it seems to have fixed every issue I had with the game except for one. Rockstar's horrible customer service. I still haven't gotten an answer to my support tickets submitted in the above review. STILL. I honestly can't recommend this game in good conscience simply because if you have an issue with the game running properly or not running at all Rockstar simply WILL NOT offer any support. After going on to their support forums Rockstar employee's are basically extinct and the only people answering questions are 10 year olds telling you to 'get good' or 'fix your toaster'. Even submitting a support ticket either gets you completely ignored or told it's your computer's fault even though it probably isn't.If you're 100% sure your computer will handle this game fine then by all means do what you will but if you have any doubt in your mind that it will run stay away because you're not getting any support here.,Grand Theft Auto V

Let's get started.The reason why the reviews are mostly bad is because the steam summer sale... Blah blah blah blah.... Yea dont worry about that. Grand Theft Auto 5 just had a sale. The game was $35! That was the perfect time to get it.We also read about hackers and framers getting you banned. The best way to get away from this LEAVE! I have met a few aimbotters it was bad. But there can also be good people. Modders arnt the end of the world they can make your GTA experience fun!Now for some PRO's!If you have ever played on consle and if you are wanting it on the PC Get it! It's worth it! The controls are smoother everything is better to use not a lot of lag (although that depends on your computer) The game is stable enough for mods as well!If you have friends on here go online! Dont be afraid to play online you can meet some good people on their.The CON's of this game are just that the game has a lot of hacker.Sure yes like i said they can be fun but at the same time they can abuse their power and stuff like that.Hope this review helps at leaset some!

Spawn anything you want from vehicles to people and change the world around you from time to the weather! i prefer storymode a lot more for these reasons and you can't get banned...

2017-06-15,0,0,46,False,Not Recommended,"I overall enjoyed this game in single player both on pc and console but not so much now. I found that the cars had to much grip for my tast so i used the slidy cars cheat code for better handling in my opion. One day the code made cars undrivable after an ""update"" and rockstar seemed to not be fixing it. It seamed that all they care about this game now is multiplayer. In single player cars still disappear from your garage if you use auto save they broke their own cheet code and most recently the game refusees to run at 60 fps (no its not my card the game is only calling for about 50 percent of what the card can provide and doesn't matter what display settings i have).So i try online multiplayer and get hacked so i had to deal with rockstar for a day to get back my login information back. I look into this problem and see that their online gameplay security is so bad that any person with basic computer skills and the game can pull and decript your user information if they played with you. So make sure you have differnet password for this then anything else.So online is a bust and singleplayer is broken time to turn to mods so i can enjoy singleplayer. Well not so fast now Take Two (Rockstars Distributer) has sent an Official Cease and Desist letter to Open IV which is the backbone for GTA mods since GTA 3. And Open IV does not have the time and money to fight the legal battle so they have agreed to shut down. So yes if you want a game with broken single player (in my opion) with continued glitches that don't seem like they plan to fix. Or a multiplayer where they are basicly makeing money on people making micro transactions and you can get hacked basicly by anyone in a basement with a computer than this is a game for you. Personally I'll go back to GTA 4 see below for the links for Take Two vs OpenIV and the Petition to overturn it.Take Two VS OpenIVhttp //gtaforums.com/topic/889348 take two vs modding/Petition to save Open IVhttps //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openiv",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-05,0,0,586,False,Not Recommended,General Pros Fantastic graphics runs very well Free updates with good features Cons Very long loading times (SP and MP) Freezes often on my System when driving around or starting missions for a couple of seconds I have to cap my FPS to 30 otherwise my CPU will always run on 100% usage Car handling is really unrealstic Controls are really spongy on PC (expecially in menues etc) You have menu loading times (Like when quitting the game you have to wait several seconds to accept it because the game needs time to load the accept button)Singleplayer Pros Very good Story characters are authentical Long playtime and very much fun with sidemissions Singleplayer is fun itself even when just derping around Cons AI is sometimes really dumb just hiding 90% of a fight behind the cover Driving AI is dumb aswell driving sometimes into your car without any reason etc. Police is unrealistic und unfair on higher pursuit levels (they randomly spawn (sometimes visible) exactly on your route) Some enemys can hit you through walls and sometimes they like to have a kinda aimbot so they can hit you in distance in a boat or carMultiplayer Pros Makes fun to derp around with friends or do some missions together Cons HACKERS everywhere had not even one single lobby without a hacker i recommend solo/friend/crew sessions Income/Outgoing Rate is way to low you get way to less money to be able to buy the good things in GTA Online (I can really understand why so many players are hacking money) (Example You get 15k average per job and around 50k 200k per heist and with the elite challenge 10M once but a Yacht costs at least 6M and good cars ath least 1.5M) Multiplayer gets really fast boring you have to do the same missions again and again. Same with Heists. Same AI Cons in MP Multiplayer is bugged as f*ck several timeouts crashes long loading times contacts not calling network lags Annoying contacts Lester is calling me everytime even when i cancelled all heists. IT'S ANNOYING!All in all I can't recommend the game anymore. It's fun to play the Singleplayer because the campaign is just great and for around 20 50h the multiplayer but then it just get's annoying and boring.,Grand Theft Auto V

There aren't really any bad things to say about this game.... except... the multiplayer. It's ok if and when you play with friends and people you know. Don't even try playing with some random guys on some random session. It's not worth wasting your time effort or your nerves.

2015-04-14,0,0,85,False,Recommended,This game is great! I played it on the 360 when it first came out and I have to say that getting it again on the pc was a great choice. The game has really improved from the 360 version. It looks beautiful with max setting. I get about 45 to 50fps on max settings (check out my profile for all my pc info) which is still better than the 360. First person mode is really cool and the scenery is awesome. Also something that I liked is they put in even more good songs into the radio stations los stantos rock radio is the best haha. Last but not least hiests! If you are on the fence about getting this game I'd say go for it even if you have played it before like me on the ps3 or 360 it's so much better on the pc.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-29,0,0,290,False,Recommended,GTA 5....Easily the best game I have ever played. The role play in this game beats any other the graphics are amazing and you can do literally everything You can just wonder in a store and do a stick up go and join some races or even do some jet fighting/races customize your own character to the pinnacle of customization freckles dimples wrinkles size eye color. Then if you are feeling up to it you can even change your make up hair style literally everything. The races are fully customizable to however you want them weather cops own vehicles or basic vehicles. There are events like the $10 000 000 challenge if you complete all heists with the same team without dying once you all receive $10 000 000. Some of the downsides include connectivity issues there is a lot of loading and sometimes you can load for 5 minutes and then get disconnected or if you attempt to join a heist and it's full you have to wait a few minutes of loading. therefor I say do your best to not mess up the mission when you are in one because if you mess up means more loading time and it gets annoying. Also hackers Rockstar seems to be on the ball with banning them but there is a lot of them only yesterday a guy was blowing things up and everything he blew up turned into money bags was quite funny but the day before someone got angry at me and repeatedly killed me I tried to kill her but I did 0 damage she even ran towards me unarmed as I shot her and nothing happened and she killed me with her fists it was funny but at the same time very unfair.,Grand Theft Auto V

Didin't cost to much just $250 of course later that year the next generation consoles began getting their copy as well and upset me since I didn't plan on upgrading to another console since they were about $500 600. I saved up an moved to a PC spent $500 when originally it was $750 on black friday plus I got the game for $35 on that sale which was pretty awesome. I overall love this game to bad rockstar support gave up on modders for PC since they could find easy unban codes for their mod menu and they care more about the next gen consoles than computer. Overall if I would have to rate this game I'd give it a 10 out of a 10 also you could transfer your character as long as you have that rockstar account an such for crews thank god cause it had me worried since I didn't want to start back at level 1 on online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-17,0,0,682,False,Not Recommended,I can't believe how greedy the publishers and developers are. I'm just blown away. The developers of the popular modding tool known as OpenIV have officially received a cease and desist from Take Two Interactive (the publishers of GTA V) forcing them to stop distributing their software and killing off a major portion of the modding community in the process. Anything that requires modding the game's archives (car mods texture overhauls etc) is now impossible thanks to the publisher's insatiable lust for f*cking over their paying customers. Countless people have bought this game just to mod single player. After putting about 500 hours into online I decided to move over to modding since the pointless cash grab updates lost their shine years ago.The online community is slowly dying. Take Two knows it and they've realized that the updates with overpriced super cars and convenient 10% off Shark Card sales isn't enough to bring online back. Because of this they've decided to FORCE you to either play online play vanilla single player or uninstall the game. I'm going for the last option.How greedy can a person possibly be? The developers and publishers have made more money on this game than I'll ever see in my entire life and they still feel the need to f*ck thousands of people over just to wring the last little bit of water out of the moldy sponge known as GTA Online.The most frustrating part is the fact that I've bought this game 3 times. 360 PS3 and PC. I've spent $180 total buying copies of this game and I know many of others who have done the same but our opinions don't mean sh*t. I'm done supporting Take Two and I'm done supporting Rockstar.

2015-04-23,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Um. Yes this game is one of the best games I've had the chance to play to date. I've played a lot of games. The sheer amount of things you can do in this game is phenomenal. For me I only play online which does have its setbacks but theres a whole single player campaign which I hear is pretty good too. The level of immersion you can get in this game is excellent. Want to play tennis? Sure they got that. Want to race cool cars? They got that too. What about guns drugs and killing strangers of course! Now the biggest drawback for online is the money. Everything is terribly expensive and it's very difficult to come by money. Not impossible just slow and tedious. I believe they make it this way so that you'll buy money with real USD but that's pretty much status quo of the gaming industry nowadays. The bottom line If you want a game with a hell of a lot to do looks great plays swimmingly and is an overall joy to have this is the game for you. There are flaws but they're not significant enough to ruin anybodies day.GLHF Make that Money! twitch.tv/thethinktank,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-21,0,0,468,False,Recommended,Hey I might not have the most hours but I can make an honest review to help someone outThis game is awesome the story mode is awesome I completed it completely when I got banned for a month (i'll get back to that) and enjoyed playing as trevor and running motorbikes into the strip club and killiing them all and the police can never find me. The CEO Missions are awesome motorcycle clubs are fun I've not really done races as if I wanted to do a game for races I would get Beam.NG drive or something similar. the messages to join theem are annoying but it doesn't matter.Going back to my being banned for a month I was a noob level 16 and had thought that modding was ok so I shot this guy some dms for his mods and surprisingly gave them to me. It took me 3 hours and 6 minutes after I logged off to get an email to say I have violated the terms of service and have gotten to Level 70 legitimately through heists and CEO missions so I have no complaints apart from the fact the Cheating system has been good for me (but as far as I can tell not as good for other people)If theres one thing I hate the most is those jets who fly around trying to kill you when doing missions and vehicle missions (even though its allowed but its still annoying) and I think they should be allowed to do what they want but the level 4s who do it and just sabotage by crashing into you is annoying but if you've got a hydra and paid money to do it what shows you are sad and have nothing better to do its fine by me just I would think it would make more sense to get the jets from fort zancudo shot down every time they leave the airfield (as it mainly happens to me most of the time when I try to get payback) but thats just my thoughts.Personally GTA is a great game lots of bugs (I was loading for 4 hours once and it crashed . ) and loading screens. but its a great game. looking forward to the next game,Grand Theft Auto V

Now that mod support has been removed I will probably not play this game for quite a while.Thanks Rockstar for making a good game and thank you modders for turning that good game into one of the best games in the past few years.

2015-04-20,0,0,781,False,Recommended,"GTA has been a favorite series of mine since the first game. In those days it was very convenient for party play pop in some cheats and hand off to the next person when you died. Nobody did the missions except if you were the only one playing. This trend continued on into 2 and 3 where multiplayer either did not exist (or on PC couldn't get it to work easily) or didn't matter. The real first experience with multiplayer I had was Multi Theft Auto for Vice City. From that moment on the dream of multiplayer GTA meant stupid impossible feats. San Andreas reached that peak in singleplayer but lacked multiplayer beyond co op (sad). GTA has many capacities for GTA V you have to take the game as two seperate parts delineated on borders of functionality. GTA Online is to a lesser degree an excellent game however the reason one would play GTA Online is because singleplayer after finishing the story becomes a dull boring affair with little of the emergent content present in GTAO. That emergent content however is dull too once you've become accustomed to it. If you have imagination GTA (any GTA) can be enjoyable.I will discuss both GTAO and GTA V in each facet to help you determine whether this game is a heap of dog crap or a brilliant postmodern mockery of sandbox games. First of all GTAO has microtransactions and it is stupid. It goes against everything imaginable for a decent company like Rockstar to engage in this nonsense microtransactions are a nuisance and a micro economy of fake money injected into games using your real money. It is unscrupulous and unethical and I think this personally that it is a great albeit evil business model. GTAO might be preying on stupid casual or lazy players who suck at GTA are 12 and have mom's credit card or weary married too young males who work a lot and just buy their way to success in P2W games. Still endorsing a Dave and Buster's style microeconomy of optional pay walls to content is tantamount to encouraging it even if you plan to gain marginal sales on their Shark Cards (they made a lot of money actually).GTAO and singelplayer suffer from the same gameplay issues that every GTA eventually runs into GTAO makes up for lack of minigames and activities by always adding more content over time. As of yet singleplayer is dead due to no new content injection. A major change to the gameplay is the quality of graphics and the new viewpoint. The first person view adds immense icing on the cake of new graphical fidelity which puts the game far ahead of any competitor. Even when textures look like runny jpeg slosh the after effects and great breadth of options mean that even without texture modding the game will look fine for quite a while. GTA IV is still getting new leases on life because both games leave a lot of room for personal taste for modders to eventually exploit and manipulate to get more intensive graphics (yet to be seen but the game just came out). The lowest generation versions (PS3 and 360) were quite bad looking washy textures and terrible aliasing abounding but the games still had excellent visionary quality for that generation's horribly gimped graphical power. It's quite an achievement that even on low settings the game is functional functional is the least I can say for games since the last big sandbox games I played a lot Black Flag and Watchdogs were pretty... pretty . They were functional messes at their best and glitchy contorted eppileptic siezures at worst. GTA V on PC still has glitches (though I have had few pop in issues) and crashing but it's far more stable than many multi console port/mish mash games I've been uncomfortable playing.A major issue I have with these games that is GTA V's various versions is that as updates and content have been implemented there is a major difference between singleplayer and multiplayer driving/handling configurations. Cars go slow or faster depending on the patch and there's awful discrepencies even in Online alone between the lag you experience when I do normal missions in full servers on this PC version I rarely experience floating cars and pop in. Now in every Heist related mission there is lag pop in invisible cars and fgloating cars dropping in on me. Consistent with PS3 (my previous generation version) Rockstar expends a lot of energy issuing small one day patches that clear up exploits and glitches but not ones that functionally break the game! No! They focus on exploits and hacking related to people griefing or making money (taking away from their Shark Card revenue) or duplicating cars. This goes hand in hand with contentious still approaches to ""bad sports."" I have never even been fully on bad sport lobbies but I hate that you cannot avoid it. Accidental car destructiuon happens constantly. GTA IV had many of the greater qualities that made fan created multiplayer (especially SAMP) so much fun in other words we need to stop having draconian rules about personal vehicles. Implement a server list so people can implement rules like ""no cops"" or ""no personal vehicle insurance claims."" Being able to ban or give tanks to players outside of missions would be a plus more control of the lobby like free mode would make this game immensely better! GTA IV multiplayer was enjoyable yet I do not want to give up new ideas like persitant weapons or personal vehicles but insurance and whatnot is so superfluous and pointless that I cannot stand it. I get it Rockstar! Sticky bombing peoples cars in a game about robbery and murder is a bully behavior (from the guys who made a great game called BULLY). The soundtrack is excellent though a lot of wierdness comes from the ambient soundtrack. I just wish there was a seperate soundbar for just THAT ambient music. The roster of artists is very good varied large. One feature I wish would one day be added is updates with new music after launch... a pipedream I know but GTAO is being built on a longterm profit and update model. As for the sound effects they are superb. The game has a quality more like GTA IV where I don't hear a lot of the sam pedestrian dialogue but it also falls in line with an overly serious tone the game takes (no quotable dumb pedestrian lines).As for story and this is my final topic I can only be brief. There's many elements to the characterizations and the cast that makes the game a compelling GAME and not some cinematic experience. There are definitely moments where it goes over into that territory but often this is temporary and is pointed out. We are not given characters that fall down under examination or have no criticism from the world beyond police and an antagonist. There is self deprecation and there is deprecation from these characters' families and friends. As for the preachy left wing/right wing saoccer mom/social justice warrior critiques of this game's treatment of LGBT topics this game is incredibly fair and kind to everyone involved. Major themes critique the protaganists their society and the enemies that motivate the main characters. You're going to feel sorry for things you do. I don't know how this is any less a story about reluctant criminals than the previous in 3 it's forced revenge to deal with a romantic betrayal. In Vice City it's forced independence to escape your betrayers. In San Andreas it's forced everything by everyone often because of their crimes and weakness. GTA IV was about an immigrant dealing with America forced to flee his past. Now we have three protaganists fitting these previous games (Franklin and CJ Michael and Vercetti Trevor and Claude).In closing I give it a number out of a number.GTA is still hectic even if you don't like the HD era. It's a ing parody of its own meaningless plagiarized movie plots. Online is fine and good even when it disappoints... you'll still play it. And where's the co op R*??? WHERE?!",Grand Theft Auto V

Being able to drive with a controller and swap to a mouse and keyboard setup without touching a menu is genius. The game runs smooth as butter on a mid range system. With an i5 3570k 16GB and a 680 GTX I can pull 60 fps in mostly very high settings. Nary a stutter or pop up tree or building in sight. I spent 40 minutes just driving around obeying the traffic laws listening to Fernando give me his views on Feminism. I haven't heard the same repetitive crap from the NPC's that seems to plague other open world games what I like to call the ""arrow to the knee"" problem.

2015-04-20,0,0,41,False,Recommended,I haven't fully played a grand theft auto game since Vice city. My friends have been raving about Grand theft auto 5 and I was on the fence about it because I outgrew the game and wasn't my cup of tea anymore (I was wrong).I took a chance and bought it and wow I do not regret my purchase one bit! DThe world looks beautiful (granted if you have a decent pc rig to play it) the game mechanics are pretty fluid missions are creative and the story is fantastic! I was never really interested in the story much for the past GTA i've played but this one has gotten me hooked. The characters are very memorable and well developed you can easily connect with them at all times.I haven't ran into many bugs (yet) in the main story mode. The online experience so far is so so. The open world and missions that you do are pretty fun against other players. Although it gets really laggy and glitchy often whenever I play with some friends not sure why this happens but it does kill the mood a little bit. Overall though it's decent but if you're in it for just the online multiplayer portion then I would probably wait a little bit until things get fixed and optimized. Again that's just my experience I would do a little more research about online experiences from others before purchasing.Honestly with that little negative asside I could go on and on about how awesome this game is but that would turn this mini review into a book. If you don't mind the violence (lots of) swear words drugs etc...Then this is a game for you and a must buy D,Grand Theft Auto V

I have tried every thing listed on all forums and support pages to fix my issue but nothing works an open ticket from rockstar in an attempt to fix the issue as well but still my issue is not fixed. I can play the game for random amounts of time before the game simply crashes on 2 of my computers and its the same symptoms on both machines. The game running with settings changed from extreamly low to as high as you can set them to test the issue and it crashes no matter what setting even safe mode crashes. I doubt that this issue is something to do with my equipment and I am finished jumping through hoops for support teams with all the uninstall reinstall disable enable rollback restore none of it works. I am convinced that this issue will be corrected with a patch and now I will simply wait until they decide to start looking deeper into the issue on thier end instead of looking at my msinfo file and trying to correct it on my PC. I have over 500 games and this is the first one to have this issue with its persistant crashing I have yet to trouble shoot any other game as much as I have this one and the biggest bummer for me is that when I do get to play this game for the brief amount of time in which my PC works with it the game plays and looks absolutly amazing I have no other game in my library that can touch it. I am hoping they can find a fix in an upcoming patch to fix my issues with this game so that I can enjoy it but until then I will just enjoy listening to my friends and family I purchased the game for enjoy it and focus on thier positive experience with it.

2015-04-20,0,0,46,False,Recommended,What is there to say about this game? It's been around for a while so reviewing the game itself is probably unnecessary. The PC version is beautiful runs smoothly and plays just right. You can't go wrong with this well known entity and you can certainly get caught up in the controversy that surrounds this game but even if you focus entirely on the story based gameplay you won't regret the investment since you likely will get an easy 60 hours+ out of this game. I have not tried GTA Online so this recommendation doesn't even include the potential for entertainment which is included with that online version.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-31,0,0,106,False,Recommended,"Before you hack in this game hear my tale. I bought the game. Played the campaign for a while. I was a good man. Innocent. Then came online. Me and a buddy played missions together. We were dirt poor. My only car was a ruiner with tier one upgrades. Then one day a chrome rainbow lighted bus fell out of the sky. A man wearing gold rimmed sunglasses and white leggings covered in a luxurious fur coat stepped out of it. He took us and a few other players into the usually inaccessible FIB building. He whipped out a minigun that sprayed bags of money for all to enjoy. He filled our bank accounts to the brim and we flew around in the bus for a little while but after that he vanished. With our new supplies of cash from the friendly modder we bought top quality apartments juiced up sports cars and the most expensive outfits. We were living like kings. Then the money ran out. We tried to contact the wealthy gentleman from earlier but we couldn't find him. So we went to Youtube. We almost immediately found a flashy new mod menu. One that could give us powers like the stranger had. Within a day we had millions and every new car with all the best upgrades. We gave stacks of cash to noobs. We were gods. We even fought other malicious modders who wanted to ruin everyone else's experience. We had become greater than the saintlike flying bus driving stranger we had met so long ago. Things were great. Then came the ban wave. We had gotten so used to the laissez faire nearly completely non existent anti cheat that when I logged on to see a ""Banned for two weeks"" message I was stunned. No problem I thought. When the ban lifted there was already a new injection based modding method released. We went back to business. Bought the new yacht and all the latest sports cars. And then another ban wave. This time it was for a month. After a while I was inevitably permabanned. I bought another account. The cycle continued. Recently I got my friend's account which I had been borrowing banned. Rockstar wiped all of his characters. Completely reset his account. He was extremely at me. I now have to get him back all of his the hard way. Just because I wanted to be like the charming modder who stepped off the silver bus that one faithful day. Learn from me. Don't hack Grand Theft Auto V.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,1,1,594,False,Recommended,GTA 5 is simply a masterpiece presented by Rockstar to the gaming industry. The graphics are simply immaculate the ragdoll physics is almost fullly realistic no more strong pushovers to pedestrians like in GTA 4. The story although it has certain elements from various movies is still adrenaline pumping and the revoked combat system makes the spine chill. The vehicles are love and unlike GTA 4 the handling of the vehicles is realistic. The damage physics is also like in real life as tyres get bust after drifting. The activities (Hobbies and Pastimes as its called) are interesting and stress relieving. The sky and sea floor are quite detailed and convincing enough and the first person view is cool as the head rotates according to the situation. The director mode is fun if you're not interested in doing any mission or playing with any of the protagonists (sorry console peasants). #PCMASTERRACEThough I did not like quite a few things in the game. The AI is worse than GTA 4 especially the cops who kill anyone instead of arresting them. If you want to gain unwanted attention the quickest this game's perfect for you as the cops can smell you from anywhere if committed a crime like ANYWHERE. The traffic AI is also poor though this reflects the real life attitude of Los Angeles's citizens while driving. Overall I rate this game 10/10. Definatley recomended for anyone. Great.,Grand Theft Auto V

Not much to keep you playing after you beat the single player game as there hasn't been any new content released. The grind on GTA Online is terrible. It's way too hard to earn enough cash to buy all the cool they keep releasing leading to the next negative point. Shark cards are the devil. All the good new vehicles online are so costly that it's almost as if they've made the grind so awful that people will want to purchase their Shark Cash cards. Take Two/Rockstar seem to not be fans of singleplayer modding. In short buy this game if you really want it but dont waste your money on cash cards otherwise they'll continue to try to milk as much out of you as they can.,Grand Theft Auto V

Tons of online modes and much progress in the way of ridding the game of hackers which was a problem which came up quite often early on.

2015-04-16,0,0,42,False,Recommended,Runs at a consistent 60 fps with very high textures using my 4gb 770 gtx and an i7 4770k at 1080p. I was a little worried that the PC port would run poorly even on modern hardware like GTA IV but it seems to be very smooth considering it is a port. The settings claim to require 2300mb of vram so I'd imagine having a graphics card with only 2gb of vram won't be able to run this at max settings simply because of a vram bottleneck. Invest in a 3gb+ graphics card or settle for slightly less than max settings. The game is beautiful at high resolution and high fps. This is a much better experience than my original playthrough on the xbox 360 when it was first released.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-25,0,0,406,False,Recommended,Yes,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-25,1,1,1111,False,Recommended,SIngle Player Good story. Probably kinda underwhelming compared to previous games but it's not bad pretty entertaining and has some variety. The world itself is fantastic detailed and was made with a level of attention that's usually unseen and it's probably one of the most convincing open world games that I have played. It's almost impossible to see everything that the city has to offer. Anyways to keep it short ok story but fun with an amazing world to explore. Could be a little longer tho maybe. Also special mention to the cast of the game because the actors did a really good job portraying the in game characters.Multiplayer It's a mixed bag. I haven't had issues as other players but as any online game with plenty of people the griefing cheaters and kids screaming on mics is to be expected. But...if you get some friends to play it's truly a way way better experience specially for heists and other activities. Racing is fun (for me at least) there are some modes that are quite entertaining and earning money is not as hard as some people think if you play the weekly 2X Money and RP activities you can earn a lot of cash in a couple of hours. Lots of customization also from vehicles to the character.Also I have fun also just driving and doing dumb stuff on the world trust me that's also a pretty fun way to enjoy the game rather than playing exclusively missions. The constant updates are also decent because they kinda help to keep the game getting stale.TL DR A pretty decent game overall with plenty of replayability but mostly better with friends if you wanna play online.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-25,0,0,366,False,Recommended,Very addicting game. Fun with friends and alone as well if you look around there are many things to do. Yes there are lots of modders but some are bearable.

2015-11-14,1,1,839,False,Recommended,The only way I can state this is that Grand Theft Auto 5 is a brilliant game. Massive open world ready to be explored containing countless locations to have enjoyable and exciting firefights the new freemode update takes full advantage of these locations by adding games like King of the Castle and Hot Property where players can hide out in buildings perfect for a shootout. The amount of detail in the vast open world is amazing especially the dynamic props (because face it no one would get anywhere if you couldn't drive through signs). Many ways to obtain money not just in missions. The ability to attain cash just by having fun in freemode makes it a much more enjoyable game than if you had not been able to. Rob stores take out bounty targets or just stab the guy that just used the ATM. All these factors make both singleplayer and multiplayer great ways to spend a few hours.I've seen lots of people complain about the amount of hackers and glitchers in public lobbies as well as those who drive around killing people randomly. I admit that sometimes I go on an airstrike killing spree in my Hydra but that's once every two weeks or so. Most lobbies I go in the kill feed is almost empty and the only players I see getting killed are those taking part in a freemode event or just a few friends having a gun fight. And while a lot of people say that there is a ton of hacking in the game I see less hacking in GTA V than there is crime in real life Los Angeles and if you think there is indeed too much hacking you can still play in private sessions or singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V

I'm not someone who enjoys shooters and super violent games that much but this game was too brilliant to pass up. There's a huge open world with tons of things to do all the protagonists are very likable and constant action. I have yet to touch into the realm of online play but I'm sure I won't be disappointed the offline mode is pretty worth the buy anyway. Also it has some great humor.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-27,0,0,1019,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V the GOAT!I've been playing GTA nearly every single day since it was released back in 2013.I started playing it on my old but gold XBox 360 which was obviously overstrained by the high requirements that the game demands. However I didn't really care about low resolution all I wanted was playing GTA V.Then when it was eventually released on Steam I instantly spent the full amount of $59.99.At this point I was extremely hyped cause it was indeed an upgrade from 360 resolution to full hd.Believe it or nah this particular hype is still existent. As I mentioned earlier I nearly play this game every single day and it's great that Rockstar keep on working on GTA Online constantly to deliver us fresh new content at no charge totally awesome!In the end I can certainly say that I definitely recommend GTA V to everyone out there even to those who have never been into any GTA. Just give it a shot I bet you won't regret it.*EDIT*There's recently been a lot of negative reviews since mods got banned from GTA 5.I don't like this decision either however it was probably made for a good reason so just accept it and stop hating obviously the game didn't make that decision.*Have fun doing crazy stuff with your friends in Los Santos and surroundings Josh,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-19,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,"Thought it was great at the start although over time it became very clear that it was a MASSIVE cash grab. Playing online everything costs an extreme ammount in comparisson to the ammount you can earn. Queue Shark cards. This game is designed from the ground up to make you want stuff you can't ever afford it would take hundreds of hours of grinding gameplay in order to buy a yacht for example. By the time you've made the money? Theres a new chain of missions which require you to buy a certain type of building. Fun times get grinding again peasent. Or just give rockstar 30 and get your cruddy building ""Fun"" right?This all in all was tolerable. As much as I hated it I just bought sharkcards and had fun it. But then the rogue ban robot happened thousands upon thousands of players got permenenetly banned 3 of which were firends of mine that I regularly played with. The only difference between me and them? I bought shark cards they did not. I'm 99.9% convinced that they would not have been ""accidentally"" banned had they been pumping money into Rockstars pocket like so many of us do. Upon asking support for evidence of an offence one friend was actually insulted and had the phone put down on him Good job Rockstar support! Top marks there. Everywhere you go online you say you are wrongfully banned and you are told you are lying. Well I'm not banned but my friend was and he's not a cheater Rockstar know he's not a cheater but they probably just expected him to re buy the game and start again. Guess that's punishment for not buying shark cards right?!I've not played GTA O since this. Not one bit and now.. the great news that they are completely killing the modding community which will make the game no fun for me in singleplayer either. Good job guys you managed to make the best game ever into something so so terrible.TL DR Rockstar will ban your friends kill the game for you then insult you on the phone.

2017-06-16,0,0,48,False,Not Recommended,"Edit The devs have tried their best to backpedal but the damage has been done already and the community's view of the company has worsened. The review will stay negative because there are major gameplay flaws with the game The worst problem with the game is that there is little to do You can play missions around with friends blowing things up while chasing each other and then do heists. The game becomes a grinding simulator for one vehicle that is a 5mph increase over the last. Racing is just a roll of the dice to see whether you'll get an to knock you off the track screwing up any chance at a win. Combat doesn't feel heavy enough it's too floaty and unbalanced. You don't feel challenged fighting players it's just a matter of who hits the other player with an RPG first. There just isn't anything to do after the first dozen or so hours.I'll keep this here so people understand what happened.Devs claim to support mods then threaten mod makers with legal action a year later. Nice t you just pulled there Rockstar &amp Take Two rethink your position as a game company.If you really wanted the community to be happy you wouldn't target a harmless modding platform. Your method of thinking follows as such ""people own metal we love metal workers! terrorists exist oh no terrorists use solids so ban all solid objects everywhere!""

2015-05-01,0,0,242,False,Recommended,The game is great wonderful storyline to it with a great 3 characters to play as and since it is released for PC you can play with mods which make the game even more exciting and intense. The only main big issue to me is the intense lag spikes. I have a decent computer that can run more than the minimum requirements says on Steam I am able to run on High and Ultra but for some reason after 30 to 40 minutes of playing in game I start to experience small lag spikes that become stronger and stronger as I keep playing and about a minute after the lag spikes started I get about 1 FPS and it doesn't change unless I restart my GTA and play again this kind of issue really bothers me and is a flaw to any kind of game that has this. I have heard from my friends that some of them do not have the same issue as I do so I am quite curious if any other of you guys out there have the same issue as me because I really experience great discomfort and cannot play the game anymore and just wish that I can play without any lag. Is my graphics card the problem or is there some sort of bug/glitch in the game which causes lag for no reason. Someone please explain but over all the gameplay would be an 8/10 but after 40 minutes 2/10. This game still gets a positive but I will not play this game anymore if Rockstar does not fix this issue.

2016-04-15,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,"Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary secondary latent and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm painless non itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or . In latent syphilis which can last for years there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non cancerous growths) neurological or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as ""the great imitator"" as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.Syphilis is most commonly spread through sexual activity.It may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth resulting in congenital syphilis Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue) pinta (subspecies carateum) and bejel (subspecies endemicum).Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.The risk of syphilis can be decreased by latex condom use or not having sex. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics. The preferred antibiotic for most cases is benzathine penicillin G injected into a muscle. In those who have a severe penicillin allergy doxycycline or tetracycline may be used. In those with neurosyphilis intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever headache and muscle pains a reaction known as Jarisch Herxheimer.In 2012 about 0.5% of adults were infected with syphilis with 6 million new cases. During 2010 it caused about 113 000 deaths down from 202 000 in 1990. After decreasing dramatically with the availability of penicillin in the 1940s rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries often in combination with human immunodeficiency virus This is believed to be partly due to increased promiscuity prostitution decreasing use of condoms and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men.In 2015 Cuba became the first country in the world to eliminate mother to child transmission of syphilis.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-05,0,0,828,False,Recommended,The story is great but online has so much grinding and microstransaction incentives that it will leave you amazed that this isn't an EA game. It can take you hours to earn what can be lost within short periods of time. Also the modders are the worst. Usually they terrorize the server instead of being creative or generous with their mods. The microtransactions cost too much so you may as well just mod it for you and your friends but rockstar usually bans you or at the least removes all or most your wealth and levels. The CEO feature is far too expensive and annoying with 15minute cooldowns for missions that don't pay that well given the huge cooldown and army of A Holes who will probably stop you with ease with the laggy servers and overpowered vehicles combined. Missions that reward well are purposely rigged to be harder than they should be causing you to become frustrated to the point that it can ruin friendships and cause many rage quits. Also boredom is a huge part of this game. You will find that you will either stop playing because of rage or boredeom or both no matter who you are. The Motorcycle club feature is cool for the president who can afford to make it cool but sucks for anyone else. It takes hours of resupplies just so that you can attempt to make money off all your invested time and money. To add more insult many of the motorcycle businesses are very rigged in favor of Rockstar's greed. Resupply costs a fee more than the product is worth leaving you with the only option of stealing it everytime. Stealing it would be fine except there's either no reward or barely any reward for doing it and it takes several resupplies just to barely make any product. MC businesses cost an arm and a leg and take forever to do anything even when fully upgraded and fully supplied unless you can somehow maintain a full motorcycle club for an extended period of time such as many hours. Also if your business gets too much product the game will probably just take it all away from you making those 15 to 25 resupply runs you did probably by yourself a total waste of your time. Heists are terrible as they take too long and are too easy to fail. The only way to even do all the heist challenges is to basically cheat by using a combo of karuma miniguns food and bodyarmor. Even if you do well at mowing down the ridiculous number of enemies that stand in your way there's still a good chance you'll fail as there's a high likelyhood that as your rushing through that an enemy will spawn in directly in front of you or another heist group memeber with a shotgun leading to an instant death even with full body armor maxed stats bulletproof helmet and full health. Races with custom vehicles lack any form of balancing leaving you with the only choice of buying and customizing all of the best cars for each class of vehicle so that you can stand a chance at winning the race. Although it's nearly impossible to have a fully customized vehicle for each vehicle class since they cost a lot and require a high level and several challenges to be completed which a NOOB will be unable to complete considering how the game is now unless they were to cheat with mods or microtransactions. Also it's worth noting that this game is actually quite old now and still has more bugs than anyone could ever count. The bugs would be easy to overlook if it wasn't for the fact that these bugs can lead to situations where you buy a multi million dollar vehicle only to have the game or servers go down leading to the money being taken from your account but the vehicle not saving to your account. Some gltiches are simple like going in Motorcycle clubhouse only to have it crash leading to over 5 minutes of waiting until you can get back to where you were that is if that session is still even available for you... Also it's worth noting that MC presidents must pay a recurring staff fee that can easily be 9000 per business per game cycle which further hurts your MC business' profits. Also the best vehicles in the game cost way too much. To get a a karuma insurgent hydra savage and sports car it will be well over $10M which can take centuries to afford without microstransactions prior wealth modding or other forms of cheating. Also it's worth noting that the controls are mostly garbage as key binding and controller bindings will often feel awkward to use. Examples include selecting your weapon while in any vehicle(especially any motorcycle in the game) swimming flying while shooting and anything to do with the phone ringing or pulling up the camera. Also you might have serious issues with the microphone working since mine hasn't worked since I had this on Xbox 360 and that includes just hearing them talking as well as you talking. The online aslo feels lacking as many story features are not included such as wildlife road construction random police chases with npcs random small events and radar detection police. Also the online has the worst story telling. If it wasn't for the story mode you'd be left feeling like this game had no effort put into the online's story as you will hate any and all dialogue in the online even if it's your first time hearing the dialogue and not the thousandth time. Many of the most expensive items in the game are simply not worth even a fraction of the cost leaving you with yet another incentive to cheat. Then there's Benny's new car cutomizations. A feature that was supposed to be there from the start but was missing due to corporate greed and laziness so it got added later. Once it was added it featured 0 fast vehicles and basically no vehicles for you to truly love using for practical purposes. Later they finally aded some Benny vehicles worth liking but keep in mind benny customizations make the vehicle cost two or three times what it would've costed without it. People are not kind and are as opertunistic as humanly possible in the online leaving you hating everyone the second you join a server. In fact when you play as the MC president you can turn friendly fire off and you'll still find that without their being any easy way for other MC memebr to kill you they'll still find plenty of ways to annoy you as much as they can. So in the end this games best part is the graphics and worst part is all the waiting and annoying BS that is caused by people who either play or created this game. If graphics are the best part then that's kind of in line with IRL where nature tends to be the only thing that is pretty and innocent while man's creations are often hideous and destructive usually in the name of greed. Worst of all about the online is how it really is constantly tricking and manipulating you into thinking your going to make a lot of money only to find that it usually takes away your time and money. If you play this with random online people expect that they will not cooperate with the objective or you as they just continuously do whatever they feel like whenever they feel like it. Hard to blame them when any and all objectives that are more proftible than fun will make you want to rebel against the game's system and players. It really is the world most accurate depiction and simulation of California featuring many of your favorite and least favorite places stereotypes and general look. I would say that it's terible to have people yelling at the NPC's in this game except they really are just as stupid and annoying as actual Californians. Best part is how full of itself the entire game company state of California are. It just works. Except when the game isn't working because of the latest update causing you to reinstall it only to have it not work again leaving you to wait for a future update. Last but not least DO NOT USE THIS GAMES DEFAULT GRAPHICS. Whatver system you have it will not be setup properly at all not even close. Also Framerate dips to mid 30's even on the best systems with moderate graphic settings so expect performance to be quite random.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-19,0,0,581,False,Not Recommended,This game was great fantastic actually when it was out on the console and I was so excited to get it for my PC to play with my friends once I left the console community. The story mode is great fun filled with many missions and the classic GTA style killings and such but the three main character was an interesting change of pace. I do like the heists in the story mode which was another great addition. Overall the single player is fun but not worth the sixty dollars. What most people wanted from this game was the multiplayer experience and this is why I do not recommend this game.Multiplayer is complete trash. The server system is crap from there being no server browser (which is really annoying when the game throws you into a server halfway across the world making you have 3516 ping) to playing with friends and having them or you drop out for no apparent reason having to join back with no problem. The jobs are very repetitive and boring for they have not added any new missions to the game besides player made which are normally some weird objective just to gain max money and experience. Then there is the hackers or scripters or whatever they do to mod the game. This completely ruins multiplayer the free roam that used to be so fun with the crazy shootouts and car cases that has turned into players fleeing servers from this moders because they steal your weapons kill everyone in the server under a different player's name go into god mode and teleport to players and murder them left and right changing their bullets to explosive rounds destroying everyone's cars instantly or spawning in swat police with tasers that will tase you over and over again not being able to move. Then there are some that like to spawn in millions of millions of GTA$ defeating the purpose of doing those jobs and missions and heists that are in the game giving no value of buying the extremely expensive weapons and cars that many of us have gotten before this nonsense. I cannot play multiplayer anymore with my friends because they all have stopped playing due to this and there is not much point in playing anymore for me. I know many people wanted to get GTA to mod and I do not care if one mods in single player or even if Rockstar made mod servers which could easily be done if they added a server browser but now as is it is ridiculous trying to play this game. It is not fun anymore and if you planned to spend money on this game for the multiplayer and not hack/mod it is not worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-14,0,0,299,False,Not Recommended,Update There has been a minor update to OpenIV. We still haven't heard from Take Two yet though so I'm not updating my review until I'm sure they weren't just allowing a token update while the sale is on before they force the OpenIV team to remove all useful functionality.There isn't any decent GTA left anymore. Endless releases of horrendously overpriced stuff designed to 1. cost loads of money and get players to buy shark cards and 2. get players to kill each other more (which friendly reminder EVERY DEATH costs you money in GTA O even if all your money is in the bank) using more and more expensive ammo and paying insurance payments on expensive vehicles needing to buy shark cards.Add to that that they just killed OpenIV to try and drive players who were having a good time with nothing other than the $60 they paid for the base game and I'm finally uninstalling this crap.Really at this point just wait for GTA VI. It's not worth $60 anymore and you'll just get suckered in to buying virtual dollars on virtual ammo.Update I see they've issued a cease and desist for a cheating tool Force Hax. This is telling. If their priority was to hit cheating they would have pursued that first. Instead they went after a tool that specifically is designed for single player modding to chase off the fun for people who were still enjoying the game without paying for shark cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-26,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto. The most anticipated videogame I wanted to buy when I first got a computer. However I was quickly proved wrong about my anticipation. The online part of the videogame is short of what it promises to be with hackers glitches and all around a bad community. This made me focus on the singleplayer part of the game.Heists are very intense and captivating in GTA V as they are planned to the slightest detail. Travelling in the game is very cool as you can use JetSkis cars boats planes trains quad bikes motorbikes BMXs and many more modded in items. However you are not able to customize and save the cars that you customized.Out of 10 I would give this game around a 7. High potential well executed gameplay and a dedicated team of developers. If you are intending to buy this game to mess around in with friends I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO YOU. This game is crazy fun especially with mods. However BE CAREFUL NOT TO USE MODS ONLINE OR FACE A GAME BAN.

2017-02-06,0,0,204,False,Not Recommended,"(Summary at the end) This game is fun. It's been one of the most popular games on Steam for years and for good reason. But after actually playing through it the game gets really boring.The story is great. The transitions between characters is a little choppy at times but it still leads to a unique gameplay experience and a decent narrative. But after finishing the story there isn't much to do except go online and quite frankly the online mode sucks.In order to unlock about 75 95% of the game you must go to online mode. Dozens of weapons vehicles properties heists etc. are only available there. But transitioning into GTA Online is the biggest pain in the I've ever seen in a game. Right off the bat they ram you with stupid quests that prevent you from achieving the main thing that every GTA player wants Robbing banks getting cool cars and murdering players and NPCs. And if you skip through all the stupid quests then you'll have no idea what to do as random players shouting the n word run you over and mow you down with an Uzi. However if you do listen to the tutorials then they'll plunge you into the maddening mess that is the economic system. The economic system has the potential to be amazing Go on a heist use the money to buy a cool apartment start a company and do whatever the hell you want. But instead of being able to do this they put a bunch of obstacles in the way between you and that heist forcing you to slug your way through their races and survival modes and Adversary modes until you reach level 12.One of the worst parts about this is that they hype up level 12 to be awesome. They say you can unlock heists from there and they will lead you to believe that once you get there everything launches from there. But no it really doesn't. You still can't start your own heist until you own property and you can't buy property unless you join someone else's heist. Other people's heists are always available from a convienient app on your phone but as soon as you join one people will see your level 12 or below stats and think ""Ew I don't wanna play with that noob"" and quit. And as soon as someone quits during a mission it's over. You can't do any more. Not a single person at Rockstar has thought ""Maybe we should put a bot in their place or something"" like Valve does. The incompetence of other players and Rockstar developers makes it virtually impossible to get started in their potentially amazing game. Say you got lucky You joined a crew or a company and they provide a steady source of income for you so you can FINALLY get on your feet. The only downside being that you'll have to deal with the toxic GTA community which is composed of whiny nine year olds and creepy middle aged men with anger issues. (Sounds like the main characters of the game!) Naturally you're going to be better than a nine year old and you end up obliterating them when they try to gank you. Then being the entitled little crap that they are they're going to report you for hacking or greifing. And as soon as someone reports you you're banned from GTA Online. Now you're stuck with just the story mode which has as I said less than 25% of the actual content. Rockstar doesn't bother fact checking that you're cheating they just ban you. Their strict policies have made the extremely unlikely the impossible. Congratulations. And after playing on a few servers dozens of people have impossibly high stats all guns and a crapload of money on their third hour of playing yet they're not banned!And as if this headache weren't bad enough it's still sixty frickin' bucks. This 4 year old pay to play infuriating game is still sixty dollars. By the time Skyrim was four years old it was around twenty and Skyrim has WAY more replayability than GTA (Especially on PC). I get it they add new vehicles and guns and gamemodes a lot. But as I said before almost none of it is accessible! Sure the Tron bikes are awesome but you're not getting it without either another $600 to spend on the game a really high level friend or a cheat menu and a LOT of luck. Pros Good story lots of contentCons Toxic community awful economic system annoying quests crappy ban policyI see a few solutions to make the game infinitely better. A Update your ban policy. Remove the banning due to modding make it completely based upon whether or not you're ruining the game experience for others. Like griefing.B Remove the stupid level restrictions. Make it so you can start a heist at any level. C Add bots to heists.D Make an offline mode with all the customization features of online. I'm sick of playing as Franklin I wanna make my own character offline.E Quit making money grinding mandatory. It's so stupid and it usually ends with banning.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-25,0,0,183,False,Not Recommended,This is for single player only as I don't care for a cheater infested online 'experience' While certainly the best looking GTA ever (the colors are absolutely spot on) featuring a huge map heists Trevor (thx commenter) being the best GTA character ever still in the end I cannot fully recommend it and the so so story with the highly unlikely and incredulous partnership between the three main characters is not the reason why.So why not? In GTA IV one of my favorite activities was creating and watching chain reaction explosions by getting my vehicle on fire and planting it in rows of traffic waiting for the light to turn green. It was always alot of fun to watch the result without having to worry about getting relentlessly hunted by an ever increasing barrage of cops. In vanilla GTA V I've not once been able to do this. I had an elaborate idea of blocking off a crossroad with several trucks and rig them to blow but as soon as I exited the vehicle and tried to do the same on the other sides the truck simply vanished and traffic resumed as normal. I tried several other things in this way but the same thing whatever I would try to set up it would disappear. For a sandbox game supposedly offering freedom that is rather limiting. The traffic in general also seems to more rigidly (or more obviously) than ever follow a predetermined pathway. The in game mini games such as tennis and golf also aren't worked out well enough to hold interest for very long. The heists are also limited as you still cannot enter or rob just about any store you set your eyes on only some of them which is another limitation. As it stands the vanilla single player game pretty much begs to be modded in order to get the most out of it because in its original state it feels too much like an elastic shape that will immediately spring back into its original form after being pushed or deformed by you the bothersome player.,Grand Theft Auto V

Franklin Micheal and Trevor. All their story arcs seem half finished as if there was supposed to be more content to fill things out but it was either removed or not put in. Micheal's character seems to be the only one with some real meat all the way through. Franklin seems to be there more so as filler between Micheal and Trevor's antics and fighting. Trevor's sole purpose seems to be shock value or for laughs. I'm not sure which 100% as neither are executed very well.Mechanics wise. The game plays like any other in the series after GTA 3. The main focus this time around is the 'Heists'. Some are interesting but how the story is executed into enabling these heists is rough. It also feels like you never get a solid reward that makes doing these Heists worthwhile other than moving the lackluster story forward.One thing I have to note it is a pain in the to make money. I have no idea if this is due to the Online component being the way to make funds or what but only by completing the Union Depository Heist at the end of the game do you have any real funds for vehicles aircraft boats modding building purchases etc.The radio doesn't capture the quality or amusement that it did in previous games which is a bit of a let down. This comes down to personal preferences though. So take that with a grain of salt. It is possible to import and play your own songs through the radio but I experienced performance drops any time I tuned to that station. All in all I don't see the big deal people have made over this. It's not worth the $60 $70 they were asking initially in my opinion.Even if you are a fan of the series I would recommend waiting till you catch it at a reduced price and on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V

It's unclear what exactly about it has changed to abide by the rules outlined by Rockstar and Take Two below but this appears to be a positive move for the modding community.Original Story The recent legal shutdown of Grand Theft Auto V mod tool OpenIV angered fans to say the least. Developer Rockstar Games has now released a new statement addressing its stance on mods and while there is some good news it still likely isn't what many people are hoping for.In a post on its website Rockstar reveals that it's spoken with its parent company Take Two and convinced it to avoid pursuing legal action against certain types of mods. ""Rockstar Games believes in reasonable fan creativity and in particular wants creators to showcase their passion for our games "" the statement reads. ""After discussions with Take Two Take Two has agreed that it generally will not take legal action against third party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single player non commercial and respect the intellectual property (IP) rights of third parties.""No Caption ProvidedThere are of course other restrictions as well ""This does not apply to (i) multiplayer or online services (ii) tools files libraries or functions that could be used to impact multiplayer or online services or (iii) use or importation of other IP (including other Rockstar IP) in the project "" the statement continues. ""This is not a license and it does not constitute endorsement approval or authorization of any third party project. Take Two reserves the right to object to any third party project or to revise revoke and/or withdraw this statement at any time in their own discretion. This statement does not constitute a waiver of any rights that Take Two may have with respect to third party projects.""All of this started when Take Two issued a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV which is a tool that is used to power numerous GTA V mods. Take Two and Rockstar subsequently explained that this wasn't intended to specifically target single player mods and that ""malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody"" were the real problem. The companies also said they were investigating how to ""continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players."" Despite this there was an outcry from fans who sunk the game's average user review score on Steam. Additionally a petition calling for OpenIV to be left alone has attracted nearly 77 000 signatures as of this writing.Today's statement doesn't totally clarify what the future of GTA V mods looks like. OpenIV would seemingly still be disallowed by these rules despite not directly targeting GTA Online. Rockstar told Motherboard that it's spoken with OpenIV's developer about allowing it to continue but at this point it remains unclear where things go from here. Gamespot",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-05,2,1,1407,False,Recommended,"GTA V is two games in one A single player game with a storyline and GTA online named so for reasons one may assume to be obvious. As such this review will mainly focus on the online as that is what I have mostly played and why I purchased it. With that said there are obvious similarities in it and many of the things I will mention apply to both.In Grand Theft Auto you mainly start the game small Whether homeless or with just a small house there is very little you can lose. And from there you begin your adventure in crime and moneymaking. With what appears to be an anarchocapitalist society filled with well made backstory and world complete with multiple full series of cartoons mock TV channels(Better than real TV!) and radio stations. There is an internet ingame with plenty of often humour filled websites along with useful ones that you will find to be genuinely interesting on their own.In short The worldbuilding is top quality there is a lot of effort and attention in it and it shows that it was a great priority when it was madeIn contrast the controls are not very well thought through. Aside from the car and boat controls they are very clunky and questionable with movement being difficult to get right and taking cover means you will stick to the wall too long when you want to get going to other cover and you will not stick to cover when you actually want to stay in it. I've found the movement and cover to be questionable at best. Switching weapon is a massive pain and will generally not be viable unless you are not actively in combat. For airplanes and helicopters there is no joystick support at all.Following what they did right with vehicles is the damage model for cars. As may be expected from a GTA game the cars can be damaged destroyed and otherwise have their function impeded. Though it isn't massively realistic it is good enough to give you natural damage effects such as veering to the left or right or the engine beginning to break and give less power. It is then a shame that this will almost never show up in multiplayer unless you are a terrible driver because a thing that they clearly did not think about for the multiplayerNamely the balance. Everyone gets a homing rocket launcher no matter their level. This rocket launcher will destroy most cars in one hit and blows anything flying out of the air with a little aim and luck. This means that while you can put armour on your car to protect it from bullets your vehicle's function is more along the lines of ""Has it exploded? Yes or no"" than anything else. Similar for non vehicle pvp. You will be either dead in seconds or your enemy is dead no long firefights with players here. Pvp modes are a bit better but still often feel unfair. Much like this the rest of the online balance is out the window with many things costing a large amount of money and income being generally very low even for things with several millions of input needed to set them up. If you want anything more than just a gun and a random car you can still from the street you are going to have to actively grind for money or play for a very long time without spending on anything.The loading and in general connecting to the online servers for a first time in a session(Or when switching session) takes a truly massive amount of time though I have been told it is much less in single player I will still say it is unreasonably long You can go do the dishes and return in time to catch the end of the loading screen. Something I know because I've done that. I have no idea how they thought this was acceptable.With that said the rest of it is mostly good Sound and looks are pretty decent the map seems very nicely made with lots of interesting details and plenty of hidden spots. Someone seems to have thought about everything on the mapIn the end what really sells GTA isn't the pvp and fighting other people online. What is good about it is the single player the missions and the world. For online the one thing that is much more interesting than any of the official selling points is the fact that it is a world you can hop into with your friends and drive around together do a few missions or just decide to take everyone on a race go parachuting or even just play a round of golf. There may not be a real grouping up mechanic and there are a large amount of flaws in multiplayer but as just a world for you and your friends to hang out in and do whatever you want to do it does incredibly well.Worth full price? It's a rare moment when I say it is for something this expensive. But I certainly got my money worth and do not regret it. It has a fair amount of technical issues with it but the design is great for many things and there is almost always something to do So I would say it is.",Grand Theft Auto V

The online is pretty much ""ok"" except the fact that its a little bit empty (content). I mean yes there are alot of things to do but at the same time there is nothing to do. Its hard to explain but it feels like it has so much potencial in it but R* focused on wrong things. Yes there are great addons like Heists and Low Rider storyline but the other ""global"" addons like CEO and recent Bunker update they are cool to play in co op but you have to play it in open session versus other players and thats where its getting ed up.

GTA Online pushes players to buy shark cards. Servers relies on player s connection speeds. VOIP is intrusive no matter where you are you will hear others talk.The game itself doesn t need much work single player is great Rockstar on the other hand are neglecting this gaming platform are treating PC gamers exactly like console players even though we have different needs and problems. Rockstar has not paid for any server and instead use a system were players host and maintain the server this may save Rockstar piles of cash but in return glitchy and laggy gameplay is not uncommon. Due to this the scripters roam wild and with the lack of a decent anti cheat these scripters are everywhere. I also feel like Rockstar is forcing users to play the game much like an MMO in which you have to grind heists over and over again to get some cash or you can just buy some sharp cards to save you 10 hours of your time.CONCLUSION If you were hoping to reminisce in the old San Andreas days filled with jet packs fast cars and fun community servers forget it. The game can still be quite fun and supply you with hours of explosive fun but maybe wait until for another year maybe by that time they would have implemented some of the core fixes that the game desperately needed.,Grand Theft Auto V

Although the ending left me feeling they either ran out of ideas or had deadlines creeping up as the ending seems to rush things and attempt a conclusion with a lot of unexplained caveats. The gameplay is a lot more accessible than previous games and the rather unrealistic arcadey vehicle handling offers some ridiculously fun driving experiences.But if you've got buddies to play with the game's biggest pull is its online section. Though often criticized for poor UI and money making schemes similar to free to play games there's seemingly no end to things to do in the game. There's co op missions races deathmatches and various other gamemodes to partake in some of which are even completely original ways to play in the form of adversary modes.

2017-03-02,0,0,449,False,Not Recommended,This game is a Hacker Fest. There are very few times when online there wasn't someone ruining the game in some way for the others. I have no idea if Reporting people has any affect you'll never know and trying to kick people is pretty pointless. You end up spending hours just trying to find an instance with decent people who your pretty sure aren't hacking. This has nothing to do with the obnoxious people because sometimes having the free for all battle is great fun. Until someone starts spawning random objects or all of your guns are suddenly inaccessible or you watch someone teleporting across the world or they are level 23 but have millions in equipment and somehow have every weapon in the game. You can't access some of the neat content without being in the open area but inevitably several $$hats join the server and there goes the neighborhood. It doesn't even make sense since once you give yourself unlimited funds... the game becomes pointless... hence they get bored and just mess with everyone else. One can only hope that they simply lose interest in the game quickly and go hurt back to whatever meandering pointless existance they spawn from. Thats polite right?,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-30,0,0,2335,False,Recommended,"So ! after 515 hours (665 now) of game (192hrs in the offline mode) i feel like i can give a solid review of my experience on this game.My opinion about the Grand Theft Auto Online is based IN A SOUTH AMERICAN point of view which in my point of view is pretty different from north american/european have been experiecing.About the Offline campaign Its amaizing ! It's just awsome ! can't say its perfect it has its issues but the game itself is great !Story 9/10Graphics 10/10 considering that it is a huge open world with an especial compliment for the lighting effects.Sound 10/10 Driving 8/10 Don't get me wrong the driving is nice and the phisics are good in the game but the aceleration breaking topspeed traction of the tires are unrealistic phisics are good but its poorly tuned.Side Missions/stories 10/10Openworld in general 10/10 So many things to do such a rich and beautiful landscapes countless random events filling the game with life.For these alone i'd already recomend the game i did not play it on the last gen and didn't get it JUST for the online part as many people did.GTA ONLINESomethings first i have a 100 mbits fiber optics connection with Gigabit class routers/switches connecting the devices here at home. even though i have notebooks connectec with 300mbs 802.11ac wireless network (which is not slow at all) the experiencie that i'm about to describe is on my cable connected desktop. HUGE connection issues can't remember how many times i went ""connection time out"" trying to get in an online session. Countless times im thrown in a session all alone. I'm live in south america and already played with people from Russia and China can you even imagine the latency ? things were just randomly teleporting all around the game is a little stupid when choosing a session to put you in... The game itself becomes a sea of bugs. Teleporting things and people becomes something usual. Countless i tried a heist and someone couldnt load couldnt open the game menu the game HUD didn't load only able to choose weapons inside cars and the only ""solution""(only way to quit the heist) for that is going to the Social Club menu and change characters so im thrown out of the room...EDITED Latly most of the issues described here doesnt happen anymore i've been experiencing better connetions no more ""time out"" screens and the only thing still happening is the time when someone won't load on a heist mission and we get stuck there but i can easily blame someone else connectivity issues for that.About the Rockstar Suport Downloaded the iFruit app to custom change the license plate of my cars my most expensive fully upgraded car just vanished. EDITED Got an awnser in about 1 day got the refund for the car and upgrades added tumbs up for that.BAD THINGS (in my opinion) Gang attacks are pointless pays too little for the effort Bounty on players are limited to 10k for that little money people wont really go after anyone The way level unlock weapons are quiet nonsense the higher lvl players have more gear in general and low lvl players just have way too little things to protect themselvs making the starting you online life very hard Houses are ... basicly the same the interior layout changed way too little from building to building and if you're not willing to pay the 900k for the customizable Eclipse tower the view from your window is the only trully different thing you'll find.GOOD THINGS i DID NOT FACE so many hackers as other people described and even when i saw one they weren't messing around they were just playing normaly. In more than 200h i was only killed twice by a hacker. Never heard of unfair ban never happend with me or any of my local friends. So many more cars and upgrades Not perfect but still interesting character creation Even though it's GTA the game has mechanisms to not let everyone go riot and it tries to keep peace(but people still do it anyway) thousands of things to spend you money on houses garages cars clothes boats planes upgrades weapons ... Sharkcards exist for that right ? anyway its huge and you may never get tired of spending.If you never played the campaign get it its awsome if you want to buy it just for the online experience ... well if you live in south america and don't mind trolling brazillians all around enjoy it!(i might edit later if i remember something else)",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,30,False,Recommended,(tl dr Game is a masterpiece)After 18 months of delay after delay GTA V is finally here and I can firmly say that it was worth the wait. The game is the best version to have come out. The game has delivered on everything that was promised and it runs like a dream. Pros 1. Amazing Gameplay Gun play is perfect and very fluid. Playing in 1st person mode is incredible and the mouse aiming is as good as it was Max Payne 3. Driving in the game is fantastic. I use the M/K the whole time even when driving. Since I play in 1st person mode completely I find that driving with a keyboard works really well. Plus the cars are heavy and well balanced so your car doesn't swerve all over the place like some do when you use a keyboard.2. Optimization I've put many hours into the game so far and apart from some early FPS drops I haven't had any major issues. I run the game almost completely maxed out with MSAA turned off and advanced graphics turned off. The game offers you up one of the most detailed settings menu I've ever seen. From your standard graphics options all the way to the number of people that appear on the screen. They took their time and truly did a wonderful job.3. Story One of the biggest issues I had with GTA 4 was the boring story and protagonist. Luckily R* fixed this by adding three playable characters all with their own unique skills and missions. The game combines the three quite well so you never feel like is less significant than the other. Even though the game centers around Michaels life and problems the story very naturally intertwines the other two in there perfectly. 4. GTA Online I haven't spent much time in this but from what I've been able to do it seems pretty good. This is the weakest part of the game imo but that's mostly because I'm not a big fan of MP. I haven't done the heist yet but from what I've seen it seems like it was worth the wait. Cons 1. Can't think of anything major tbh. Not saying the game is flawless but there is nothing major that I've come across that I would put as a con. While this game isn't perfect and I wouldn't put it in my top 5 it is still a masterpiece of a game that will appeal to just about everyone. While the game had a rocky launch it seems to be running well for almost everyone now. So please don't listen to those people who gave it a negative review on day 1 because they couldn't get on. I understand their pain but the game runs and plays like a dream so don't deny yourself this amazing experience just because a few people drew the short straw. For me this game is a solid 10/10.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-01-15,1,1,163,False,Recommended,Absolutely gorgeous game.I took my time on getting through the story in this game. I love sandboxes and this one was pretty good. Pinch of salt with the story. First time I booted it up (on release) I couldn't handle the far fetched acting and put it down for almost a year.There's some strange glitches eg. trying to store/save stolen aircraft/special vehicles (like armoured cars) and losing what you wanted as well as what you already had saved.The combat is kind of dumb.

Hell even GTA SA has multiplayer servers running daily.You refuse to allow SP DLC to be made even though GTA IV had 2 lots you charge extortionate prices for digital money and you take forever to release GTA and RDR to PC (which you still haven't done for RDR and I doubt RDR2 will be any different)You want to screw us paying fans over for modifying our SinglePlayer portion which you know full well does not impact the Online experience (which is btw. No new Heists in over a year after they were promised) and all because of your greed to milk your SharkCard purchases which are an absolute waste of time and money.So sincerely Take2 Interactive.FUCKYou.,Grand Theft Auto V

However due to a toxic community plagued with hackers and greedy developers who let their hunger for money take over Grand Theft Auto V's multiplayer has been ruined. Every game of Online that you will join will be swarmed with hackers and cheaters who break the game by consistently killing you and giving you hacked money which will ruin your experience especially when Rockstar resets your hard earned money. Rockstar also has implemented a microtransaction system that is completely t for the consumer. Most good items in Online will take you hours upon hours to unlock but Rockstar consistently tries to get you to take the easy way out and the cough up your hard earned money for their 'Shark Cards' which ultimately let you skip through that t grind. Rockstar has also been known to legitimately reset people's money who haven't been cheating at all completely throwing away thousands of hours of work for some people. I have not encountered this issue.Overall I mainly played Grand Theft Auto V for the singleplayer campaign which is truly a great game and I know that Online would be a genuinely fun game but I cannot recommend you to buy it solely for Online. Rockstar's policy on microtransactions and the community of cheaters and hackers has ruined this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

T2 has made an annoucement that any modifications of GTA V will be considered an illegal action. Uninstalled don't buy this worthless pile of junk I used to love this game but any amount of joy I used to have is gone and done. I'm not buying another Rockstar product I'm not purchasing another T2 product or any other company affiliated with them. I no longer support this franchise. Since Leslie Benzies left Rockstar games this entire company has taken a downward spiral and I couldn't care less. What Take Two Interactive has done is disgusting and low even for a big company like that. I support EA games and Ubisoft more than them at least you know what to expect from them. If I had known back in 2015 that GTAV was going to be illegal to modify in two years I'd have never wasted my countless hours or dollars on.It's been fun GTAV but I no longer support you.

It just gets beter and better there's so much to do and I haven't even played online used the editor tried director mode or done anything except the typical missions.

2016-05-22,0,0,184,False,Recommended,Honestly. One of the best games I've ever played ( for like 10 hours it won't even load anymore )I'm honestly refunding it because my top notch laptop won't even make it play. This game would be much better experience d on console. However if you've got one of those ultra strong computers with like barely anything on it I reccomend you getting this. Online is ok. Lots of hackers but it's hilarious and fun.,Grand Theft Auto V
