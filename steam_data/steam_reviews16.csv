2017-12-14,0,0,111,False,Not Recommended,GTA is alot of fun expcept for the fact that rockstar basically created a game designed for microtransactions. Ive put almost 100 hours into the game and im basically no where. you have to constantly buy ingame currency for the game to be fun. Some of the mission are also designed just to you off to try and get you to buy more ingame currency. The mission will be far too hard for what you are able to do resulting in immense frustration. this game to its core and you rockstar for being so lame.,Grand Theft Auto V

Take GTA 5 Online for example 1)Loading Online is too slow even with a good pc Loading online still takes more than 5 mins2)Chaotic When a player is in sight u can expect him/her to take out his/her weapon and start firing it at u like a psycho.Otherwise this is a very fun game to play and you can have a great time with friends too!4/5 stars,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-23,0,0,1309,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing GTA V since day one on console.As soon as it was playable on Steam I've played it. Between PC and console i've played this game for over 1800 hours. While I mostly play online sometimes I enjoy downloading a trainer and a couple mods to try out in single player. While I do agree that modding in GTA Online needs to be fought because it's the main reason behind the downfall of GTA Online modding in single player is AT THE BASE of whole GTA saga on PC. I've been using OpenIV since the GTA IV days and as it only works in single player there is no reason for take two to remove it.

I nearly wrecked my Laptop trying to fix this brown nugget of a game and what do I get?A game that looks like on the only settings I managed to get it to work on.Spawning in multiplayer I apparently didn't have the rank to do the first tutorial mission so that does not work.In singleplayer my keyboard inputs lag because of the Integrated Graphics don't ask me no idea how they are connected but a short internet research revealed that they are linked so that does not work either.(I know you can fix the keyboard problem but I really don't want to change my settings everytime just to play the game same as I don't want to deactivate my graphics card every time.)In total I've wasted about 20 hours of my life trying to get this to work. Not worth a single one every time you fix a problem they throw another one at you. I see this game in my steam list I wish I'd never bought it.If the game works for you be glad take a minute and thank whatever god you believe in for giving you the chance to play this unoptimized turd.

I'll be leaving my negative review as is as a mark on this game as something that should never ever have gotten past the idea stage in whatever corporate meeting decided it was a good idea to send a C&amp D to the OpenIV creators. I usually keep this game installed even if I don't play it that often anymore because I love trying out new mods.

2015-05-17,1,1,5,False,Recommended,Hi guys. I'm Zalvager aka iBryan. This is my review on behalf of the Original Traders Group. From Me. Honestly this game was amazing on any console. It is a beautifully made game and if you don't enjoy it something is wrong with you! To start I thought the PC version's driving controls would be terrible. I was all but right! Driving and Shooting is absolutely beautiful and easier to do. I understand the game had it's bugs and is bad at times ( Not Really ). But when people actually complain that the game is depending when it comes to specs but honestly. The video card and space on it is all you need to worry about. Most PC's are built to play the game. If your having lag spikes then try messing around with the settings to check what your shadow quality grass quality etc. This will effect your gaming depending on how your computer/ laptop works. I honestly love the controls and gameplay in it. I love the game and I think it is a better option then the consoles if you have a good PC. The OTP review 9.5,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-15,0,0,100,False,Recommended,Amazing it outshines Gta 4 by a landsllde. you can do about everything in this game and more.just beat the story and it was the best put together video game story in years where it has you pretty much cheering for the characters like they are real people but still give a feeling like its a real world adaption of a movie.Graphics look amazing and im and the minimal settings too i believe ( my compute ris only 1 2 years old ) so that just screams how amazing and life like everything looks especially since all cutscenes are acted by the Voice actors themselves so they really nail how the character would react with motion behind it.Oh yeah and the voice work is amazing main characters sound believable and entertaining while the minor Npc's all sound like they are having real conversations and react like real people....to most things at least since cant directly talk to them.the Ai is fantastic......at times at least. what i mean is that they hit the head on how people would walk and do stuff so all the Npc's feel natural its just.....sometimes the game does glitch out with Ai but thats on rare cases more of a physics thing anyway. biggest complaint is that when driving if your driving in wrong lane people tend to swerve toward you instead of trying to swerve away.The big feature though is Heists basically fun main quest robberies that earn you big bucks but requires big team and careful planning and prep. basically you will be introduced to a heist idea and will study up on the place sometimes then you will go to a planning board screen that will explain the two paths you could take to achieving a successful heist with both options being completely different sometimes and resulting in its own events that will make the heist smoother or pay more. after you choose you get to make the choice on the crew basically you have a list of people who you can choose to do certain roles usually being hackers gunmen and drivers. the big thing here is it is important that you choose correctly who you take with you because they can die from not being skilled enough or make bad mistakes but you dont want to hire to good of a team because they require big cuts in the loot. as you find potiental crew members and level up existing ones in heist ( which make them better without raising the Cut percentage ) its all your decision though.Gameplay is amazing a literal wall filled with different guns though they are broke into 8 classes that game takes time to introduce before you can buy sadly but hey some are so expensive you wouldnt be able to buy them tll the point they unlocked them anyway because of the amount of money they give you in start.which brings me to my only two complaints....in the begining unlike Gta 4 which would pay you for nearly every job but with low amounts Gta 5 doesnt pay you for alot of jobs but makes up for it with when they do pay you its usually big AND the fact that business exist for you to purchase and earn money as well as other ways to earn money. also the biggest complaint i have that in Single player ( because multiplayeri s a different beast and i only liek talking about single player in reviews like this ) they give you so few heists theyre about 4 5 in the game after say 40 hours of gameplay i just wish they threw in more and really explored the aspect of multi pathed heists with some routes that just are failure routes if you cant be efficent and have a great team.other than that i still say its a great game and will always recommend till hopefully GTA 6 blows it out of the water ( just hopefully not in the next couple years like some companies do ) very much in the top ranks of my favorite games.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-05,0,0,86,False,Recommended,(Update) Apparently you could possibly get banned for using discord and overlay it on gta but i havent ran into problems so.....You see this game is debatable. Overall I would recommend it because of the story mode and (some) parts of the online mode. Sorry for the bad spelling im not used to this keyboard LONG REVIEWAlright so as for the story I love it. I absoloutly love it. It has a funny and great story with awesome gameplay. I love the 3 main protagonists I love their different personalites and they absolutly get me hooked. The ending was a difficult choice. If you plan on mostly buying this game for the story BUY IT NOW!Online Alright so there are very mixed feelings on this one. First of all as for the false bans. Personally me or nobody I know has not recieved one yet and we all use basic talking programs like Skype and Discord so I can guarantee if you dont use anything other than those 2 you will be fine. For the actual Online however it is fun. See the key to Online is to have the most money which results in more gear and armored cars and weapons and etc.. To not spend a fortune on this game buying Shark Cards (Cards you buy with real money to give you in game money) you have to be good at the actual game or play with good friends. Fortunatly I play with good friends and I am sorta good at the game. Therefore its more of a skill based game to get money which is appropriate. The actual Online sometimes can be glitchy which is acceptable considering the game is constantly updated and is adding new stuff. Now the part that people hate about online is the community. You could get annoyed which is very nerve riding. People could continuosly kill you or they could mess up the heist on purpose for you and you just buying the game have no idea how to kick them. Also heists. They don't usually give you a lot of money unless you do all of them in order in which that would be great as you would get bonus money for doing so. Again thats where Shark Cards come in but unless you actually spend additional money on games you wouldnt want that. Also unless you have a decent gaming rig and want graphics that look okay then don't buy this game. All in all for Online play with good friends try to be decent at the game and do all the heists in order. Also if you have any additional money that you dont want to keep in your steam wallet for whatever reason (Maybe someones coming over and they will check your steam account and if they find money beg you to gift them something) or just wanna spend it on something that you might enjoy spend a few bucks on a shark card as it might boost your game and allow you to buy a decent gun. Also for the story its amazing buy it now. Hope to see you in game if you decide to buy!,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-08-07,0,0,202,False,Not Recommended,GTA Online can be quite fun with its incredible customization options and solid shooting mechanics. It's just a bonus that the game still looks gorgeous in 2018 with its support for 4K and incredible textures.However Rockstar has evolved into another greedy EA corporation and it's this that spoils much of the game's fun. Please stop buying their Shark cards guys you've ruined the company. Many missions require you to spend millions of dollars on things such as Bunkers and Nightclubs and it's honestly quite lackluster. And even when you buy these things there are several more things you are required to buy in order to enjoy the missions. Characters like Gay Tony Lester and Agent 14 will bombard you with phone calls EVERY LOGIN and it's this incessant whining from them that makes you want to buy what Rockstar is offering. DON'T DO IT.This is a disgusting business practice worse than what I've seen in several MMOs and the developers should be quite ashamed of themselves. Don't support shady business practices like this.On top of all this GTA has a griefing community of online modders that they refuse to remove after receiving complaints AND their missions are hidden by a horrendous paywall. Everything about the online experience is now TOXIC.Ultimately the groundwork for a great game is here if you just want to enjoy the campaign and/or coop missions with a couple of friends.

The sun setting low beneath the clouds slowly sinking into the waves of the ocean and the apex of the mountains the downtown bustling with individuals interstates full of vehicles driving to their own direction for a specific need... It's like living a real life but in a virtual world. I do not really care about the violence sexuality or any sort of thing that's inappropriate in this game. In fact I usually try to avoid it.

Let's ignore the sheer hell that is free roam with hackers FFA k/d bros and people broadcasting over open mics. We can even ignore that there is no real way to lobby up with friends not one that reliably works anyway.What you cannot ignore is the fact that every new DLC that comes out is basically a reskin of the previous DLC albeit with some cosmetic changes. But hey you get new vehicles right? I mean sure if you don't mind paying for them.Let's break this down. A megalodon Card costs $100 USD for 8 million GTA bux. It's now to a point where you cannot get everything in a DLC for that amount of money.So ask yourself this.

That said you'll find that Rockstar run plenty of Double XP/RP weekends for spotlight events. So you'll always find it quite easy to grind out the cash.

Take everything you knew from GTA5 on consoles then inject it with shark testosterone and slap on 60+ fps and you got yourself a car racing bank robbing people shooting rage boner.However if you want this game to run make sure you do the following! Install the latest drivers for your graphics card (Im not ing around about that) Make sure you have a rockstar social account! Make sure that you have enough RAM (8gb) is reccomended (by everyone) Finally make sure you have a decent CPU ( i have a intel i5 4690k and its at 100% CPU usage most times!)Have fun!,Grand Theft Auto V

Also many Challenges to be done aswell. The 3 Main Characters Micheal Trevor Franklin there is also alot to explore in the map.The Game has cool Easter eggs and cool backstories of the characters and other cool places. If you like to play GTA V go ahead the Story mode is amazing!Online I wouldn't say the Online version of the game is the worst we got from Rockstar in all history of GTA Games but it is.The Online version has alot of Hackers and Bad Sport players wich means you can get banned or put in a cheater pool or Bad Sport pool meaning you would have to wear a hat that says Dumb or Cheater wich you can't get off or unequip it because its temp or perm. You can't make barely any cash without you having actual money to buy Shark Cards wich give you the advantage to buy from 100k to 8 Mil$. Wich you can use to buy an apartment and all the Bunkers and Hangars and Motorcycle club houses so they stop calling you and telling you to buy there The Online version however is fun to play with friends wenn there is new adversery modes and cool player created Missions or Death matches. I don't recommend the game fully cause of ""Again"" the lack of support and updates that needs from Rockstar. Players getting banned randomly Hackers buying accounts to mod. There is no way you will not meet a hacker i bet you my steam account you will meet one. ""Sooo Good luck playing the Story mode and online mode."" I would give the Story mode 10/10 and Online 6/10. 6 + because of the gameplay4 cause of the Microtransactions and stupit phone calls and loadings screen to advertise the 10 + Never Ending Story mode D",Grand Theft Auto V

Tons of stuff to do in online. Fun online progression system. Playing with friends is best. Tons of sweet mods for single player!Cons Hackers/Modders/Cheaters there is usually one on every server some are nice and just fly around most are s. Connecting takes a long time to online. You're not paired with players of your same ranking so some servers you will get demolished because there is a clan of level 300+ destroying you with flying vehicles and lock on missiles. Online houses/bunkers/businesses/etc cost WAY TOO MUCH money! For casual players it is almost impossible to gain that much money so quickly unless you buy Shark Card which is a huge money grab! Shark Card pay to win essentially...pay a bunch of real cash get all the best houses and vehicles instantly! Not many cons but they are huge issues. All in all its a fantastic game bought it for me and all my friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

Right click while you burning out your tires and horning the horn. Get p*ssed off and hits my hard to find muscle car. Catch the car. Shoot the tires. Hand to hand combat and wins. Two star cops and wasted because I ran out of ammo. Personal humor lol+ Love it when you press throttle too deep and it's burning out.+ Bit more better combat system. Hell pistol really hurts now.And many more that I too lazy to write.But? Bit more like the old GTA 4 handling and physics tho. I'm a guy that actually loves realism.

2017-08-07,0,0,481,False,Recommended,If you are worrying about the price or the downloading of the huge game i recomend reading my review.2 years ago i was thinking about buying GTA 5 but the price seemed so high. For some reeason My friend and I then bought the game and i have now played it about 600 hours. I have never opened the game when i didnt want to and yet i have now easily gotten to 600 hours of play time. I think you should think about not the price but the expected price per hour. And i think nearly everyone will play GTA more than 100 hours and at that point the cost of one hours play time is less than 1 . If you compare that to movies or other games i think you will be in the same class of around 1 per hour. So actually the price can be justified even if it is really high.I recomend buying GTA 5 on steam and not the rockstar version because i have had so much problems with the rockstar versions download servers that i actually bought the game again this time via steam. After switching to steam i have had no problems with downloading the 66GB game.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-20,0,0,325,False,Not Recommended,The only reason why I bought this game is now been disabled. The owners of this game disabled all singleplayer mods.

2017-06-20,0,0,378,False,Not Recommended,I never do this but I am giving this a bad review. The only reason I and anyone else on here bought this game on PC was for the mods. There is absolutely no reason to remove them. It is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to cheat online. If you have one small file out of place or modded even the most unimportant one they will automatically detect it and prevent you from playing online. Maybe if rockstar didn't have to rely on shark cards being bought from their new online conent people wouldn't have to mod the game to make it fun. And the mods are all for single player. But I guess they want people to spend money on their shark cards instead,Grand Theft Auto V

Not only this but the story is well played and very well acted. There is a ton of stuff you can do with friends...However it has become very much about buying money to get anything in game if you already paid $60 you shouldnt have to pay more just to play the game. It is full of cheaters and down right hackers. It used to be you could earn enough for stuff by hard work which has now become 5x harder. All in all it is well made and you get a lot but It contains continual pushing of people to buy to play multiplayer. So I don't feel sorry for them when hackers give themselves absurd amounts of cash.If you have money at your finger tips go ahead but it can be irritating.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,356,False,Recommended,My IMO score 10/10Why?Don't have to answer Roman's calls anymore because he isn't in the game.Seriously though here are my points Story I haven't played it yet but based on my brother's gameplay it is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts. There are also a lot of twists in the story.The inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective Special Abilities. Cheat codes are fun too!Online I played about 99% of my time in Online. The community as I expected is SOS or shoot on sight kind of players so you don't really have a room for making friends. The real fun comes when you are playing with your friends. The jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money.Beware though vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle. It will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too! Although they are very expensive they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse. They also give your owned cars a safe place where other players can't blow them up and you have to call the Insurance company to get it back. The most expensive ones looks something that only Iron Man can buy hell the Garage already looks like a house.HEISTS my favourite part of Online. They are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications. The succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon. It gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader (I got 200k once). The problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1). Noobs who cant do 2.) People who don't know what to do. 3.) people who Perform their roles poorly and 4.)just incompetent s who sit around while you and possibly others are getting by the police. However when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew you can have actually fun and it doesn't even feel that you are competing. You also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast. Optimization Hell this console port doesn't even feel like it! Truly the PC Master Race has prevailed. The graphics looks very beautiful. The streets and cities are very lively. The effects are truly stunning. All this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications GTX 860M(Single)Intel Core i7 4710HQ 2.5Ghz 3.416 GB RAM.It runs around 40 60 FPS on Very High settings with no AA and on 1920x1080!There is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isn't really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing GTA V constitently.Well that's all I could say for this review.

It's a bit of a grind fest to acquire bases vehicles etc. but that's because all the DLC is made available for free in a way.You'll read reviews telling you to stay away from the online side and you might think it's the game Devs that made it a bad experience.Online is ruined by the player base nothing else. Hackers/Modders are constantly present so all you can hope is they don't decide to mess with you. Trying to complete missions on a public server will often end with someone using a Hydra/Deluxo or any other ridiculous OP vehicle to blow you up with ease.As I'm typing this I'm about 0 40 as a guy in a hydra is spawnkilling me before I can do a thing. And as I'm on a mission I can't go into passive mode so I'll just have to wait it out as this has already been a 20 minute ordeal.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-28,0,0,308,False,Recommended,The game itself is great lots of content lots to do and is very fun with friends. But the people you meet in public servers are absolutely horrible. Kids in hydras blowing everything up griefers with explosive sniper rifles bombing your car from miles away and unfriendly modders that buries you under 200 planes. I understand that this is supposed to be part of the game but a lot of the game mechanics seems to be encouraging these actions. Such as having a kd ratio to your character gaining money and experience points (rp) for killing other players for no reason etc. All in all if you are fine with the griefers and toxicity this game can be really fun.

Players will seek to destroy your fun online and it can be hard to play on an open online server without someone trying to destroy you and your fun with one of the many ridiculous vehicles available.

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh could be better honestly. It's not really a bad story itself it's mostly just ""Oof ouch bank heist gone wrong wrong guy got shot guy gets dead man walking rob banks sucking eachother big ing d i c k s again with a new ."" which sums it up completely. The thing that brings it down the most is the characters Franklin is obviously the best written one because he's an actual C H A R A C T E R and Michael is just a grumpy old man with kids and a wife who hates him cuz he's a And Trevor is just some meme character that kills people and does drugs and does the epic i hate the people that arent meeeeeeeeeeee.

Which would be better if you just played with friends but apparently people dont know what friends are????? Overall it's not bad just grindy and filled with losers and if you have internet like me lag.Strong 7.5/10So yeah I'd def buy this if it's on sale and you have some buds to play with just don't take all these meme reviews seriously cuz it's just people getting pissy at Rockstar because they're unironically a bad company and we still need to know they are.",Grand Theft Auto V

GTA IV was also a classic but something like 5 years later and we see just what a developer can accomplish in that time span. The story was amazing. Just straight up hilarious at times and the character development is pretty solid. The story could be longer however but it was a solid story and i enjoyed it a lot. Online is a different story of course. All the shark cards and dudes flying around in jets and recently the oppresor can definitely make me angry as hell. However It is possible to get thrown in a solo lobby which i spend a lot of time on to resupply my meth and cocaine labs aswell as my gun running business.

The CEO/company biker gang gun running smuggler's run dlcs have been in my opinion just reskins of the same core idea. Pay millions of dollars for a crew base buy supplies go get the supplies sell them buy outrageously over powered vehicles to kill players minding their own business. I feel gun running was the final nail in the coffin for me. Anyone lucky enough to be in a lobby with a modder and not have their modded money taken away by rockstar got the upper hand. They bought apc's and other crazy death machines. They bought guns like the heavy sniper and put stuff like explosive rounds on it instead of leveling up.I will say that the heist dlc was great. It added more story to the game and to online. If there were to be a second heist dlc I would most likely reinstall the game.Obviously hackers that blow up everyone on the map suck so I'm not going to talk about that. I'm not a fan of how rockstar handled situations where people were being modded money. I played this game with two of my friends and we were all glitched money. One of us was permanently banned. I had my money taken from me. My other friend (who was modded the most money) was left untouched. Punishment became a lottery.I have logged over 300 hours in the pc version of this game.

Full of modders Toxic community support (Seriously theres a wait period before you can contact support about ANYTHING) Horrible matchmaking system Overpowered cars (Karuma or however it's spelt) Once you get this thing it's pretty much the only car you ever use because everything else is complete trash. Buggy. For example I had a horn a musical loop one and everytime it blew up or i logged out and logged back in. the horn would change to some other horn. in order to get it back I had to REBUY THE DAMN HORN. Not to mention if you pick up cash from a modder chances are you could possibly get banned for it. Seriously? Wow way to weed out your community. Not even trying rockstar. Don't believe the hype.

They don't care if there is a fault on thier end they just say no and tell you to literally off... To me Rockstar can now go suck a bag of .. They on my account with no option to get them to even CHECK that it was valid.Honestly Steam should look at this and consider their future releases as this will be something they will keep doing no matter what anyone says.Bad business Terrible responses and quite frankly the biggest ' you' to anyone who puts time and effort in to playing the game even while all the hackers run riot online without consequence.Also when they reset my account they reset it to 0 and didn't give me back the money I paid for as part of the PRE RELEASE... them and their new releases that are coming out. Not worth the risk to get suspended and simply be told 'You violated the EULA/ToS"" which is so broad that if you stop a player going into a store and they don't enjoy it then you risk being screwed.HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO AVOID ALL OF THIS COMPANY AND IT'S SUBSIDIARIES RELEASES AS THEY ARE PURE TRASH AND CAN'T EVEN CATCH _REAL_ HACKERS...I can't even sell this piece of game to anyone else to recoup some of my money and to rid myself of this crap...

2018-09-30,0,0,246,False,Recommended,Okay so i've been playing this game ever since it got released i've been playing it on xbox360 and PS3 even PS4 it was great fun and i was happy with everything but when i started playing on PC (this is about online) i was disappointed... the amout of modders you see in lobbies is just unreal.. i mean i don't really mind modders who are cool and don't grief but most of them are griefers and they're extremely annoying but if you don't mind switching lobbies from time to time then there should be no issue.The Gameplay is great i mean online is really well made theres so much to do but it gets kind of repetitive.. you constantly have to grind jobs and get money and lets be honest most of the jobs don't pay that much you can make about 100k if you play gamemodes that have double money and RP but even if you grindded that for a week straight it would still do you no good since everything is so expensive and the prices are jacked.. although it's repetitive if you have a group of friends you could really have some fun doing hesits etc and could possibly speed up the money making proccess but thats if you have friends who play GTA all the time.. it's really difficult and very boring as a solo player you constantly get people who leave jobs right when you're about to finish people who grief jobs etc the gta community is extremly toxic full of griefers... and f*** me don't even get me started on Freemode It's basically a KOS People will constantly blow you up blow your car up kill you to the point where you're going to have to look for another lobby.. but like i said apart from all the chaos and toxicity it's extremly fun with friends. i've met people in game who became friends with me helped me do heists etc... in general online is well made theres so much stuff to do you can squeeze out a couple thousand hours in online without a problem. Now the singleplayer.. i mean it's singleplayer it's great amazing story great voice acting.. just a perfect game.. despite it being 5 years old It's still really fun especially with mods.. i think i've beat the story mode like 5 times already with mods and without mods it's really fun.. so overall it's a great game i would recommend it 100% although i would probably play on console if you want a better online experience but if you dont mind modders and all that then go for it you wont regret it..,Grand Theft Auto V

Thetre is almost nothing fun about the clunky physics and lack of any real direction as to what to do in game to progress. Would not buy a R* game again if it is anything like this.

2017-07-31,0,0,320,False,Not Recommended,"DISCLAIMER I started playing this game on release day on my Xbox 360 and then pre ordered the PC version when I made the switch to PC gaming so I have a very long very diverse play history of this game.GTA V is a mixed bag to reiterate what one of my peers put into their review. The singleplayer is an incredibly memorable experience and the story is characteristic of Rockstar's blockbuster storylines. If you want a darn good singleplayer game you will feel like you have spent your money well. There's an absolute ton of things to do and it doesn't take unheard of amounts of money to do it's just darn good fun and you can't beat it. From the incredible storytelling to the improved gameplay I cannot recommend the single player enough. If you're reading a review this in depth then you know how incredibly detailed and amazing Rockstar's singleplayer worlds are and this is an absolute bar setting experience.Where this game falls short is the multiplayer. And it's the ONLY reason this game is remotely bad. Compared to the singleplayer it truly feels to me like two entirely different studios developed this game. Rockstar made the singleplayer and the scummiest most criminally minded corporate scumbags made the online version. To put it bluntly there are very few things that online did right and an unbelievable amount of things they did wrong and it's truly concerning. In the early days following release the pricing systems (in my opinion) were rather well balanced. It didn't take and overtly insane amount of time to get the good cars guns and clothing/houses. But as things developed and time moved forward the game took a directon which all games nowadays seem to be taking one we observed in countless AAA titles Fallout 4 being among them as well. What I am referring to is the seemingly constant push to make games appeal to wider audiences release large amounts of half finished content and lacking DLC just to get consumers to spend more money on things like in game currency. And that's more of a philosophical issue in gaming and gaming business that I won't delve into but when so many developers in the modern era are constantly pushing in game currency and half finished DLC doesn't anyone question what they're doing to the game itself as far as content or integrity to justify those types of additions?Regardless of this the online portion itself is a grindy frustrating experience for many players just read the various reviews from my peers on steam and reddit and you'll find a few common themes. Grindy gameplay unbalanced gameplay (in terms of level gaps and economic gaps) and an overabundance of just really unfriendly players. That brings me to another issue and it's not something R* can control directly but have an influence on. The playerbase itself is a very very toxic community because R* does nothing to control it and doesn't give players the option to do so either so it runs rampant. There's no way to flag problem users there's no way for the community to police itself and Rockstar seemingly has no interest in this either and thus the toxic community. As for support from Rockstar that's an entirely different issue that normally isn't related to the game but in this case it is. I have no experience with any sort of unfair banning and neither do my friends so I won't speak on a topic I have no experience with. But in past dealings with R* support when I had issues migrating my account from XB360 to PC their service generally places any issues or blame on the customer and doesn't seem to be interested in accomodating or helping the customer. Which being a business owner myself I can tell you that despite popular belief the customer is always 100% completely right and nearly the only way to have a successful support/service department is to do whatever is feasibly possible to help the customer even at a loss to yourself. It breeds a positive customer base and that's not something we see with this game as I have previously mentioned.To conclude I don't really have any advice as far as te al aspects of the game go since I have no background in any form of programming whatsoever. However I can give support and business advice. The more money you take from a customer without them feeling satisfied justified and cared about in their purchase/experience the more you'll develop bad publicity and poor unruly customer bases. Business is about a relationship between a corporation or company and an individual and while a company's primary goal or directive is to make money you simply cannot treat customers poorly or take advantage of them through unethical practices or ""overly corporate relations"". You have to be a human first businessman second. You have to make money while also ensuring that you don't lose sight of what you originally set out as a company (or studio) to do and that's to make games that people want to play. Not make money. These practices might work in the short term but as we have all seen before consumers NEVER EVER forget and it's even less likely that they forgive. And Rockstar well you've lost sight of your goal and you allowed your highly prestigious studio to be controlled by the never ending pursuit of money. Tl dr I am unable to in good conscience recommend this game even with the incredible single player. I cannot recommend it.",Grand Theft Auto V

We have 12 year old K/D warriors all over the Online servers who frankly ruin the experience of the ENTIRE online aspect of the game (80% of it). From a person who has played GTA 2 3 Vice City San Andreas Chinatown Wars IV and now V the non online portion of the game is 1000% worth it. In recent years the Online portion is getting more and more expenisve to play however. Its' understandable that they charge a lot for shark cards since all DLC is released for free (lots of it). But its' not cool that they make all the in game items more and more expensive every update.

And after 4 hours of loading maybe I will be able to play again.The AIs are terrible and the spawn of enemies is wild and unpredictable (police during chasing during races and so on) but I guess that the latter tries to compensate the former.Oh and basically your body is just a punchball when it interacts with any surface. If you jump just a centimeter earlier instead of climbing you will jump and hit the obstacle and lay down forever.And remembering all the commands it's a nightmare. I would have prefered a game more intuitive with less non important features (like the damn cell phone) but with more effective core mechanics.Oh and the objectives for the gold medal are shown only after the mission instead of during it so you probably have to play them again. So more than one hour of time wasted just in loading screens!Once again probably for people who love GTAs with all their quirkness this game is perfect and they will not give any importance to these flaws.

2015-06-18,0,0,334,False,Recommended,Was GTA V worth this long wait? It is a fantastic done port much better optimized than GTA IV ever was. Don t bother with the first person view as it cuts off about 40% of your screen. Rockstar has provided a lot of graphical customizations to let you get those 60FPS depending on your PC Hardware. It s always good to check your settings with the provided benchmark. The grass and vegetation options on PC put the console peasants to shame! The PC port is highly detailed compared to last gen and current gen consoles. The Radio Station is mediocre at best GTA IV and San Andreas Radio was better I suggest using your own MP3 s and making your own playlist. Addition of new weapons vehicles and Easter Eggs throughout the game make a very nice and exciting gameplay. You can customize your weapons and vehicles to your liking there are a lot of options. Nothing like driving a sweet ride and listening to some tunes. I consider it to be one the best looking Open World games which will continue to get better with modding community on PC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-11,0,0,255,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). This is by far one of my favorite games ever. The graphics are great. The gameplay is simple and satisfying. The characters are loveable. There is Franklin a gangster who wants to be a little bit more. Michelle a retired criminal who is basically dying from boredom and my favorite Trevor... just plain crazy Canadian. He is not sorry. Anyway the reason I like this game so much is because there are tons to do even taking away the online mode which I will get to shortly. There is the main story that is interesting and fun where you get to plan your own heist to an extent hire crew members (using the same people in your team makes them get better the more you use them) The fun thing is unlike other GTA games to date (as far as I know) GTA V gives you the option of playing as 3 different characters instead of just one. Each one has a special skill which is pretty cool. There are tons of side characters that are either very annoying (Michelle's family) or very awesome there are even stranger missions that you can do where you meet someone and they ask you to do something for them like a mini story something I really appreciated. All in all I really think this has been one of the best GTA games.Now for the online version. GTA Online aka loading simulator. Don't get me wrong it is worth the wait it is just very annoying. GTAO is very fun especially when played with friends. There are more things to do then I care to mention my favorite are the stunt races. You can get a few friends together and do a heist which is a lot of fun unless you get a random and that person doesn't want to follow the rest of the team. The thing that really makes GTAO feel real for me is you start with nothing just the clothes on your back and by doing stuff like events or heists or even missions you get money which you use to buy houses businesses cars whatever you want. There are even some of the mini games you can play from the single player mode. The community are about what you could expect from GTA in other words most times it is just a bunch of people killing each other. Still fun but can get annoying if you want to do like a car drop where the more damage the car takes the less money you get.Basically if you liked the previous GTA titles you will most likely like this one too. It improved a lot on the GTA formula. Heck there is even a first person mode that seems better then most FPS games out there so well done Rockstar. There is literally something for everyone in this game. Race CTF team death match. There are tons of stuff to do. I recommend picking it up on a sale since it is a little pricey but even at full price it is totally worth the money,Grand Theft Auto V

SOMETIMESShort DONT GET THE GAME!!!Save your money get this game off some website where you can get a key for cheap if you really want to. online grind. Long Dont get this game in 2018... if you are even reading this... just don't do it... this game is only fun for a very small amount of time after so you would want to take long breaks from the endless grind this game requires (authors note I am not a very good with money so take it with a grain of salt... nor am I patient enough for most grinding) However the game does give you a great time if you aren't into the freemode stuff. I do recommend the races especially the user made stunt ones. Races are great with freinds... not that I have any that play them with me... BUT ANYWAYS... it's still not worth the purchase unless you get this game from somewhere cheap. 60 dollars or even the 50% off 30 dollars isn't worth your hard earned cash. However... this game does serve a niche in the market as there aren't many other open world games I could recomend over this... unless you include GTAIV (which I have never played) and The original red dead redemption (which I also have never played). From a person who has played many F2P games I know when I smell Pay 2 Win or Pay 2 Progress and this game stinks of the latter. However I understand the business side of this game and although I do not support the extent it has gone to try to dry our pockets they have at least added some new content to the game. Simply put it is most likely that liscensing for the music in the game does not come cheap for Rockstar. (from experience researching music liscensing for youtube)Conclusion if I only look at this game in 2018 I would barely suggest getting the game when it is on sale. I am honestly still enjoying this game from time to time but that does not mean that I would support this game.

2017-02-06,0,0,221,False,Recommended,"first off this is a Great game a bench mark for the series technically. I'm still amazed how good it looks.Yet the game seems to lack the special something of earlier titles the ""wacky"" is muted replaced with a more somber realistic toneyet the classic absurd nature of the games physics of how tough you and your vehicle still exist.it creates an odd dynamic you get drawn into the reality of the game you find yourself not having to suspend disbelieve as much then every once and a while that is shattered by evil kenival type stunts and unreal bullet damage.its like it can't make up its mind if it wants to be GTA The simulator or GTA the game. as for the game the main story is great good pacing actually interesting characters are better fleshed out and with 3 main storylines to follow it keeps thing fresh but there are fewer side missions/alter goals in singleplayer and sadly this seems to have affected the logevity of the game as once the main story is completed the world feels kinda bland/empty the cheats avalible are ""meh"" could be that after 4 iterations of this game I may just be an tired old man but it dosent seem to have the same replayability of the older games.Online is great! if you can find a group of like minded players.watch out for hackers and con artists tho it makes for an interesting side of the game people have developed systems to rob people after hiest etc I must admit adds a bit of tension to the gameif your looking For straight up TDM DM etc like GTA 4 you really need to get a friends/player list as a pick up game of that type hardly ever happens.online jobs/heist/gangs missions etc are fun can be a bit convoluted if played with randoms as i said get a group of regular players and you'll have a blast.*update The new heists are Awsome",Grand Theft Auto V

You have no idea what to do no idea what a lot of stuff means no idea how to get cash and the list can go on.Plus Rockstar seems to think that sticking a bunch of players who are level 200+ with a total beginner is a great idea. Can't tell you how many times I've been bombed from a helicopter while I can barely afford a 2 car garage and a few guns. And that Passive Mode is a joke. You can't do anything while in passive mode.

Once you recieve a certain amount within a small amount of time the game lets you know that you have been ""logged"" to Rockstar. This has happened twice and I had a 3 day then 3 month ban rather than risk getting a perma ban for nothing and knowing that after hours spent trying to resolve the issue with Rockstar they kept blaming me which isn't how a business is supposed to work. I had my Steam account unlinked from the Social Club bullcrap and will never buy another Rockstar product again.When a company's Customer Support blames the customer for hackers spawning lots of money on top them and that it was my fault I decided Rockstar doesn't deserve anymore business from me and I had the game removed from my Steam Account as well (at a loss but I didn't care).Overall though before hackers and Rockstar's ""Support"" blamed me for something I didn't do the game *WAS* fun sadly this is no longer the case and singlplayer was boring after beating it and whatnot...Game (Overall) 3/5 Not Bad was fun but can't play a game with hackers and no effective anti cheat or customer support.Rockstar Customer Support 0/5 I've never given anything a 0 but they are terrible.

2015-04-14,1,2,265,False,Recommended,"GTA V is a better port than GTA IV. It runs smoother despite the fact it uses newer tech. I've never played the console versions so I can't compare it to those though it's pretty obvious that the PC version runs and looks much much better however it's one of the better AAA releases of late. I recommend using a beefy cpu and gpu to fully enjoy the PC version. I'm running it on an i7 4470K Haswell and a 770 GTX which allows me to run everything on ""Very High"" except for Textures that are set to ""High"" with a stable 60 fps (higher w/ V Sync disabled). You can squeeze by with an older card but you'll be missing out on the full scope of graphical improvements in this release.I'm still playing the Story Mode and haven't bothered with GTA Online yet so I cannot comment on its functionality but Story Mode is running fine. No crashes or stutters or any other game breaking issues. My only gripes seem to be in game design and it's a little petty of me I'll admit.I don't like the cops in this game they're too invasive and it feels like a lot of the chases are more tiresome than exciting. Losing the cops in this isn't as fun as in previous titles. Also it feels like they pick up on every little crime you commit and that's a bit of a change from the other games. Unrelated but just as annoying the phone in this one is absolute trash unlike the one in GTA IV. GTA IV's phone was quick and intuitive. Whereas in GTA V I'm annoyed with how much time I spend trying to find different things in my phone when I'm busy driving or doing a mission. It seems like they're just too busy satirizing Apple's iPhone when they should have made a functional phone for us to use. Perhaps I shall adjust.So that's all. Concluding I'd like to just say that Rockstar has improved so much in this latest release. It seems like they have learned from GTA IV and listened to their fans quite a lot when it comes to developing a port for PC. Aside from that the gameplay &amp story remains pretty flawless and loyal to the GTA feel that we're accustomed to with the exception of annoyingly clairvoyant police and a couple of petty gripes of my own. Still it's definitely a better port and worth giving a go.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-06-25,1,2,50,False,Recommended,The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below) but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths.

2017-06-18,0,0,105,False,Not Recommended,Now don't get me wrong. Despite the negative rating I honestly do enjoy GTA V or at least the singleplayer part. It's a fun and charming game with a lot to do great writing and a lot of hours to spend. The multiplayer however not as much. With rampant hackers a play to win model and microtransactions everywhere it leaves a lot to be desired.In the years since GTA V's PC release Rockstar and Take Two have constantly been making decisions which have been incredibly consumer unfriendly. Whether it's the neglect of the singleplayer mode in favor of the broken online which just happens to make them more money (seriously where is the singleplayer DLC? No let's just keep having more MP microtransactions instead) or the time where they manipulated Steam sales by adding one of their virtual currency cards in a bundle to avoid actually going on sale or most recently the debacle where Take Two has gone against the modding community by sending a C&amp D to the OpenIV team.Mods have been an important part of PC gaming for a long time and the Grand Theft Auto series is no exception. In the singleplayer campaigns people have the right to do whatever the hell they like with a game that they have purchased as long as it has no bearing on other players. But no apparently that's bad now according to Take Two. Never mind the epidemics of hackers on MP it's the singleplayer modding community which is the problem.But as long as these issues still stand there is a definite problem and it needs to be addressed.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-04-05,1,18,63,False,Recommended,I bought the game mainly for the story mode and I've been greatly enjoying it. However I don't think GTA O is worth playing. The community is pretty toxic. First time I loaded in online I get called a noob repetitively cause I was a level 3. Whether you should get the game or not for the online mode is on you but personally I think the story mode is where Rockstar gave all its love towards. If you played the console version Los Santos remastered in 60 FPS on PC is definitely something to witness.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-25,1,2,1606,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE 29/08/17 Just like they did before GR hit R*s been nicking peoples cash again. I personally made about 5 mil from the I/E double money event and a couple days later R* took 1.2 mil away. Though I should count myself lucky there are people who got Criminal Mastermind money taken and even Shark Card money! If you browse the Discussions keep an eye out for the R* defense squad if you make a post about lost money they'll spam links and cheating accusations all over. Game's decent.. Plays good looks good sounds (mostly) good. Online mode can be a bit hit and miss sometimes you get good sessions with no greifers or cheaters other times its a cluster of chaos. Discussion boards are nothing but a huge garbage fire stay away if you dislike salt and poop (because my god does it get thrown around a lot).R* doesn't seem to know exactly what they're doing with the game as of late giving rediculously OP vehicles and weapons to the richest of players while leaving the ones at the bottom to seek glitches for empty sessions just to play the game. Of course if you bring this up the vocal minority of braindead psychopaths that lurk in and around the games playerbase will say that they're 'just playing the game as it was intended' but don't bother listening to that lot. Over time you may find some decent people to play with (I've made friends with quite a large group of people over the past few months) but at the end of the day GTA Online in some ways is like Rust. You start at the bottom and either get killed on sight by some or you grind up to the top and eventually become the who kills on sight. Though there will be some exeptions that's essentially how it plays out.UPDATE 24/03/2018 The banocalypse is here god save us all (Exept for iD and FIREFLY they can go hump a cactus naked).,Grand Theft Auto V

The fun gameplay makes me want to play the graphics keep me in the game and the random nonsense....over the top action....hookers....etc. makes time FLY by. I'm only 31% complete with the single player haven't even tried online yet. No mods either so when mods do come out....good bye life.Going out to upgrade my PC soon because I finally realize after playing GTA on Xbox360 and XboxOne then PC...that 60+fps really does make a difference.

If you havent played it before and are getting it for the campaign wait till its on sale and cheaper. Its an amazing story mode.... for the first time through. Sure you can go back and try different scenarios but its the case of seen one seen it all.As for multiplayer dont bother. The multiplayer platform is rediculous at this point. You start with nothing and every awesome in game item is millions of dollars forcing you to spend a rediculous amount of hours or spend a ton of money to get one car let alone the CEO builings and buisnesses.It's an amazing game and if you see it cheap pick it up for the story but other than that I wouldn't bother.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-23,0,0,290,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V in my opinion is an important milestone in the evolution of video games. It's also important to point out that this game is centered around having fun. Fun things to do in real life is fun to do in this game. The mechanics are deep and varied allowing you to do things I'd doubt the devs even thought of. The aesthetic of the game is consistent and polished. You always get the 'Los Santos' vibe from the parodical nature of the game's media to the nostalgic hollywood esque music scores that play in important/exciting events. The game forces you into immersion in ways I haven't seen other dev's than Rockstar do for example in Online To buy stuff like cars you have to browse the in game web using your in game phone. Things like these really help you get deeper into the world.,Grand Theft Auto V

Pros 1.Singleplayer is not bad2.Multiplayer exists3.A lot of content4.Good graphics5.A lot of voice acting6.Good voice acting7.A lot of different cars faces people buildings locations and many more8.Some interesting heistsCons 1.Important! The game does not make the feeling when you are on a heist I mean even if you have a stealth mission it ALWAYS comes to the point when you gotta shoot. And not just shoot but kill 200 policemen trying to stop you even if you do everything right you will get somewhere with a lot of space and the melee will begin.2.Boring multiplayer3.A lot of killers on multiplayer4.A lot of hackers on mp5.A few things you can do with a car or any vehicle forward backward left or right no slowing speed not even lowering your side glasses!6.Pay to winIf you are like me and buy this game here is what is going to happen. You go to Singleplayer you buy a lot of guns and you start destroying everything and soon realise that policemen waves are infinity and you can not blow any structures and finally get killed. After that there is not many exciting things to do.The price is not tha good for a game like this If you are too eager to buy and play this wait for a sale.

2017-06-15,0,0,524,False,Not Recommended,I have put so many hours into GTAV on two different platforms and one of the main reasons I bought it for a second time on PC is for SINGLE PLAYER MODS. I didn't want to ruin anyone elses fun by using mods in multiplayer but Take Two (the guys who own rockstar) have effectivly BANNED MODS not multiplayer mods but singleplayer mods. They don't want you to be able to use all the new cool toys in singleplayer so you are forced online and into pulic lobbies with hackers which they can do nothing to stop to grind money endlessly for stupidly expensive vehicles because flying bikes are cool. OR you can buy shark cards of course which is exactly what they want. They want more money every content patch and the only way to avoid that trap was to play singleplayer and mod in the new vehicals so you can have fun. Charging for mods like Bethesda are doing deserves it's own level of hell but this level of scummery claims the deepest darkest level all to itself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-24,1,2,2822,False,Recommended,So here is Rockstars latest introduction to the GTA franchise. I myself cannot say it s perfect and yes the ban system is WAY out of whack but there is a silver lining to this game. Pros It is in my opinion an AMAZING way to get together with friends and just absolutly wreck the town/each other. I think that there is no better way than to get together and just goof around. It s an amazing experience to play this game with other people who want to try out the same whacky s*** that you want to try! It s a great experience from the other versions of GTA online that we have been able to try. GTA 4 was awesome as hell but this adds so much onto it in such a tremendous way. The constant but limited in time DLC keeps you busy. Want to be a CEO or run a your own chapter in a bike gang? Do you want to spin loops and run like a cracked out bunny while possibly breaking speed records? You can! Even though the DLC isn t what everyone wants (cough cough zombies) It s still entertaining to see what they throw out at us. The full ability to customize/transfer your character. I m really glad this was an option.Cons The banning system that Rockstar has put on this game does more than just damper the experience. It leaves good and fair players in fear at the risk of getting temporarily or even permanatly banned. If you re like me and you have invested WAY to much time and money into your character getting banned is like having a chunk of you ripped from you and lit on fire. Over the course of the life of GTA V s life the system has gotten more and more strict on what players can and cannot do. This turns players off immensly. There are players who just want to watch the world burn literally. I was always paranoid on getting on public servers even before the ban switch was flipped. People are such a** munches when it comes to this game. yes I understand that It is a public lobby and that it does happen but there is a time when enough is enough. Shark Cards....The only way to get your bonus money is to actually buy it from the Rockstar site itself....Overalll GTA V is a stunningly beautiful game that has entertained me for hours. Yes it has its issues and no I m not neccissarily defending Rockstars ban system but if you have the right people this could be one of the most amazing games for you. Let this game bring you as much entertainment and joy as it has for me. Also remember not everyone out there in that world is out to get you. Some of us are actually good people.,Grand Theft Auto V

The story isn't as serious as GTA IV's story but it isn't wacky like what they did to Saints Row 3 and 4.GTA ONLINE ___________________It's quite obvious now that this game is filled with terrible paywalls and good GTAV youtubers like GTAMen and GypsyYT have videos that explain this in much more detail than I can.GTA Online has become Rockstar's and TakeTwo's cash cow because of shark cards.It is possible to grind for money in Online though it is time consuming and in the end probably not worth the time spent.GTA Online at first was very enjoyable having a world that you can explore with friends and such and nothing was really forced upon the players but in order to really enjoy the game now you'll either have to put in tons of hours grinding or pay Rockstar tons of money.BASICALLY___________________If you want a proper GTA experience any game before this one will suffice.Alternatively you could avoid GTA Online use FiveM (If you're into that sorta thing) or Singleplayer Modding.

2015-08-06,0,0,361,False,Not Recommended,"GTA V is without a doubt the most draconian and anti consumer product to have ever been released to any market since the invention of currency. Let me explain why From the ground up every feature of the game is designed with the primary purpose of limiting the amount of in game revenue you can earn. Buildings designed to keep vehicles stuck are placed under hills to ensure that if you're selling something and your car goes over the hill you lose all your product and thus you make less money. Extremely long cooldowns are placed on CEO businesses to ensure you can't make too much money. Modders are never banned until they start dropping money for people to take. Heists which are one of the only things designed before the game ruining microtransactions were implemented pay extremely well compared to the low quality businesses and cost a fifteenth as much to do. Every tiny feature is modified to ensure it hinders one's ability to earn money as much as possible. I could name dozens of other examples but I won't for the sake of time.The game is a non stop grind to earn enough money to buy the next ridiculously expensive toy only for updates to retroactively nerf it and introduce a new more overpowered and more expensive item. This has resulted in a level of power creep rarely seen in video games where you now have APCs which can ignore 10 direct RPG hits and flying motorcycles with homing rockets on them.Don't forget how terrible rockstar's support is. It often takes weeks to deal with basic issues if they even try at all. Bugs which have existed since 2013 are still unfixed. There are constant non ending loading screens that force you to exit GTA via task manager and restart it as well as a myriad of other glitches R* knows about but doesn't bother to fix.The singleplayer isn't remarkable enough to pay full price or even the 50% off price for.Is the game fun? Sort of. I've had enough of a head start to afford most of the toys (largely due to the few times the ever benevolent star graced us with x2 rewards for the most lucrative heist that brought in millions for me) However new players will be easily squashed by the nigh unkillable warstock vehicles and forced to grind heists and missions for hundreds of hours before they can even come close to competing.Never have I been able to recommend people to avoid a game more thoroughly. GTA V is a garbage fire propped up by microtransactions corporate greed and pure utter hatred for the consumer. There is no circumstance in which it is logical for anyone to recommend it. Avoid it and any future titles from Rockstar everyone knows damn well they'll be microtransaction riddled hellpits. Never in the history of my entire life have I so utterly loathed a ""product"".",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-20,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,"The single player side of this game is phenomenal. I'm very engaged into it and still haven't finished even half of it.The online side of this game is... Well have you ever been to a circus? It's the complete opposite. Modders overrun 50% of lobbies you get put into pulling every shenanigan in the book from increasing their in game level with cheats and making it impossible for you to kill them (or to survive them) to setting off mapwide perpetual explosions stealing your money just for being in the lobby with them attaching gigantic objects like f*cking forklifts to your player's head making it impossible for you to see where you're going and persisting with you to new lobbies.Most of the few remaining decent lobbies however fall victim to an extremely toxic player base seemingly overrun by people whose self image and confidence depend entirely on their ability to kill you and call you every profane word in the dictionary.As for actual content yeah the heists were cool at first but unless you've kept up with new releases (which by the way didn't happen for a few years) you'll find them impossible to get into because nobody does the older ones anymore. You either buy R*'s shark cards or suffer through incomplete lobbies or complete lobbies filled with people akin to what you'd find in a World of Warcraft raid finder group.Overall these days (unless R* cracks down heavily on modders which given how long they've been a problem probably either won't or can't happen) if you enjoyed the GTA series before and don't mind completely ignoring the online portion you will probably have a very enjoyable time playing the single player mode.I rate this game ""not recommended"" though because one of its most appealing features was the online play. Which I'll admit can still be fun at times. My real recommendation though is either (a) play with your friends and try to limit your exposure to complete strangers as much as possible or (b) join or start a crew and play only with them.",Grand Theft Auto V

The computer is a 2017 build and works flawless for other high demanding games. I feel Rockstar doesn't value it's customer base as other game labels.This game is the biggest cheaters paradise.

2015-04-15,2,4,74,False,Recommended,Firstly I have been waiting for this game since console release and swore to only play it on PC as I'm not a console fan. I pre ordered the game in January with much anticipation and excitement. Although the game was pushed back a couple times due to technical issues I didn't mind as I wanted GTA V to run correctly on my system I mean who wants a broken game? Secondly as soon as I launched the game when it became live I fell in love with it it is all I had hoped for and I'm incredibly impressed with the way it has been optimized. Unfortunately nothing is ever perfect and neither is this game. Day 2 after release and I can no longer continue with the game as it crashes with every mission I begin now as disappointing as this is I'm not angry like a lot of people are you need to allow the game a couple of weeks to allow Rockstar to iron out the game breaking bugs. Even though I haven't played as much storyline as I had hoped at this point I highly recommend it to any Rockstar Fanboy/Fangirl as it is one of the best games I have played in a very long time visually and performance wise.Well done Rockstar on an amazing game!,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-17,3,5,375,False,Recommended,GTAV is a great game. It is really. The visuals are stunning. Everything about the story/single player is fantastic. I previously had a long review about how the Online was kinda ed up but I got tired of even seeing it in my reviews list. Soooo I edited this review with a writing chainsaw.GTAV is beautiful complex interesting thrilling and funny. Since I'm also weak and attached to material possessions I'd just give it a 10/10 because it allows me to buy stupidly expensive supercars and to drive them slowly in the suburbs with dope music sending bass all around.The story is great and there are of course tons of easter eggs and things to discover. The game is also moddable which is nice.Now GTA Online is a great experience. Well it's true that there are... Hum... Well some loading times. And yeah it's true that apparently it's also moddable leading to lobbys being sometimes clean and sometimes full of hackers. But with the latest updates it's feels even more alive.And of course since I can also drive around town in my stupidly expensive cars and this time not only for my pleasure but for the pleasure of showing off like hell I still recommend playing it.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-12-09,0,0,314,False,Not Recommended,Mixed opinion on this game I love it but also hate it in their very own aspects. Story Mode should probably be a side purchase in my opinion not too many people play the game for that just GTA Online from what I've seen. But despite that the storyline seems to rush right into the bank robberies and explosions and bullet stuff. It could've done better but even to this day it can't compete with GTA San Andreas. Let alone GTA IV's story line. Grand Theft Auto Online on the other hand pretty much an economic nightmare is one way to say it. Want a car that can shoot missiles? Give Rockstar your money. Want to shoot anything pretty rad? Spend an overwhelming amount of time grinding for that level up or give Rockstar your money. Want to not give Rockstar your money? Get banned for trying to negotiate with that one dude you talked to earlier claiming his money drops are untracable. Want to drive around the block in that new convertible you bought on San Andreas Autos? Oops some modder popped into the lobby and decided to blow everyone up for who knows how many times. Overall opinion? I recommend the game if you have 2+ friends preferrably 4 to enjoy all of the content in GTA O. Story mode is pretty nice if you're looking to toy with some mods but my overall take on the game is to just be sure that you have friends. Otherwise you're looking at a really stale grind for hours on end that can leave you to be the overpowered social outcast of the server or just the outcast in the server in general. The game's fun though if you have enough friends to do a 4 man heist or if more a race can do just as well! The only downside with 4+ friends is you'll have to abandon a few if you really want to get to making money which can usually be achieved via Heists. Races or events tend to forget about the money and consider it a way to play with more than 4 friends with no money made whatsoever.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar have decided to ban the transfer accounts over which is pathetic. It says at the start of GTA Online ""if you cheat or hack in the game your account will be banned"" they also said that accounts will be detected as they monitor GTA accounts. If this was the case then why not have the transfer between consoles and pc. If they detect accounts that have been hacking they can ban them. Its simple you just destroy the game for some players. Soon enough the new playstation will be out and gta on ps4 will die. When it does die some people may want to go to pc that way they can save their GTA accounts and still have fun with it.

This for me was the last chance for this game but when i downloaded it (22 hours btw) i couldn't activate it. I searched the internet for solutions but it seems like people have been having this problem for 2 years now and there is still no easy solution. I understand not wanting people to pirate the game but when it gets to the point that not even an honest user can play it that's a little to far. So what if 1% of players pirate it.

2015-09-18,0,0,396,False,Not Recommended,The single player in GTAV is OK. I mean ok it's very short with very limited features if you never plan on going online and the post endgame is as in all GTA games boring with practically nothing to do.GTA Online on the other hand is a bigger cr*p than single player. Why? Lots of reasons The loading times you will spend the majority of your GTA Online experience watching the loading screen and if you're lucky like me and most of my crewmates you will lag out.. a lot.. and will need to re connect.. which means more waiting.. yay! Repetition (I mean sure heists are fun TDM and DM modes are fun racing is fun and the freemode events are fun... to some extent. But when you've done it about 5 6 times it gets repetitive and the loading times make it so much worse. Sessions why oh why god all mighty couldn't they make it possible to invite people from multiple sessions?? The game features so called sessions the map which is reserved for a set number of people (32 max I think?). If you want to start a heist and need people you may only invite the people from your current session or your crewmates. If no one from the session wishes to join you need to go into another session which means you guessed it! MORE DUCKING LOAD SCREENS!!!!! Lag FPS issues graphic glitches even on high end PCs you may experience graphic glitches and stuttering which you will not fix unless you join another session and pray to god / allah / buddha the glitches will disappear. If they won't just join yet another session and enjoy watching the same loading screens you have been watching for the past 10 hours.All in all do I recommend this game? No. Definitely not. The game has way too many bugs and way too many nuissances to have a fun time. If you wish to play only single player ask a friend to lend it to you or something but don't spend 60 EUR on it because I guarantee you will only be disappointed. And until they fix the basic problems with GTA Online trust me on this one YOU ARE NOT MISSING A DAMN THING! It is NOT fun it is NOT entertaining it is NOT all that great it's boring repetitive and as I said for an hour of gameplay you will only play like 10 minutes and wait the other 50 minutes reading loading screens.You have been warned.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-21,2,3,345,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is probably the game that has been the hardest to decide whether or not to recommend. It has a lot of good and it has a lot of bad. On one hand it has a huge open world with a lot to do ranging from races many creative and fun pvp modes coop heists and everything you'd expect to be able to do in a vast open world game except hunt wtf? Hunting and being hunted by animals with friends in Red Dead Redemption was an absolute blast and it's available in solo play why not online? Anyways the Singleplayer is enjoyable and long. Some of the stupidest tiest fun you'll ever have will probably be in this game whether it's flying off a mountain and catapulting your friend out of your technicals mounted gun and having the two trucks your escorting follow to trying to pick up your friend riding a dirtbike with a helicopters hook hooking him by the head and sending him flying a hundred feet into the air. GTA Online supports custom maps as well with a wide variety of BMX tracks Snipers vs Cars Impossible BMX tracks Money hacks that don't actually work but are always popular for some reason horribly made BMX tracks and something fun every once in awhile in between the hundreds of the previously mentioned.GTA V also has some of the stupidest t in gaming ranging from $100 Shark Cards that give you in game $6M which can't afford some of the more expensive purchases ($100 of your cash in addition to $60 can't buy you a yacht) to hackers removing all of your weapons trapping you in a box and teleporting you underwater a mile off the coast. For reference the most expensive car is $2M not including another at least $500k worth of upgrades and customization. Yachts can reach near $8M the new offices and warehouses can combined reach over $6M and Aircraft ranging to over $6M and averaging around $3M. The real issue here comes down to heists. The best heist the Pacific Standard Job can earn up to $1.2M usually unequally split among 4 people with whoever hosted the heist earning more since he had to pay to start it. This heist almost sets you up to fail attempting to make you drive nearly across the map on motorbikes with 5 stars. Here's where it gets even more fun every time you take damage you lose money and lost money does NOT reset if you die and restart at the latest checkpoint. Between the setups and the heist it usually takes about and hour and a half on a good day to sometimes make UP TO 500k for youself. OH YEAH and that $1.2M is only on the hardest difficulty. Otherwise it's 500k or 1M. Missions and minigames aren't worth earning about 200 300k over the course of a few hours depending on what you play. You can always rob stores for $1252 out of the register all day. The UI is also the worst ever. You can't start a public private invite only or closed session while in multiplayer. Instead you must exit multiplayer into singleplayer which with a good computer is at least 3 minutes of loading go to the Online options and spend another 3 8 minutes (my friend with a good laptop actually takes 8 minutes tested) to load back into online and have a half decent chance to get kicked back to singleplayer due to connection issues. Then you do it all over again cause you really want to play with your friends without getting killed by some bag with a jet only to have everyone end up disconnecting 10 minutes later. If you want to race pvp anything regarding the missions with your friends expect everybody to be split into random lobbies and having to start the entire ing process from the start. The UI is also really unresponsive and is unecessarily confusing and frustraing to navigate which really adds to the whole experience. Now this doesn't happen most of the time but it happens enough to be irritating as hell and worth mentioning.I want to say don't support Rockstar and this half broken unbalanced extra DRM cash cow hackfest that is GTA Online but at the same time some of the most fun I've had in gaming as existed because of this game. To be fair though a good amount of that fun was had while using mods to spawn in (in a private game i might add) invincible clowns with tazers that would follow you ing everywhere and show up randomly one hour later out of nowhere and taze your friend for 10 minutes straight while you laugh uncontrollably because there's not a whole lot you can do to stop an invincible tazer clown. That ended quick when we got banned though. Speaking of bans many people who don't mod also get banned. Regardless what you do with mods whether you have fun in private lobbies use it to exploit money hacks so you don't have to grind for hundreds of hours to get the cool use it to be a total dickhole to everybody or simply happen to be in the same session with someone who does any of that you might get banned. ConclusionIt basically comes down to you can have a lot of stupid and enjoyable fun doing ridiculous things in a vast open world with a lot of options ranging from flying helicopters and planes to exploring the depths of the ocean with submersibles that can reach hundreds of hours but it comes at a pretty big price between $60 WAY overprice Shark Cards hitting up to $100 A lot of the fun and progression revolving around owning money modders getting banned from said modders free mode holes restarting a heist 10 times a day because either someone sucks can't communicate can't pull their weight or leaves mid heist or grinding for literal hundreds of hours to reach a high enough level and earn enough money to reach end game unlocks etc.,Grand Theft Auto V

Factor Rating Gameplay 9 Story 7 Graphics 8 Content 8 Mechanics 9 Challenge 7 Diversity 8 Mapping 10 Soundtrack 7 Interface 9 Pricing 8 Performance 9 Replayability 8 Online/DLC ( 3 for server issues and waiting time) 6 Personal 7 SCORE 8.0/10Factors are in descending order of importance. Ratings are separate to each factor despite the overall opinion regarding the game. However they are given equal importance while calculating the average. 2 Cents Grand Theft Auto always has been a bar on how open world third person shooter games have been perceived. And V doesn't disappoint in that regard. If you have been a fan of the previous games go with this one without an afterthought. You get a huge pleasant open world to rip in. You get to do bizarre in a set of compelling missions in the campaign. And if that's not enough you can team up with your friends in multiplayer to do similar missions in co op including better heists than most of the single player missions. But the game does come with a couple of issues. The story though stronger than most GTAs is nowhere close to the bar that games have set these days. Side missions has never been a high point for the GTA games and that proves true in this one as well. While the game is filled with a lot of things you won't do it lacks things that you'd love to do that are not part of the main narrative. The game follows a linear format through the whole campaign up until the very end where you get the binary choice of the kind of ending you want. I went for the ending where Michael dies because he was my favorite character. This ending gave the story the kind of serious tone that the whole narrative needed. Where the whole thing comes full circle. Michael betrays the people who trusted him and ends up with the same fate just before everything was about to be alright. The other two were too superficial to be true.Getting to GTA Online. While the missions have been well made and the system is a fantastic attempt. It lacks 2 very things that are the backbone of any online experience Seamless matchmaking and people to play. I'm in no way stating that the online is barren and no one is available to play with anymore. But even with all those people who want to play it is still not very smooth to get 4 people to do a heist. The most absurd thing is the minimum requirement of 4 people even in set up missions which can be done by a 1 3 people as well. You need 3 more players with you to play online. And if you're lucky you'd be able to get a mission started in the first 15 minutes. Never happened with me though. The game becomes really cheap during sales and is very well optimized for even medium end PCs. Even the campaign is worth the money and I feel GTA V is a must have.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-14,2,14,643,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas (based around Southern California) the single player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from the government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas which includes open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). The game is played from either third person or first person view and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. You control the three lead protagonists throughout the single player mode switching between them both during and outside of missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences many of the missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. Outside of missions you can freely roam the big open world. Mostly composed of the San Andreas open countryside area and fictional city of Los Santos the world of Grand Theft Auto V is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. The single player mode lets players control three characters Michael De Santa Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. You can use melee attacks firearms and explosives to fight enemies and may run jump swim or use vehicles to navigate the world. Throughout single player you may switch between the protagonists at will by using directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch between the characters automatically in single player missions to complete the objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if is in danger and needs help and flash white if he has a advantage. Overall I give GTA V a 9/10 stars it is a huge improvement to it's predecessor. I absolutely recommend you get this game because I am just absolutely without single doubt sure that Grand Theft Auto V will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-26,0,0,77,False,Recommended,A fantastic single player experience. If you've played a GTA game before then you know what to expect. A massive open world with a huge amount of detail lots of action and comedy. This time around you get to play as three different main characters which all have their charms and unique qualities. The story will keep you busy for a long time and there is a heap of side missions to work on too. Sadly the multiplayer aspect falls far short in comparison. Ridiculously long load times which will happen too often just to be thrown into a match with cheaters. Yes cheaters. Rockstar have done nothing to stop the cheaters and they just keep increasing as time goes on. At one point people were being banned for receiving money from cheaters which just make people run around throwing money at everyone to get them banned. The cheaters themselves have had nothing happen to them. Online could and should have been so much better implemented which is really disappointing.I highly recommend the game for single player. If you only want to play online then keep an eye on the forums and when/if they start cleaning the game up and banning cheats then think about picking it up.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,62,False,Not Recommended,If I have the time to make a detailed review of this game it would be focused on the Singleplayer portion since I have no friends to play with on GTA O. It would be positive because I really enjoyed playing the story mode of the game back in last gen and since I got the game on PC the only thing that would enhance my singleplayer experience is with mods. But oh boy Take Two Interactive just gotta it up don't they?On the 14/15th of June T2 sent a cease &amp desist notice to the team behind OpenIV which is a tool that allows you to open up and extract/replace those game files or you know letting you mod GTAV as easy as pie. http //gtaforums.com/topic/889348 openiv/Now of course I have no intention of using mods to ruin other players' fun on Online Mode but if you officially decided that it's not okay for us to use them on Singleplayer then do realise that we will be about it and more likely to uninstall and forget about the game altogether therefore losing consumers that would buy your stupid sharkcards on the Multiplayer portion of the game that is ironically filled with cheaters while in the meantime innocent players gets falsely banned.Seriously if you don't rethink your disgraceful decision then on the behalf of the OpenIV team bugger off you You ain't worth our time anymore.And also you for abandoning Singleplayer and giving Multiplayer all the treatment just because it makes you money.

Which i dont complain about as its easier to grind cash in your own public session (there arent any high level players flying around in jets hunting ground targets for daily objectives). Invite only lobbies work great with friends.Overall a really great game. I would recommend it to any of the GTA series fans out there. Follows the GTA V story perfectly and is extremely immersive. Id recommend getting it on sale as they come around quite often but if you have some extra wallet and are looking to get started by all means dive right in. My rating 9.5 / 10,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-09-23,0,0,33,False,Not Recommended,I dont play online so I cant say anything about that but if you just want to play offline its not a great game. I really liked the dinamic between the 3 main characters but thats about it. Plenty of bugs. A couple missions not starting even though I'm at the right place. Two times after hours trying to start a mission I finally gave up and went to look up what do to just to find out I was doing the right thing but nothing was happening. After restarting the game everything went fine but its really annoying.The amount of time you waste driving to missions is far greater than the time you spend more time to get to missions than actually doing them. The heists are the only good part but they are far too few and to short. Planes and helicopters are annoying as hell. And most anoying of all rockstar club or whatever its called. For me sometimes it just wouldn't connect. Double DRM crap.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,1,1,397,False,Not Recommended,Overall the singleplayer gameplay is an enjoyable experience from start to finish especially if you throw a couple of your favourite mods in the mix. 9/10 would replay again! (No singleplayer DLC tho ever... F*ck you.)The multiplayer ONLINE mode is a myth and a scam developed by Rockstar's hungriest moneygrabs during the third reich. Grinding is extremely slow and paying huge amounts of real money for a couple of in game big ones is somewhere between burning money and raising a child it's just disappointing and a waste. And what about cheat prevention? Do not spend 8 hours grinding for that sweet sweet cheddar 'cause you run the risk of getting all that money removed by Rockstar because 'that money might be cheated'.! (I wouldn't know since I don't grind for money or xp. I just hear tales about it.) If you only want to play Grand Theft Auto V for it's official multiplayer mode instead you should buy some pizza and use the remaining money on hookers and cocaine.But there's a mod for the game that allows hosting your own servers independent of the sh*tty ONLINE mode so that's nice.

2015-05-04,0,0,615,False,Recommended,"Of course a great game. And if it would not have all these annoying restrictions cooldowns and the ability to go straight into a private friend only session it would have been the perfect game. When driving around in los santos you get cursed at at least twice every second. But trying to make a number plate with the same language is forbidden. That's just stupid and hypocritical. For a game that is called ""Grand theft auto"" you can only do a ""grand theft auto"" once a gameday because of restriction. God forbid you could make money easy with stealing cars cus after earning billions we need more of your money so buy shark cards kid! You can't do this or that because there's a cooldown for 5 10 15 30 minutes. For most things in online mode you will have a cooldown timer which gets pretty annoying. When alt tabbing to google something you get kicked within 2 minutes from a friends only session where you are playing alone and put into a public zone. Stupid. First of all why kick me in the first place what is the reason for that and why can't it remember i was in a friends only session? When switching online characters you get put in a public session have to go back to story mode then you can goto a friend only session. Which amounts to 3 to 4 minutes of useless loading the same again and again. The interface is a pita i'm aware that it's made for consoles but couldn't they dedicate some time in the already long time it took to release it on the PC to make the interface a bit better for us PC players? For instance when you want to use a snack you gotta go through 3 or 4 layers of this bloody menu where it could have been tied to just one key. The heist should have been do able with only two players and the other 1 or 2 optionally replaced with Ai. That way you are not forced to play with idiots that leave after joining dying or generally messing up the missions. Now with the latest update you are forced to play in a public session which most of us are trying to avoid because it's just a deathmatch filled with hackers and griefing idiots. It's just irritating.Even with all the irritations the game is of course good. But to be honest a game should not annoy or irritate you.

2017-06-03,0,0,820,False,Not Recommended,"With almost 400 hours of pure online on PC I can tell you without a doubt this game is amazing. It's incredible. It's one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played it basically reinvented what a mutliplayer game could actually be.I've met amazing people made friendships and broken them over this game.It became my life for a few months.I've not experienced 100% of GTAO but I will give you my honest review over everything I have experienced good and bad and sum up why I don't recommend this game to anybody.PROS 1. It's the most fun you will ever have with your friends.THE most fun.It's the most fun you will ever have with people you don't even know.THE most fun.It's the most fun you will ever have with people that you ing hate.THE most fun.2. Beautiful. I can't believe a game that launched on PS3/360 wound up climbing to the top to become the most beautiful gameI have ever played and enjoyed to run at a pristine framerate at that.3. The foundation of this game should be how every game strives to be. Completely open. No bars. But GTA has always been that way I'm sure I don't need to tell that to you. CONS 1. The community is insecure and I don't blame them.The way interaction functions is to be expected in a GTA game you can do whatever you want Especially to other players.

2017-06-23,0,0,78,False,Recommended,Full disclosure I've played GTA V since 2013 on console and PC.This game is an absolute triumph the overworld is beautifully detailed. The campaign is great. The amount of cars you can own legally is also astounding. Credit needs to be given to Rockstar for really going all in on the social commentary as well. On PC the game is even better. It is astonishingly well optimised.Recently Take Two Interactive filed a cease and desist against OIpen IV a modding tool for the Single Player campaign. Rockstar very recently convinced Take Two to retract this cease and desist (source https //support.rockstargames.com/hc/en us/articles/115009494848). I am really glad this is the case. I am not much of a modder but I will always endorse the freedom consumers have to mess with game code for their own personal use.As a result I'm giving this a positive review.GTA Online on the other hand is still loaded with cheaters and is skewed very heavily toward users who buy Shark Cards. Can't blame Rockstar either as they made like $700 million USD last year. Very cool.But yeah buy this game. It's absolutely worth the money for the single player alone.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-30,0,0,134,False,Recommended,The long wait has been worth it. If you re a PC gamer who s spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest greatest GTA then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. Sure the Xbox One and PS4 versions were amazing delivering GTA 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures smoother surfaces better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below) but the PC version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the PC s strengths. In doing so it adds a few more metres to one of gaming s towering achievements.Having covered the game twice already we won t go too far into the detail of what makes GTA 5 so good. Partly it s a question of experience. With four previous 3D GTAs under its belt plus Red Dead Redemption Bully and assorted DLC packs Rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems and GTA 5 has the best driving the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series.It s also a question of structure. Dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from Michael s ageing career criminal saga to Franklin s ambitious hoodlum story to Trevor s crazed amoral brand of mayhem where the dumb cathartic slapstick violence we all deep down love GTA for finds its natural home. With repeated play it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with Rockstar s savage satirical take on the Californian dream.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-04,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"Talking before the update that made everyone hate it which is when I quit the game it seemed pretty good.It ran 40+ frames on my craptop so it was well optimised for an open world game of the detail level that it had. The controls seemed a tiny bit clunky but still gave a realistic feel as the pay off. The storylines seemed for a video game fairly realistic compared to other competitors in this genre (Saints row for example).The downside is the waiting. Like Saints Row 2 you have to do things before you could start the next mission.But it wouldn't tell you what you needed to do. It just expected you to do them.I never completed this game because the waiting and dumb chores were terrible. They were increasingly more annoying to complete as the game went on and practically forced me to give up not even mid way through the game. Saints Row 2's infamy system or whatever it was was bearable to me. I enjoyed it it made me do all these extra little things that I wouldn't have done other wise. GTA V's system makes me go to the middle of no where just to complete a task that I don't wish to do just to drive the story forward in a completely different section of the game.If you're okay with this or you're here SOLELY for the multiplayer then I can highly recommend the game to you. If you disliked Saints Row 2 SPECIFICALLY for the system they had in place then do NOT get this game for the single player experience. I never made it far enough in multiplayer or ""online"" to truly comment on how well that plays out with heists and such. I've heard good things but I recommend staying away from random players from the rumours I've heard.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-10,0,0,128,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is an odd game to review. The singleplayer was enjoyable in my opinion definitely what I'd expect from a Grand Theft Auto game. Then there's the online mode. There are a lot of different opinions on the online and personally I found it really fun. It's great to play with your friends and I spent most of my hours in the online mode just messing about. I do however find the monetisation of the online mode very predatory if you don't decide to waste money on the micro transaction it will become a very long and boring grind to purchase the best items. I still think this is a good game I just wish there was less emphasis on micro transactions however with the amount of money they've made from this game it's likely that future Rockstar games will only focus more on micro transactions. Let's just hope they don't ruin any games with micro transactions in the future. 7.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-01-10,0,0,73,False,Recommended,Product received for free. My friend gifted this game to me since he knew how much I loved GTA but now I m not so sure. GTA V is a great game (I ve played it ever since it first came out) the storyline is amazing and you will feel a kinda connection with anyone of the three characters in the game. Soundtrack is amazing as well for anyone but the only thing that makes GTA V bad is Multiplayer. GTA Online is great but it does have flaws like the Shark Cards and the new DLC s that cost a lot of in game and if you do buy a Shark card Real life money. GTA Online does bring players together to pull off great missions and amazing heists but the new Heist that came in seems more like a cash grab is anything. The past few DLC have seemed like this but The Doomsday Heist is one main culprits in the game. For a game more about trying to make money and getting to the top the game is taking away your actual money just for a few things in your in game bases. GTA V is a great game but don t be foolish and fall into the trap of Shark Cards for GTA Online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-13,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,"This game was gifted to me by a friend who bought it for full price....If i would know this had so little gameplay hours for 60 bucks i would refund it immediatly and give the money back to my friend.Sit down and grab a drink or a snack folks as this is gonna be quite a lengthy review.Whoever wants a good game with a good story you may wanna go check other games (such as Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain even its lacking story for a Metal Gear game is better than this one and the gameplay is astounding)The missions are extremely repetitive which comes down to ""go here shoot them while spamming your gun behind this cover/spam your gun at them"" ""take this after you killed them"" maybe ""drive after this guy to this location and shoot the people there"" or shoot the driver thats it.Gun mechanics are extremely noob friendly in the manner that they are near laser accurate and have no recoil (some of them have very slight recoil) unless you are in first person view mode which gives you abit more of a challange to use guns but its really not worth it considering just how choppy the first person mode is no way to explain it its just BAD.Online is a more dull version with a few more dull additions to it and luckily a few non dull ones.The standard missions may be a good quick fix but they get extremely boring after the 3rd go also coming down (and this time literally) to ""go there shoot then take this drug/get back this veichle"".The online missions are just one of many gamemodes the game has to offer ranging from them car races survival and PvP.PvP is just plain awful lets begin with that when everyone are quite slow have stable and near laser accurate guns and jumping being utterly useless for dodging the attacks its like the wild west whoever pulls the trigger first wins. (unless the enemy has a one shot sniper rifle which in that case you are ed unless you also have it)Survival is probably my most hated one you and possibly a few more of you friend are up to 10 waves of AI that increase in their numbers and firepower as the game progresses sounds good right? until you realize that even after the early waves the only way to pass it is to find a cover spot where the AI cant shoot you from at all and spam your guns from behind cover but no worries to makes this harder you dont have your crosshair out while you are spamming your guns!(not a problem to people who played other crosshairless games such as Killing Floor PAYDAY 2 and even Battlefield hardcore mode which i happened to play all of them and i find the lack of crosshair meaningless)The car races are actually good driving is very solid you got some bonuses here and there on the road to help you out you gotta know how to dodge the incoming cars without losing speed or needless to say bump into them and there can be wonderful racing courses made by other players and of course do stunts!This game also has flying!Actually this part was also made quite nicely probably the hardest out of shooting/driving/flying and again even this gets boring after a while UNLESS you decide to pull off some amazing stunts but im gonna save that for laterAnd then we have the feature that was praised by most people ive met that played GTA V the heists as a PAYDAY 2 player with well over 1000+ hours i couldnt wait myself to see how the heists in this so far incredibly dull 60 bucks game would play out but 60 bucks is 60 bucks i guess.It was awful.These so called ""heists"" are basically a bunch of standard missions put down to one... how should i call it.... ""campagin""coming down to the same things ive already mentioned with the only difficult part about them being the driving (which again greatly done).Besides all of these gamemodes you can do alot more you can buy yourself a fancy house (which isnt as cool as it sounds you basically got a building and you buy an apartment in it and you can't customize it) buy yourself a car modify your car to be better get yourself a gun from the decent amount of guns this game as to offer (most guns of the same cathegory function the same at least that's how they feel to me) modify your guns! (only difference it makes is scope as far as it comes to noticeable gun performance)and buy stuff for your lovely character.The open world is very lacking the only things you can do is 1)shoot innocent civilians to get the cops attention.2) fight off the cops you've just called upon yourself.3)rob a gas station and call cops by doing so.4)repeat 2.5)randomally pick on other players who don't wanna have any trouble with anyone and just wanna relax and enjoy the game.6)Probably the best one pull off some actually amazing stunts with cars airplanes bikes or a combination of all of them!In the short time i played in the multiplayer i only encountered assh*les you either get uncooperative people in your missions or be harassed by someone in free roaming for 15 minutes like a guy who said i was mediocre in life for not being as good as him in GTA V *cries in the corner*.You CAN improve the lacking gameplay with tons of mods that people have made (such as shooting cars out of your minigun and airplanes all around the sky shooting at your and crashing at you in an attempt to kill you) but knowing there have been mods that were created with viruses as well i decided to avoid them altogether.Overall? 2/10 this game is too dull for a 60 bucks one.",Grand Theft Auto V

However there is one thing that works if i go into my device management and disable my graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060) and then launch the game the game sometimes loads but on god awful settings and even on these settings it's still unplayable because of how unresponsive it is for example i would try to move and it will continuously move without stopping at all and i can never change weapon or do any actions in the game. so basically it either never loads up or it works but to the point of it being unplayable and not being able to do anything at all almost. IF ANYONE KNOWS WHAT THIS IS AND CAN HELP ME OUT PLEASE LET ME KNOW. Oh and also (if this helps at all) im using an Alienware laptop thats fairly new and can run loads of other games such as the witcher 3 rainbow 6 siege for honor and warframe all on the highest settings possible. NON OF THESE GAMES HAVE PROBLEMS IN ANY WAY AT ALL SO I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT ISNT WORKING. please help me if you can or know what this is (no youtube videos i've seen have helped me either),Grand Theft Auto V

Yes they are taking forever. Especially when you are joining online after launching the game jesus christ that thing takes forever. I could find myself wondering if the loading screen was bugged or if it was just taking forever. Rockstar should improve this. Hackers are a big issue especially when they like to destroy your game. (Deleting your guns trapping you). But hey R* is making those banwaves coming faster than ever. Toxic community? I'd say I've met more normal people than on any other game. There are some people that are randomly killing you swallowing their mic while holding the voice chat button or purposely ruining missions or heists but let's be honest you will meet those kids everywhere these days.Sharkcards and expensive DLCs?

2017-09-09,0,0,94,False,Not Recommended,The game's terrible and not worth your hard earned money. Online is the main thing I'm gonna talk about since story mode isn't really that fun. Story mode is pretty boring the missions don't feel worthwhile and once you're done there's not anything else for you to do except get a mod menu and even though it's fun to see what you can do with it it gets pretty monotonous. So basically when you've completed all of the missions you're never going back to story mode ever again. The story is actually quite confusing trying to combine 3 characters into one main plot isn't a good way to go. They should've stuck with one main character. The things you can do in story mode are what make it better you're rich after completing the last heist so you can pretty much do anything you want after that UNLIKE what I am going to be talking about below.The only other option left for you after story mode would be GTA Onlne. I'm only rank 20 so there are VERY MANY limitations and options for you to do. Online is mostly a grind really because the only thing you're going to be doing is jobs and you're going to be paid 20k for each half an hour job when a car you really want costs 2 million. It's pretty much a pay to play game shark cards are the only way you can get everything you want. The problem is they keep releasing update after update in an annoying way where they release a new car or event every week and there's no way possible to actually get all of it without paying! And if you don't buy the new things coming out Ron or Agent 14 will keep pestering you about it every time you log on to Online!! **** THEM! Maybe some people just don't want to pay 100 bucks for 8 million in game cash that will probably be used to buy ONE FREAKING CAR!!! And the player base is absolutely terrible! If somebody that has friends with them doesn't want you in their session they can just kick you out even if you're not even bothering them! If you and your friend just want to have fun delivering an import/export car to a dealer there will not be any more fun when they BOMB YOU WITH A TULA AND DESTROY ALL THAT HARD WORK THAT YOU PUT SO MUCH EFFORT INTO TO GET!!! This is the only thing those types of players want to do in this game just ruin other people's time. OH BUT JUST YOU WAIT!!! I'M NOT FINISHED YET!!! REMEMBER THE MODDERS?!?!? YEAH I THOUGHT YOU WOULD!!! THEY ARE THE IEST THING I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH!!! They teleport you all over the place so you can never get anything done they display FAKE BAN MESSAGES ON MY SCREEN THEY MAKE MY CAR DISAPPEAR AND THEY can make it say that you killed everybody in the session to MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU ARE THE MODDER!!! WHAT THE ROCKSTAR?!?!? I THOUGHT YOU WERE BETTER THAN THIS!!! Oh and the LOADING TIMES!!! IT's like I'm playing Loading Screen Simulator V instead of the actual game. Yes you heard me. You will be spending more time looking at a loading screen than actually playing the damn game. To get onto GTA Online you will spend 15 minutes looking at a screen that displays 4 different messages about new things coming out. If you want to do a heist or an adversary mode there's always that one player that you can't kick who is stuck on a loading screen and you can't start the game.Please for the love of everything that you love and care about just DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! PLEASE!!!!,Grand Theft Auto V

It's an amazing game with so many vehicles and now planes and just a game I can play with friends and just have a generally good time.Though I can't recommend it.It sucks you in and you still hate it but you can't just stop playing it it's a daily grind where you just have to spend countless hours just to buy a plane you'll never fly again.The fact that R* has taken legitimate money from honest players is baffling yet they don't remove my friend's money after he got 30 mil the day before the new update. Absolutely ridiculous.They ban modders because they ""make the game unfair"" and ""break the system"". However don't your shark cards (that cost an insane amount of money) do the same thing? Put the player at a disadvantage from other people who can afford to throw away thousands of dollars? No wonder there's a modder community people have to earn money some way.I love this game but I can't recommend the Online.If you're getting it for the Story Mode be my guest every mission (except the Strangers and Freaks they get old way too fast) are action packed and different and very enjoyable.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-09,0,0,463,False,Not Recommended,When is Rockstar going to figure out that GTA V Online is nearly unplayable?I guess the thing that frustrates me the most is that it's a really great game. It has so many cool features and game modes the graphics are amazing the racing is nuts and it runs so darn well on my computer in every way except the user interface. Anyway I just picked it back up the last couple of days and now I remember why I stopped playing it. It has by far the worst menu system and server queuing system of any game I have played ever. Ghost Bear's Legacy on my 56k modem was a dream to get going compared to this nonsense. It makes it so you aren't even playing most of the time but waiting for load times and extremely slow turnover on racing and challenges. It's like this for 5 years and my computer today is about 4 times as fast as the computer I was using when I first purchased GTA V with no appreciable decrease in load time.To even start the game with friends one would logically click GTA V Online which takes about 2 5 minutes to get going. Then it takes you to some random open world server regardless of what your friends are doing or anything. So you have to then join on your friends which could be anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Finally we're all in a server together after at least 2 30 and up to 10 minutes. ANY other game in my catalog is no more than 1 minute but whatever it's only 5 years old.Now once you've waded up 12K miles of clogged Internet there's FOUR completely disparate menu systems to make sense of. Hit escape that's a menu. Hit home that's a menu. Hit the up arrow you better believe that's another menu. And just when you thought surely no he was exaggerating like the maniac he obviously is you guessed it! Just try that M key over there. ANOTHER MENU!Once we get that sorted we can actually look for the actual game we're going to play. Can we pull up a server list? Nope! Use your cell phone and its still frequently disfunctional auto matchmaking system leaving some friend dropped so your friend isn't going to be put in the same server as you so you want to cancel the search but there's no cancel anywhere to be seen so you and three friends wind up in a full server and we all have to quit back to the open world to start all over which takes another 30 seconds to 5 minutes.Did you get dropped because you were waiting for your friends to get loaded for 10 straight minutes? No problem! Let's just rejoin a completely random server instead of the server you were in with your friends 10 seconds ago.There's plenty of other examples but the point being that all of this results in only getting to play the game like 60% of the time you're spending in front of the screen. 70% if things are going really well and 20% if things just keep glitching over and over.I get it the cell phone seemed like a cool idea but having to join an open world twice before even getting to pick a game mode is silly. I should be able to click GTA Online and within 2 minutes be playing with my friends. I would play so darn much GTA V if that were so but I'm going to have to give up on it to play games like Counter Strike and Rocket League both of which are loaded with all four buddies in a fraction of the time and we're actually playing like 95% of the time.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-23,0,0,121,False,Not Recommended,Can't believe i'm saying this but Rockstar for whatever reason has gone completely incompetent. They port GTA 5 to pc years later and admittedly it's a pretty good port. But they hardly even support single player modding and instead allow online to be completely overrun. The single player is great looks great etc.Now for the updates. Updates have caused the game to go from running perfectly to stuttering frame drops out of nowhere and countless other problems. GTA Online for PC is a complete craphole. Modders/cheaters in every other free roam lobby. They can boot you from vehicles force you to kill yourself and everyone else on the server ruining your reputation and potentially getting you moved away from other players. They can spawn virtually anything they want and teleport anywhere they want. The last update not only destroyed FPS but it was nothing but overpriced vehicles so they can sell more cash cards. I will reconsider buying games from Rockstar again. They finally cracked. They were one of the last few developers who stuck to their guns but this game has proven to me that they're slipping.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-11,0,0,124,False,Recommended,"Beyond the questionable business practices during the Steam Summer Sale the game is very very good.The single player is your usual fare with a unique mechanic of being able to transfer between three different characters. Going through some of the story it's checking off some of the same beats as the previous incarnations of the series. Someone pisses off some kind of cartel and the next ten hours of gameplay is cleaning that mess up before doing it all over again. Not that this is a bad thing it's just... expected.The game shines ever so slightly for GTA Online which is basically a modern day sandbox MMO that I've always wanted. People talk about hackers auto murdering entire lobbies and making millions of dollars litter the streets but I have yet to encounter any of this. So either people are exaggerating the ""plague"" of hackers or they've cleaned up the servers before the two days I've owned the game.The game sort of forces you into a couple of races and deathmatches before it unlocks the full array of activities and there simply wasn't a hack to be seen and I won most of those entry level matches.Beyond that there's an ocassional trigger happy player that kills me but it's more of a temporary inconvenience than a rage inducing event. And if they are the type to continously hunt you down I'm two buttons away from a different server so even that wasn't an issue.GTA O however remains to be a lot of fun. After gaining a few levels you're a few button presses away from countless activities you can play from competative or otherwise. I like doing a spree of cooperative missions followed by a freeroam around town to buy some clothing steal and save a new car followed by a heist.If I had a request heists need to be redone a bit. I've only succeeded in one (And only because the main guy really knew what he was doing). The rest are just conga lines of failure and it would be nice if heist hosts could reassign jobs if someone was... less than stellar. I can't drive planes to save my life so that's just a failing notion if I ever end up being assigned such.GTA O is sort of a granted wish I didn't know I had.

2016-08-15,0,0,972,False,Recommended,"Great game even though the software is incredibly terrible at times (mainly GTA Online). Online lobbies aren't servers they're peer to peer connections. As a result cheating is an issue and is harder to address. You're connecting to players a player in Asia will have a terrible connection to you causing their character (and NPC assets that have/could interact with them) to glitch around and lag to you. On occaison you will disconnect from the other players in the session kicking you into your own lobby. Yes this can happen while playing with friends. Alt + F4 does not hard crash the game (like it should). It puts you into a pause menu asking you to confirm you want to quit. If you get shot at in an online lobby and you are in the pause menu it kicks you out of the pause menu which can be irritating when trying to change settings/leave a lobby in which you are being spawnkilled. ""Free"" DLC It's blocked by a paywall of ingame money. Rockstar has made over $500 million off of the in game microtransactions. The newer cars they've added with pricetags of $2.5m ingame cost an equivalent of $40 USD. The Finance and Felony content update requires you to have a CEO office (min price of $1m ingame) and a warehouse ( $200k iirc). Most of the future content updates are gta online only. New supercars lowriders only exist in online. With that being said the singleplayer game is worth the $60 on its own.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-23,0,0,265,False,Recommended,I have played over 500 hours on this game on PS3 and PS4 I have to say this game is even better that anyting the consoles can offer. This game is more fun with friends and that is not going to change when you try and play with strangers you will not get anywhere SO MAKE FRIENDS trololol P ! When you are new to playing GTa Online you are best joining a crew or a clan that has a Team Speak server as this way you might find sone people who are will help you get better at the game and also some money D. When you are looking for people to play with just google GTA Online team speak server's you will be sure to find something. Some other pros to this game are the Cars which are ace when you have more than enought to choose from as you can never decide which one to use glad they have added a new top dog car now too!!! This is something you are going to have to work up too as it is 2 million P which is no easy to get /. I have to say one of the worst things in this game is the fact that you cannot seem to get rid of you're guns which is BAD as when you have all the guns in the game you get favouties which are even harder to find in the mess which is the menu system for the guns / this needs to be improved as it's terriable which os so annoying!

The characters are quite unique and have their own story that the game tells you in a great way the transiction between every character is flawless and innovative. The story is probably the best in the franchise with a decent ammount of choices and lot of explanation given so you don't miss any detail. The guns feel good the world feels alive the cars feel real the NPC's feel alive and not for one second this game felt nothing less than a true masterpiece.

Great plot perfect graphic amazing details.But the reason why am I giving this game a thumb down is because 1 ) GTA Online is the biggest problem and reason why I dont recommend this game for online gaming ( for SP its great but price is still high AF )2.) In GTA Online you see more loading screens than you actually play. 3.) A lot of cheaters played GTA Online for 4 hours and already encountered 3 cheaters that were killing everyone on the map at the same time by explosion. WTF are you doing with that money R*? You could have the best servers and anti cheat countermeasure. But you just focus on makey money from us by spending it on in game sh*t.4.) Very annoying news from all sides about in game things or what activity you should do etc.5.) Bad balance in teams some 4 dudes can be in team with lvl 60 and more together but team with low lvl and me with 2 other low lvl dudes and lets play now. You have 0 chance to freaking win anything. LEARN HOW TO BALANCE TEAMS! MY QUESTION AGAIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ALL THAT MONEY?! FIX THIS SCHEIZE NOW!6.) Sometime lags stuttering and crazy psychics. Some dude hardly scratched me with his car and I just flew away like if I was hit by running HULK with Thors hammer in his hand.Really with all that money and how many years is this game out I just cant believe how you dont give a damn about issues in GTA Online.

2018-12-30,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,I own this game on the 360 and decided to buy it on steam so I can try out the online aspect. Unfortunately I got a permanent ban for no reason. I have wrote to rockstar and have never got an answer as to why I got the ban. I have only logged into online 3 or 4 times.. I have done nothing wrong on my part that would warrent a ban let alone a permanent ban. The times I sat down to play I had to get up to help with my son and have logged out. So maybe rockstar sees that as suspicious activity for whatever reason. Buy at your own risk since you may get banned for no reason. Its a great game its just to bad bans are given with no real reasons. I have never even used cheat codes in single player so to be banned from online blows my mind. Had I would of read the comments before hand I would have saved myself $35 bucks.. Edit On another note since rockstar wants to be and banning for no reason if your in this same situation. Look into GTAV private servers. YOU ROCKSTAR I will never pay for a game from you again.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-18,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,UPDATE TWO I love this game in singleplayer and the fundemental ideas of GTA O however the economy makes me want to run far away from it. In the beginning we had reasonable prices and shark cards that while they were microtransactions in a premium game were fairly balanced and you got a respectable amount of money for them. That has since changed drastically.First they never go back and fix anything they just pile on top making everything below it redundant. This applies to game mechanics and the economy/microtransactions themselves. It seems with every passing update the items in game get more and more expensive. A borderline usless yacht for as much money as it would cost me to buy a whole new game? Sure! Why not? 60 million in new content added in the smugglers run DLC that would take me (at a generous estimate) at least 60 HOURS of grinding to buy all the content (that's assuming you have everything set up to maximize profits and don't waste any time or *gasp* actually want to do something enjoyable like the stunt races or what have you.) If I were to by shark cards it would cost nearly $700 for all of the smuggler's run content ALONE ingoring any of the prevously price gouged DLCs. Yes it's free if I want to grind tedious cargo sell missions and import/export jobs but as the YouTuber Nerdcubed did the math for you would be better off getting a minimum wage job to make money in GTA Online it would be less time and just as fun. Yet I keep playing it because goddamn it I want that flying bike. I will say this though Take Two Interactive will never see another cent of my money in shark cards. I know I'm just a drop in the bucket but if we all put our foot down we can put it right where it hurt a swift kick in the wallet.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-04,0,0,410,False,Recommended,UPDATE FOR 2017/2018So I haven't played much partly due to not having a system that could run the game but really ignore the people talking about how online is bad. Every lobby I've logged into for the past half month since I've been able to get on properly has been peaceful and as long as you don't with someone then you get left alone. If you are doing CEO stuff where things are tracked and your in a full lobby yes expect to get attacked it's part of the game since it gives cash and RP to players. I've stolen loads from people and they just try and take it back part of the game get over it.Grand Theft Auto V So this first part of the review is for the single player aspect of GTA 5 the online aspect will be put below this part of the review.So single player. One thing for money I have to say is the stock market buy low sell high and you can make a ton of money. This is mainly how I make upwards of 100K per time I use it by watching the values of the market snuff investments supposedly don't work in some peoples eyes but they take in effect a longer term investment in my eyes than normal if you do the snuff killing and etc...The campaign since I've played through the game a few times and I've enjoyed the campaign thoroughly. Franklin isn't your typical black man coming from the neighbourhood he's in as you can see by the surroundings there are lots of dealers gang bangers and people that are just getting by. Franklin though has bigger dreams of owning a nice house having nice cars and being able to live rather than sit around at home.Michael married man with a ruined life by his past and a cheating of a wife...well at least for now. Kids? Two stuck up runts one who loves to try and sell his dad's stuff and the other who likes sleeping with porn stars. Michael just wants peace and happiness.Trevor? Insane psychotic Canadian with a tad bit of a meth issue. I relate with Trevor being Canadian and crazy.GTA 5 offline mode is great there's a lot of things to do but you eventually will run out of things to do unless you make movies in game with the editor then you will have plenty of to do.GTA Online review. s all of you ing s.At least that's what I thought in my first few weeks of playing online.Now though I'm at level 49 done a few heists and done some of Lamars missions as well. I own a high end apartment with 10 cars... marjority stolen and then refit at LS customs.I will say it is more enjoyable now that I've unlocked stuff and been able to actually do stuff around the game. One of the best features of online play is the ability to do private sessions with your friends this has helped me enjoy the game more in running around causing mayhem with my buddies and then doing heists and going into a online lobby and using homing missiles to shoot people down.If you love the series I'd advise getting it if you don't like being blown up randomly or getting shot full of holes by the cops for taunting them in offline and standing near them in online then don't get it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-10,0,0,155,False,Not Recommended,Great game to play with friends but it has it's issues.Rockstar constantly adding little ways to stop you from grinding the same missions for the best payouts.E.gRemoving things like the replay options after the mission is completed.Changing the way a mission works to make it longer for you to complete.Adding different amounts of rewards triggered by timers E.g If you complete the mission in under 15 minutes you only get 60% of the reward from it.Which this just seems like a way of making you give up on the money grind and buy one of their overpriced micro transactions for money.New finance and felony DLC offices and warehouses are way too overpriced considering that your deliveries are almost guaranteed to be destroyed by some guy in a buzzard or jet unless you get lucky enough to find an empty lobby and even then they don't pay well at all.Loading times are still shocking.Online is still infested with hackers and Rockstar couldn't care less.E.gI was attacked by a hacker and sent screenshot and recorded evidence of him.Godmode I recorded myself attempting to blow him up with the RPG multiple times whilst he was in a banshee. (Then he'd just gun me down from inside the car)Also attempting to headshot him with a sniper whilst he's stood still (He took no damage)Hitting him with my car and bouncing off.Minigun point blank whilst He was AFK Returned and sent me 200 feet in the air.Jedi powers Video showed him forcing me to ragdoll away from him (Much like the effect from flying on the superman mod for GTA SA)Spawning vehicles Pretty basic video just shows him spawning anything from jets to tanks.Player model swapping Video shows him changing to NPC characters from the story.However after I gave all this evidence to Rockstar as well as his name they sent me a reply a week later telling me that not enough evidence was provided of this scumbag to prove that he's using hacks. All in all it's a great game to play online with friends if you stay away from public lobbies If you've got no friends I'd pick it up for the story but stay away from the online.Unfortunately I can't give it a recommended since Rockstar can't be bothered to support the community and are attempting every possible way to try and sell you the shark cards.

2016-12-31,0,0,543,False,Not Recommended,I wish i could give this game a good review but i can't for reasons that should be familiar to everyone who wants to buy this game First of all the community is very VERY toxic they don't care if you're a level 5 scrub or a level 129 veteran because they always grap their minigun or rpg.Second of all even with Rockstar's recent banwave this game is still full of it luckily some of them are smart enough to make sure they're not hated but i'm still paranoid if they start dropping money.Third of all the loading times ugh the loading times i started checking it and it took over two minutes to load the game and it gets even worse when you get kicked out of the session because that can also take forever.Now don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVE this game i played it on ps3 then Xbox One and now PC but i know that the pc version might not have been my best decision because problem one and three were there but two wasn't and i'm not banned but i think that one day i will and that's why i can't recommend it no matter how good the game looks or how fun the game is.3/10 community8/10 game0/10 support,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,167,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a phenomenal game and it sucked having to rip into it but modding of PC games is a freedom owed to all and if a company attempts to destroy the vibrant community and enhancements that sprung from it we had to speak up. Thankfully our voices were heard (and hopefully some closed wallets contributed) and Take Two has since reneged since Rockstar hadn't authorized them acting on their interests and have since allowed OpenIV to continue development.Now I would highly recommend the game to anyone interested in a detailed open world with plenty of opportunity for mayhem a captivating story with great characters a bangin' soundtrack with original score and solid game mechanics to keep it all flowing.As for GTA Online it's good for what it is but only play if you have a few friends to play with over Discord or something as solo it's nothing but a chaotic grindy mess. And DO NOT BUY SHARK CARDS THEY ARE AN ENABLER OF SIN.If you're looking for more out of your game experience download OpenIV here http //openiv.com/and download mods here https //www.gta5 mods.com/ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWING TAKE TWO'S MOD BAN BELOWIf this was a month ago I would have given this game a favorable review plenty of new content being released through the years new vehicles weapons mission types game modes clothing it's simply marvelous.I could have proselytize the merits of PC originated features like the first person view mode Rockstar Editor and highest quality settings possible.I could have mentioned the vast community of creative types making machinima.I could have mentioned the enormous array of fantastic mods.But I won't now because according to Take Two and Rockstar modding is illegal.For those not in the know Take Two filed a cease and desist against OpenIV a file navigation and editing tool for various Rockstar games including GTA V that allow mod creators to do truly amazing things to expand the possibilities of their games. Also know that both Take Two and Rockstar are complicit Take Two claiming violation of intellectual property and Rockstar claiming it to be the cause of GTA Online's notorious hacking problem even though OpenIV was only intended for single player use and will actually crash your game if you attempt to go online with mods enabled through it.OpenIV and its creators have been operating as clean as a modding tool can be expected to and have no reason to be halted by greedy bastards who are mad more people aren't buying Shark Cards. (in game currency)If you own GTA V I urge you to sign this petition https //www.change.org/p/rockstar games save openivI urge you to email Take Two and Rockstar Games directly on their official websites.And most important I urge you to refrain from purchasing any games under Take Two's umbrella that means no buying Rockstar or 2K's games. DON'T BUY THEM NOT EVEN ON SALE NO SHARK CARDS EITHER YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.In fact I'd advise against playing GTA Online period simply enjoy the singleplayer with mods cuz it's your GODDAMN RIGHT. Download an offline installer of OpenIV 2.9 (the latest version) and wait for ScriptHookV and RAGE Plugin to receive compatibility updates then start modding like crazy.Then share your modded gameplay.Rub it in their faces.Show them that it's OUR SOFTWARE WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE WITH IT AND THAT THEY CAN'T STOP MODDING!,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-20,0,0,2526,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 17 September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 18 November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and on 14 April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. The game is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas based on Southern California the single player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas's open countryside and fictional city of Los Santos based on Los Angeles.The game is played from either a first person or third person view and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single player and switch between them both during and outside of missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A ""wanted"" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online the online multiplayer mode lets up to 30 players explore the open world and engage in cooperative or competitive game matches.Development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years.Extensively marketed and widely anticipated the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest selling entertainment product in history earning US $800 million in its first day and US $1 billion in its first three days. It received widespread critical acclaim with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design open world presentation and gameplay. It caused controversies related to its depiction of women and a mission featuring torture during a hostage interrogation. Considered one of seventh generation console gaming's most significant titles it won year end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It has shipped over 60 million copies and is one of the best selling video games of all time.My Review I in Love This Game 10 Travor's Our Of Ten",Grand Theft Auto V

More launcher issues Beside this there are various problems for people with different AVs Dual graphic card settings etc. 3. Performance It is a hit and miss. Once you finally can get into it..It works... Next time it is so slow it does crash windows as it has an massive issue with memory spill. It is playable yes. Some people do get lucky and have a machine where it does work..and the game itself is as good as you have seen it on the consoles a year ago. But...Some if not most players experience problems.... And this is unacceptable.UPDATE Wow it is even getting worse. On one of my three machines the game could be loaded although with massive performance problems that occured randomly . Well. The last patch was installed yesterday after that it worked as well. Now it does not start on either of the three machines.

2015-06-24,0,0,81,False,Recommended,"Better then the console versions in every way! THE MAIN STORY has new life brought to it with 1st person and better graphics it has never been so captivating. If you haven't played through this story yet you are in for a treat. If you never go online and just do this you will have still played one of the best games you will ever play with hours of entertainment.ONLINE now this is where the majority of my review will focus. Since I've already competed the main story on console my main focus was online and here is what to expect Online has so many rises and so many falls Teaming up from the get go you can find a way to join up friends tho make sure you both have completed the tutorial as it won't allow you till you do. If you have friends on GTA online then it will be a blast if you don't you can join a crew or just play with strangers but be warned you will have less fun doing it this way as most of the bigger crews don't help or even talk to you and strangers are sometimes worse. What you may find is you will complete a mission together then as you are transported back into a session together you will spawn near everyone else. You have strangers amongst this bunch there is a good chance while you hotwire a car they will shoot you in the head for no good reason. It can be annoying but it can be fun to spend the next 30 mins hunting them down to get sweet revenge. Alternatively you can put a bounty on their head for all the other players in that session to get your revenge for you or you can turn passive mode on and no one can hurt you. Whats more the worse you are to your fellow players the more you become a target on the map.Deathmatches can be fun but you do get these custom death matches that are made to create utter ruin for all except those that created it be warned. Then there is the skill system it doesn't matter if you are a better gamer this game punishes you for simply starting up and taking on other players without having a higher skill bar. You character will die easier have less access to guns armor cars run slower for shorter ect. To me this was stupid as it was a real handicap that new players would find disheartening and ex veterans would find unfair. You may get the drop on these higher leveled people unload an entire clip at them then all they need to do is come up pistol whip you and your dead.Races Suprisingly you will find some challanging races in this game be sure to try all of them as the 1st time you go on a track you may not expect it to be so intricate. Off road Planes Bikes Boats even parachuting is a type of race you can do online all of which are fun and well done. Playing in 1st person if you have a wheel you can switch and use it instantly without need for menus If you have a plane and a stick same thing. I personally switch between Joypad and Keyboard all the time Mouse for Shooting Range Joypad for game.Missions This is one of the best features missions can be increadibly entertaining requiring real team work to complete often pitting one team against another to complete an objective. The only downside to missions can be the waiting time in the lobby to get enough people. Often you are looking 5 minutes (on average letting anyone join) to 35 minutes (if you want to populate the lobby with people of simmilar skill).Heists This is the big one like in the game heists requre missions that set it up and missions that involve the actual heist. It is thrilling and exciting to do one and you come away with a lot of money. The only downside to heists is that it is only this exiting with friends over headphones. You can type talk to each other but with strangers there is no garuntee they will reply. If you don't have four friends that play GTA then you will have to go with strangers and even tho you can re invite them for the next mission often you will be mixing and matching which means long waiting times in the lobby and unpredictable people in your mission which you have put in game money down to host.Hackers This is by far the WORST thing about GTA online. The hackers they are everywhere. I use the term hackers loosely as all they have done is downloaded a mod and loaded it up on GTA anyone can do it. At 1st it might seem these guys are great as they shoot money out of their guns or have parties on a random spawned giant chrome plane. But the longer you play the more you see that these guys ruin the entire experience. Remember that guy who shot you in the head for no reason well lets say you get revenge and run him over. Oh he doesn't like that so you will have random missiles from the sky hit you for about 10 minutes untill you manage to turn passive mode on. Then he will come at you with a machine gun that shoots cars as that effects you even in passive mode. Worse is that he might turn god mode on and drive around in an armoured car with a machine gun this happened just yesterday it tuck a tank to eventually blow up the vehicle after several shots the guy came out 20 headshots later he was still standing there it wasn't till we all said how much of a wuss he was for not being able to fight properly that he left. They will randomly spawn dancing jokers around you take all your guns away for that session or even take controll of your character! These guys ruin the entire experience. Rocksteady said they will be banned if cought but no one is catching them I don't even know where to report them? And if I do am I reporting the right guy or just someone they have taken controll over? Often you see text saying ""that wasn't me!"" even tho you are dying due to sky missiles from that person. You then leave session wait 5 minutes to be loaded into a new one and hope another hacker isn't in it.Overall This game for single player alone is a thumbs up 10/10 for online it is mixed as on one hand it could be an experience like no other hitting peaks where you litrally think that was one of the best online experiences you've ever had and lows where you feel like there is no point to working hard in the game if hackers are going to ruin it. Because I'm an optamist I give Online 6/10 but really it would get less if done by a proffesional.If you get it and don't have many friends on the same game and want the online experience feel free to add me theoneknownasd.",Grand Theft Auto V

For serious now vehicles actually feel great to drive again and not at all like the rhinoceroses that were GTA IV's. Your characters still move and handle realistically which means they can't take much punishment before dying and/or I am just bad at videogames. Bit of A bit of B. Mission variety is pretty good. The 3 leads are likeable and gasp there's 3 leads now. There's a healthy amount of things to do in the game but almost none of it is for me it all feels like busywork not because it's videogamey fluff like Ubisoft's sandboxes but because all the activities feel routine and just what you'd expect an aspiring crimelord's daily 9 5 to be. I don't need another job! To Rockstar's credit then that their simulation is so on point that I'd much rather just put in the time and effort with the same general pursuit of life liberty and happiness only in real life instead indiscriminate crime aside thanks!My PC benchmark results and also my score for this game 27fps/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

Life a complicated thing. In the distance seemed machine and I know that this movie was going to happen because the decision has already been taken. Then there will remain only a crime scene may lead a quiet country of radio fired at the car. For fifteen minutes of real time in GTA V has time to occur so interesting that for the whole game cutscene cheaply enough. Got into a fight with the homeless drenched them with gasoline and set on fire tried hijack jeep the dead driver knocked down the leg stuck in the radiator the cops kill got into the jeep drove off the gas tank is breached burn jump on the asphalt car explode at a distance.

This is partly why GTA can not escape the violence. And this is a very cruel game (not the first and obviously not the last in Rockstar) childishly cruel game psychopathic violent. And naturalness of all it looks like a psychopathic character with complaints of severe childhood nailed to the floor with wooden toys and other fatal trouble.

Of course you'll never know which one will work of harm your system even more since there is never any official word from Rockstar. I know most people will think ""That's not a problem if it doesn't work Steam will give me a refund""... Except that GTA can decide to stop working in a few months. You may be forced to pirate a game you own to work around its non functional launcher. Did I mention that the official minimum internet bandwidth for the launcher to login is superior to what the game needs to host a 30 players session?So spare yourself the hassle if you're still interested pirate it.

2015-05-06,1,1,40,False,Recommended,"My journey began at the firestation. After beating a few firemen in a fist fight..(that I pulled out an smg to ensure victory) I found my true calling DRIVING A F#CK1N&amp FIRE TRUCK. Never before had I experienced such ecstasy and a feeling of I am king. Many will go crazy in GTA V while driving a tank but the real fun is in your local Fire Department. I drove around washing the streets of anyone and everyone who questioned my reign over Los Santos. And then I took the fire truck on a high speed police chase on the high way. I never thought driving a 35 000 lb vehicle at speeds of 100mph+ could be so invigorating. I was almost falling out of my chair when the cops tried to tackle me off the road in their standard sedan squad cars. I decided after the chase had gone on for about 5 minutes to take the truck on a safari. Mudding in a firetruck oh man there aren't words to describe getting air and doing doughnuts in such a beast. Unfortunatley the cops still were chasing me so I decided to implore the laws of physics and simply ram head on into each cop car. It was beautiful and the truck still kept on going!I then took it back to the city and noticed it was late at night! So I began my cruse of the streets looking to pic up some ladies in true GTA fashion.... this is my only complaint of this game I couldnt pick up these individuals of interest becausee a firetruck is ""too small"" for such an ordeal.Then I realized it was ok. This was the GTA gods telling me to purge the streets of these fell temptresses. So I unleashed the FULL power of the spray cannon mounted on top of my mighty ride and sent the heritics flying as they were bathed in my holy water. In the end I brought home a firetruck to my house rather than a woman. I believe this may be a wise choice for us all to do IRL.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-25,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game should not have been released as it is there is a really bad lag between the keyboard input and the response in the game especially while driving. So many other popular games I own seem to play much more smoothly. I read terrific reviews online so I thought this might be something other than an afterthought port but sadly the reviews were wrong from my point of view. I tried turning down the graphics and ran a benchmark but even with about 40 50 FPS there is still really bad input lag which leads me to believe there is some fundamental bug in the game itself. The game crashed several times and even caused my antivirus to crash which is a behavior I have not observed in a game since the days of Windows 98. So many other games play fine on my system so I have to conclude that this is a bad port and is not worth it (as of April 2015). I sure hope they fix it because the graphics look terrific and the story was fun (I played it on a console before buying the PC version). Until a fix is provided I cannot bring myself to deal with the frustration of playing this game as it is life is too short.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-25,0,0,109,False,Recommended,The most recent offering the in the Grand Theft Auto franchise has finally reached the shores of the PC. Is it worth the wait? I'd say absolutely the graphics are excellent the gameplay sublime and the new songs on the radio are a treat.First of all I want to start off by talking about story mode. I feel as if the characters are well written and they develop throughout the game in a good fashion. It helps the player connect with them emotionally which in turns offers more incentive to progress through the story.However I feel the story can get a little stale at times. Not because of the writing but because of the type of missions. Everything big is a heist mission which are fun at first but seem draining as time goes on. Variety would help with this as the previous GTA games had more variety in their missions (aside from GTA IV).Secondly the graphics are very nice. The port is decent enough and with the AMD GTA patch my 280x was easily able to power it on high settings with little to no frame drops. An issue I had frequently was that textures seemed to load slow and had not fully loaded sometimes if I drove fast ending up with me driving my expensive car into indestructible obstructs from time to time. This is nothing game breaking but it did get annoying from time to time.Next the radio stations are better than the previous game in the series GTA IV and since coming to next gen consoles and PC there has been a plethora of tracks added and a whole new radio station. Personally my favourite is Non Stop Pop and the Rock Radio but there's a radio station for everyone and if there isn't then there's always Self Radio. Self Radio is where you can add your own music to the gym so you can traverse through the world of Los Santos and it's surrounding countryside to your very own jams.The map of GTA V is very big in comparison to GTA IV. I'm very grateful for this but as I neared the end of the game I thought that it just wasn't big enough! However what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality as there's lots of little neat secrets tucked away and it's littered with races and missions to get you exploring the diverse landscape.The online portion is a neat addition to the GTA franchise and it's been demanded ever since San Andreas MP took off on the PC. Whilst this isn't as good as SA MP in my opinion I do feel as if it is sufficient. There's a nice leveling up and you can feel your character getting better as you get faster more expensive cars and the more expensive apartments and garages. I do feel as if the missions are repetitive online but there is a lot of variety as you can race do adversary mode do deathmatch and many others. One feature I didn't like infact I abhor is the character creation. I feel having to choose between two parents has stifled the creativity of the community and does a disservice to the online portion.In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a great game to purchase and you'll hopefully thoroughly enjoy your time on the game with the amount of stuff to do and explore and experience. It has great graphics stellar radio selection engaging story fun online portion and satisfying gameplay.,Grand Theft Auto V

The server issues will cause you to throw your hands up in frustration. Team members getting disconnected during missions will cause an instant fail. If you don't have a crew you will have to wait in the lobby forever then you have to pray the pick up guy(s) is competent at their given task. There are a million things that can go wrong during a heist and it will test your patience. All that being said IF you are lucky enough to get a good team together. IF you can bear the unbearable load times and are lucky enough not to have anyone leave or disconnect. Then during those few golden moments during a heist are the most fun you will have in any game. Those are the moments that keep me sane waiting for this game to load.10/10 bar the server and loading issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

You can run under the specs by tweaking the game files to get those few extra fps if you need them.Very great story was interesting in my opinion.Also very good online play quite interesting and addictive would be great if there weren't all these cheaters out there.I would have lots of more hours if it wasn't released earlier for ps3 i am certain about that as i have spent lots of horus in there too.Well that was a review that was positive but is changed to negative because i want modding to be a part of the pc version as it was for years on the gta franchise.Currently i don't recommend it and i would actually like a refund features that were there suddenly disappearing is quite bad.And the negative will stay in here forever i guess. Rockstar keeps making bad moves in other more subtle ways. I remember hearing that they undermonetize the game yet even the more simple things have gotten way more expensive than they used to. You either need to grind for countless hours in online to get the things you want (remember there was a story mode at some point? rockstar does not).The game started off as a very great game but right now i would consider it a failure. I have stopped looking forward to gta 6 not because i know they just want to keep milking this game and screwing over the players but because i feel the same situation will be a reality when gta 6 launches.I totally regret buying it again (for the PC) and i would rather just play in the PS3 until support stopped for it (because apparently paying 70 euros for the game was not enough for them to let me play for more than 3 years)Farewell rockstar.

2017-06-14,0,0,332,False,Recommended,This is a really really good open world game. It might not be the best game in the series (san andrease or vice city are better) This game is still pretty good on it's own. The online for this game I cannot recommend.It's filled with loading screens microtransactions grinding and hackers.Getting back to the singleplayer the story is not enjoyable in any way it has it's moments but the story for the most part just does not have the same impact that the previous games had. This mostly stems from there being three playable characters that you can switch to on the fly while that is cool and all it resulted in there not being enough focus on the 3 characters equally. The story mostly feels like it's about michael. He is the first character you play as and he has the most amount of missions.Speaking of missions missions are the best they have been in the series. they now have a large variety in things that you do. on one mission you can be running around an office full of satirical portrayls of nerds and on another you can be blowing up a gang to shreds and killing their leaders.The gameplay is the smoothest it has been in the series though I would argue that it is the least complex.I found myself empting entire clips into enemies without consideration compared to the previous game Gta IV where I would burst my shots. Overall this is a pretty good game if a little flawed on the story and not that complex on gameplay side of things.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-08,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,I think I've played this game enough to understand that rockstar has gone communist. GTA V is so expensive and you have to put so much time and effort just to have decent cars and places to live. You can't even sell half the you buy to buy new It's t even more than real life and cancer. If rockstar is trying to make this game like real life and all the real life t that comes with it then stop trying. Cops start shooting you if you just stand in fornt of one you don't have to obey traffic laws or gun laws for that matter. Heists aren't as rewarding as they should be if one person leaves from that heist that heist is cancelled and you have to find a whole new group to do it with which is t because trollers love to do this along with noobs because noobs always lag out or are too terrible and leave as soon as you call them out. All in all rockstar could've made this an absolute great game where you could play in a modded lobby with your friends you could get more money out of a heist allowing you to buy the large mass of stuff that you can buy in this game the physics are better and skills stayed with you not decreased over time and make everything you buy sellable. If you skipped to the bottom because you didnt want to read this whole review then I'll say it right now DO NOT BUY THIS GAME wait until GTA 6 comes out or a new game comes along to whip GTA's,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-04-05,0,0,88,False,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 has a great story line with a very interesting cast some missions are very fun or exciting but there are the odd view that tend to be alot slower in pace and seem to be there for padding. but overall the campaign is fun and exciting and there is lots todo and there is a large range of side missions and activitys to complete. the port on the other hand is something to be desired. its not the worse but i have a i5 4670k and a 980ti. i understand that is not the best CPU but it should work just fine. however i am met with frame drops when driving no matter what settings and no matter how high i put the AA i seemed to still be greeted with a jaggy mess. i believe the performance has seemed to get worse as patches are released so im not sure whats happening there to be honest. then the worst part of this package by far is the online. this is littered with hackers and after the handful of heists are finished in one sitting there is little left to do other than try and make your own fun and have that shot down by the previously mentioned hackers. believe it or not i have owned this game 5 times. PS3 PS4 360 XONE and now on PC. im sorry to say that this is the least fun ive had with this game im not sure if the charm has finally worn off but it simply felt more at home on the console and seemed to work better as a package.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-10,0,0,384,False,Not Recommended,hmmm where to start... First off i had super high expectations being the only version I knew anything about was the PC. The graphics were well above average and game play not too shabby... Single player story line was enough to keep me attached to it. Multiplayer...is where it starts to get bad... gameplay concept for this is good but the demand for graphics plus all the people plus hackers very unstable gaming but that can be over looked for the fact you can friends only play. Where the game lost me is a lack of variety in missions and limited hiests... i mean only 5 heists? Seriously?? and then when they came out with the latest addition of like 4 cars and like 3 flying vehicles and 1 new gun and celibrated it I was done...That's not how you do it rockstar... you guys made hella money off this game alone... stop being lazy new heists new guns unique cars if someone has to play 25 hours to make a few million give them a reason to. Until the effort makes it look like RS cares about entertaining the a.d.h.d. of gamers i wont reccomend this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-27,0,0,677,False,Not Recommended,REVIEW IS ONLY FOR GTA ONLINE! If you are I buying it for the campaign go ahead. The multiplayer though there is hackers bugs and sometimes a toxic community.If you are a low level most people just kick you from their game. Try to make sure that you have 3 other people if you buy this game. If you try to start a heist and do it most people screw around and don't even try. Then they leave. There seems to me to be quite a lot of desync online too. Sometimes it completely ruins the mission for me. Like one time I was driving and for my friend it showed we were stopped then he was killed and the mission failed. I don't know if they are doing anything to fix it.Modders/Hackers are another thing that ruins it online. I join a gang to do some bounties and VIP things but there there is billy1423 with his brand new modding tool and he starts killing everyone on the server. I really thought they would have fixed this by now but to this date they still have not.Also they decided not to let anyone have mods online in private sessions. In GTA IV you could start up your own lobby and play with some mods. Sure it would crash the game A LOT but you could still do it. On here their goal is to keep the multiplayer strictly mod free. I like that but why not add like non official servers or something? It would make the game so much more fun. In overall it's not a bad game. Story mode is great and there is lots of modding in the singleplayer. If they could work out the bugs hackers/modders it would be great. The community would have to fix itself though. 7/10*UPDATE May 2017* Still cancer*UPDATE Mar 2018* I now have cancer from playing this,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-30,0,0,59,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Grand Theft Auto V evolves nearly every mechanic that was in the previous Grand Theft Auto games. As far as driving goes the vehicles have been greatly improved with Rockstar running more complex physics on them. The cars can even hold to the ground slightly better. The driving mechanics feel more like a racing game particularly the Midnight Club series compared to Grand Theft Auto IV's rocky boat like handling system. The shooting mechanics are better in terms of the feel of the mechanics and larger compared to the melee mechanics in the game but that doesn't mean that the melee combat won't be fun as it as been improved over the previous titles as well. Weapon selection has now also been changed. Instead of the old way of selecting through all the weapons there is now a Weapon Wheel which is similar to the one featured in Red Dead Redemption another game made by Rockstar Games. Grand Theft Auto V draws inspirations from many different Rockstar titles in the past including Max Payne 3 Midnight Club Manhunt and Red Dead Redemption.There are many unique features in the game one of those features is that when the players are playing as one of three protagonists in the game the other two are out living their independent daily lives and you will be surprised by what you find the characters doing when you switch back into them. Another unique feature is that the character swapping feature is executed in a Google Earth styled manner and was displayed during a Game Informer demo which was showed to have ran smoothly and without lag. The PC PS4 and Xbox One versions present an exclusive feature the first person mode The whole game can be played through the eyes of the protagonist. This gameplay mode presents a whole new way to play the game. Cars have detailed interiors different from one another shooting is like that of an FPS game.New activities have been added such as yoga triathlons jet skiing parachuting tennis golf and scuba diving. Random events have also been added to the game and can appear any time while the player is exploring the map. The mobile phone has returned from Grand Theft Auto IV but is now only used for calling the player's contacts surfing the web and quick saving. Giving people the middle finger is another new feature the player can use while in a vehicle (which Rockstar recommended you do in various locations around Los Santos to see the outcome of this effect depending on where the player is at they will get different reactions from pedestrians).Rockstar has also made changes to the pedestrian mechanics some pedestrians can be seen at the bus stops in East Los Santos and the same people can reappear in Rockford Hills working in the gardens of the opulent mansions. Some minor mechanics that help convey the environment and appearance of Los Santos occur at certain times of day such as a sprinkler system being turned on in the morning in wealthy areas like Morningwood.The map is larger than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Grand Theft Auto IV and Red Dead Redemption combined. After some calculations by members of GawdAlmighty.com that would equal to around 27.5 square miles/71.2 km2 when land and sea are combined.,Grand Theft Auto V

Every time i join a free roam server I get a flood of messages saying that everyone disconnected. Its really me disconnecting because of some bug. I opened a support ticket with rockstar and they have not replied. Doing some research into this I have found that many people across all platforms are experiencing this. Rockstar made a guide to fix the problem which said to forward some ports and disable your firewall among others things. Well I tried it and it did nothing. I really hope they fix this but I doubt they will. Because this has been going on for years. I think they are just not worried about the few that are getting this bug because the majority are not. Just goes to show how much of a company they are.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A PATCH. Or risk wasting 60 ing dollars.,Grand Theft Auto V

Two years later and a few delays but all worth it entirely. The game looks amazing and plays really well. I guess its kinda good that all the bugs were really worked out by the console players so that we could have a bug free experience. I'm running the game on high settings with a 4790k and a 760 with about 50 60fps.Anyway this is the first game I have ever pre ordered in my life and I love that I did.

2015-04-26,0,0,356,False,Recommended,Within a month of being out I've played GTA V every single day it's been out and have 130 hours. I never played GTA V prior on any console. I was very excited for it to finally come to the PC. Like many I was curious about how it would run. Turns out it's one of the best ports there probably is. Very easy to run 1080P with 60FPS and even better it doesn't require a $500 GPU to max out. I must say I'm in love with this game. My friends don't play it as much as we did the first week but I continue to play daily. The preorder bonus of $1 500 000 was a good gesture but now that is petty cash once you get into the game you get it all figured out and know how to keep up the cash while maintaining full garages.As of October 2015 I decided to play a bit of singleplayer again where I didn't get far. As soon as I was able to play as Trevor I was hooked. Within the next 24 hours I ended up finishing the story line. Singleplayer is a great time definitely worth playing instead of just going for multiplayer like I originally did.,Grand Theft Auto V

I do appreciate the world building in GTA V the characters the dialogue the story the city the blatant satire. The problem is that there is almost no fun gameplay in GTA V the playthrough is polluted by pointless side missions menial mini games and long boring drives around town. Despite the open world nature of the game the missions are very linear and usually forces the player through scripted events. I got no enjoyment from the yoga QTEs moving shipping containers or towing cars! Gun battles are few and far between and they are generally tedious with little strategy required.The game plays like an some sort of interactive animated from Adult Swim. Not my thing. Wasted $40.Edit to illustrate my points I'll summarize my last 4 hrs of gameplay.Drive. Gratuitous mini game moving shipping containers drive again.Drive. Sucker punch a dude and steal a mini sub no one else to stop me.Drive. Forced to a flying tutorial despite the fact that I've already flown on a previous mission. Drive. Sucker punch an isolated guard the whole base is immediately alerted. Rush to the heli and take off. Soldiers and the pursuing helicopter can't hit me.Heli pilots very poorly it's a pain to get it to the very specific waypoints required for the game to proceed.Drive to Chinese mission. Oops it's a pointless mission for Cletus where I have to shoot elk.Drive save the game and huff some gasoline. That's how I feel lol.Okay can I do the heist now? Nope... ""Open World"" they said...Drive to cutscene then drive to another cutscene.Heli sequence to another very specific waypoint. Rail shooter sequence then heli again.Drive.

2015-04-14,0,0,2306,False,Not Recommended,Plays like it was meant to be a pc game. SLI works. Nvidia dropped a new driver today for this game and SLI optimizations. This is my first time playing this game and i was blown away by the performance the visuals and the level of detail in everything. Just started the story mode but i did some exploring. After i am done causing mayham i will progress through the story mode. But i think this will be one of those games i will be playing for weeks to come. Since the 1.28 patch the game stutters like crazy. Also seems rockstar is more focused on DLC than adding any real content such as mission or even 1 new heist. Most lobbies are overloaded with hackers. Rockstar support is terrible. Fix your in game seriously........So the performance issues seem to be resolved. But it doesn't seem like they are going to add any new missions or hiests so i have since moved on to other games. Adding cars guns and clothing and only what they think is going to sell shark cards is all they seem to be interested in and after doing the same missions and hiests over and over gets old after a while. You can't expect people to buy shark cards if every other lobby is full of hackers. And then there was the summer sale scam and for that reason my review will stay at thumbs down.,Grand Theft Auto V

It is more fun than the single mode but the problem is there are so many people using the plug in the most ridiculous thing is when they used it people will all die and maybe the killer is you. Yes! you are the killer! maybe u opened the passive mode then you will not die. but!but! but! you will in a stupid glass house and will not be allowed go out unless you cancel the passive mode. And also if you are the killer(i know you are not) the police will chase you. Even you are in passive mode! Here is my suggest for R star. if the police checked the player is in passive mode cancel the hunt.And if the player choose the passive mode just let them be alone. At least i dont want to see others in the map if i open the passive mode.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-11-28,0,0,371,False,Recommended,I will break my review in two parts one for the single player experience and the other for the multiplayer experience.TL DR Superb single player dysfunctional multiplayer.Single playerGrand Theft Auto games get more complex each iteration and this one confirm this trend.Map wise the level of detail is still amazing each area of the map is specifically designed with care and attention. From the busy city to a calm desert or a huge mountain area the variety of terrain is nice and well put together.The world is filled with non player characters with a plethora of actions and reactions conversations. You will often surprise cops chasing someone on car or foot people parking their cars partying in the woods... Everything comes together to make you feel part of a world that is alive(and might want to murder you if you wander on foot into the woods).On the stylistic side of things the work in lightning is unprecedented and the colorful sunsets will make every player forget the brownish tint of Liberty City and for many people a bit of Vice City memories may come back.The scenario is more hectic than ever. After the somewhat serious story of Niko Bellic in Liberty City this is a return to a more wild type of storyline involving ridiculous car chases breaking thefts destruction all around fun.The rand character mechanic of GTA IV is back in a more structured way. Strangers and freaks will ask for your help. They are not essential to the story progress (or the 100% status) but are nice way to take a break from the main story missions.The three characters seem like they are tailored to three types of GTA players. Gangbanging in the hood driving fast sports cars and wearing fancy suits wreaking havoc.... The special abilities are a little plus that is if don't forget they exist or how to trigger them.The mechanic of switching character solve a problem often encountered in large open world games I'm in the middle of nowhere no means of transportation? Let's switch characters and see what the others are up to leaving this one to get back to civilisation by himself. The missions that take advantage of the mechanic are forcing the player to use them which end up restricting the possibilities. Fortunately they are in small number.When it comes to driving the handling is a lot less ridiculous than GTA IV the feeling of driving a cardboard box on soft springs is gone and the fast cars are very satisfying to drive especially with Franklin's special ability.The deformation of the cars has been decreased too it will be more difficult but not impossible to turn your car into an unrecognizable mess.The huge variety of vehicles is amazing even though we could have used less declinaisons of modern sedans and more special vehicles (the return of the go kart or the hovercraft for example).The radio is always an important part of all Grand Theft Auto games and this game is no exception with a decent variety of genres over 16 music radios and 2 talk show stations all of that punctuated with the infamous satiric advertising. There is also a way to know at any moment the title of the track playing.MultiplayerAfter much thought given to it I find the multiplayer being the weakest part of the game. It is a shame because it all comes down to the quality of life or quality of experience. When joining the multiplayer you re put in a free roam session with up to 32 other players. The entire map is yours you can do whatever you want.After a few minutes you ll realize that the world is a bit less lively than in single player. In order to optimize the amount of network traffic the number of AI around the streets and driving is significantly decreased. The pedestrians are scarce and have less range of actions and no more wild life.This is one of the most negligible problems.The main problem is the way the multiplayer itself is structured. If you want to join a race deathmatch or other kind of gamemode you are first disconnected from the session you re in then the game checks if the gamemode party you want to join is full. This means that if the party is full you will have to face another load time while it puts you in another free roam session.Another infuriating thing is if somehow the game can t connect to a multiplayer session instead of sending you back to the main menu or asking you if you want to give it another try it puts you back into the last single player save. That s two more loading times.The whole heist system is handicapped by that. If one out of the four players disconnects everyone gets sent back to a free roam session instead of just coming back to the party screen.One other problem is the amount of cheaters. Since there is a lot of informations sent by the players on a peer to peer basis there is no server to check for malicious information sent and cheating is common. Even after Rockstar promised increased anti cheat measures people are still able to teleport themselves or everyone on the server to other players can spawn vehicles money or worse of all blow up everyone on the server while making it appear in the kill feed that it s someone else s doing.If the multiplayer was more cleverly implemented and cheater free I would recommend it without the neccesity to have solid nerves and a lot of patience.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-23,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,If you are playing for the gun play I can not recommend this game. It takes a step back from gta 4 cover system making cover really only good against an ai. Against a person that has played enough if you use the cover system they already know where your head is going to come out of cover if its not out already to kill you. In gta4 you could come out top of cover go left and right and if it was standing cover even crouch and come out left and right. So now in a gun fight you have only one spot he comes out of cover instead of the 3 5 you had to pick from in gra4 to try to get the win in a gun fight. Also no crouch was a big fail that is almost game breaking in my opinion. So any depth that was in the gun play of gta4 was lost in 5 leaving the story and other thing that were fun. But since we are playing a gun game here with that part of it lacking cant give it a thumbs up. Again everything else was better than gta4 and moving in the right direciton.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-02,0,0,289,False,Recommended,"GTA V what can you say about this title other than GREAT!GTA V story mode allows you to play out some epic scenes good enough to make movies from ... well actually a lot of them were taken from movies lol. Now do not take that last part as in they ripped off the movies because they changed it enough to where it becomes something new and different but still full of epicness. I found myself invested in the characters and wanting to see what happens next. It wasn't all smooth sailing though when you first start playing Trevor it gets slow or did for me. I did not like his character and found it hard to play. He is nasty dirty disgusting and down right crazy and disturbing but soon he gets back in touch with the ""others"" and that all changes ( he doesn't change the fun level does ). I found myself playing 5hours or more easily in a sitting because i just couldn't put it down. I had to see what happened next. Everyone out there will most likely find a conection between themselves and one of the characters. It's a must play.GTA OnlineMost games of this type throw you online in little maps of deathmatch combat. GTA Online allows you to play the whole open world of GTA V and do what ever you want. The Hiests are great fun and well done the Missions are plentiful and diverse ( racing ""land sea air"" sky diving deathmatch PvE Survival etc etc etc. Owning your own house or condo setting up your OWN hiests or just goofing around in the map. The fun is endless it truelly is. the only drawback is from level 1 20 it was not as much fun as it got after lvl 20. Stick it out reach lvl 20 and start to REALLY enjoy the online aspect of the game. Overall GTA V is a must have in anyone library do NOT miss out on this title ( PC ) or you will be missing out on one of the best games EVER made and that is not fan boy Hype.",Grand Theft Auto V

An awesome game to play with friends but if you have no friends then well gta online would be kinda boring as most players are well boring and what makes the game so great is with it's story mode. It makes you wanna replay the story mode over and over again making you explore what Grand Theft Auto 5 is all about.Honestly Gta online would take a long time to load as when your team member leaves in a heist you would have to load again and wait for 5 minutes just to make a new lobby and would make you kinda disappointed on how rockstar has put little time to help improve the game and make their customers satisfied with their purchase of this wonderful game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-26,0,0,41,False,Recommended,NOT FOR MULTIPLAYER. I'VE HAD MY FILL ON CONSOLE.GTA V is going to be a landmark game for the 2010s with how many copies it's sold and the game itself. Grand Theft Auto has always had an affinity for films and cinematography (note the near useless 'cinematic mode' you can use when you drive) and this is the most cinematic entry in the series. The game follows a 'Crime/drama/liar revealed' type story one that hasn't really been done in the series so far. One of the characters is more or less washed up an old veteran in the crime scene. Trevor even after being exiled is still heavily involved with serious crime even more so than Franklin. Franklin would be the most 'GTA' of the trio as he's just a gangster trying to work his way to the top. The story really kicks off when the three of them meet. To talk about the gameplay it has been improved and feels and looks better than GTA IV. The driving especially has been changed for the better going from floaty and realistic to tight and video gamey. The gun play is more or less the same except now all the guns don't sound like you're hitting a plastic bottle against the floor. The set pieces in the story are especially fun to play through my favorite being the boat mission and the shootout through the recycling plant. The music in this game is stellar icey synths over stuttering percussion on the loading screen to big band brass when you're playing through missions to even some other genres that characters will use the radio for (the mission where you blow up the O'neil brother's meth house). This game feels very very modern most of the time but will sometimes dip into the 80's or 90's. One of the most glaring flaws in the GTA franchise is still very prominent in this entry you can't meaningfully interact with the large beautiful world rockstar has built for you. People will run you over they'll attack you if you look at them for too long. This open world serves only as a hub area for missions and collectibles and any wacky stuff you want to do in your free time. These wacky killing sprees can be written off easily if you play as Trevor or even micheal where as in GTA IV it would create a sort of ludo narritive dissonance when put up against Niko's character. Dispite this I still love GTA V it's characters it's story it's gameplay and especially it's music and visuals. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,132,False,Recommended,I've played GTA V on the xbox and was blown away. Once I got it here however I will never think about going back to the console for this masterpiece of a game. It runs fantastic looks amazing and the 1st pov makes it feel like a completely new game. This is how you port a game. This is how you make a game! It has everything you could possibly want.No point in reviewing the game itself. If you don't know what it is by now then it obvisouly is not something you'd enjoy. Suffice it to say this version is THE version to own. It runs on a wide variety of PCs up and down the spectrum. If you can run it with the settings turned up wow. You are in for a treat.Shut up and give them your money. You won't regret it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,94,False,Recommended,I would reccomend this game for playing the sp. like all of the games in the gta series the sp gives the player a vast and diverse world offering endless choices to make doing good or evil...however the online version is one of the most bugged games I've seen lately... and I've played lots of those eg ghostrecon assassinscreed... al games that where pushed to be released giving loads of bugs...in this game the online version gives problems connecting to friends and other player loading heists... you can invest dollars in a heist only to find out you HAVE to play it with four players wich if you are at the moment playing alone is a big problem but when you go online your friends can't even join... if somehow otherplayers manage to join you you get a blackscreen ( I was hoping it was just a loadingscreen but no the only thing that was working was my talk key and the others kept waiting for me to start the heist...short of if you are into sp games rpg style in a modernworld with some shoting elements then this game is something for you. if you want to get a good multiplayer experiens it looks to me you are better of playing PAYDAY2 although here in gta you get far more heists and possibillities and unfortunately also the bugssincerely Farathinel,Grand Theft Auto V

The thing that i hate the most is that when R* added the Import/Export update and you sold a car worth $2.5M you get only like 15% percent off it and that means $60k so R* are still hungry and they want more and more people to buy their Shark Cards wich are a bit too expensive.,Grand Theft Auto V

Join mission someone quits need to load everything again to start another mission.Load new mission full of noobs Fail mission lose. 2 hours wasted on online mode no chatting on voice or txt to coordinate anything. Feels like im just sitting on connecting/loading screens all day with no human or game interaction.To be honest I may aswell be playing with a bunch of glitching bugged bots.The online could be great but there needs to be more emphasis on teamplay and community.I guess any game primarily designed for console is going to lack any online community and I shouldnt be surprised but COME ON!

Unless you have a way of cheating the system of money I would highly recommend finding a different game. This one just sucks beyond compare and Rockstar seams to not give two sh*ts about it.

Take two basically killed single player with banning open IV with no real reason other than being money hungry. I would not reccomend this game anymore. The multiplayer is fun however after 50ish hours it gets boring. With single player it is fun for like 10 20 hours unitl you complete the campaign. Then you could download mods and make it fun again.

2017-06-18,0,0,689,False,Not Recommended,"GTA 5 is overall a good game the singleplayer campaining is good and actionpacked. GTA Online on the other hand is a mixed bag the content at this time is vast and enjoyable but the constant push for ""more money"" which basicly means buy the bloody shark cards is absolutely ridicolous as I mainly play multiplayer and have to cope with the constant pounding of by this buy that and then being offered the shark cards as an easy way out I find is frustrating. Paying 70 bucks for 8 mil ingame is bonkers and unacceptable for this reason peaople turn to hackers who make a decent profit from the annoyment aand desperation of others. Rockstar has since outlawed the modding community and tried to milk the last bit of money out of the players. For this reason I must leave a negative review.

2016-12-29,0,0,38,False,Recommended,This was one of those games that I put off playing for the longest time. After beating it I will say that I have no idea why. The story was very well written and the characters are the best I've seen in a GTA. Michael and Trevor do seem like they got more attention than Franklin but by the end I was a fan of all of them. The driving is as fun as ever and the gunfights are very nice with the first person mode. Love the radio and song selection. The voicework is SUPERB. I had a few graphical glitches here and there but for the most part it's a beautiful looking game. Of course it retains that classic Rockstar style of humor with more hits than misses. There are some missions that drag a little but I think that's true of any GTA style game. The highs are much more common than any lows and I fully recommend the single player game. I haven't touched the multiplayer but I hear that it's a mess. Still worth buying though.,Grand Theft Auto V

I WAS SUPER HAPPY BECAUSE I HOT THE GAME ON SALE FOR LIKE 30 DOLLARS AND THEN I BOUGHT THE BUNDLE WITH A MEGLADON SHARK CARD FOR ONLY 60 DOLLARS... THATS RIGHT I PAYED 60 DOLLARS IN TOTAL AND THAT INCLUDED THE SHARK CARD... I am impressed with how easy it was to transfer my xbox character to pc and the game runs well with my low budget gaming pc. Money burns a whole in my pocket so i already spent the shark card but it was well worth it. I still really love the game but I ws skeptical at first because all of the reviews said they got banned for no reason and I bought it anyway.

2015-04-29,0,0,248,False,Recommended,Excellent game very fun not for the light hearted or people who take things to seriously. Need to remember its just a game regardless. Yeah bad language nudity death and gore )I beat story mode and have to say I was sad when it was over. But after the missions in story mode you get a nice piece of pie to play with.Online play is ok but needs some work. Game uses P2P for connecting instead of real game servers like most online games. With that being said if you connect to a session where someone doesn't have the greatest set up you may get spammed up that everyone left leaving you all alone.The same issues with XBox/PS plague the PC version also with the empty lobby issue. Once again due to P2P and no real servers.Rockstar editor mode is loads of fun if you like making videos. Having the ability to change the camera angle in recorded clips is completely awesome. I have not yet tried the Director mode (thats next) but I already know im gonna have loads of fun playing with that mode also.Overall its a fun and addicting game and would recommend it for appropriate ages.Edit May 8 2015Love the wave of bad reviews recently.The game is even better now after last patch that cleared up some of the connection issues and banned all the people using cheat mods. Now online play has improved tremendiously. No more people running around in god mode unkillable or using money cheats and FOV Field of view cheats.Thank you Rockstar for cleaning up the garbage and making online play enjoyable again for the people who play for real without cheats and hacks!Edit June 24 2015Stopped playing online little over a month ago.Cheating/Hackers returned and have ruined online play.Game went from 300k online to 30k online.

Which makes what would be fun games like co op rally driving where the passenger has to voice command the driver where the checkpoints are impossible. Server options and server visibility is needed. Also the Loading times are historically long and don't even think about alt tabbing to surf the net while it loads. It has to be a foreground task to actually even load. It is very disappointing.

Not to mention the fact that they sold this game to us 3 separate times and some of us bought it all 3 times. This company will whine and complain because they didn't make trillions they only made billions you think your online community is a bunch of free loaders?

It's disaster!I know that to be high on steam ratings people should play the game more but they shouldn't grind all day to buy 1 car! I'm playing GTA Online from the 1st day of the PC lunch and love all the modes and heists but after lowriders prices on cars and property got higher and higher. Yes you can say developers want to sell shark cards for the reason all DLCs are free but ok then I bought the game for the price of Megalodon card (8 000 000 gta $) and lets look what we can buy on this 4 cars? For the price of card that costs the price of the game I should be able to buy ALL the property in the game 10 times. All DLCs that came out already required less time and money to develop then original game for shure and why should I pay the price of the AAA game for opportunity to buy 5 cars??? Now we came to conclusion that there is two ways out of this situation 1. I'll do as R* want me to do will grind all day stealing cars and selling it. Do you think it's fun R*??? Seriously? And there is like no more then 10 scenarios of that missions! I will be able to drive blind from any of those spots to my wharehouse. So for example I shoud do this sh///t with cars for 2 days just to buy 1 car for 1.5 mil. This is no fun. This kills fun and gets me angry. Gta wasn't the grind game in the past but now it's close. 2. Second way out order a character upgrade from some modder or bacome a cheater. Many people do that just because they don't what their favorite game to become grind simulator where you can even play with friends because they need money to and they have to be the boss as you are. So people order upgrade and get 500 000 000 gta $ for 10 real USA $ and can get anything the game can offer. And they keep fun alive and play happily! So if R* wants to keep their fans happy with GTA online they have to make prices 10 times lower fo everything or to sell shark cards with the amount of cash that allows to buy anything in game. Because now it's just unrespectful for people who wants to play fair. We are the only ones who looks like fools now. Grind money all day without actually playing the game and then walking to the person who have everything cheating. C'mon! You can't even choose the right paint color for chrome paint without paying 10 times for different combinations you don't like. You call it fair R*??? Show some respect for you real fans.,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player story is phenomenal the gameplay is vastly improved i really dont have anything negative to say besides the cops are no longer pushovers and have since gone through elite training.But the online...i put an equal amount of hours (if not more...) into gta IV multiplayer and still love IV's multiplayer. However gtaV online has turned the once amazing game franchise into a massive cash grab. The only thing Rockstar is concerned with is getting people to buy shark cards. If you dont be prepared to grind grind grind for cash...and along the way everyone who bought shark cards is going to be using all the high end toys to troll and grief the lobby. I would glady go back and play gta IV but gtav is dead to me as is Rockstar.,Grand Theft Auto V

Now I would like to point out some flaws for people who have bought the game and are finding issues. This game requires a much stronger computer to manage it. Depending on your graphics card you may find constant crashing a large amount of visual lag and ultimately rage. I do not think that it is fair to take anger out on the game because it is mostly for strong computers and consoles. It is a fantastic game that was well designed and thought out. I personally have a medium spec computer and had to do a lot of research into getting my game to run without crashing and while I am still running into some issues online it was well worth the time that it took to research it.

2016-01-06,0,0,193,False,Recommended,Alright so I love GTAV. I bought it back on the PS3 back in 2013. loved it! When I heard the PC port was released I was gonna buy it at the summer sale. Rockstar bumped up the price to regular but just with a Shark Card ($1 200 000 in GTA Online). So I didn't buy it then. So during the christmas sale the price was ACTUALLY decreased. So I bought it. Note that my specs are on my profile yes I have the Alienware laptop/desktop hybrid. The game is very well optimized and may be the best looking game on the market. So I already beat the story so I went to GTA Online and imported my character. Note that I've played GTA V around 150 hours on PS3 alone. So I expect this to be great I loved GTA Online on PS3 so it should be cool to see my character in high res and do some heists really difficult. This is where it gets bad.MODDERS.Every. ing. Lobby.

No plastic surgeons in a city that has a film industry? No way for characters to excersize for bigger muscles and better strength? This shows that Rockstar doesn't care about it's gamers and only wants you to spend money on their shark cards.No more god damn pvp freemodes!

2015-07-19,0,0,497,False,Recommended,"Not a perfect game but certainly the best of its genre. Recently this title has been suffering from what appears to be poor decisions on the part of the developers. Many have complained about poor performance after updates when they had fantastic performance previously. I myself have only had one instance where my experience dipped into the ""poor quality"" category. Other than that I've had a blast with this game. If your computer meets the minimum requirements I'd see about buying this game. A word of advice As soon as you're out of the tutorial focus on finding a fast car and break some laws so you become wanted by the police. A higher the wanted level is ideal for this. That way you'll see as soon as possible if your computer will struggle with framerate drops popping textures or anything of the like. Police chases are considered to be one of the most prominent areas where these issues occur. If you're able to get to this point and see for yourself if you are able to play within the first few hours of having the game running then it won't be too late to ask for a full refund if you need it.That being said I put over 200 hours into this game just on PC and still highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V/Online for its replayability open world sandbox style and engaging characters throughout the entire story.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-23,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,I might very well expand this review and elaborate in the future but for now you get the short version.GTA V has given me many joyous moments in the single player but I have never really felt on par in the Online. This is due to it's microtransactic nature. The Online part of GTA V is balanced in a way that means that (unless you are one of those who exploited the early days of money raining) you have to play all of the very limited amount of Online story content again and again and again in order to accumulate funds to play for fun. Things like a few cars a garage to store them in and an appartment to go with it is expensive enough. When you add the desire to get an aircraft or maybe a boat it just comes down to a downright grind. Unless of course I continue to pay Rockstar through micro transactions for a full price game they have already sold me three times.The single player mode is being affected by this as well. Some interesting and fun vehicles and other assets are exclusively accessable through GTA Online to lure more players into their micro transaction swamp. The best solution to this was until very recently the use of mods. THREATS OF LEGAL ACTION WERE DIRECTED AT THE BACKBONE OF SINGLE PLAYER MODDING. The gamers enjoying single player mode is apparently not of value when compared to the watered down repetetive grind of a micro transaction heavy multiplayer and its economical potential. The threats has since been withdrawn but I can hardly recommend a purchase after the incident.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-08,0,0,26,False,Recommended,When GTA V first released for consoles I tried to ignore it and all the hype that surrounded it as I knew it would be a long wait for a PC port to be released. However even after all of the delays I still feel as though that wait was worthwhile. Rockstar have clearly put a lot of effort into making sure this game isn't just a shonky PC port in fact it's obvious that a lot of time has been spent optimising to ensure the game runs as well as possible on high settings (I played at 4k and my 2x780Ti's were able to maintain a constant 60FPS on very high settings something a lot of less visually impressive games struggle to accomplish). I can certainly see why a lot of critics and fans have deemed the PC release the 'definitive version'.The game looks incredible at moments although not necessarily as pretty as some less open world AAA titles. It does also suffer from some quite obvious pop in at times but otherwise it's visually a very pleasing experience.As far as the actual story is concerned the dialogue is hilarious at times and the characters are well designed to match. I do think that Franklin was the weak link but otherwise the storytelling was engaging and entertaining throughout.I've only finished the story mode so it's now on to the online where I'm sure the experience will be similarly enjoyable. Highly recommended.,Grand Theft Auto V

In 2013 ONLINE was good but little pricey but the there was money cheats. they were great if you just wanted to fool around with your friends or own anything but if you tried to use them to with others then big YOU! Ok back to present day its very hard to find hacks to gtav but it aint impossible. But now to the point Online is now great with the CEO stuff but example i want to play alone or with one of my friends and its too hard in full online lobby and its need more money to move around i have played so much but im poor as in online all the time cuz all the cars etc. is too ing expensive...

2016-12-16,0,0,130,False,Not Recommended,Nice game rubbish server GTA V is a very nice game I admit. However the price contains two parts GTA V and GTA Online. I've played online mode for 36 hours since I bought it and almost half of the time I'm in loading page. I cannot finish even one task because I always get kicked out. I entered an empty lobby without other players. It's like I'm so scary that everyone quit immediantly once I log in.(In fact it's me who disconnected). After searching on the Internet I found out a lot of players face the same problem with me. Overwatch and LOL run perfectly on my com. So it's not my own problem. We cannot play with other players cannot race with others cannot even see each other. GTA online basicaly is a single player game without story. The only thing you can do is rob some shops and then lose the cops. After losing the cop you find out you cannot do anything else. I paid for both two modes and now half of the game is totally rubbish. Then why should I buy this game? I mean I rather download it from than being cheated like this. Oh when I started to write this review my GTA Online is loading. Now I finished writing it's still loading. So rockstar you better not make next GTA cuz I'll download a pirated version without feeling bad.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-16,0,0,61,False,Recommended,This game is the best rpg I've played and my favorite gta game yet! The story is long and has good depth fun to play through a couple times and is the perfect canvas for mods. Only downside is that Rockstar has ditched any attmepts at single player DLC so dont expect anything in that department. GTA online is entirely different It's amazing playing in lobbies with 30+ people and with the new heists and CEO updates and even more to come with rockstar promissing to continually release new content to improve the online experience there is so much to do even with 264+ hours played on my Xbox 360 already and now transfering to my PC can keep that going. No major glitches in the game although online has become overrun with hackers so rockstar needs to step things up controlling this problem but all things said I would recommend!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-10,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,I had high hopes. I had heard from every source that this game was fantastic adn they weren't entirely wrong. The single player is good though filled with entirely unlikeable but interesting people. I bought this game primarily for the multiplayer though and was sorely disappointed.GameplayI'll talk about what the single player and multiplayer have in common first gameplay. In a word meh. Driving is excellent. I love zooming through the streets at high speed. swerving around obstacles. Each car feels different and it makes them all feel fun to drive. Once I had gotten my first supercar (Coil Voltic don't judge me) the most fun I had in the whole game was driving it at high speeds through Los Santos. Flight controls well too but I recommend a controller for both.However in my opinion this is the only good part. Shooting feels extremely same y. Normally I wouldn't complain about this but in GTA 5 every gun feels EXACTLY the same except sniper rifles and rocket launchers. Magazine size is all that differs. Recoil is negligible and it auto compensates so that whenever you can shoot you always shoot in the same spot. Guns feel dull all around. I enjoyed using the marksman pistol most just because it added a little interest to shooting since it only has one bullet in the magazine.Movement is okay but just okay. At times you never even notice it which is good. But whenever you try to enter a car for instance your character automatically figures out the best path to get into the driver's seat even if that involves getting in the passenger's side so you stay nice and still for the cops shooting at you or running clear to the other side of the car and getting run over by traffic. On top of that he resists your attempts to stop and you have to continue to tell him to move another way before he listens. This can be extremely aggravating at times. In short when you don't notice it it's fine. When you do you will break your keyboard.WorldThe world of Los Santos is one of the best I've ever seen. The detail in every house every nook and cranny is staggering. It's like the developers were just waiting for you to go to the middle of nowhere and see this little piece of nothing at all. This makes it feel so immersive like a real world. Living and breathing. However if you just want to muck around in it it quickly gets boring. You'll start shooting up a strip club and hide out inside with a shotgun blasting the cops as the come in the door or start throwing grenades from the side of a train blowing up cars as you go by. THis will last you for maybe five to ten minutes before you realize that its no fun without other people to do it with and even then it's kind of pointless. But I mostly played in multiplayer with a pal or two so these were generally fun times.The police are a constant downer though. They are EXTREMELY sensitive and view the slightest bump as an act of murderous aggression. They are also infinite so you can never beat them. You run away or die.MultiplayerIn a word garbage. I expected way WAY more quality.You enter the world of Los Santos after spending two hours in characters generation and are overcome with wonder. What will I be able to do in this world? What sweet cars can I get? And what instruments of mass destruction? Then you realize that everything literally EVERYTHING is centered around obtaining the only resource in the game cash. You play heists get cash. You play Adversary Modes get cash. You rob a store get an extremely small amount of cash. So on and so on.It... is... mind numbing...You'll have fun for a few hours until you figure this out. Then it is all one giant grind.And actually getting into a game with other people? Getting into a heist or adversary mode? Nightmarish. I would spend twenty minutes just trying to START playing. And every time that you get into a game or leave a game you get a two minute long loading screen. Why?Another major issue is the amount of adversary modes that nobody ever plays. There are so many modes. Deadline is one of my favorites but no one ever plays it. I got one game going with four people then never was able to again. I turned on their system called auto invite. Near as I can tell all this does is repeatedly invite the same people who have already said no. These modes need to be discontinued then brought out again at a later time so people are excited about them. There should be ten modes or fifteen at the maximum not FIFTY.Cutthroat and trollish behavior is the norm. If a higher level or more skilled player decides to repeatedly hunt you down and kill you good luck stopping them. There is a passive mode that essentially makes you untouchable to other players and other players untouchable to you. You can't draw your weapon and they can't shoot you. This is fine until you bump a cop car or off some rednecks. Then you get to fumble around in the menus and wait ten seconds after you disable passive before you can shoot back.As a final point hackers are everywhere. I have encountered more hackers in this one game then I have in every other game I have played. One such hacker was giving out free cars and money to people. Another was driving down the street causing the entire thing to explode. Oh yeah. And he was invincible. And invisible. The last one made me stop playing entirely. A player came into the match and immediately every other person on the server was teleported to maximum world height. After maybe 60 seconds of falling to our deaths unable to use our parachutes for some reason we were all teleported again to the inside of a building. However none of us could move or draw our weapons. The hacker then proceeded to pull out a heavy machine gun and kill us all. We all left the server because there was nothing else to do.SingleplayerThis is actually alright. The story is solid from what I have seen but I have no interest in continuing it. No one and I do mean no one is likeable. They are interesting in the same way that a dead cow is interesting. I like to look at it for a second and wonder how it got that way before I plug my nose and never see it again. I do think this is the best part of the game and if you enjoy interesting characters who treat everyone else like dirt then you will enjoy Michael Franklin and Trevor.The surrounding characters are funny hilarious at times. Each one is a caricature but they have have the same qualities as the main characters they quickly dpress you and turn you off.Final VerdictIf you enjoy satire interesting and depressing characters and morbid humor then the single player is for you. I recommend the single player to no one.I hope this review helps you in your decision. I know many people really enjoy this game so do not look at one review (mine or others) in isolation.

Now to the real review. Its GTA and above all ITS GTA V. So far the best in the series to me I have played as a long time fan of GTA since GTA III and these games are just plain fun. It combines the openess of GTA San Andreas the broken city feel full of crime and hijinks like in GTA IV the outrageousness of GTA Vice City and the familier gameplay of GTA III.

The game play is great.The only let down is the controls. It definitely plays much better with a controller compared to a keyboard. Where with any decent car W sees you fly forwards like a jet and S sees you screech to a halt. Analogue is king here.The controls are generally your biggest nemesis in this game compared to the older gen combat and driving is simpler but that makes the gameplay much more smooth.Bugs oh the bugs!There are many many bugs int this game from simple ones like mission checkpoints not triggering to complex and worse ones like how my Xbox one controller suddely stopped working with this game. And heart breaking ones like that jet fighter you stole and saved vanishing if the game forces you to use one of it's planes in a mission.Still recommended!,Grand Theft Auto V

For maybe a couple of months I had fun making my way up to organising heists and buying cars. When I finished all the heists and got myself a couple of apartments and cars I was kinda growing bored of it and just left it as it was. The game was sitting in my library for a good year or so I pretty much forgot about it. Then I read somewhere that the game has been updated with new content so I went to check it out again.Now I'm just stunned at how much there is to do ingame when playing online its awesome and my money well spent. I never modded the game to begin with so I dont really care about what happened recently.

From there it only gets better. First off you have to talk about the visuals they are amazing. There are moments where I forget I'm controlling the action and not watching a movie. The frame rate is buttery smooth dynamic lighting highly detailed textures and so on make GTA V feel alive and begging to be explored. So far I'm only a little ways into the story but it already is engaging and I'm excited to see how it all unfolds without feeling burdened by it. Don't pass on this GTA is the crown jewel of gaming and GTA V once again proves why.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar also has a history of missbanning so play at your own risk.With that being said if you like racing and shooting you'll love this game.Pros Great graphicsBeautiful and colourful open worldHuge variety of vehicles (land sea and air)Lots of customization for land vehiclesPlenty of activities to do in the open worldFun driving and shootingDecent selection of radio musicFun and varied singleplayer missionsGood voice actingVery diverse selection of mods in singleplayerMultiplayer Heists can be boatloads of fun (the first few times...)Cons Bland and overused sound effects (except explosions)Frequent connectivity issuesNo classical or jazz radio stations in game (Multiplayer missions get 'grindy' very quicklyNo mods allowed in multiplayer (frequent bans are handed out to offenders)Multiplayer items (vehicles property etc.) are very expensive (probably for Rockstar to sell shark cards)Are there modders in multiplayer? Yes a lot of them. Are you still going to have fun? Almost certainly.You should probably buy this game with a few friends to create a crew but multiplayer can still be fun on your own just to a lesser degree.In summary great single player slighlty sketchy but enjoyable multiplayerSolid 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

The variety of cars people and aesthetic in the game was amazing. There is so much to explore and when you do there is always online. Now spending money on this game is avoidable but it's really tempting so be prepared for that. I have spent a large amount of money on this game and I can say it's really addicting.The story was a little rusty for the whole things but the missions were exciting. The multiplayer is very bad unless you are playing solo. There are many hackers in this game that screw you over unless you play alone. Regardless it's fun and unrestricted. It's may be a little over priced but it's worth it in the long run.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-31,0,0,80,False,Not Recommended,"Rockstar is one of the few gaming developers in todays market that is heavily worshipped by the majority of the average gamer community. Anything they release is an automatic GOTY candidate and is heralded as THE game that raises the bar for others. Meanwhile any semi intelligent gamer that is not so easily swayed by the hype generated by these marketing masters realizes that time and again rockstar has so masterfully created videogames that appeals to such a wide audience that it fails to entice those individuals that crave enthralling tales about people we grow to care about cheer for and empathize for. I have been playing rockstar games for a while now from GTA3 to Red dead redemption and I see the same formula being regurgitated over and over again in the backdrop of a game that is all shine and no substance.Correct me if I'm wrong but GTA has never created a single likeable or even realistic character in its entire history. I never rooted for Tommy Niko John/Jack Marston and not to forget the 3 stooges in GTA 5. Not ever have we played the hero and not ever have we played as a female. This is because Rockstar has figured out so well what the average gamer is like and tailors the game to them so well that the average player doesn't even realize this. I can't think of a single protagonist that Rockstat has ever had in their game that is memorable enough to stand the test of time. I don't remember anything about Tommy Niko or even John Marston. And since Rockstar knows that it can't write a coherent character they try to fool audiences by including 2 extra ones. Don't even get me started on the ""story""... I'll keep it simple there is none. Nobody recognizes Rockstar for compelling writing and they never have. So how do they cover up the schlock they call ""story"" and ""character""? They build an impressive detailed and pretty sandbox for the player to play around in. That is the whole premise for GTA. People don't buy these games for the next chapter in the GTA saga they play these games to golf watch movies kill innocent people fly planes boats play stock market etc. Basically play real life in a video game. That is something I will never understand. Why do people want to play reality in a videogame? People that play as race car drivers astronauts samurai space cops knights templar and even plumbers I understand but playing in a world based on our world to do exactly what we can do in reality? C'mon. To all you gamers out there singing this games praises on how good its golf or bowling is... get off your BUTT disconnect from your tv and go outside and play for real. You all completely miss the point of videogames... it is to escape reality and live out our fantasies in lands and as people we hope to but can never become. So the entire premise of Rockstar games are all gllitter and flare. Story is non existent. Characters are forgettable within 5 seconds of meeting them. And honestly nobody will remember these games in 10 years. Nobody will remember when you had to do the 50th ""drive to point B and kill C"" or ""go do yoga"" missions in this game. I'm still playing it and even I don't remember any of the missions I've done. Maybe the bank heist but even then its getting stale. I do not like these games and I don't like how predictable the average gamer is. Until our community starts growing half of a brain games like these will continue making 2 billion dollars. It's disgusting. It's lazy. It will never change. Mark my words GTA 6 will just be GTA 5 but in a bigger city just like how GTA 5 was GTA 4 in a bigger city. I don't recommend this lazy game not at the price they are charging for it. Wait for it to go on ""sale"" if that will ever happen. This game has been out for several years yet its' price is still way too high that is disgusting. Shame on you Rockstar. No wonder you cannot create likeable characters you are a relection of your work.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-08-08,0,0,207,False,Not Recommended,none of the following complaints apply to singleplayer if you are planning to get the game only for the singleplayer then great go for it 9.8/10 as for the singleplayer and keep in mind that gta online does have its fun moments with friends BUT...Gta online is by far one of the most aggravating games I have played lately due to the large amount of broken and unbalanced mechanics as well as that fact that the game nearly supports the griefing of other players. To start the heists in the game are extremely annoying and are agonizing to play with randoms. Randoms are often stupid idiots who don't have any idea what they're doing and really shouldn't be allowed to do heists at such an early level! Any time one of them messes up it fails the entire mission for everyone even if they merely die! Then when they leave the mission fails except this time you get SENT TO FREEMODE INSTEAD OF THE LOBBY often making you lose your entire group and forcing you to restart all checkpoints. Also you only get to suffer all of this after you actually manage to get a group because lobbies take ages to fill up unless you're doing the final where people feel that they are entitled to a higher paycut even though they got to skip ALL SETUPS!!! The part about all of this that can be most aggravating is the fact that almost all the things listed above can be fixed with very simple patches yet Rockstar completely ignores it so long as people are buying shark cards. With the exception of single player the game makes me feel that the developers are completely incompetent when it comes to basic game design. There is one thing that can happen which is ridiculous and shouldn't be a thing no matter how incompetent the developers and that is the fact that you can get kicked for being idle while you're in THE LOBBY!!!! In fact a heard from one guy that he got kicked during a cutscene at one point. This is sheer stupidity and no developer has any excuse that can ever justify this. ceo associates get paid practically nothing for their efforts helping a ceo who then has to go out of his way to do vip missions just to be able to pay them. A ceo should be able to directly pay his associates and the fact that he can't is stupid. Next is the fact that when you buy crates not only is the process sometimes excessively annoying and time consuming but there's also the fact that players can go out of their way to sabotage you for only a small amount of pay making them more motivated by their ability to troll you rather than actually gaining something out of it. Ceo work simply just does not pay enough to justify this risk. Once you're ready to sell your crates you must carefully transport them and if the vehicle is destroyed by an npc or some player all of your hard work goes down the drain and you can kiss all that money you spent good bye. Also even if you manage to do all of that successfully there's a chance your warehouse will be robbed by npcs which have insanely ridiculous accuracy making you lose your crates and even if you kill them you can't get your crates back which is RIDICULOUS!!! Whoever thought this was a good idea should have their own eyelids melted into their eyes by a hot rod. I'm not done yet! I've still got more to complain about before I finish! One other thing I hate is the spawn killing which other players can do for absolutely no reason and the fact that it's possible to force someone to pay insurance through multiple means. Also this game has no balance for example two of the worst motorcycles are the two most expensive motorcycles while one of the cheapest is the best one costing less than 1% of the price of the two worst. WHAT THE HECK!!!Also there's the armored kuruma which makes you almost invincible when fighting npcs while you can shoot them in complete safety from anything but explosives which npcs rarely have. Rockstar's greed is also ridiculous. For one thing unless you buy the game twice you can't access certain vehicles something which is absolutely ludicrus and in my eyes is absolutely UNFORGIVABLE!!! This entire game draws more frustration anger and hate than what I can handle for the amount of enjoyment I can squeeze out of it. I've had enough and I'm sick and tired of it all. This is probably only about half of my complaints and to summarize my main points I hate rockstar with a burning passion rockstar makes great singleplayer games some of the best in the world but rockstar faults when it tries to make a multiplayer experience enjoyable becasue of their refusal to fix simple things such as a glitch that has been well known and extremely overpowered and heck the developers probably use it when they play the game! I digress but I hope I didnt come across as a rambling idiot as all of these problems may not be extremly game braking but are really bad game mechanics and awful design flaws and they stack up.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-17,0,0,1252,False,Not Recommended,Two words Caveat emptor. Before buying this be well aware! When you first purchase this game the first thing you will notice is inflation. Everything is tens to hundreds of thousands. Want a small $50 tattoo on your butt? $68 000 thanks. Want some shoes? $250 000! Leather motorcycle jacket? $180 000. Wait you want it black instead of pink and green stripes? That'll be $450 000 thanks! Every car you try and jack when it tells you to choose your first ride is 'premium' and locked. All the missions are dreadful. And all the buildings are fake bar like 5 in a 50 kilometer radius. Controller controls are counter intuitive you'll need to change them straight up.You can't buy a house for a long while and all houses are pretty much fluff. Can't play tennis because there's no one online. Can't play mini games. Can't be an executive running a business because there's no businesses only phoney sham fronts and mafioso fluff RP text. There's no stock market no purchasing or sale of things and no way to make money bar grinding boring deathmatch style missions. Oh also EVERYTHING has a padlock on it. You need to be level 50 100 to access 90% of the content. So don't buy anything you'll regret it later because if you can access it it's noob. Oh speaking of buying. Pay to win? Hell yeah. They named it right with the SHARK CARD. Because they're definitely shark's out for your shekels. And the drop outs omfg. I literally spent 20 hours waiting to play about 1 hour of gameplay so I've gone through the 2 hour refund region. You'll definitely need to queue up some YouTube in the background to make the huge amount of wait sufferable. Tbh I am seeking a refund from Rockstar for it. Whether I'll get it who knows. I know Steam would screw me over like they always do because it's been more than 2 hours. Mind you it took me 19 hours just to download it and 30 40 10 minute lags looking for online servers. But hey screw me for taking more than two hours to wait to see if I can actually play the game. I'm miffed I wasted $80. I knew I'd have buyers remorse when they screwed PC users over so royally taking a year and a half to port it. But I didn't realise how evident it would be.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-18,0,0,137,False,Recommended,"Never played it on PC so I don't know about this version but Grand Theft Auto V is by far one of the best video games to ever come out so far. It's not just a Shooter It's not just a Racing Game it's not just an exploration game it's everything combined making it the most open Grand Theft Auto ever to be released.Pros VERY moddable. (Story Mode)Amazing Online mode unlike anything you've seen.Great music on the radio plus an amazing in game soundtrack for both Online and Story Mode.LOTS of cars that can be modified.Lots of guns that can be modified.This game doesn't have that crappy driving physics like in Watch_Dogs 1/2 or Just Cause 1/2/3.There is a lot to do in both Single Player and Multiplayer.Good story. (although maybe not as good as IV)Good Graphics. (could have been better if not released on last gen consoles)Very funny.Cons Map is too small and boring.Online Sessions need a higher player cap. (Maybe 100?)Driving physics are not realistic but still not too arcadey like WD or JCIf your were to drive a car straight into a wall at 100mph it would look like you hit it at 30mph. (Cars are pretty much made of steel)Auto aim is abused way too often Online resulting in constant deathmatches in the city.Online modders are a thing and they will either bully you ruin your game by spawning stuff or give you x amount of cash so that Rockstar bans you.Everything Online is over priced and requires you to either grind your off or buy ""Shark Cards"".New DLC is no longer being ported over to Single Player.Once you have done everything the game gets boring.Notice how most of the cons are for Online? Grand Theft Auto V is a great game Grand Theft Auto Online is okay. (even though there are more things to Online.)Overall I think this is an amazing game that you should at least try. It has it's ups and downs but so does every other game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-18,0,0,187,False,Not Recommended,This game is fantastic it's an incredible game that has been made extremely well however recently Take Two (the creators of GTA Online) shut down OpenIV the base for almost every mod. This is shutting down modding for GTA Online which is good but also shutting down modding for the single player as well as other GTA games. GTA modding is dying because of Take Two and Rockstar. Not only this but Take Two have designed GTA online to get them as much money as possible. The economy of GTA online is awful the only way to get money in GTA Online is to either grind for hundreds of hours or pay large amounts of real money for not much in game money. As well as all the issues listed above everything added to GTA online is not added to the single player Take Two and Rockstar are forcing you to play GTA Online to get themselves more money. The singleplayer of GTA v is extremely good and massively improved with mods but because OpenIV has been shut down mods have been removed from the single player game Take Two are making GTA online a money farm and instead of working on the next GTA game Rockstar are just milking GTA online. As I've said the singleplayer of GTA V is amazing but Take Two have ruined the game I don't recommend anyone gets this for the online as it is a pathetic attempt to earn themselves money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Do not support this game.Old review The game is fun to play with friends but the controls are the worst I have come across in any game so far no official support for joysticks and wheels flying with a controller is a pain as well. If you don't have friends then about half of the time playing will be spent in loading screens. I hate to admit that I will play it a lot but I will dislike rockstar more for every day I play. It feels like those in charge of mapping controls over from a controller to keyboard/mouse haven't tried the game on pc or they have three arms since you need one for wasd one for numpad and one for the mouse to be able to fly and use the camera.,Grand Theft Auto V

While you have a lot to do in this gameworld after completing the game that ammount of content cant be measured with the work modding community has done over the years.In conlusion this is a great game but the greed of the publisher is causing it troubles now a few years after its release I will recommend this game because I had a lot of fun for my money but I am hoping they will bring back mods so I can continue enjoying this masterpiece.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-11-01,0,0,310,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V is a absaloutly fantastic game. The single player campaign is amazing and has its memorable moments but for me it wouldent be the same without the multiplayer mode.Rockstar did an amazing job with the multiplayer on this game with very regular ""Free"" DLC's which keeps the game alive. It greatly expands what the online experience has to offer everytime theres an update. Yes the free roam is a big focus of gta but without money its crap thats so there is numerous ways of making money in gta from Races to missions to multiplayer heists. The amount of content is amazing.The problem with this game is that online items can get very expensive and money in gta v is not easy to come across and takes time to get but i guess thats what keeps us going back Sure theres shark cards but the prices are ridculaous for what you can actually get. I guess this is a small price to pay we do have constent free DLC updateds close to every month.",Grand Theft Auto V

The single player is spectacular and some of the mods make it almost infinatley replayable but the multiplayer is something else.

That worked for months but then all the money and items were taken from that account and i had a pistol with no ammo and no money to buy bullets. I came and bought the pc version but i got another account with money on it because online is unplyable without a ludacrious amount of money and I got IP banned on pc. Everything is a cahs grash and ever non minor dlc costs $500 to over $1000. You get a car for free and it's still expensive to upgrade the thing. You can spend up to $20 000 in game dollars destroying cars getting killed makes you lose your entire magazine which can be $4 000 if you die with the grenade launcher you get heat for doing almost anything and the missions give you poor money and repeating a mission gives you less money so you can't grind the best mission in the game. Unless you wanna spend Five THOUSAND REAL dollars there is no point to buy this game for online waste of time and money.,Grand Theft Auto V

GTA used to be the series that yells 'I don't give a really shut up .' That is why it deserves such popularity and praise.Look at you now. What the have you done to your 'master piece' game? Firstly during the steam summer sale you put your game on sale AND forced new players to buy those stupid shark cards. That was not honest. And you are afraid that the modding community will ruin your gold magnet GTA Online so you simply disable those mods??? Mod is the heart of GTA you moron.GTA is meant to be played with leisure not to be played competitively. You are the one who ruin the game after all.,Grand Theft Auto V

The very next day i check the pricing again and it was back up to $60 so somebody screwed up. Game is alot of fun but Should have just went on sale even Witcher 3 which came out after GTAV( for STEAM) got a sale. Even if the game just had $5 off during the summer sale i would have gotten it instead i got 3 games for the same price. as buying it then was going to be the same as buying it later. So my advice is check GtaV all the time to see if you can get as lucky as it seems somebody is trying to help us out. My 7th sense just happened to go off that day and started to think how i was that it didn't go on sale and then i checked its homemage and surprising found it was $20 off,Grand Theft Auto V

Looks like having the 4th best selling game of ALL TIME and making billions of dollars already wasn't enough for Rockstar and Take Two. GTA IV didnt have this problem as Rockstar was not as money hungry and didn't have micro transactions in their game. What a disgrace.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-18,0,0,1234,False,Recommended,"GTA VIt's an amazing game not only because of the storyline but what the game is itself. Seeing how far it has come since the very first launch back in 2013 you wont be disappointed in this game. Singleplayer is well thought out and very interesting. GTA Online however is a different story. Due to the amount of modders and cheaters in the recent months you may end up getting your experience ruined or if you're lucky enough get in game money which is hard to gather if you're starting in 2017 or later. Online is also very very complicated for new players. It has so many different activities and features that you'll spend your first hours just by trying to understand what you can do.+Pros Well to Good game optimization (you can run this on a watermelon with playable fps) Amazing singleplayer story You wont get bored with all the jobs and activities you can do Cons GTA Online is ran by money if you have it you can play like you're supposed to Very complicated as the game is getting updates over the years changing gameplaytl dr If you have the time to put into this game get it.this is my first ""proper"" review so if i missed any key information (duh) i'm sorry",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-15,0,0,70,False,Recommended,Really horrible Q&amp A. Half a dozen missions are bugged and require ridiculous workarounds. Some missions are totally bugged and can't be worked around. At least you can skip missions now which prevents the game from being literally completely useless. Some other weird stuff. Like why do rich guys who drive porches only have a maximum of $17 in their wallet when you murder them? That doesn't make any sense. The multiplayer is horrible. Just absolute trash. Laughable MP game mechanics.... If you kill a guy and steal his car he can disable the car. Why even bother killing someone if you can't steal their car? It's fricken gta.Otherwise pretty decent single player slightly better than gta4. The characters are very memorable and the story is alright.

2017-07-01,0,0,53,False,Not Recommended,Garbage. The anti cheat system is awful the entire purpose of this game being made was to push Shark cards. Normally I don't have a problem with capitalism but Rockstar focused all of their efforts on the Shark card system the campaign itself was designed so they'd have an excuse for heists in multiplayer so they can push Shark cards. The campaign story is the worst out of all of the games and I wonder why.However it is one of the most optimized games I think I've ever played.

2015-06-24,0,0,108,False,Recommended,Here is my review for GTA V (Single Player)PROS Open world with very big map which you can explore and do many many things from side quests to activities. Stunning graphics. Excellent voice acting. The music is as usual in GTA game good. Easy gameplay A live city the Ai was very well made. You can do almost anything you want from watching TV playing golf parachuting going to strip club buying various properties or even wreaking havoc in the city! The main story was although nothing extraordinary solid and good FANTASTIC main characters each one with his pros and cons in his character. Even if you finish the game you can just play it from time to time for fun doing whatever you like. You can customize your vehicles at a great extent something that i really liked.Cons You cant have a proper girlfriend like previous GTA. Although the cops are more challenging than previous GTA and thats good sometimes it becomes a nuisance to escape them. Rockstar's move before the summer sale to increase the price was HORRIBLE and it stopped 3 of my friends from buying it.Online is really enjoyable but i stopped playing because there were too many jackasses that attack you for no reason epxloding your car etc making the gameplay frustrating for me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,0,0,160,False,Recommended,I avoided playing or watching anything about the game on the consoles and just waited for the PC release. So happy I did. They got everything about this game right. PC port is nearly perfect. This is what a PC game should be. Game of the year without question. I was annoyed when they delayed the game twice but if this is the final result then more games should be delayed. I've had it crash twice but I have overclock SLI setup so it may be my computers fault not the game. I have GTX670 SLI and get over 60FPS at 1600p with everything at high or very high (except textures at normal as 2gb vram is not enough it will run with high textures but you can see the stuttering as it constantly swaps the frame buffer from system ram). One thing I did notice is that SLI scaling is not as good as it could be. One spot I tested I got 52fps with one card but only 63fps with both. I did find that turning on MSAA 2X with one card killed my FPS but with both cards it only took 2fps hit. What I found the best in terms of visuals and performance is to run the game at 2560*1600 and use NVIDIA downsampling to 1920*1200. This gives a much sharper picture with less performance hit that using 1200p and MSAA. Different setups may have different results. Hopefully a driver update can squeeze out some more SLI performance. Can't say enough good things about this game though. Everything that I didn't like about GTAIV is fixed and improved. Some of the best writing and voice acting I've ever seen. Haven't tried online yet so I can't comment. Like I said this is what a game should be and a game like this is why we buy high end PC and not crappy consoles. As others have said thanks for the consoles for beta testing for us. Buy this game and show developers why PC is the best platform for games.,Grand Theft Auto V

Without the modder problem it would be a 9/10 for me but not only do they have modders they have trollers and rockstar has a poor soultion to fix the wallets of those who got money from the modders. So I rate this 7/10 and even if modders are fixed I will still have it below 9 for that fact that rockstar has stolen so much money from me and even gave me a 5 day suspension for being framed by a modder tool called ""frame"" (It kills the entire lobby under the persons name who is being framed)",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-04,0,0,68,False,Recommended,"Having put over 60 hours into the game in the last few weeks it's a wonderful story mode game. The characters both playable and non are colorful well voice acted and a joy to experience. I like the map it's big enough to give you a great variety of terrain. The main story is engrossing and fun to play. Tons of side missions to do and fun little ""random encounters"" to do as well. Guns lots of types and modable to an extent to improve them. Also even more modable is the cars.I haven't played a GTA game since San Andreas and I must say this is a wonderful addition to the series. I caught it on sale for $29.99 and well worth it. I have not tried the online game but I'm not sure I will. Lots of horror stories about people getting banned with no appeal process.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-20,0,0,369,False,Recommended,The most beautifully crafted openworld with life like similarities to LA. The general attention to detail and immerion is through the roof. The ingame websites news radio etc reflect your actions. Npcs respond to your actions and their dialogues change ever so slightly if you restart a mission or take a different route. Finding these little details was a big part of the fun for me. The graphics quality is pretty good and the options menu is as good as it gets. There are so many side missions and things to do. Exploring the world with various vehicles is also very fun. The campaign is engrossing with a few options and choices to make every now and then The concept of 3 main characters and switching between them is very entertaining. Tons of content!Cons No direct option to restart a mission from a checkpoint. For me the online component is pretty mediocre and can be hit or miss. Can be good if you play with friends instead of randoms.Nevertheless the base game itself is wonderful and is worth the price.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-12,0,0,54,False,Recommended,I'm not sure how much more I can say about this game that hasn't already been said.I've only played the online portion of GTAV and it's kind of polarizing. It can get boring very quickly and I often find that if I spend at least 5 hours playing I'll want to play something else. This is due to the game feeling REALLY grindy online. There are some issues I've found at least with the UI and matchmaking that I don't particularly like. Let's say you're trying to join a race and you get automatically queued to be in a race where someone made a map that's literally a loop. There's no way to leave that match besides joining a new online session which sounds insane to me. The last thing I would ever want a game to do is force me to play something I really don't want to play. This can be incredibly frustrating when you're trying to play deathmatch and 90% of the time you get custom maps where it's just a box and you literally stand around and shoot at each other. How is this fun? I also have a problem with the apartments. They don't really add anything to the gameplay. Why is my character showering? Why is my character watching TV? They spent more time making this game realistic than they did making it fun.But I still recommend it because when it lets you have fun the fun factor is pretty amazing.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-02,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,Absolute GarbageAside from the storyline being the only good part of this game the online play is just the absolute worst.Just crappy matchmaking and a poor community leave you wanting in online modes where you want to accomplish anything in order to be on the same level as everyone else.Heists are unplayable. Being paired with no english speaking people in an online world who don't understand anything thats going on is just terrible. Not to mention the match making system is so badly designed when you actually think you are going to progres your heist half your team leaves as soon as you hit 'play'Players who leave too many heists needs to be treated like people on CS GO when they leave too many competitive games. Rank lowered content locked and unable to join games. This game is so trash online its no wonder there are so many hackers that Rockstar can seem to keep under control. God forbid either I wouldn't expect a company who makes such a worthless online experience to be any good at making any attempt of cleaning up the servers besides doing entry level script work.,Grand Theft Auto V

Server full of people speaking Russian Indian and China and some other languages and kids scolding profanities Activated passive mode and no one kills me start numerous of heist earn big money and wat u can spent on? Cars Cars mod boats Planes Helicopter and tanks. food outfits throw money at stripper buy drinks pay stripper to dance for u Houses Guns armor Heist payment etc etc Various missions like Steal the drug deal steal cars destroy cars and trucks defend ur friends. U need friends for dis coz i played with some strangers some erh perhaps trying to screw up ur mission and spent 1 hour for playing for nth. I guess i have trust issues with strangers Basically u can do almost anything in this open world mapThe bad is sometimes the server is full or some other issues they will bring u to offline or storyline mode is quite understandable as millions of players are online. But in gTA Heist u have Team lives count and once it runs out game over. There is no such thing in team revival in GTA if u played payday l4d etc etc. U must get use to driving flying and shooting and taking necessary cover. Hackers? Yup they still have hackers i occurred a guy is total invisible and just shoot frm above i was like wtf? and go ard killing ppl i understand some put a bad review just becoz of price honestly this game do made a tremendous breakthru throughout game history the price did set the reasonable range but still hope for steam sales for this game in order to convince my friends to buy . But overall if u have friends go for it and go to private servers and yes create a crew and i hope rockstar can create new heists and missions and cars and guns lol,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-28,0,0,70,False,Recommended,GTA V I needed roughly 18 Hours for all Missions without doing many sidethings and I really enjoyed it. The Characters are great well made and solid. The comedy is ing great either the radio or the characters or random dudes standing at the side of the road I ing love listening to these little conversations. The missions are also great full of humor but still good to play. Everything seems polished and yes there are some glitches here and there but for nearly 18 hours with 4 6 glitches and bugs for a game of this size is complety ok and these dont even destroy gameplay. Driving is awesome police is to say the least lame but whatever the heists are great. From Repo to Business... love it! GTA V is more for someone who likes a story and some good missions less fun is there to have when only roaming. Online on the other hand is a cluster and I dont like the long loadtimes of sometimes up to 3 minutes and then waiting for someone to join which incedently is a troll and crashes the heli.

With the PS3 to PC transfer save it was actually a good thing for me to make the jump especially from last gen to current gen.Honestly do you really need any review from me about it ? It's GTA V everybody knows the damn game and I mean EVERYBODY. How many games can actually cover so much news outlet even outside of the game industry like GTA ? Not many that's for sure.So yeah it's GTA V... There is nothing to say. Either you'll like it or not.

2016-09-21,0,0,928,False,Not Recommended,So... you decided to get GTA V. You paid up the ridiculous amount of $69.99 (Canadian Dollars) despite it being out for around 4 YEARS. You get in single player for the first time then play the first mission... It looks amzing and you are having lots of fun. You arive in Los Santos after playing the prolougue mission thing.After you've done some missions you stand around for a while near a police officer then the police officer gets angry at you and shoots at you for no reason except maybe loitering? &gt _&gt Then you try and escape in your max upgraded super car but unfortunatly for you they have a insane boost and keep up with you.You finally get away from them very far away. You think your safe then *POOF* they use their intersteller warpdrive transmissions they aperrently have and they're on the road ahead of you.You fly through storymode and realize how short single player is compared to other GTA games.You are dissapoint now.You see Online and you click it you enter a room where your character creation starts with horrible options.Finally your done and you arrive in Los Santos with your plain character that looks like everyone else.After that you get to choose your crapy cheap starter car.After a bunch of begginer missions and crap you decide to buy some clothes.You paid $1000 Dollars for a pair of pants...You get blown up by a flying in a jet/helicopterAfter you've leveled up some and got better at shooting crap you decided to do your first heist.A nice car! you steal a Infernus (Nice sport car) You bring it to your garage and get a notifacations saying you need to buy this car from the internet... you are dissapoint (Agian)Some time after you've completed all heists you put money into a CEO office you get the cheapest one cause the others are really expensive.After you spent a fortune on a CEO office you yet again need to spend a lot of money on a warehouse.Unfortunatly you've decided to buy a shark card to buy more usless junk and cars that you're not even going to use.A person calls you on your cell telling you about buying a bunker. They sound like a c**t you hang up on them ten minutes later that c**t calls again you hang up on them again.You've been playing online for a while now as a CEO you've been grinding special cargo missions yourself for hours at a time and then selling the special cargo yourself for a dissapointing amount of $112 000. after many days of grinding and selling you almost have enough to buy that stupid thing you've always wanted then somone blows you and youre special cargo up. You are very mad now you join a different sesion and get back that cargo and sell it again. But then you get blown up again you get cargo back you try again you fail... You are furious after. You throw your controller to theground and slam your headphones on the table and you quit the game and you quit multiplayer tired of grinding and buying shark cards. Then you question why you played Online in the first place and why you wasted all that time and money only to quit. And if you join you only have a choice between SHARK CARDS or GRIND.Then you delete it out of your steam to save space with nothing left to do in that game.LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I Present To You Grind money and legally buy cars simulator _ This has been a review (or whatever the hell this is) By the Sammich ( ಠᴥಠ) ﾟ.*,Grand Theft Auto V

However i would not call ot a ""masterpiece"" as IGN states. A masterpiece imo (everyone has their own dont get salty) a masterpiece should have memorable characters and an unforgettable storyline as long as an enjoyable multiplayer. In GTAVs case..the story is lackluster and the multiplayer is filled with hackers that rockstar has done nothing about. Also optimiazation is pretty poor and requires quite a hefty rig to run smoothly at good frame rates. Lastly singleplayer is definately not as much fun after a while.

2015-07-31,0,0,543,False,Not Recommended,It's a really fun and good game if you play the singleplayer. Lot's of things to do and you'll even create you're own fun by discovering some really cool things. I've played the single player for about 50 hours now.But i would strongly recommend not buying this if you want to play the multiplayer. It's too broken to play modders are ruining the online experience and some bugs never get resolved. If you're lucky you'll get a lobby with no noticable modders (meaning they don't blow you up when you step outside your appartment) and have some fun with the people playing with you. If you are gonna play this in a private lobby with friends however it's a must buy.So i wouldn't recommend buying it for now untill the multiplayer gets fixed.Singleplayer 9/10Multiplayer 5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Being matched up to a unmatchable party will waste 4 minutes frequently.

So far it has not caused me to commit violent crime in real life so that seems to be a hoax besides that its really all its said to be. Online mode can be a bit rough around the edges but has greatly improved since it first became available on the previous generation consoles.On a side note it runs suprisingly well even on more limited machines albeit with downgraded graphics it still looks good which it nice because I can play it on my laptop and still have fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-07,0,0,573,False,Recommended,With over 100 hours in this game on PC and over 500 hours in total I think I've played enough of this game to give a thorough review. Please take note I will be reviewing for multiplayer and that it is my own perspective on this game. Pros So the game itself is pretty great. There are tons of things you can do in this game. Fly small planes that can only fit you and your buddy to planes that can fit the whole lobby and even a jet that can make a lobby frightened or more encouraged to fire a rocket at you. Getting high of a bong at home or getting drunk on beer on the streets then driving a supercar drunk. Taking a boat out onto the endless sea and getting lost biking up on mount chilliad (or skydiving to there) having races around Los Santos chasing the train trying to get on the train and not die and even having a brawl with someone on top of maze bank. The possibilities are almost endless. The graphics are also very nice and the cars oh yes the cars look extremely good. First person also makes the game more immersive and challenging. The AI people of San Andrea's give funny reactions and the customization for your character isn't bad either. Also to mention the smallest details in this game are fantastic.Cons Despite being an exciting game with a variety of activities available there are a few things that cannot be overlooked. First thing is how difficult it is to make money if you're new to GTAV Online. Right now the easiest way to make money is to grind missions. However if you're new to GTAV Online your low level kind of restricts your access to missions that give high pay and good rp (usually from 10k 25k). Heists give a good pay but half the time it will take a couple tries to complete just one. Not to mention how long they take. So essentially if you want to get a 10 car garage and a fast car asap then you have to grind missions. Which brings me to my next problem with the game. As I said earlier grinding missions is the easiest way to make money. The pay is also a bit higher if you're doing it with more people and if it takes longer than usual. For example if I do Rooftop Rumble (mission) by myself i get only 12k but if I do it with 3 other friends its around 15 17k (dependin on how long it takes). However with the prices of the coolest vehicles and armory right now it takes A LOT of grinding for those. Before the most recent update came out the most expensive super car was 1 million dollars. However now there is a car that costs practically twice as much. And now let's do some math. Let's say you wanted this 1 million dollar car by grinding missions by yourself. Each mission on average takes around 15 minutes if done without fail and properly. And each mission pays around 12k. This means it'll take around 80 missions which equals approx 1250 minutes (20 hours) just for that super car. How about heists? Heists it's a little different because it's a team effort and you can't screw up at all or you'll have to start over. From my experience most of the time you'll end up having to restart it once or twice and it'll take around 30 45 minutes to complete one even with your buddies. But if you have friends to play heists with do it it'll be worth your time more than grindng missions. There is another way to make money other than grinding. Shark cards or in other words purchasable GTAV Online Cash. However in my opinion these are crazy overpriced. A $20 Sharkcard can get you $1 250 000. As much as it seem in the beginning this money will run out IMMEDIATELY with the price of cool stuff in GTA. So in the end they aren't that worth. A million dollars can only afford a high end apartment with 10 car garage a sports car and maybe a basic helicopter. Even the $100 dollar sharkcard run out pretty quick with all the expensive cool stuff you can buy. In other words the game itself is worth 4 million GTAV cash ($50 + $10 Sharkcard) which shows how unbelievably overpriced sharkcards are. Other Stuff You Should Know About Finally hackers. They are rampant in GTAV Online. Probably half of the lobbies you will enter will have a hacker in it discreet or not. And I'm also pretty sure that at least 30% of the GTA PC community knows how to mod. So you will see flying boats explosions all over the city strippers with shotguns spawning around the streets and maybe JUST MAYBE if you're lucky their minigun's will fire money instead of bullets. Other than that it'll be cloudy with a chance of money bags. Have fun dealing with godmode.Final Thoughts This game is a Eh.... mainly because of it's current state right now and how closely it resembles the structure of a classic mmorpgI would only recommend buying this game if you have friends to play it with. If not then this game should not be worth $60 buy it on sale.6/10 great game but lacks balance,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-18,0,0,1614,False,Recommended,"Been playing this game since it came out on PC and have 1 305.5 hrs of playtime. PLayed story mode twice after first run through went to online and to me online is better and now mainly play online. Have over 90 friends met through the game so now have an idea of who will follow through on missions.Got rained on with money over a year ago just quit server and avoided a ban which was not my doing anyway...nowadays i hear they are very strict on that so if it were to happen again would just quite the server i am on again. I prefer to buy a shark card from time to time and well worth it to play for a weekend plus plenty of money to be made from missions so why complain?Hackers are a PIA sometimes. For example just got my car out from being wrecked and was going to mod shop pull up to door and get exploded by a hacker who then flew away like a rocket...slight inconvenience since just had to repeat the process...honestly dont understand why people hack...and ""hack"" may be the wrong term.That said graphics are very good even on my GTX670 just lower resolution below 1920 and was able to increase some settings and there are youtube videos to explain that more and what to adjust. No problem for me as not ready to upgrade my 2012 video card just yet so could not be happier.The game did get me to buy a steam conmtroller just for the driving and it was worth it as well as all controls while driving are editable and only need the controller with some modifications to the buttons am able to do everything i need.Sum it up in one word FUN )ETA It would be awesome to add a full out DLC that extends original story mode i thought the story was amazing for a game and add new missions real missions in online mode and would be worth the price of game...iow's why bother with a GTA6 and make it a continuation since the game is too extravagant as is and the map graphics still hold up...imop.",Grand Theft Auto V

Michael's horrible family and his own dysfunction is amazing and hilarious. Los Santos is the most vibrant exciting lived in open world I've ever experienced. It looks SO MUCH like LA.On the other hand it's as insecure as a fifteen year old edgelord trying to grow a goatee so he can shave lines in it like the cyborg from Deus Ex as concerned with being ""extreme"" as a decade old Mountain Dew commercial makes a torture minigame unskippable and it hates women so damn much that it shows a skull ed Teddie Bear more compassion dignity and character development than the entire gender.Triumph and tragedy all in one Rockstar.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-04,0,0,423,False,Recommended,First of all Hi! 3So i decided to write this review now even the game is now almost 5 years old.So i really like the story ... Nah I LOVE it. The story mode is unbelievable good and i think if you finish it you will think that too. But now we go on. I would recommend you to buy this game ONLY during a sale. (I will explain why) But if you have active m8s who want to play with you really much than you can also buy it for the normal price.Why? Because of the online mode of the game. The online mode is splitted. Sometimes it can be the worst game ever sometimes its really cool and fun to play. So if you go into the online lobby it takes you much time to load the game completely but thats not the real proplem because its the same with the story mode. So if you are in the lobby you have different options for what you can do now. The best thing is to farm money. But how? So there the real proplem starts If you want to make an acceptable amount of money you have to do heists and thats not that easy because you need a crew and an apartment. The cheapest apartment cost 108.00$ if im right and to get that money you can do jobs over the online menu of the game. Most of the jobs are very cool some are so bad that you cant play them but most of them are cool and give a normal amount of money 10.000 32.000$. So if you farmed enough you can buy the apartment and do heists? No! You have to get 3 more people who play with you the missions. Otherwise YOU CANT PLAY THEM! If just one member left while the mission is running the mission stops and you have to load the WHOLE online part of the game again. (Good Pc 3 min). Then you can start to search for players again. ( Thats why a crew of 3 more people is necessary. But hey there are more options. You can also do heists where you CAN play up to 4 people but only 2 are necessary. Now you think Oh hey how cool thats much more worth it and you get even more money from it! O Yeah thats right BUT You need to buy an extra building for this which costs you at least 500.000$ or more. WHAT?! Yeah this is how GTA Online works nowadays. (So that was a little explaination from me. So some more information Cars and literally everything in GTA Online is overpriced AF! People are really salty and sometimes so annoying that you wanna smash you pc The loading time of almost every part of the game is just TOO long! You can get just a random ban (+ Your Char. Gets deleted) just because a hacker reports you with a bot army (This happened to me! &gt I had 250 Hours in online mode. I was lvl 120. And i just got banned for NOTHING + OF COURSE My Char got deleted) The anticheat doesnt work at all! The rockstar support is even worse!So my final reason to say this is a good game? Because if you play with friends and dont interact with cheaters you should have a perfect gaming experience. Also the storymode is the best of the game by far! I d recommend you to play the Story mode first then try the online mode otherwise you ll maybe lose your will to play this game. /So thats all. Overall a nice and interisting game. Good day! ),Grand Theft Auto V

Do NOT buy the PC port of this game until they do some SERIOUS patching because every single time I tried to play either story mode and GTA Online the game would cause my PC to crash and go BSOD. I have the latest drivers installed on my PC my specs are more than enough to run GTA V and yet every time I try to play the game it crashes and I get a BSOD message. I've tried lowering my graphic settings running it in windowed mode using compatability mode running the game as an administrator and yet it still crashes and I get the BSOD.I went to Rockstar to see if I could get some help only to find out that others are experiencing the same thing they are also having their games crash and lead to a BSOD. ""It's one thing if a game freezes and crashes but it is another thing when the game takes my whole computer down with it! This isn't just a game breaking bug but a possible computer breaking one!""This guy CombatDurable in the Rockstar comments section stated perfectly how I felt because this game is causing my entire system to crash and could possibly end up damaging my PC if I continued so I had no other choice but to ask for a refund.My honest opinion is that you should hold off on purchasing GTA V for the PC until Rockstar patches all of these issues because there is seriously a problem here if GTA V is causing myself and other people's systems to crash and go BSOD.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,0,0,195,False,Recommended,"GTA V Singleplayer ReviewFirst Draft Version 1Clocking out at 102 hours at the time of writing and this without any GTA Online counted as I have not yet started Online even once.IntroductionTo be fair Grand Theft Auto needn't a big introduction to most people as it is a huge and ifluential title. But nontheless I shall give it a quick rundown. So what is Grand Theft Auto V? Well some people say it's a sandbox. Some call it a quasi actionrpg. Some just stick with third person shooter. And non is really wrong either it takes elements from most genres and bangs them together to make them work. And they really do. It's a game that gives the player immense freedom you can either go full psycho and kill everything that moves steal cars kill animals and so on or you can go play golf. This is just an example but the stark contrast is there. And this is the thing that makes 'GTA' one of the most successful franchises of all time. The freedom of doing whatever the hell you please is a satisfying thing indeed. Story (Spoiler free)In this game you're introduced to three protagonists a ""hood gangster"" a retired bank robber and well frankly a psychopath. In a series of events these three become connected and their three seperate stories become entwined into one in one of the most interesting ways I personally have ever experienced in a video game. At first I was not very impressed in fact but that might be because you start off as humble as this game gets a gangster. This alone is not a problem but I was generally put off by the fact that what felt was every third word was "" "". And yes I am aware that this games plays on stereotypes and that in fact it is very common but it still felt silly after 5 minutes. Get past the small things however and youll find a rich and fleshed out story set in a great setting with immaculate attention to detail.MiscAs I mentioned in the introduction there is for example golf to play. Well that's not all. There's all kinds of side activities ranging from street racing to tennis from hitting money transports to getting ""attention"" in gentlemen clubs. It's a universe filled with things for you to do things to occupy you and this is one of Grand Theft Auto V's greatest features.Pros Great combat. Immersive gameplay. A ludicrous amount of features. Extreme attention to detail. Fleshed out story. Fun side activites. It's able to mix humor and seriousness in a way only Rockstar can do. Great music. Superb customization for both vehicles and characters. Impressive graphics. Near perfect voice acting on almost all characters (including pedestrians and random AI)Cons Some dialog feels a bit forced. I personally encountered bugs when tabbing out of the game crashing it but this might be due to other issues. During my 102 hours of gameplay my game crashed thrice. This is not as much as of a con as a general ""fyi info"". Flying controls suck really bad. If a cutscene is accidentally skipped I found no other way than to kill myself to cancel the mission and then restart it from the beginning. As you can tell most of these are really just nitpicking. The only real problem I had with this game was the flying controls. Flying helicopters was just the most infuriating thing I did in this.SummaryIt's bloody brilliant. Definately in the top ten best games of all time. When I finished the story at 83 hours in I couldnt stop myself from keep playing. Yet I found another 20 hours before I felt I could say that I am done with the singleplayer. And I have not even completed it to 100% yet. So do I recommend it? Maybe a tiny little bit. Maybe a tiny tiny little bit. Buy it if you like good games. I'm done here.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-11,0,0,55,False,Recommended,"I don't understand the uproar over all of this. The game came out on PC less than two months ago and it's not like Rockstar is required to participate in the summer sale. You can buy the game on its own for its original price which is reasonable given how recently it came out. So instead of lowering the price (again NOT SOMETHING THEY ARE REQUIRED TO DO) they bundle it with older games and in game money for the same price. Still people are upset because the bundle redeems the cash card and makes it non refundable. However less than a month ago Steam refunds weren't even possible so I don't see this as Rockstar's fault. They didn't create the refund system. So why are they pairing the game with these things instead of other in game content? Maybe because all of the DLC they have created so far has been FREE.Honestly they are constantly releasing free updates to the game including weapons missions usable items clothing vehicles etc. again ALL FREE and people are upset that the price didn't go down?+ FREE DLC (new content still being released!)+ New playing perspective (FPS mode including detailed and functional vehicle interiors/dashboard)+ HD retextures for virtually all models+ New side missions for single player+ Increased foilage and wildlife+ Acutally decent console to PC port (few if any glitches)+ Even small details have been given improvements (camera filters more vehicle mods extra radio stations etc.)+ Can record and upload clips of gameplay+ And just like before the next gen port a generally fantastic game (story gameplay voice acting interactivity etc.)/ Graphically demanding game. If you're unsure about being able to run it buy the base game and test it there get a refund and get a bundle if it works Rockstar Social Club DRM. A pain to set up initally fortunately automatic after first loginPersonally I don't get the crap people are giving Rockstar for this. Yes it sucks that bundles are unrefundable but there's nothing greedy or ""shady"" about creating bundles with the only DLC that they don't give you for free. Yet the reviews are being flooded with negative reviews because people don't like the content that Rockstar is giving out for free for buying the game.",Grand Theft Auto V

Not the best)8 GB RAMWin 10 OSHDD 1 TBA pretty solid laptop.Now I'm aware that my graphics aren't strong enough for the game but I'm able to run pretty graphically demanding games like FC3 L.A. Noire Life is Strange The Sims 3/TheSims4 and even Telltale games on medium high settings without any problems. In addition I did a couple things to make it run well and it does work on relatively normal low settings with pretty good fps and no lag/stutter. But my problem is that it overheats my CPU to 80 100 % within a couple minutes of gameplay especially when driving! I havent been able to play ONLINE and even get past the mission with the black guys in Single Player mode because of this. I've done just about anything in the book! I tried getting a game booster like Razor Cortex and disabled turbo boost by changing the power settings under ""power options"" and ended some tasks in the Task Manager but nothing seems to work! It still overheats my CPU and crashes! I don't know what to do but I guess I can say that this is a very fun game (I used to play it on the PS3 so I know what it can do) but if your laptop isn't well equipped for this game please save yourself some money and don't buy it. Do NOT listen to those people in the YouTube videos that show how GTA works on Intel because that doesnt matter when all it does is overheat your CPU.

If you do buy this game you will be probably be playing the standard online mode from now on and it sucks. Every online DLC has been over priced since the PC release in 2015 and its just been getting worse online money in this game is hard to freely accumulate to purchase the latest ingame vehicle clothing and whatever else. They have even made it so that if you have so many cars and you want to sell a bunch of them there is now a limit on how much you can sell and when you exceed that limit you risk getting banned for doing nothing. The current system often forces people to have to spend real life money around the $30 to afford some of the content and it's just sad to see this happen to a game that many of us loved. modding was a way of getting passed that and just having good old fun offline without it you just have a very basic game that's just overpriced and no longer for the fans and sad that the game has turned to,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-02-16,0,0,837,False,Recommended,Truly an amazing game. The singleplayer has a intricate story with great depth and amazing charachters. The online is super fun to play yes it can have modders that can ruin things but just hop sessions they can't be in every session. Online is where most of this game shines imo they are constantly updating it and making it even more fun to play and adding more things to buy P (Did I happen to mention all the updates are free?) Even if you get bored with that the singleplayer is somewhat moddable its might stop soon. I would for sure buy this with my money tho every day,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-13,0,0,364,False,Recommended,In the main story Trevor tortures Michael this is some information on torturing Torture is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological pain and possibly injury to an organism usually to one who is physically restrained or otherwise under the torturer's control or custody and unable to defend against what is being done to him or her. Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals groups and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or even longer. Reasons for torture can include punishment revenge political re education deterrence interrogation or coercion of the victim or a third party or simply the sadistic gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. The need to torture another is thought to be the result of internal psychological pressure in the psyche of the torturer. The torturer may or may not intend to kill or injure the victim but sometimes torture is deliberately fatal and can precede a murder or serve as a form of capital punishment. In other cases the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim. Alternatively some forms of torture are designed to inflict psychological pain or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. Depending on the aim even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as half hanging).,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-21,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Look this is not a game it's an experience a premium one at that. GTA V is like playing a movie. I'm not going to review the Online portion that did not appeal to me at all. The single player campaign is where it's at for me and let me explain to you why I feel the game overall fell flat.The story can't be faulted terribly. It's interesting at times but lacks urgency. I never get the feeling that my characters are ever in any real danger and mostly because Trevor's campaign starts off with him doing crazy over the top antics that nothing after feels believable. I do appreciate it for being very much like a movie. As the ending credits rolled it very much felt like I'd witnessed something similar to a true Hollywood gangster movie like Casino. I didn't feel challenged by this game. Some games don't need to be challenging but I felt like a better game could have been had if they had only made it somewhat of a challenge to get money and to steal special cars for your own use. The city portion of the map felt small particularly the downtown area. Sure looking over it at night looks pretty but then after a moment you realize wow the suburbs are precariously close to those sky scrapers. In constrast the outdoors portions were too big and boring to drive down after a couple goes. The game needed more talk show radio stations. I didn't enjoy many of the tracks provided on the radio stations. I enjoyed Sleeping Dog's radio more. I even wound up looking up some Sleeping Dog tracks on youtube something none of the GTA V songs compelled me to do.The main antagonist is weaksauce. He's goofy sure but really weak in terms of creating urgency for our characters. Once again you never really feel threatened. If you ask me Sleeping Dogs was the better game and I can't believe more people don't give that game a chance. Not only do we get a fresh setting in a beautifully realized Hong Kong but we also get a much better game as well in nearly every respect. Oh and GTA V sucks just for how easy it is for your car to disappear. Cars should simply have been saved on separate files and only lost if you destroyed them or sold them.But even still I'll recommend this game because there is fun to be had. Just... buy on sale like I did.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,448,False,Recommended,"Update 6/19/17 Some new ideas have come to my attention if they end up being confirmed then the game does not deserve a negative review from me just because the companies involved have to keep their plans secret in order to stay a step or two ahead of GTA online hackers. I will update this review again once I am satisfied that I will be able to explain the theory I have been presented with (Which justifies the Open IV situation so far) in a clear and understandable way.Original Review 6/16/17 There are many games where a large portion of the playerbase enjoys the modded experience. This is one of those games and thanks to Take Two Interactive all single player mods based on the Open IV modding tools (The most prominent set of modding tools) are now considered to be hacking the game. The policy is a sledgehammer being used to get a dent out of a totaled car it is going about it in all of the wrong ways. I won't iterate what has happened here as it has been explained in hundereds of reviews already (Nerd Cubed explains this situation quite well) so I will not be reiterating it here. Take two Please spend a bit more time thinking about how to fix the online multiplayer hacking before just making a blanket ""fix"" that does not target the real issues and rather just ticks off the majority of the playerbase. Iterate VERY clearly what aspects of modding are allowed and not within GTA V and GTA online and maybe work with the modders (crazy thought right?) to start fixing GTA online hacking. Once something has been done to my satisfaction (An Apology clear rules for modding a plan for dealing with both current and future hacking no laying blame on any one employee or department) and then I'll be more than happy to drop my negative review.Now for an actual review Single player campaign is honestly close to perfection I cannot be happier about the many hours I sank into following these character's stories all the way through to their completion. Each is unique and prvides a hilarious spin on the sterotypes of people that live in California (being from California I can confirm the accuracy of the map but not of the sterostypes which are highly exaggerated) There is more than enough ways to earn money and I personally enjoy the stock market mechanics and being able to buy up buisnesses and homes accross San Andreas and then fill them with a lot of shiney things. The only annoyances I can think of would be the submarine mission (If you've done it you know which one) and that a few story missions force you into some very uncomfortable situations. Outside of that I have almost only praises for the single player aspect of Grand Theft Auto V I think it is a genius satire of the California lifestyle and of the social structure in place in the represented area of the United States.GTA Online is a different story. . .I have read of many horror stories of players joining public lobbies and hackers immediatly causing them to be banned and then these players have to go through a nightmare of customer service in order to NOT regain access to their accounts all progress being lost forever. I have personally never encountered any of this so I cannot comment on these issues and wheter or not they may actually exist. The worst I personally run into are players that immediately shoot you at the end of a mission to mug you for cash and one occation where I joined a session and apeared to be stuck in a cage. (Screenshot of it is on steam) I do not have any close friends that I play GTA with consistently so I play with random players mostly and the experience working through jobs and heists is certainly fun. The missions can be creative and challenging and there is something memorable about almost every mission I have completed so far. (I'm only Level 23 so I'm not that far in) But attempting to amass large sums of cash for new vehicles or personal living areas or garages is certainly a grind. Obviously encouraging players to buy shark cards. (Fun fact you can get a real minimum wage job and buy more GTA money than you could earn by actually playing the game) Once i've gotten further into the online experience I'll return and iterate on this portion further. But nothing is stand out awful from my experience and I can confidently say I have enjoyed my online experience overall.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-27,0,0,255,False,Recommended,This will be a 2 parter Gta Story Mode and Online.Story Mode The stroy in this game is awesome. In my first playthrough there was not a boring moment. I played it on the potato 4 times through and once on PC (mainly because I've been distracted by mods). It's truly a brillaint game. I think the map makes this game there are easter eggs everywhere and cool places to visit. A personal favourite for me is pimping up a kickass ride and going for a road trip across the map. It will entertain me for hours. The graphics are beautiful even on the lowest settings oh you have a bad computer? No worries! Just download a graphics downgrade mod. They're helpful if you don't have a good enough computer. Anyway back to point. The story is thrilling offering you to engage in stealth missions explosive missions air fights which include sniping pilots out of their chopper. There is high speed chases and even omre chaos. The 3 protagonists have some very intresting dialogue and you wont heistate to have a laugh from the monsterous activities of the psychopathic Trevor Phillips. This game is a MUST HAVE for any steam user. The gun mechanics are awesome and with a large variety there is something for everyones taste. The melee mechanics will have you screaming for the watch for hours and the car handling / aircraft handling is beautiful to drive/fly. An overall brilliant game. GTA Online Well. This has 2 sides to the argument. The cons there is always some driving in an armoured car killing noobs. There are quite a lot of hackers. The community isn't that nice (I guess killing hookers embraces anger of abusive parents?). Pros don't give a Load up a private session and play with friends. This game never ceases to entertain me. Me and my friends driving around saying we'll do a nice safe road trip which always ends up in death. It's brilliant and hilarious. As long as you have friends GTA Online is awesome. If you just plan on playing solo don't even bother. The heists are alright the races are alright. The main thing is messing around with friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have two main issues with this game 1) I have over 30 hours played and I've probably spent a good 30 50 minutes of that time in loading screens. The most frustrating thing ever is waiting for online to load for 3 minutes and then being sent back into story mode because you've failed to connect to an online session! Argh!2) The community. Setting up a heist takes hours because as soon as people find out it's only a setup they leave. People want to complete heists to make money but they refuse to put the work into the setup. Something definitely needs to be done about this.tl dr Awesome game! 10/10. Highly recommeded.,Grand Theft Auto V

Everytime you try and do a heist with randoms one of them randomly leaves for no reason which makes everyone start all over again. You have to have 4 people for the heist setups even though most of those I could probably do solo.

To be honest they should have waited a little while longer then again that's why you release a bug filled game to the public and have the public complain about said bugs and the company fixes the bugs..Rockstar is a good company to follow and this game proves to everyone why they're still the best.. I loved this game on the PlayStation 3 continued to love it for the PlayStation 4 and prowd to have gotten it for PC.. But quite honestly I don't think it should have been made for PC..I do recommend this game though it's a great game to have on any sort of device that it was made for I love playing it and I enjoy hanging out with my friends in it..

2015-05-04,0,0,158,False,Not Recommended,This game has a FOV (field of view) of around 85 (in first person of course) and this would be acceptable if you were to play the game on a TV at a distance however this is not high enough for most people who play at monitor and are much closer to it. While Rockstar has yet to offer a solution modders have already brought out mods that fix this problem which would be great! The problem is the game is banning people for using these mods even in single player. Rockstar either needs to fix their anti cheat to allow players to use FOV mods or they need to update their own FOV slider that goes above 85 to around 100 110 . As well as they must remove the bans they have on people who modded their game for a higher field of view. If you want to get the game believe me it is a fantastic game just be warned any type of modification for at least the moment will risk you getting banned (this does include single player as well).,Grand Theft Auto V

Original NOPE NOT WORKING. Opening mission they suggest you press caps lock to activate power all that does for me is turn it to window screen and does not allow you to go back without exiting and restarting since for some reason when you press full screen on settings it just locks up.

But since I played this game on other plantforms and totalled 500+ hours with this game I can say for sure this is one of the greatest games of the franchise and it's extremelly fun for any casual or serious gamer. Online still has a fair share of bad apples that use ONLINE MODS that need to be stopped but so far I haven't face any issue online.Once again from all the modding community thank you Rockstar for the toughtful decision.,Grand Theft Auto V

Would recommend the game for singleplayer alone but if you have some friends who can join in the online it can be a serious blast.

2017-07-01,0,0,98,False,Not Recommended,Pretty much after years of mods being a part of the game Take Two decided to cease and desist OpenIV developers whose program allowed you to run modsEdit After reinstalling this game I decided I would give it another shot. Unfortunately what follows are tales of woe my friend. Pros Its a well made game and I enjoyed it for the time I had with it.Cons r u fuccn kidding me with the goddamn microtransactionsIt's like $30 to buy dlc in game money to get me ahead of where I currently am online.I get called in game while playing online constantly. Some calls I have the option to hang up while others. Specifically the ones for whatever new dlc came out where they want you to purchase a forclosed hangar for like $2 million. The problem is that it feels like I'm constanly pressured to purchase the property and I can't devote the time into the game. If you have time and money then come sit on ur big and playThere is always one hacker in the server.I paid $30 already not mention I have also purchased this game on console twice at the full retail value. This is me just being stupid and not devoting myself to one device.Basically what it comes down to is that the game is big af but it runs slow as hell the matchmaking is I've ran it on an SSD and it still didn't run well. The amount of money you make compared to the amount of time you need to devote into it.I enjoy playing multiplayer games but I don't want this kind of social aspect. You need to have friends to play with to make a lot of money but I don't have those options.TL DR TIMESINK CRAPSHOOT MICROTRANSACTION HELL WITH GOOD GAME MECHANICS,Grand Theft Auto V

The graphics are amazing The game is still brilliant. But GTA Online is completely COMPLETELY broken. If you are going to buy this game purely for the multiplayer (as I did) why don't you do yourself a favour and hold fire for now. There is little point in me having spent my money on this game seeing as slow connection random kicks connection drops and lag to the point of not being able to even play the game. Then being forced back into GTA 5 ""Returning to GTA 5"" has got to be one of the most annoying things that we see quite often when trying to play online. Also this is not just for me it is a number of people so it's not a local connectivity issue. If you want the story buy it also you might be lucky.

The list goes on and on for what some people think defines a good game.I'm not here to argue and tell you that you're dumb for thinking graphics make a good game or anything else like that I'm simply here to tell you how great this game is.This game is by far my most favorite game of all time. No seriously I have played this game's campaign over 30 times and that's not a joke. I've actually played it over 30 times.I started playing it on Xbox 360 and fell in love with it. (That's where I played it 30+ times) I thought it had amazing graphics great audio quality tight gameplay and an amazing story.Now that I have it on PC the 360 version looks like lego.This game is one of the most beutiful games I have ever played and the best part about this game's graphics is that you don't need a $2 000 in order to play it and for it to look not just good but amazing you don't even need a 4K moniter.This game is pretty easy to run so most of you should have no problem running it.Still not convinced to buy it?How about the story? It's amazing Rockstar took 3 different Characters with totally different background lives and extremely different personalities and they tied them all into one story flawsly. The story is amazing you have gun fights you prepare for heists you chase people in cars and the whole time it's going on you're doing something that makes sense in the story. No GTA V doesn't have gangs but this game isn't about gangs as much anymore. GTA V is more centered around hesit and team play but there are still gangs within the game.If you like great audio then once again this game is for you. The car noises the characters voices the weapon noises and everything else that makes a noise is just amazing. What about music? You like great music? I do too This game a variety of different music and about 90% of the artist on here are pure gold. It has tracks with Jay Rock Kendrick Lamar Queen Black Flag Snoop Dogg NWA and many many more great artist. Whether you're into electronic music or old school rap there's a radio station for you.The only complaint that I have is there's not a heavy metal station but the Punk Rock station sort of makes up for it.The AI is great too It doesn't feel like there's only 30 different vehicles and only 10 different player models. It feels like the real world. There is so many things to see and do.Now if you are dead set on playing a game just for multiplayer then this game is good for that too.You create your own character and the creation even goes as far to pick your family heritage and stuff. It has a great tutorial to start you into the multiplayer and there are so many things you can do.Missions Races or just roaming around with friends or new players online. It's a great set up and I highly recomend it.All in all this game is great to play alone or with friends. If you haven't bought it already or if you think you should save your money stop over thinking it. Simply buy this game. It's a great game. I honestly doubt you could just hate it so you're not going to waste $60 you're going to put $60 to great use.I've bought this game twice and I might buy it even more. (Hard Copy and for friends) If I do I won't regret it.. not one bit.For day one this game has so little bugs that it's amazing.Stop reading reviews and buy this game so you can write one yourself!,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,0,0,871,False,Recommended,GTA V is a a game I always come back to Though I did not play the preivous GTA games GTA V is in my top 10 favorite games of all time. I almost always play GTA Online and was not invested in the single player campaign. That aside the game boasts incredible attention to detail fun but simple flying/driving smooth third person shooting enjoyable missions and much more. It's a great game to kick back and play when you want to relax. Likes Attention to detail Always something to do Simple yet fun flying/driving New updates add depth and more to do Always something to work towards Hackers are less and less common Great visuals Funny momentsDislikes Online vulerable to hackers due to the way the game is programmed Very difficult to earn large amounts of cash and everything is overpriced Griefers are common and can ruin your fun NPC's can be very annoying at times Overall I would definitely recommend this game to others. It's reviews have recently plummeted in ratings because Take Two Interactive (the publisher) shut down some popular modding tools in an effort to stop some malicious hacking mods that were going around. The community decided to respond by giving bad reviews. The game will always be moddable and I personally think the response was blown out of proportion. Don't be fooled this game is great and worth the purchase in my opinion.Update As time goes on the overpriced content in this game has begun to upset me more and more. If you spend $100 in real money for the game you get 8 mil which is about enought to buy 2 super cars if you're lucky. When GTA Online first came out the most expensive car sat around 800 grand. The ridiculous prices make playing the game very punishing as earning money is insanely slow. This choice only encourages hacking which is still rampant.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,5,70,65,False,Recommended,"Sandbox game with a take it or leave it storyline and lots of city to explore.It departed from the ""locked"" areas of the map that that previous games had. Everything is explorable from the minute you are able to walk the streets.The storyline is very impressive. You have three very distinct personalities involved in the form of Trevor A sociopath with anger issuesMichael The professional bank robber with family issuesFranklin The illiterate gang banger trying to make it bigGreat visuals and graphics (if your rig can handle it... there were some folks having issues) along with butter smooth gameplay and 60 FPS throughout the entire game (again depends on your rig of course).Sound (The usual station selections are here along with some new ones... the absence of the funny commercials is really obvious to me but I actually liked them)Gameplay The only issue I can say I had with the gameplay was the fact that the driving engine still needs some work. It's worlds better than GTA IV but still nothing compared to the SR series. Sometimes you hit a curb and keep your grip othertimes you hit the same curb and end up getting rolled 20 times. There doesn't seem to be much consistency with it. Shooting It's not what I would say tight unless you're using the Mouse and Keyboard. I found it to be very forgiving as far as distance shots and headshots. Probably to compensate for the fact that most people use a gamepad for a game like this.Some Cons In a game that revolves around driving you'd think there would be an easier way to get your cars or at least be able to use them. But if you do any mission that you drove up to in your custom vehicle it's gone. It MIGHT (some of the time) end up in the impound but about half the time it's just plain gone. The only real vehicle you have that is consistent is the default one. So don't waste your money at the beginning of the game souping up an infernus you jacked. There's really no point. Even when you get a place to store your vehicles you still have to take a cab to get them out of the garage.. and if you lose it in the water or get it blown up. It's gone for good also.The other thing I didn't quite understand was the fact that the ""hang out"" function of the game seemed to be just thrown together and didn't really have a purpose nor does it integrate into the storyline. I was at a portion of the game where Michael and Trevor hated each other (one of the many) and yet I called him to hang out and took him to a bar played tennis etc. and they acted like best buddies.All in all it's a good game. I wouldn't say there is ""lots to do"" beyond the main missions. The focus seems to be just getting through the game and then trying out the online version of the game. There aren't even any end game unlocks or interesting things to do beyond one mission for Trevor.So.. I'd give it 9/10 for the game overall9.5/10 for the graphics and attention to detail for small things you may never notice but do appreciate when you see them.And once you win the game for the first time.. you owe it to yourself to replay the first few missions to see how the three of them had their stories intertwined even before you really knew who they were!",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-20,0,0,184,False,Recommended,This game is very well put together in terms of details story characters online mode etc. I will continue to play this games online mode only let me explain. When not doing the story gta 5 gets very bland and boring very very quickly. That is just one of the problems the PC port is average and its not holding up very well. There is a problem with GTA ONLINE the modders and mod community are always creating new accounts with steam family share. I recommend only giving a ban to those who ruin the game for others and the ones who use money hacks. And online mode is full of trolls aswell. So most of the time I play on a friends only server. One of the things that keeps this game going is the beauty and size of Los Santos. My favorite character Miachael is a very intesting person and I thought he was the storys best strength. Franklin is a very fun character to play and is a very funny character with funny and interesting friends such as lamar. Trevor is a very beafy character to play and I always get a sense of fear or anxiety when listening to dialouge or just playing as him which means he is voiced by an amazing voice actor and the character designer did a fantasic job on him. Overall this game has some cons and a lot of pros. But the pros throw the cons out of the window this game is just fantastic really recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun online mode and an interesting story. So this brings me to my conclusion is this game going to last another 2 years and my answer is yes/ and no because of the aging process it has been taking and this process is just a process that I see in a lot of games that show the aging of the game for example Dead Island has aged very badly because of movement with gta 5 its a lack of entertainment. This will in the end be what dwindles this games population. So I recommend playing this game for the few years it has left and who knows I could always be wrong because opinions are opinions.,Grand Theft Auto V

It has an overall very good action packed story well um I would say this game does have an amazing story to keep us entertained for hours and hours so apart from the story mode which we will be spending more time doing crazy stuffs. That's GTA for all of us D Doing crazy stuffs and doing more exploration. So let's talk about the characters. Trevor and Michael are the Best Buds I've ever seen in a video game but with an awkward rage relationship lol Franklin the son Michael always wanted! One of the most beautiful thing about this game is night which I personally find it so beautiful and so realistic!! What else? Ah the never ending mysteries UFO Aliens Unseen Monsters discovering deep ocean and some creepy noises at 3 A.M will keep you in game forever Oh and few Youtubers will make you to play this game over and over again p. The details in GTA V is just amazing and we have to appreciate it and the game is well optimized as I almost run at 60FPS on my laptop which has an i5 Processor and GTX 950m with 12GB Ram. You have to love Rockstar's attention to detail! Rockstar predicted every little dumb thing weridos might do.. You've lots of stuffs to do in game after you've done the story mode. There is more than enough content packed from Collectables Discoveries Mysteries &amp Side Quest Etc. Rockstar didn't at all disappoint us with the latest installment ),Grand Theft Auto V

Here's a few things I'd like to debunk from playing this game for 500 hours. 1. Hackers are common. ones are rare it happens. If you don't enjoy it just switch sessions. (Or play jobs I literally never see any hackers when I am out doing races deathmatches survivals etc. They all frolic in free mode.)2. Anyone down here crying that they were banned for literally no reason saying ""I ground so hard for all that money!"" is probably lying trying to get un banned for their stupid cheating. I've played this game for years and really the only way to get banned is dropping money for yourself/others. Or getting so many reports that rockstar actually does something about it. I have been friends with countless modders and hackers and they are pretty power drunk people most of the time if I'm honest. But sometimes they can make the session better if you're not a baby. If you start telling modders to off and that you're reporting them they ARE going to ruin your fun. If you don't like it that much find a new session easy as Pause &lt Online &lt Find New Session. Or easy as One Two Three.3. You CAN legitimately afford the stuff rockstar markets. You want a Luxor Delux? Buy a hangar buy regular Luxor paint it gold. Badda Bing Badda Boom. Back in my days on PS3 I could probably make 200 grand a night grinding missions. All you need to get started is to buy a Bunker I say the bunker because you don't need to also buy a warehouse like the CEO Offices. Normally people don't mess with gunrinning shipments. 90% of the time they destroy your stuff it's just for the sake of destroying your stuff to you off. Because people are like that. Whenever you want to sell mass amounts of goods you're gonna need a few friends and there's plenty of guides on how to get a solo public session you can just invite your friends back to then sell your stuff before anyone joins. 4. There's a lot to do in this game I find myself patrolling free mode basically allll the time and I have personally gotten bored doing it. Many people do this and then get mad that they can't go inside perticular buildings and do this and that and give it a review. Me and my friend were bored in free roam one time and I asked him if he wanted to play from versus missions and races and stuff. So we went and tried it out and we actually had a lot of fun. The rockstar created job lists are massive. And there's even a creator to make your own stuff which I have utilized many a times over the years.5. You don't need to buy everything that isn't the goal. To say there's an end goal to GTA Online would be like saying there's a specific end goal for everyone in life. After you reach the max level 120 you just keep leveling. I am like level... probably 230 something now. I have everything I could ever want in GTA Online however I find myself never using a lot of it. Some things are annoying to not have in GTA Online like a lot of guns/ammo. I have all the guns and tons of ammo for them all and I sort of feel very vaulnerable when I play on my alternate character which is only like level 70. (Back when he was level 20 it was hard fending off rocket spamming 3 Kdr players that stat pat.) GTA is just basically an open world crime game where the only objective is gaining a higher net worth.6. If you like cars it's a pretty good game Open world you're not limited to sports/race cars like some racing games. if you like pickup trucks or SUV's there's plenty of those for you to own. You can own up to 120 some cars and you have the freedom to do with them as you wish be it racing drifting or wrap the son of around a tree. You do you man. But as a car enthusiast GTA V is my favorite game. The guns and the planes and the boats and everything else is just a huge bonus when I don't feel like doing car stuff. 7. The developers are active they kind of have to be though so it's not a surprise but I find a lot of good games on steam develop very slowly and updates are few and far between. But Rockstar keeps it pretty up to date with new content. (Although it would be nice to see that content in Singleplayer like you guys used to *cough*) And uh singleplayer. God it's been years since I played the story but it's good that's what all the hype and all the love came from in the first place and we can't forget what a great game this was. When it was released it was the benchmark for computer performance can I run GTA V? GTA V Budget PC builds. This is really a classic game that I believe lived up and beyond it's predisessors. And don't give me that ""Oh but GTA IV had better AI and better car damage and it was more realistic!"" because yes GTA IV did have some details left out from GTA V but overall this really didn't ruin the game and probably wasn't even noticed by most people until that guy on youtube made that GTA IV is better than GTA V video. (Which has 10 million views and people are making reaction videos to it.) But I can understand that they basically re made the game from scratch. Unlike the Saints Row transition from III to IV. If you're going to copy and paste a game I am going to be upset that you removed details. But if you re make the game from scratch and it's bigger/better. I can ignore some missing details like how pedestrians stumble when they're pushed. Everyone is comparing their experince to value I don't care about the money if I enjoyed this. If I ""randomly get banned"" I'd buy it again honestly. Rockstar has a lot on their hands to turn heads with GTA VI and honestly I expect a heatwave similar to Call of Duty Advanced Warfare upon it's trailer release because PC gamers are ing spoiled and hop on mob mentality band wagons like Bad Dragon products. For example when they banished OpenIV. There was an influx of over 40 000 negative reviews in like 3 days. People just came to on GTA V and rockstar because everyone else was doing it and it was cool. If you ask me hackers make the game more fun in Online. You really just have to be creative. Before YOU leave a negative review think about if this is a game you'd really enjoy in the first place. Because it's not just a 'shooter'. You wanna play GTA V multiplayer with mods online? Get FiveM. It's great. And probably exactly what you want.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,2,10,73,False,Not Recommended,Where to start? I have about 17.4 hours on record according to this sheet but a good eight hours were from being AFK while I tried to Google workarounds for the disabled friend joining feature in the online section of GTA 5. Apparently this is a bug that has been rampantly reported since the console release of GTA 5 but no solution or patch has been implemented.I find this to be troubling in unison with the reported 'special character' bug that prevents PC players from being able to sign in. What's more preloading the game by removing 60 GB of data from my SSD only to find out that I needed to remove another 60 GB of data just to download 358 MB of deencryption. Why are these bugs even here? This should have been fixed months maybe a year ago. To me it suggests Rock Star's QA review over the last few years has failed at conceptualising the fundamental aspect of gaming consistency and stability. You can make a beautiful game but when I can't play with my friends or I can't play at all the aesthetic aspects of GTA 5 is no longer a pleasure it is a detriment. Rockstar had more than enough time to fix these problems and they never did. As far as I am concerned until these bugs are fixed I have no reason to release a positive review.,Grand Theft Auto V

Just another way for Rock$tar to make money off of the lazy impulsive people who don't want to spend the time earning in game money. And they will bundle GTA 5 with a Shark Card and say it's on sale charging $60 instead of $80. Extra virtual money that can be earned in a breeze. There is a thing called heists. This game deserves a 10/10 when it first launched.

Not to much depth tho.GTA V Multiplayer is an abomoination 70% of the time you are waiting for lobbys to fill loading screens to end etc. etc. etc.I feel like this game couldve been alot better if the money for this joke of a multiplayer went into the singleplayer.60 /$ not so much. Surely a great game for 40ish /$.For now i dont recommend this game lets see how the muliplayer comes along.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-20,2,33,949,False,Recommended,Single Player campaign is amazing. Just like all other GTA games the single player mode is very well done and there is a lot to do. There is more than enough story and gameplay to justify the price alone without the Online mode. The game runs great and is so much fun to play. There is no denying this is one of the best games out there in quite a while.The Online mode has strong positives and very strong negatives. It is lots of fun plenty of different modes to try out and things to do. The heists in my opinion are the best part of online and are tremendously fun for sure. Just driving around with your friends is great or doing races with stunt courses. There are many many problems with online however. First of all everything costs a crazy amount of money including the required buildings you need to start heists especially the doomsday one. There is a huge amount of hackers or modders online also. So many that it's rare I play the game and there isn't one the lobby or at least someone complaining about one that just left. The modders can do any number of things like lock your character kill you instantly from far distances or spawn any number of vehicles items (including money) or just random obsticles such as UFOs. For someone that would be playing the game legit and worked for weeks to collect crates to sell having that inventory blown up instantly by a modder would be devastating.There are a number of technical issues mostly related to online mode as well. The time it takes to load the online lobby can be extremely long. This includes when you're done missions or heists and go back to the open world. I've had numerous ocasions and so has everyone i know where the lobby takes past 10 minutes to load back up or wont load at all forcing you to ALT F4 to quit. In fact the loading is so long that almost always when i'm done playing i wont wait for the game to load again i will close it with ALT F4. Furthermore the menus seems extremely delayed and are very awkward to use with mouse and keyboard you very often dont realize you're on a certain screen when you think you are. The online matchmaking is also very hard to understand and use. Sometimes when you want to start a new heist/setup/mission/race you join other peoples game by mistake because there's no option to stop that.There is so many more issues with the Online mode that there's too many to list and could really go on forever. Almost every time i play there's something that's extremely frustrating about it purely on a technical aspect not related to modders or other players.Saying all these faults about the game there is no way i could not recommend it to everyone. There is so much polish in the actual gameplay controls story characters voice acting overall feel and pure enjoyment in this game that it's worth playing no matter what else is wrong with it.But seriously the modders/hackers need to stop. Although with the price of everything online it's not going to.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-13,1,5,307,False,Recommended,All the reviews about Rockstar pushing microtransactions are trash. Of course they'll push to make more money if they're still supporting the game with free DLC so long after launch. Naturally cars will cost more given the infinite (and increasing) ways you can make money legitimately. Downvoting arguably one of the greatest games of all time solely because of the multiplayer support is poor form.

2017-12-28,9,58,67,False,Recommended,Product received for free. I'm definitely hooked by this game...totally stop playing other games when I got GTA V as a gift from a very good friend. However this game has both pros and cons. Here are my thoughts about GTA V.Pros Stunning visuals Great soundtracks The gameplay is very easy to understand. The tutorial is helpful enough to get you to know the gameplay. Full controller support which makes it easier to drive / fly vehicles There are lots of stuffs to do in GTA V and the devs keep updating / adding new missions on it so it's still fun even after many years of release. More fun with friends but you can also play solo if you don't have any or if you don't wanna play with them. P Has both story mode and online mode I like the options that you can customize your online session to play with friends only or with pubs. Basically The Sims for guys (and girls) with more actions! I would consider the shark cards as a pro because why not? It's a shortcut to getting rich. Still better than hacking though.Cons So many hackers killing the buzz of the game Laggy &lt &lt &lt The game runs on P2P because Rockstar has no dedicated servers for online sessions as per Ender's comment. I sometimes get disconnected or lagging moment when playing with some friends. Some other players may be annoying by constantly killing you. If you get salty just change the session or kill them back until they change the server instead.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-18,0,0,212,False,Not Recommended,For the most part this game is great. Its everything a pc gamer wants from a game. Great storyline fantastic graphics 60 fps you name it. But there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review. It's the fact that every single time i try to join GTA online it forces me to sign into to Social Club. Dosen't sound bad right? Well the issue is every single time I try to log in nothing happens. Absolutly nothing. In fact when I sign in it actually logs me OUT of the game forcing me to restart my game. I cannot join online because when I sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does as I mentioned before ABSOLUTLY NOTHING. It dosen't look like its trying to sign in it dosen't look like its trying to do anything at all. So now my friend and I cannot play online together which is a HUGE shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing. Its almost as if I can only play 50% of the game because gta online is such a huge part of the game. Hopefully Rockstar Games will fix this issue. If that is to happen I will change my review for sure.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,4,15,61,False,Not Recommended,"AVOID THIS GAME LIKE A WARM SPOT IN A SWIMMING POOLPlease give me the Self Refund Button so I can click it.Where to begin...Purchased this game for the PS3 out 60 bucks game freezes no fix tried two copies on 3 PS3's no help from Rockstar. Waited forever with anticipation for its release on PC preordered postponed release waited some more... then the day finally arrived... Oh Joy.Random crashes in single player constant messages to reboot and reload ( if this continues contact Rockstar Support). Once in it works fine until it decides to dump to a black screen and lock up. Online.... Wow what a poor design might work for some but not what I expected from the ads I cross between CrimeCraft and APB but not as good as either in any area and those games are not great. In a nutshell the City is a Lobby of sorts while you ride around and jack cars and shoot other players for no reason or you get a call from an NPC for a PVE mission to do something random. Or you can drive to a blue icon on the map and start a mission which for the most part are just weak pvp vs instances... At this point the game becomes a ""Load Screen Simulator"" which I give a 10/10. Early experience in these games types is that you spend more time in load screens than actually playing a match. Of all that I played so far the worst was ""Crooked Cop"" it boiled down to 40 cop cars wrecked around a package with members of both teams spawning a block away each time they died and driving strait into the pile of cars... total cluster the worst game mechanics in a multiplayer game I have experienced to date. On every level... ""Come out and Play"" really? WTF Rockstar.... why? So to sum it up I have wasted a total of 120 bucks on a game that is not worth playing. I was ""lucky"" enough to get it installed so no refund for me or I would be clicking that button. Three installs of Social Club to fix random crashes and the inability to load the online game at all as well as server drops where I am attempting to play Load ""Scream"" Simlulator yes scream not a typo that's what we call it we see the f'n load wheel or birds eye city view or game tips and we scream.... So server drops in a session with a friend all of a sudden a spam of people leaving and I am all by myself in a session no friends. I have to close the game down and relaunch and wait... and wait.... only to waist more time trying to find my friend before we launch into load screens to do something stupid then get so frustrated we quit and go do something else. Could this game be fun yes is it no. Truth is its broken. And before you scream hater I love the franchise I was with GTA since its inception and have had every title since but this one has issues plain and simple. I truly feel they should make the refund available to everyone. Please give me the Self Refund Button so I can click it.Rockstar today a fan has died...

2015-04-22,0,0,171,False,Not Recommended,GTA V was my most craved game of 2015. Every delay even further made me want it more and ensured me Rockstar was going to give us a fully optimised product here. Yeah this game works for a lot of people hence the dominant recommended reviews but for me no. This game crashes all the flippin time. I'm running an R9 290 i5 w/ 16GB RAM. I'm above rec. specs and this game crashes like there is no tomorrow even after it's 2 updates. I don't have all of the graphic settings turned on and many of them are lower than the highest setting available and it'll still crash like crazy. Sometimes it crashes after 10 min of play sometimes 1 hr. Sometimes driving sometimes walking sometimes in a mission sometimes just standing there. I have found however that the lower the graphical settings are the less the game crashes. But man the lowest settings look almost worse than the PS3/360 version of the game.

Atleast the first few times it crashed it actually got me through the social club sequence now when i start the game it takes me to the social club app and everything goes white. So as anyone would i closed the application. Of course though when i tried to start again it said ""Failed to launch app is already running."" This statment was false so i proceded on to the Rockstar Games Support website. Their methods were smart and most likely usefull to other people but not me. I sware i have tried everything and almost come to a conclusion that my computer just isnt capable. This lead me to buying an Nvidia geforce graphics card and downloading the drivers. If you have read this whole thing so far you already know this was a complete waste of time. Now that i have wasted lots of time and money i am able to make a statement that i do not recomend this game for laptop users like myself it is very displeasing and if anyone knows what im dealing with i would very much appriciat support and help with this time nagging issue. As for right now though no i do not reccomend this game for graphical errors and bugs. I am very sorry for those who do not like this statement but until i can get my game working my statement remains the same and once again would appriciate some support. Also before i end this i would like to say that since i did prepurchase this game i am very upset to notice that for the small time frame i was able to play in my extra dlc money that i should have gotton was not in my game.

2017-07-09,0,0,361,False,Recommended,The modding community's reaction to this notorious OpenIV case was really REALLY exaggerated.Over the years I have enjoyed Rockstar games both on Ps3 and PC. I've played GTA 3 SA LBS GTA IV Red Dead Redemption Max Payne trilogy and GTA V for over 1000 hours total and I've never used any mods.Why you may ask. Why didn't you expand your gaming experience for all these wonderful games to enjoy so much more?The answer is simple they are all already wonderful games. They don't NEED to be modded in order for you to enjoy them.Sure GTA V has had rough times. The game has gone through phases that have made it so frustrating you'd just want to throw it to the wall and never play it again.After all the rough times I still enjoy GTA V. And I've been really happy with the official content so happy that I've never EVER felt a need to fool around with mods (even though some games like Skyrim I enjoy modding). The reaction by the modding community is on the other hand very understandable (some people do it as a side job to pay rent etc.) but on the other hand immature and extremely ridiculous.

2015-05-02,0,0,124,False,Recommended,Great game I never played the console version so there is no way for me to be bias here. I have played my fair share of ports and over hyped games that have come to the steam store and in one way or another they are usually not as good or up to par with any of the original versions. During the port process often times games will also have very poor conversion and then things become broken or not adjusted to a better gaming experience for PC players however after playing through this game so far I can assure you that it is a magnificent port that runs EXTREMELY well for PC unlike a lot of other games. The video is steady and works wonderfully while the controls for both keyboard and mouse users or controller users have very well optomised and easy to use. Don't have any doubts that this game is bad because you will get the same if not a better experience then the previous versions from what I am able to tell. Online works very smoothly with loads of player activity and a variety of game modes to keep you entertained for a long time. While the sttory is very interesting and keeps you wanting more.Highly recommend it and it is great fun with friends!,Grand Theft Auto V

Garbage P2P multiplayer. R* can't spend a penny on servers. At least a couple hackers in every public session. The ones who are not hackers are flying jets rocket""bikes"" that fire guided missiles and driving tanks with the sole purpose of annoying the out of you. One game breaking bug after another. You better have dedicated friends because playing with randoms is literally the worst experience of my life. The UI is ing as well. Wanna go to a private session with friends? First spend 10 minutes loading singleplayer(because you ing have to for some reason?) then spend 10 minutes loading multiplayer then notice you are in a PUBLIC session repeat then do a job (another 20 minutes of loading) and end up in separate mother ig public sessions with all the hackers and .Oh and did I mention? Every time you log in YOU ARE SPAMMED WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED PHONECALLS FROM A BUNCH OF . And why do they call? TO BUG YOU ABOUT STUFF YOU NEED AT LEAST 10 MILLION FOR.

Takes 15 minutes to make that 20k. All of it. Gone.Wanna play a R* game?

2017-07-03,0,0,146,False,Recommended,This game is one of the most fun games I have ever played with or without mods.I don't like writing reviews because most of the time I feel that the way a company knows that I like their game is because I'll give it a thumbs up on another review and I haven't tried refunding it. I have however found a need to write a review of this game because of the recent conflict I have seen.Judging this game's vanilla singleplayer content Without spoiling too much this is one of the only single player games that I can honestly say swept me away. The story was a fantastic tale of three unexpected friends and it constantly keeps the player entertained. I played through it three times before finally hanging up the controller on my ps3/ps4 and switching to PC. If you are looking for a good single player time this game is definitely the way to go.Multiplayer I can't be too biased with the multiplayer even though that's where I spent most of my time on the PC version of this game.The multiplayer is grindy. That's it. It's just grindy. The above statement is very bold but I admit that I cannot stop playing GTA Online for one reason only. It is the most fun multiplayer game I have to play with friends. I have easily put 200 300 hours combined between the PS4 and PC versions of this game's multiplayer. The heists are so much fun when you're coordinated. The grindy missions become a lot of fun when you can think of creative and imaginative ways to complete them with your friends. All in all it is a fantastic waste of time to spend with your friends. People complain about hackers and cheaters but I think that finding ways to thwart them with your friends is a totally new type of minigame for the multiplayer.Mods Here is where my real criticism comes in... I support Take Two for their actions. I know that this will not be a popular opinion but it's the truth. The whole time since before the release of the PC version of this game they have been adamant and honest about their opinion of modding the game. They released patch after patch trying to stop mods from being a thing. If this wasn't an issue before why is it an issue now? I don't think trying to take down OpenIV may have been the best decision but it was a necessary decision that they made to solidify their opinion on the matter. Mods are not an essential part of this game. Any single person does not have to buy shark cards they don't have to buy this game at all. They have been completely honest and open about the fact that they do not want their game modded. Sorry but it's the truth.TL DRGreat single player. Multiplayer is grindy but fun with friends. Devs and producers have never wanted mods and tried to ban mods from the game. It wasn't a big issue then it shouldn't be now.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,0,0,576,False,Recommended,"I love this game and I've waited for the PC version ever since it was released. I think it was well worth the wait which is why I'm recommending this game. However I do not support Rockstar and their current decison to ban everyone for the use of mods even in single player. I'm aware that a large portion of people who bought the game intending to mod the hell out of it but instead are just getting banned. In my opinion this doesn't ruin the game because I enjoy the game the way it is but mods make every game 10x better and I can only think to myself ""Damn Rockstar...you ed up.""In terms of the game itself it's almost everything I've wanted in a game. Optimization this time around compared to GTA IV is a lot better. I'm amazed how well this game performs on both my desktop and my midrange gaming laptop at max settings. When looking at the graphics I'm amazed by every single aspect it has to offer. Minor details such as puddles when it rains the glow and light pollution given off by the city at night from a distance etc. This game has so many little features that didn't need to be added that make the game an even more immersive experience. When looking at the story even though I'm about 35% in as of writing this review I actually enjoy it. While I prefer all the opportunites mulitplayer has to offer with it's minigames character creation and ability to play with friends I still find myself enjoying the storyline and being hooked on it. I admit the first hour was a bit boring but when it started to pick up it picked up and got damn good. It's not often I find myself wanting to pay attention and keep playing the campaign in a free roaming game. As of the current ""Rockstar modding banhammer"" controversy if you want the game simply to mod the hell out of it don't get it otherwise you're just going to be off and hate a great game because the developers are being shitelords. If you're looking for a game with possible modding potential in the future or don't care and want to experience the game as it is which offers a great storyline as well as one of the best multiplayer experiences get it. Empty your wallet. Let it all out. You won't regret it.Boner/10",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-22,0,0,608,False,Not Recommended,"Especially with how Rockstar handles their bans I suggest some deep thought on playing this game.With this Christmas ban wave a bunch of innocent players have been getting hit with it. I have used mod menus before in the recent past however I had some idiot drop money bags on me tonight and resulted in me getting banned 2 hours later. If you check other reviews there are repeats of my own case. I had a friend personally banned on this game for no reason a few months ago and all they used was ""You violated the EULA and your ban in permanent."" So if you're innocent and happened to be smacked with the hammer don't expect to get your ban appealed since their EULA allows no contesting of suspensions. If you get dropped money Rockstar automatically assumes you're hacking gets triggered and swings a 30 day ban at you since that apparently affects their income and they don't want people using other methods than their precious Shark Cards.In fact the last few updates in GTA Online have been complete P2W and forces you to either receive money from a hacker or buy their shark cards. The Export/Import update for all of the content alone was nearly $50 million alone with the discounts I received from missions. Prior missions have been in the $10 million to $25 million ballpark for all the unlocks. Overall unless you're planning to grind out for weeks on end for your money then expect to be coughing up money.If this issue doesn't turn you away from playing the optimization of this game is in the garbage. I have a GTX 1070 and it takes nearly 5 minutes or more just to load into an online session. This doesn't even include the random crashes or infinite loading loops that may occur from leaving your clubhouse office apartment missions etc. My other friends have better computers than I do and the issue happens to them as well. My GTX 960 had better loading times than my 1070.Honestly I love playing this game however Rockstar is pretty horrible on the optimization of the game and handling of bans.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-06,0,0,230,False,Recommended,Amusing Intese and Surreal these are what come to mind when hearing Grand Theft Auto especially GTA V and GTA Online. It's fast pace and top graphics make it special both story and online. From the vibrant landscape of Sandy Shores to the city life of Los Santos there is no question that Rockstar delivers excellence with an amazing storyline and realistic life. The activites never fail ( Firing Range Golf Tennis Darts and Arm Wrestling Ect.). There is a Director mode in story that you can create videos with stocks that you can buy off of your phone and/or PC. In Online you can create your own empire buying houses/penthouses Bunkers and all other sorts of properties. Land Sea or Air there are Races you can join in and if you want to be a dare devil there are Stunt Races. Custom Created events are also available to be used and made by players. Overall the Game as a whole delivers but like all games there are negatives (like the server ques). 9.4/10 D,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-05,0,0,887,False,Recommended,If you want this game I would check out the longer more mature reviews if I were you. Most of these negative reviews almost always have something to do with modding.As the vanilla (original game without mods just how it is meant to be) version of the game it's great! Lots of options relating to altering your desired graphics controls audio and lots of other great settings to customize how you wish to play Grand Theft Auto V. Single player has always been fun to play seriously on and then mess around at the end of Story Mode always keeps you entertained. It's got a great way of making you want to come back to it. The Story Mode is long and has different ways of going about some of the missions. Grand Theft Auto Online isn't that bad although I still prefer Single Player. Now that it's on Steam there isn't a community that's worse than console. There's less wannabe Vanoss kids and more mature good sports on. However some people take heists way too seriously which lets this down and there's no way I'm quoting what they spit out of their disgusting mouths. Yet the rest of Grand Theft Auto Online is perfect. Only a few bugs here and there but good.HOWEVER people who prefer to mod the game are getting banned. Me being a modder myself I'm going to put out my personal opinion on this. In my opinion modding Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to involve banning. The length of the ban should depend on the severity of the mods. What I completely disagree with is the fact that users are now getting banned for modding Single Player. This is stupid for Rockstar to be so fussy with their game. If it got modded on console did they really think that PC would be anything better? PC is the home of modding. I have no idea what they were thinking.I'm going to put two ratings on this for both vanilla and mods.Vanilla 9/10 Great game but sometimes bad communityModding 4/10 Great game for modding but Rockstar are ruining the fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-31,0,0,308,False,Recommended,Rating 8/10This game is one of the best sandbox online games out there. The singleplayer story is very well made and the online is always active with plenty of things to keep you busy! The economy online is alot more pricey though then playing in singleplayer so it is hard to afford things if you arent doing heist or jobs. I do think there rockstars security is a big issue with playing online as you are likely to be in a lobby with a hacker or a troll. But there is massive collection of clotheing and customization you can choose from with your character and the vehicles you play with as well.

Would this not be considered False advertising as they said that it would support it OFFICIALLY then they take it away? DefinitionFalse advertising False advertising or deceptive advertising is the use of ((false or misleading statements)) in advertising and misrepresentation of the product at hand which may negatively affect many stakeholders especially consumers.Many people only bought GTA 5 PC for the mods!Me being one of them. I already own the game on consoles and bought it for the mods on PC.Many people building whole new PC's to play it on PC.Now they take away mods!!Idea Rockstar Offline mode Allows players to make offline sessions and mod them as they see fit. In this mode the player would be identified as having modified content in their game and be allowed to play in this lobby. (Owner of lobby can set starting cash for players joining(Default 0) and would be able to ban people from their servers)None of the cash earned in this would be put into GTA Online just into GTA OfflineAny modders found joining GTA Online would be banned/cheaters poolThis would also allow people to make Role Play sessions and whatever else they wanted to make.You can obviously tell who has modified data in their game so would this not solve the problems at hand?And one last thing.... Let us mod single player. We are going to do it anyway so by banning us for it is complete BS..,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-28,0,0,1362,False,Recommended,"First of all some of these reviews stating things like ""come back to play after x months days etc"" only for their in game time to read 0.0 hours should tell you a lot about most of them.GTA Online is one of the best if not the best open world game out there just now. Great value for money as the single player was good fun too.The grind is not that bad. Hackers are a problem although nowhere near as bad it is was 6 months ago. All games have hackers now it is an industry in itself. No point complaining just use report function in game or on the Social Club website or Rockstar Support Twitter Feed simple. This is a farming game at heart the gameplay is very good and fun. All the Jobs and Modes PvP Racing etc are all very competitive and really good fun. The Stunt races are definitely my favourites.Creating your own maps Race Deathmatch etc is very easy and quite fun to do once you get to grips with controls (Cannot walk backwards for example in Creator yet anyway).Most of the players you will meet are decent human beings just grinding like you. Due to how popular this game actually is you will meet all sorts of characters NPC and real. It is your job to filter out those you get a long with and those you don't.To avoid bad sport penalties do not kill white icon players when they are in their vehicles or dog them consistently kill them over and over. Especially when they ask you to stop. If they attack or are about to attack you of course is it okay to engage them.Good sport killings are any players with color icon ANY. Players who get banned rightfully do so those who were banned by mistake do get their bans lifted. Anyone who has not gotten their ban lifted was hacking the game or were happily taking money from hackers simple. If a hacker has spawned money on a player nothing a player can really do about that Rockstar remove those funds. I have had this happen to myself.Shark Cards are there for players who can afford to spend frivolously.The economy is ok. I do feel some things are overpriced. clothing mostly.The infinite loading screen seems to occur randomly. You are best to just quit game and restart if it takes longer than 6 8 mins. The longest I waited was around 30 mins once just to see if it would load.Online content has been maintained pretty well I think. GTA Devs adjust the game around once a week if needed no downtime. Only downtime is when new content is added or there is an issue with servers (maintenance). Unlike a lot of other games.The future of GTA Online is looking very promising indeed.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-19,1,2,327,False,Not Recommended,"Pre TL DR Creator Mode has poor controls gun play is lack luster at best no dedicated servers no solid mod support.If you're looking for a game with a great PC experience... You're looking in the wrong damn place. With Rockstar not being open with mods and a simple port over to the PC I can personally say that this game is not worth $60.What do I mean by a ""simple port""? First the Creator for the game the part that allows users to create custom arenas courses and etc for the pre existing game modes is still based for the controller. A majority of the controls are forcefully bound to your keyboard so if you're looking to move a prop just a smidge up... Good luck. Another thing is the console feeling shooting system. No recoil. Minimal Spread. You can say I'm crying because I am. I'm crying because someone can rapid fire a semi auto rifle from a long range and easily land body shots on someone (in this situation me) who wanted to try and take the extra half a second to aim for the head with the actual bolt action sniper rifle.TL DR The Creator is mostly keyboard based the gun play is lack luster... at best.Now regarding everything else that's missing from a true PC game... No sign of dedicated servers or any solid mod support. Why would dedicated servers need to be a thing? For modded game types such as different maps other than Los Santos a roleplay game mode added weapons and jets and etc. that could be enjoyed by a fairly large group of people. The multiplayer is heavily limited to what Rockstar produces for the game.Modding is what makes the PC experience what it is. It's something that consoles won't be able to do for a long time if ever. Rockstar does not seem to be in support of modding the game multiplayer wise unless you want to be banned or labeled as a hacker.TL DR No dedicated servers no solid modding support.You can agree with me disagree with me but I don't plan on playing the game much anymore unless major changes are made. So don't worry you won't have to see my crying in game.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-15,3,2,14,False,Not Recommended,"Don't get this game to play online if you have a job. Or if you do expect to throw tons of money at it to subvert the grind.I bought this on sale (fortunately for me) agreeing to play with friends and enjoy some jolly co op. Well they left me behind with their massive amounts of free time and started playing with someone else which is fine but the game offers nothing for me as a solo player. There is no fun in doing the grind alone. And I mistakenly put 14 hours into it and can no longer get a refund. Trust me that 14 hours was not spent on anything meaningful nor did I get much progress from it. Not even ""Heist"" ready. Much of it was spent in loadtimes or the game crashing during load screens (I guess? It wasn't frozen nor had it loaded me onto the server after 10 minutes so maybe it is a feature xD) or just getting destroyed by other blinged out players. Or just tweaking the graphics settings and trying to figure out the deal with the memory cap in the settings.If you like open world games (which I do not) then the single player may be well worth it.The online is extremely stratified with people blinged out and able to murder your new over and over (remember to put on passive mode and put your money in the bank... why are there hidden mechanics that serve to newbies like that? Why does it have to be work to protect your money like that?).The game's keyboard support is dismal which is a shame cause the controller is pretty terrible for aiming and shooting (which you gotta do a lot in this game). The menus are garbage especially if you are playing it online they are clearly built around the mindset of using a controller but the actual navigation is poor.The loadtimes in the game are really long especially for (again) online. It can take over 10 minutes to log into the game.The heists are pretty much uncreative single player missions that cost in game money to take the contract for. Every failure costs and the crappy balance and controls in the game means you'll spend a lot just on retries. That's right the weird feel of controlling a GTA avatar is in full force and you are also subject to getting single tapped by the NPCs.The only thing I really enjoyed was the Territory matches and that is just not worth the price of the game. The soundtrack is okay but simply because of the variety it gets old as well.Don't spend more than 5 bucks on this one.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-15,1,2,74,False,Not Recommended,Let me start with the harsh part. Harsh but most important.In the current state (now little over 30 hours after release) this game is far away from 60 worth.Why?Besides all the problems people had even to install the game (granted some people are to be blamed for their rigs but the majority of the problems lies on Rockstar) there are so many other things that should not even have been issues.Want to play online with your friends? Forget about it.Most of the time you're in a session alone. You can try and join other sessions but 9 out of 10 times you'll just be put in a new empty session.Is it a port problem? No.Some times you do get into a session with other people and it's great! Well right until you try to do a job with your friends. Then the errors begin friends can't join you quit the job aaaaand you're back in an empty session and you cannot join your friends session.Does a restart of the game help? Nope.Ok so you paid 60 to play this game with your friends cause come on nobody pays that kind amount for a single player game these days anyway granted the single player campaign is about 25 30 hours long.What else is there to do? Well you can do quick jobs with complete strangers.Oh and did I mention they had this online issue on XBOX One as well and has had it since release and it is still not fixed? Yes that is correct.So lets us sum it up.You paid 60 for an online game that doesn't work very well online which has the same online issues on other platforms that never got fixed?Will it get fixed for PC at least? Probably not. Hopefully but don't expect it.So in this current state I advice you not to buy this. And if you do and you get frustrated about the fact that online play doesn't really work then I suggest you get the refund Steam are offering.You know when Steam starts offering refunds then it's bad really bad!Just don't buy it in current state.

It is a really good game open area to do what you want to do like drive a car in 100 MPH in full stocked traffic to flying planes in the highway.It has alot of mission to do big and small.It is a big game i agree on that ( 60 70 GB)But that just means more good stuff exampleGood graphic really detailed.Good mechanics.Good OnlineGood rulesGood missionsGood and pretty cars.Good and dangerous cars.yeah and along with 500 other stuff.Yes it is true that if you mod like money ( WITCH IS HACKING!) You will be banned from online for a month.But that is good! Who wants hackers with infinite lives and money to ruin your gameplay? NO ONE!So yes you can mod on singleplayer but just deactivate them and get on online.Yes it is a bit expensive but that is because they spent alot to make it and also alot of stuff in it so it makes sense.If you have actually had the time to read all this Thanks!By the way if you are a hacker on GTA V... please dont ever play online with mods. please dont.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,1,2,106,False,Recommended,Excellent port! After GTA IV I was concerned this port would be rubbish as well. So far gameplay has been buttery smooth with no hiccups. I get 60 fps with little to no drops at high settings at 2560x1080. Loading times to get into game are loooong but with an SSD that time would probably be decreased. I haven't had any issues at all logging onto GTA online at all.

If you never played this game what the f*ck are you doing?!I mean the game is awesome but you need to have a pretty good PC to run it at it's finest. Singleplayer is awesome and if you wanna play online first complete the story mode (to at least 90%) and then go online then you will know exactly what you are doing the controls etc.Now the Online For me it's 3 times better than Singleplayer because there is soo much more stuff that isn't in singleplayer (vehicles apartments clothes abilities missions heists yachts motorcycle clubs ceo's and much much more. The bad thing in online is modders. They are the reason that servers are laggy messing up with people ruining fun.. I mean it's hard to get money and you need to grind this game for hours just to buy 1 car or something.And to finish this review The game is awesome and I RECOMMEND it!

2015-06-03,2,2,127,False,Recommended,Finally GTA IV has come out. Now this is a great game it does however have it's pros and cons. I wasen't really hyped about this game after about a month when it originally released. The release dates for the PC version kept being pushed back and the online was having it's fair share of issues. However when the time came for the PC version I grabbed one to play with friends and I thought it was worth the buy.The pros The game features in my own opinion a great story filled with humor and good chracter development. The chracters in this game are some of the best out of the whole series I think and they really kept me engaged with the story/single player. The nest big thing was the city for me the city kept me engaged and hooked from the start of the game. I felt like the character was realy a part of the city during the campaign and the AI was decent enough to give you a feel of immersion. The graphics are good as well as the effects. The first person mode was also a BIG plus for me something new to try and have to say it really makes points of the game very interesting and fun. The weapons are nice and offer a decent variety. Now the cons My first biggest problem with this game is how Rockstar handles things. By that I mean having to use Rockstar social to use this game is a little annoying and the reviews I have been reading about simple mods at times getting people banned and support from Rockstar being very weak does not give me much confidence. The next big thing I think people should know before buying is that NO NEW HEISTS HAVE BEEN PLANNED SO FAR from what I have read. I feel Rockstar is really being lazy when it comes to content and some of these heists as well as the next con point dealing with the hackers of the game. Instead of banning people or letting their software ban people for simple mods they should be banning people who are hacking and making the online experience for others. In the end GTA IV is a solid title in the GTA series even with its flaws. I would recommend this game to my friends and others however I wouldn't recommend it for full price. Why? Well for starters this is what the games third release? Plus with this release there really isn't any new content from the original release which was a pretty good time ago. I would recommend waiting for a deal before grabbing this game but I do recommend this game if you are a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous titles of the series or Saints Row.,Grand Theft Auto V

You really feel like you're truly experiencing loading screens with complete realism.Jokes aside I've never been a fan of the GTA series. I hate drugs vulgar language excessive sexualisation and crime. And I've never really enjoyed a GTA game. But GTAV is different. The world is huge enough multiplayer is customisable enough and content is enjoyable enough to overcome the downsides that create a defined divide between opinions. This game is 65GB of space well taken.So what makes me overcome my distaste for this game series? Well... the sheer number and variety of cars and weapons the numerous types and examples of minigames and missions the list goes on. GTA V is a great game deserving of all the praise it gets and for that I can't help but recommend this game to even the most closed minded of people.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-21,0,0,190,False,Not Recommended,"This game has serious potential but it was deliberately upon by Rockstar. The quality of the port is mostly good unlike GTA IV but unfortunately thats all they did right.Rockstar intentionally made online mode a grind fest that rivals some of the worst MMO's. They intentionally bottlenecked your income so that you would buy in game currency from the Rockstar Store. For most players if you do not buy in game currency you will never obtain even 10% of what is offered online. So essentially I paid 60 dollars to experience 10% of online mode. At this point they expect you to pay extra money to experience the remaning 90%. Many of the vehicles are overpowered as well and inaccessible unless you play the game everyday like a job or cave in and pay money to Rockstar. That is unacceptable. Pay2Win is something you expect from garbage tier free to play games not a 60 dollar ""AAA"" title.One of the cars is even bullet proof AND you can shoot out of it! It makes zero sense players can actually shoot through the armor plating while remaining invulnerable to bullets. This means you have to spend even more money on explosives to take them out. Now heres the kicker. You spent 1500 for one sticky bomb and assuming you land it on their car during a fight you have to pay 7 GRAND TO REIMBURSE THE PLAYER FOR THEIR CAR! So if some is driving up to you and shooting you in free roam for no reason you have to pay extra money to dispose of them and it costs them nothing. This is a ing joke.If you absolutely must buy this game because you want to experience Single Player which is the only good part of the game wait for a sale. Also DO NOT spend money on the micro transactions and reward Rockstar for their t. Gaming is being ruined because gamers support this kind of t.

2015-05-06,0,0,75,False,Recommended,I wasn't pleased with Rockstar delaying the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V and I intended to wait for a sale before buying it but the reviews for the PC version were nothing but positive so I caved within the first week or two of the game being available on Steam.As far as the gameplay goes it's just like any GTA since GTA3. I've not played the console version but GTA5 does look nice on PC. I felt that the story was done fairly well it had twists drama and comedy. I didn't feel like any particular set of character missions were overdone or monotonous and I enjoyed being lazy using the auto aim feature with the gamepad and then switching to KB/M for the scenerious where I needed more precision.I ran GTA5 on an i7 950 4.2GHz 6GB RAM and a Galax GTX 970 EXOC Black. Probably one of the reasons the game actually runs so well (in comparison to the GTA4 PC disaster) is that it loves system resources. It was easily pushing my system RAM usage up over 5.1GB and using over 3GB of VRAM. Going by what I saw on reviews of the GPU I increased my core clock just a bit and then gave the RAM clocks a much larger bump this allowed me to crank the details greatly. I disabled the NVIDIA shadows in favor of softest shadows for some reason I'm under the impression that if a GPU manufacturer develops a specific feature that it should look good and run awesome on their GPU but that doesn't seem to be the case with the NVIDIA shadows performance took quite a hit. Those shadows do look good but you really probably won't notice it while you're trying to drive through every coincidental red light going 150MPH. The only technical issue I had may have been related to Riva Tuner Statistics Server. If you use something like MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision X they may interfere with the game and cause a 'D3D' crash. I had no issues after closing the EVGA application.All in all good fun game. Rockstar made a good effort to prevent this from being a disaster and it shows. (I've not played online mode.),Grand Theft Auto V

There is no way to properly express how good this game is anyone who thinks this game isn't worth playing because Rockstar is pulling some shady buisness is unequivically wrong.

This game looks nice but is better played in 4k or 5k resoultion as 1080p can be an eyesore. Also that music at the beginning of the game in the main menu is complete as its on an endless loop. The graphics and advance graphics options are vast and have many options allowing for a broad range of hardware to run this game. I honestly do not give a about story mode as i only really care about ing around in this game like killing random civilians and using mods and cheats on single player in multiplayer i just want to kill other players online and this whole level up thing is as i already spent money on this game and should be able to decide what guns i want to buy and what cars without having to ing grind. I swear if i get banned because i mod singleplayer rockstar can kiss my goodby i will never use cheats online as thats scummy but im allowed to do whatever the i want in singleplayer. I believe there are hackers from what i've read from many other reviews on steam.

2016-09-10,0,0,1727,False,Not Recommended,"In all my life I have never seen a worse game.Let me introduce you to Grand Theft Auto Online and why you should never purchase this game if you expect to play it.I have had my account tampered with by Rockstar three times.Twice I was banned for having an affiliation with modders (People on my friends list were modding NOT me.)And just last week Rockstar removed over $25 000 000 from my account which was fairly gained.So imagine you've been banned unfairly. Can you appeal your ban? No.Rockstar Support doesn't beleive in ""False Bans"". What they say is final.I know this because all three times I was banned it was clear that Rockstar didn't care. Rockstar Support does not care if you cheated or not. You bought their game.If you tell Rockstar Support that you didn't cheat and provide evidence to PROVE that you didn't cheat guess what Rockstar says ""No. You cheated. Our broken automated cheating detector told us so. Don't cheat cheater.""Then they close your ticket.Rockstar Support doesn't Support anything. All they do is blame people innocent or not.Rockstar likes to use their automated banning system a lot.It constantly bans people for stupid reasons. Gain money too fast? Ban. Buy too many nice cars? Ban. Spawn money on everyone and teleport everyone and blow them all up? Sounds good.Rockstar could easily patch the abilities that modders use to torture and abuse the game and the community but they don't. All it would take is a simple patch to the game's script. Why hasn't Rockstar done this? If Rockstar puts punishing cheaters as a ""top priority"" then why haven't they just removed the ability to add cheating to the game at all?Rockstar decided a way to scare cheaters into not cheating was to change the ban policy.Guess what. Didn't do anything.Cheating is at an all time high. I can't get into a session without being blown up.And you know what? Innocent people are being banned in masses every single day. Not a day goes by I don't expect my account to be gone.Rockstar hates their customers. They want you to give you their money and shut up.Do not buy this game.",Grand Theft Auto V
2015-04-13,0,0,197,False,Recommended,Was it worth the wait? Yes.Is it optimized? Yes.Are the controls nice? Somewhat.Grand Theft Auto V is greatly optimized. I currently have a GTX 660 and an AMD FX 4300 at 3.8 GHz. I can play the game at high settings 1080p at 60 fps. That's how good it is. I have yet to figure out Self Radio but I will figure that out tomorrow.There were slight multiplayer issues at launch but that's to be expected. After about an hour they were quickly solved and I had no issues afterwards. All in all a very solid launch. Much better than the 360/PS3 launch and the PS4/XB1 launch. I played about 3 hours with my friends on multiplayer doing impromptu races and exploring all the new graphics settings and new items. It was incredibly fun.

You play as Michael Franklin and Trevor (my favorite) in which they each struggle with modern America s issues.And there is the online mode where most people will spend their time on. GTA online is extremely vast in scope. You can race do missions play heists deathmatch golf and much more.Paying $60 for a game these days feels like a rip off especially with season passes and DLC.

Same with Take two Interactive and backdating stock fraud motherchode Ryan Bryant CFO or whatever he is sneaking JEVV WOP BRIT.This is what it says about the investigation from this KlKE.______________________________________________2001 2006 Further acquisitions and regulatory investigationsWith Rockstar Take Two invested into developments of sequels to Grand Theft Auto including Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999) and Grand Theft Auto III (2001) along with spin outs Grand Theft Auto Vice City (2003) and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas (2004). By 2003 Take Two had revenues exceeding US$1 billion. In 2004 Take Two paid US$22.3 million to Infogrames for the rights to the Civilization seriesIn 2005 Take Two began a host of acquisitions spending more than US$80 million buying game developers.One of its largest acquisitions was for the development studios Visual Concepts and Kush Games from Sega for about US$32 million in January 2005. Both studios had been extensively behind several sports simulation games branded through ESPN and typically released updated versions each year using a 2K brand to differentiate versions (such as ESPN NFL 2K5). In 2004 Take Two had struct a deal with Sega to help publish these titles. Just prior to Take Two's acquisition Electronic Arts announced it had secured the exclusive rights to create video games based on the National Football League (NFL) and a fifteen year branding deal with EPSN effectively killing Visual Concepts' own NFL title and devaluing their others games. This decision led Sega to abandon the sports game market. Take Two acquired these studios and unique branding (including the 2K brand) as well as negotiated for exclusive rights with Major League Baseball for video games A day after announcing these acquisitions Take Two established their 2K Games publishing label to maintain the 2K brand moving several planned games from their budget software label Global Star to 2K Games. Take Two also established the 2K Sports operating within 2K Games to focus primarily on sports games. Take Two further realigned the other existing internal studios Indie Built Venom Games PopTop Software and Frog City Software and Take Two Licensing within this new structure.After the formation of 2K Games Take Two completed other major acquisitions. Firaxis Games was acquired in November 2005 for around US$27 million 25 Take Two had already supported the studio by using their acquisition of the Civilization license to support publishing of Civilization IV. Irrational Games was acquired around January 2006 for about US$10 million including both its Boston and its Canberra studio. At the time Irrational had already established a publishing deal with Take Two for their upcoming BioShock game. With the deal Irrational became part of the 2K Games label. It also acquired PAM Development from the Gaia Capital Group for US$11.4 million giving them access to the Top Spin series of tennis games.However during this period the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had begun examining Take Two's business records based on complaints filed from 2001 that Take Two's earnings did not seem to match figures of game sales reported by NPD Group. The SEC's formal complaint found the company had purported sold product to distributors as a ""parking transaction"" for a quarter as to artificially increase their revenues for investors which it estimated was a US$60 million fraud. After SEC's issuance of the complaint in 2005 Take Take agreed to pay the US$7.5 million fine along with Brant and other executives paying fines totaling around US$6.4 million. However prior to that Brant had already stepped down as CEO to remain as chairman through 2004 after which he became Vice President of Production as he had been barred by the SEC from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company. Brant ultimately resigned from the company in October 2006 following a four month disability leave due to a bad backA separate investigation by the SEC found further issues with Brant and two other executives of the company in 2007. In an industry wide sweep against options backdating (receiving shares when they are priced high but backdating their ownership to when they were priced low) the SEC had found Brant had received backdating options of over 2.1 million shares though he had excised all options upon his 2006 resignation. Brant pleaded guilty to falsifying business records but agreed to cooperate with the SEC and instead of receiving up to four years in prison was fined US$7.3 million and barred from holding any ""control management positions"" in a publicly traded company.Further troubling Take Two during this period was criticism and legal actions taken against the Hot Coffee mod a user made modification to Grand Theft Auto San Andres that unlocked a hidden graphic sex scene that was built into the game with concerned politicians and consumers stating the scene belied the game's ESRB content rating. Among actions taken against Take Two included an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising to which Take Two and Rockstar settled in 2006 on fines for any future violations of content ratings. Take Two completed a US$20.1 million settlement related to class action lawsuits filed against it in 2005 over the Hot Coffee mod as well as to a class action lawsuit brought by shareholders over the options backdating fraud in September 2009.SOURCE https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take Two_Interactive",Grand Theft Auto V

They don't support the modding community at all don't listen to what the community have to say and are greedy corprate heads.They include microtransactions into a 40 game which I spent money on. They purposely make making money a huge grind and this makes their shark cards look more appealingThey don't allow private friend lobby's where people could just play with mods and have a good time.The reason why battlefield and call of duty don't have microtransactions is because they are in compitition they would lose customers if they didn't listen to the community. GTA V doesn't have any competitors so it can do whatever they like.TL DR Good singleplayer company that makes the game a grind so you would spend more money on microtransactions,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-08,0,0,63,False,Not Recommended,Probably an unpopular opnion but not the best GTA IMHO.Let me first say that I am a fan of the GTA series having played all of them. My favourite was San Andreas. I did not warm to the characters in GTA5 and most of the missions were acually quite tedious. Its a bit like the UK program Top Gear its just got a bit long in the tooth for me.GTA has never had a good user interface for me when flying the helicopter and airoplane seem to work opposite to what I expect i.e. if I set the keys up to be intuitive for the helicopter then I simply cannot fly the plane and vice versa. Some people will sat that this is down to me and perhaps it is but I dont have the problem on Just cause2/3. Also the mission where my propellor plane is chasing a jet and supposed to catch it I never did manage to do. I had to skip that section after half an hour of trying. I guess the big attraction of GTA5 is GTA5 online. However because i was already bored by the time I finished the single player story I just did not have enough energy left to explore the online stuff. Again this review is just my opinion but if you are undecided then perhaps it will help.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-02-13,0,0,777,False,Recommended,So after quite a few hours of playing I have to say something about this game 1. Don t start playing solo get some friends who already got some know how and can help help you out e. g. tell you not to unintentionally buy the worst items you yould get. 2. This isn t a very good game. There are still many things that should be fixed not only the countless amount of hackers but also missing In Game features like selling apartments (of course with losing money but still...). E. g. when I bought the game bundle with a Megalodon Shark Card (8.000.000GTA$) the first things I bought were 1. the most expensive apt. (which is actually totally useless) 2. A volatus (basically a chopper which is pretty impossible to land at least for newbies) and 3. a few of the most expensive cars (after a few days of playing i already realized how crappy they look).So don t just buy only cuz it s looking good. Most of the time you won t be able to sell it even if there is an own R* Support section for that (which doesn t do anything at all).But still this is a very good game. I mean I probably don t have to say anything about the Story Mode it s basically awesome. You have so much features and the story line is prett good and it has a damn hard decision at the end )Well the online mode is like I said at the beginning a bit different. You will mostly witness little kids crying on voice chat and LVL400 players literally bombing you with their Hydras Rhinos and whatever they own. So until you reach a solid level or invest much money in the game get a group of players who can help you out. At the end counting all the mistakes of this game would porbably take forever so I m ending this thing here. Overall I can really recommend buying this game not because of the many flaws but because of the pretty much endless options you have in the game.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-19,3,2,852,False,Not Recommended,"Updated 24/03/18 New Content Added Outdated part is moved to the end Here as a player who purchased 2 copies for online part of this game if you are new to this game and open to some advice my advice is If you love the game don't waste your time on online mode.Those who OP this game never care your time and effort spent on this game and never listen to you.I get banned for no reason and my 800 hrs spent on it were gone which is the reason I came here for a conclusion of my 1600 hrs spent on the game. Yes I am done with this game. And NO I will not buy a third copy to encourage this stupid company to ruin my experience for the third time.Fairly speaking this game is awesome. The single player part tells a wonderful story while the city is a great playground for big boys (and girls as well). I was addicted to the feeling driving supers speeding on the highway or flying jets over the city. It really built an illusion that you are some kind of ""crime master"" and that's why I chose to come back even I was expelled for ""violating EULA"" for the first time.But here is my whole story. I loved this game and I preordered it on the first day it came out. When I entered online mode in 2013 the open sessions are nearly full of cheaters. I was so envious about their houses and supers. At that time no sharkcards were on sale so I got my hands on some mods for easy in game money. I was banned twice for a total 5 weeks which I really deserved. Then I decided to start over clean. After one year playing without any modding or cheating suddenly I was banned pemenantly. I was shocked and reached out to the support department for help. However all I got were autoreplies YOU ARE BANNED AND NO APPEAL. Then I turned to some other TPS game like Tom Clancy's Division. But I still missed my time speeding in LS streets and I thought I got it because I made my mistake touching the online modding (BTW that idea is so naive). I decided to start over with the help of my friends with a new account and be 100% clean no glitch no cheat all hard work. I kept an eye on the newswire to follow the latest discounts and bargain with supporter guys with some 500k GTA$ bug last Christmas or some mere 10% discount coupon. I keep myself away from crowded public sessions. I was even selling cargo last night till late. You guys tell me how can I be a cheater of something even close to that. But today I got banned again and my record was gone again. I reached out for support and all I got were autoreply again YOU ARE BANNED AND NO APPEAL. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. I made up my mind keeping me away from any other future Rockstar works and you should probably do that too. DON'T BE IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME YOU WILL BE HURT. I kept my old comment down below it is written just after my third ban. I hope my story may help you save your money and time for more precious things in your life like exercise being with families or other games. Thanks for reading.

2017-01-02,0,0,875,False,Not Recommended,Rockstar Games has been falsely banning many users for absolutely no reason. Not everyone who has been banned has hacked recieved hacked money or even been in the same lobby as a hacker. Several of my friends have been temp and perma banned by Rockstar for absolutely no reason. They did not violate the license agreement for the game. I would know this because I personally bought them the game and they installed it to play with me on GTA Online. They have been banned within a week or so of owning the game and Rockstar refuses to acknoweledge their ban and gives them a copy paste of their website FAQ. Here's the jist of what I'm trying to tell you. The singleplayer is a great. I like it. Multiplayer? They don't care about you. They don't like you. They won't care if you just bought the game or if you have literally thousands of hours on their game. They will ban you without appeal without reason and they refuse to list your reason saying it's private. I know that rockstar holds the right to suspend your privledges of using their online services but every single company I've used to play online lists the specific reason as to why you were banned and even gives you the chance to appeal said ban if you feel if your rights have been violated. Rockstar will not read this so I submit to you the reader do not buy this game to play GTA Online. Do buy it if you choose to play single player. Rockstar will sooner or later lose their fanbase because of this fiasco and they still refuse to acknowelege their own fan's complaints based on this system. I do not recommend this product based on Rockstar's mishandling of the current GTA Online situation. They have made millions of dollars from many loyal users and many of these users have not hacked at all. Ever. These users were banned based on a failure of an Anti Cheat system. If Rockstar were to read this I have but one thing to say to them directly I used to love your company and I too hoped that your company would continue to prosper however the mishandling the situation has resolved me to hope that your company sinks. I refuse to support your products now.Edit as of June 15th 2017 Take Two Interactive (Rockstar's Parent company) has decided to crackdown on singleplayer modding. This means that if you bought this game to use mods that require Open IV good luck. Open IV was discontinued due to a cease and desist that is poorly worded and has poor technicallity. This is a blatant attack on the community at large with the ultimate goal of the player caving from the singleplayer and forcing that player to play the GTA Online portion. They want you to buy shark cards just a mere few days after the CEO of take two said that the playerbase is not giving them (the publisher) enough money. What was not having the 4th best selling game in history not enough for you? Take Two Interactive has effectively shot themselves in the foot and has ruined their own credibility. I hope they understand the predicament the have gotten themselves into because this is one thing the PC gaming community in general will not allow them to get away with.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-30,0,0,123,False,Not Recommended,Honestly I've refunded 3 games before because of this for nitpicky reasons. But this cause is legitimate. I dived into the world of GTA online excited for a new start as a young illegal kingpin but I found that the only way to do this is by spending REAL MONEY!!!! I start up one mission and get kicked because I'm level 1. Eventually I do find a mission and wow I get $2000. This is not fun unless you micropurchase and I'm forced to play in invite only because literally every lobby I've been in has some guy running around in a UFO abducting me. 3 lobbies of these cheaters who either have some outrageous vehicles or can't die push me to going in a solo lobby. Fix these extensive online issues and Rockstar stop taxing so much for the damn DLC's and maybe I'll give this a purchase. I know that it took a hell of a lot to release this game but you charge 60$ for the game give me a break you don't need micropurchases. They wonder why so many people set up money lobbies well it's so damn hard to gain money! At the most you could gain 2mil every month if you play about 4 hours of missions everyday which isn't a lot in the online community. I'm dissapointed.,Grand Theft Auto V

Also the online is a terrible cash grab. You have to grind to unlock weapons vehicles anything really. You are not aloud to just mess around with friends like previous games. It's like a bad MMORPG except with more grinding. Or you can skip the grinding and just buy Shark Cards with real money. Also the online community is as bad as you would expect it to be. On top of everything else modders/hackers are everywhere and prevent you from having fun. I'm almost thinking the modders/hackers are just employees preventing you from progressing so you have to buy Shark Cards.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-10-18,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"Online just isn't fun so avoid it. You can thank the community for that. There's just not enough of a penalty for people being the type of player that ruin a game. The story in this game was in my opinion pretty terrible. That being said it had it's moments. I remember the first heist mission in single player had me really excited about what the game had in store. I really thought to myself ""this game is going to be amazing"". It's all down hill from there. The strongest part of the game is being in single player and experiencing the city. Just traveling around free roaming is where the game shines. Interactions feel solid and the game mechanics are sharp. The game runs like a dream and looks great. I kind of wish the game had a single player create your own character and just a ton of individual quests like Skyrim or something. Toss out the nonsense story the game went with and just give a more general create your own adventure. Become a bank robber or a hitman or a vigilante whatever. They tried to tell a story and failed miserably so maybe next time don't try to tell a story and just let the player make their own. Make an actual zombie mode that would probably be fun. Add survival elements that you can toggle. Not everybody would want that but if I'm ""living"" in a city add in stuff like eating enough to survive needing sleep whatever else. What I'm saying is there is so much you can do when you create a city as large and interactive as the one they did. A lot of failed potential wasted on a story that was nonsensical and unengaging. And just to touch on the online mode maybe create user preferences for placing players. I wanted to play online to create my own character then build them up get an apartment whatever else. I didn't go online to have chaos mode when guys sit on top of buildings with rocket launchers and sniper rifles taking everyone out that they can see. Or some clown in a helo taking everybody out. Don't put me in that game because I'm simply going to turn it off and go play something else more fun. Maybe some people enjoy that gameplay and more power to them but put them all in the same game together away from me.",Grand Theft Auto V

Pay more.....get less....If you want the nice cars and all the nice things we used to have on PS3.....then bad news. It's all ONLY available in online mode.And don't even get me started on the online mode thing!!!!!!They force you to play online which is not worth it at all then they also force all the stuff that will cost you REAL money down your throat.....nope does not work that way.I paid for a game that used to be very awesome and great fun to play and got a slap in the face!It would have been better if you kept it the same but why take away content????I bought this game for the great story and game play and the fact that I can do what I want when I want and how I want to NOT FOR THE ONLINE PLAY!!!!!I want to feel that I own that whole city and that I can do as a please.....not possible in online....And I am not playing online just to get the nice things we had for free on older consoles!If you own this on PS3 don't buy.If you have never played GTA V before buy it you will love it and never look back!But for the people that had this game before.....you will not be happy.I am truly saddened by the direction Rockstar is heading in with GTA V.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-13,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Great optimization for PC fun online play and well its GTA with $270 million dollar budget devopled by Rockstar North its a fun game. With a awesome story I played on the console and an free online mode while riddle with some cheaters. . . In my limited experince with 1 or 2 cheaters after 20 hours of online to date isn't bad to me. I feel guilty to say in both cases it was actually kinda of fun floating above Los Santos in car with two other dudes on mics taken on a crazy free roam ride with one.That all said the heists you perform the progression and customization of your character when you play online paired with GTAs whacky and crazy sequences of mayhem with others is great.I know GTAV didn't go on summer sale and instead Rockstar opted to retain the price give you $200 000 starting off cash if you did buy it during the sumer sale as model. Honestly I don't find that to be a big deal R* didn't want GTAV to be on the summer sale. And so isn't worth the negative reveiw as a game. You can buy it for $55.00 for the PC on Amazon right now if you'd like.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-29,0,0,47,False,Recommended,GTA 5 was already a stunning game but there was always a sense that Rockstar's ambitions weren't matched by the technology available on the PS3 and Xbox 360.The game would sometimes buckle under the strain stuttering along when the action got too intense while buildings textures shadows and residents would suddenly pop into view at the very last second.With these same sights now benefiting from a makeover on new consoles a return journey to San Andreas is too hard to resist.While these visual glitches haven't disappeared completely GTA 5 on new consoles performs at a much higher and more consistent level.Frame rates dip ever so slightly when you speed through the busy city districts and you might see the odd shadow or texture pop up a little later than it should but these instances are less frequent and harder to spot.The graphical upgrades are particularly evident when you take the time to walk around Los Santos and Blaine County as you get to appreciate the little details whether it's the puddles that form during a particularly severe thunderstorm or the way the new plants sway realistically in the wind.Increased draw distances something you really notice on higher ground makes it easier than ever to become lost in the game world. With more people populating the city and extra wild animals roaming the countryside GTA 5 feels more alive than ever. Being able to see this stunning landscape through the eyes of the protagonist makes the game world appear even more beautiful than before. We'd definitely recommend taking a trip to the Vinewood Hills and activating first person mode one of GTA 5's biggest new features to take it all in.First person is something that certainly benefits GTA 5 but doesn't necessarily revolutionise it a handy tool but one that isn't without its flaws.It's better for taking on a group of enemies in a wide open space but you'll struggle to see what's going on around you when behind cover in a tight corridor.It is however difficult to keep your bearings when you're chasing a bike that's weaving in and out of alleyways and it's hard to judge distances when you're engaged in a fist fight with a disgruntled pedestrian.Luckily it's quick and easy to switch in and out of first person so you can activate it when the situation suits you best. The game also makes clever use of the PS4's DualShock 4 controller in particular the touchpad light bar and speaker.The light bar for example will flash red and blue when the police are on your trail. It might sound gimmicky but is actually a helpful visual signifier when you're trying to escape their gaze and can't take your eyes off the road.Radio chatter and phone calls are now played through the controller's speaker which is a really nice touch and one that worked so well on games like Silent Hill Shattered Memories on the WIi as well as the PS4's very own Resogun. The touchpad meanwhile can be used to select weapons change radio stations and bring up a quick menu to check objectives and set waypoints. Being able to quickly check objectives came in particularly handy during some missions when we thought we were all clear but actually had to take out few stragglers before we could move on.That said having so many different functions set to what is essentially one button means that you'll sometimes mistakenly bring up a menu when you actually wanted to change perspectives.It's also difficult to quickly and accurately change weapons so it's probably better to just stick with the weapons wheel. Likewise the waypoint selection is limited so while players can set markers to various stores and activities missions are unavailable meaning that you'll still need to bring up the map from time to time.This year's release also launches with GTA Online out of the box giving users even more criminal and recreational activities to engage in when they fancy a break from single player.GTA Online benefits from new character creation options. Transitioning between single player and online is extremely quick and after a year of updates the online world is packed with jobs races deathmatches and items to purchase. Which also benefits from a higher player count with smoother action and improved visuals putting last year's launch woes to shame.That said Rockstar did a fine job of sorting the launch last year so we have faith that GTA Online will continue to provide fans with a compelling alternative to single player and a reason to keep revisiting San Andreas after the story has been exhausted.Speaking of the story mode it's slightly disappointing that there isn't any meaty additions to the campaign although Rockstar has introduced lots of smaller treats for returning players.Franklin for example is tasked with capturing the game's new wildlife for the Los Santos Tourist Board while Michael must explore the map to find a series of clues and solve a murder mystery.A host of new and returning vehicles further sweetens the deal including a blimp that can be dropped off to your location as well as a hatchet weapon that seems tailor made for the psychopath that is Trevor.These particular additions aren't enough to make up for the lack of substantial story updates but they do take advantage of GTA 5's greatest asset encouraging players to further explore the wonderful state of San Andreas.It's actually the radio that provides one of the most compelling reasons to return adding more than 150 new songs from artists as diverse as the Backstreet Boys Belinda Carlisle and Bone Thugs N Harmony.While the single player experience is largely the same the world in which it takes place is more beautiful than ever so you'll be astounded by the sights all over again.If however you've never visited Los Santos or Blaine County picking up GTA 5 on new consoles is a no brainer. This is the definitive version of one of the finest games of the last few years and one that better lives up to Rockstar's lofty ambitions. HGunified recommends Grand Theft Auto 5 to all Gamers who haven't played this gem yet to get GTA V ASAP. This is a MUST Get MUST Play and MUST Experience Game. (10/10),Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-01,1,2,805,False,Recommended,This is one of the best open world sandbox games I have played. So what makes this game so special?Now the story felt too long and felt a bit rushed sure some parts were good but after finishin the story I was thankful that was over so I'll mostly be reviewing the online aspect of the gamePros free DLC's yep that's right Rockstar have made it so you don't have to spend a single centCrisp graphics that yes are a little outdated but still look good.Heaps of stuff to do from robbing cars to racing around the desert.decent amount of customization for characters including tattoos clothes and piercingssmall jobs are constently on in sessions so you have an easier time trying to find extra ways to make money great to play with friends just to muck around or get stuff done like heists etc.Cons Hackers/modders are still a thing in sessions dropping money wiping weapons in session etc. Rockstar have not fixed this and probably won't considering it has been like this since I bought this game roughly 1 or 2 years ago Some of the community can really be toxic and salty try to kill you just for the fun of it or because you might be a lower rank than them. (but this is like basically all games nowadays that have PVP)You will have to grind a lot of Heists and other missions/tasks to get enough money to buy decent stuff like appartments assets etc.Playing without friends makes this game a bit boring at times.However if you are willing to spend a bit of time getting enough money for the things that help you get even more money have friends to play with and find a decent session where people aren't trying to Kill On Sight (KOS) then this game can be somewhat enjoyable.,Grand Theft Auto V

What ruins this game is the online mode full of cheaters every lobby you join there's at least one modder who tries to ruin your game experience another bad side of the online are the constant calls you receive like advertisment every 5 minutes some bot calls you interrupting what you were doing i have a really bad stuttering issue although i've a pretty decent pc (i7 3770 3.4ghz 8gb ddr3 gtx 1060 g1).

2018-04-17,1,2,241,False,Not Recommended,I honestly wouldn't bother buying this game based on the PvP aspect. Reason why because Rockstar don't care about the game its self they just care about the money side of it also the Anti cheat sucks and they have banned people from dropping money and transfering accounts just to make more money off of DLC(downloadable content) while they are doing things like this they are still allowing people to happily mod themselves and get tons of money and then the modders are allowed to control the way you play suck as they can freeze your game and make it unplayable while you are in a lobby also they can me your game crash which makes you rest it then you have to wait another 10minutes for the online to load again. In other words you pay for a game youcan not play and near enough every lobby has a modder in. I sometimes think Rockstar themsleves made this game and never even played it once since realese casue they add terrible DLCs just so people buy sharkcards and spend real life money to get the new cars and what not when there are tons of modders allowing themselves to have more power then the legit player. The thing you have to think about is that they banned transfering so poeple stop making modded accounts when that also makes people start again when they have grinded to get a suitable character for the online world yes the game has almost been out 5years now but it is still rediculous that they are milking every last drop of money they can when they have made well over a billion on the game it's self instead of focusing on stopping people from ruining other peoples gamming experiances.

2016-05-13,0,0,70,False,Not Recommended,"It's the best looking GTA until now lovely detailed and has great gunplay. But still I feel I have to symbolically not recommend this game. Because there are a lot of systems in the game that just make me shake my head. I.e. a bunch of minor things that are really annoying. Like not being able to disable auto centering when driving a car in third person. Or not being able to walk normally when using first person. Also that characters keep swapping their outfits or loosing weapons when it's not necessary.Then there's the lack of RPG elements (San Andreas) and progression outside of story missions. The game and gameplay is so unbelievably story driven. There's nothing meaningful to do that is tied to progression outside of them. The money you make in side activities is trivial as hell. So they're on a ""pointless mingame"" level that is fun once but doesn't motivate you. This game is really surprisingly linear for an open world game. Purchasable buildings beside the air port and tuning garage are mostly boring buildings in the world you can't really interact with or enter.A more serious gripe is the messed up vehicle storage system. The only way to save your stolen or for a lot of money bought cars is to put them into garages. So you take your car out for a mission and it forces you to leave it behind it's gone. If you accidentally get it blown up it's gone. Compound works inconsitently and your cars can even vanish from your garage. There's really no point in buying and tuning cars other than for taking them for a short and careful ride. Pointless.Also this game really is dumbed down in comparision to GTA 4. Pedestrian dying in one hit the police not even really trying to stop you by ramming (just stupidly follow you for the most part) etc. etc.It's still a good game and I'm actually recommending it if said things don't bother you a lot.

A legal way for already rich millionaire dev's to fleece you for everything you got cause you like to drive cars that look cool and be one of life's ""big boys""......The hardline reality being that not everyone has this limited cache of real life money much alike everything is stupidly high priced to buy ordinarily on this game now. Even by grinding missions you're talking months to get and upgrade 1 vehicle because they made those a wreck too reducing actual rewards and then ramping up prices in game items.......So based on the fact that a lot of people don't have that endless time or money available what other choice do they have apart from to hack? ofcourse...........you guessed it!!!! &lt it's SHARK CARDS... 70 $150 of real life money (more than some average in a week pay).........for 8 million gta cash.........ummmmmm no.........that doesn't sound right.......cause paying that much and recieving that much might upgrade you a single car or 2 at the absolute maximum not taking into consideration all the other fabulous new features that are always just out of reach unless you can whip up plenty and lots of ker ching!!!!!So nope............pants nada..........not recommended.R* have messed this game up completely by over pricing everything it's just not worth it...",Grand Theft Auto V

If you're buying it for the multiplayer Answer NO THE MULTIPLAYER IS A GRIND FEST.Long answer You may think that you're going to get alot of enjoyment from the multiplayer but you're wrong. all you do in the multiplayer is grind grind and grind. and after all that hard work you finally get the item you wanted you relized that you just wasted your time and virtual money on something that you probably don't even need like most super cars that can be ing beaten by one that probably cost 1/4 of its price. aThere are a few thing that i think is a good investment in your time to grind but i think theres more thing you don't need than there are things that can actually help you. like for example the apartments The only reason you need them is for the ability to host a heist which can give you insane amount of money and thats it. you can't really do that much with them and even if you pay the extra 200k or even 800k for a more expensive apartment they don't really give you anything other than the location and the interior (the 400k is the same as the 200k only difference being how high you are in the building! and the 1M$ only makes the interior bigger and allow you to customize the theme).You may think that the multiplayer is deep and you would probably ended up spending alot of time in it but i bet most of that time is spent grinding heists ceo and mcs works. yeah there are adversary modes missions and custom games created by the community but how often do you think people play them? the answer is not very much.And before people think i'm just a poor guy (or that i get banned) that can't buy things that he want because its too expensive i'm level 150 and pretty much have everything i want (I have pretty much all popular pegasus vehicles like the hydra and buzzard mc business ceo work and 2 of the special vehicles (that being the rocket voltic and ruiner 2000). you may disagree with what i have to say but once you hit a certain point of experience in online you would start to agree with me more and more. unless you're that one player that never get bored of a game despite doing same thing over and over again. also the new updates seem to only add either new gamemodes and cars and not much else besides some bonus discounts (really? 50% off mods upgrade in the los santos custom shop? how about 25% off all supercars or pegasus vehicles) Edit The part where i said the game's campaign was shorter than most gta game is a mistake and i've removed it from the review,Grand Theft Auto V

As well as that as far as I'm aware Rockstar have not granted permission for any mods being used in the game itself but who's actually not going to try and bypass that? People have done so already. The game itself may be lacking content however the community actually continues creating things for each other. It is quite a community driven game to be fair however the community is restricted due to what Rockstar have limited the game to.In addition to this the port of the game is generally great unlike Grand Theft Auto 4's port over from console which was extremely buggy.All in all This game was worth my money and waiting time.Oh did I also mention the 60 FPS?

I started the story really great characters are awesome blablabla. I try the online game. AND THEN it began my hate for this game. Sometimes you have to wait for 10minutes just to find and load an online session. You start playing get killed by 10 years old kids. Fine. You start having a good stuff and suddenly everyone is disconnecting ""failed to connect to rockstar servers"". Fine that's not like I was online for 2 hours but fine.

I'm still loading it's now 21 52 i restarted the game twice while my friend is waiting for me.IN CONCLUSION Do not buy this game unless you have time to lose or want to get under the control of the of the marketing section at RockstarAND MY GAME FINALLY LOADED IN OFFLINE MODE WOUHOU ITS 21 56oh waiti tried to get on online and guess what ? ing timed out to connect to rockstar serversu know what? this game the developpers (not really but yes) the marketing employees that make this game a cancer and THE WHOLE WORLDomg its 22 03 and i joined a gamewould not recommend this game at all 10/10IGN",Grand Theft Auto V

The game is optimised really well even for those who have to run it with low settings the first person mode is addictive and gives the game a new feel and overall it really does feel like the 'definitive' version.Note some people have trouble with frame drops at the moment and with Rockstar social club which disables them from playing. This will most likely be fixed but no problems for me as yet and online seems to work fine.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-18,0,0,370,False,Recommended,I've been playing this series since the very first one and would like to say it's been an excellent influence on me growing up and well into adulthood. Yes indeed.As far as this one goes the single player mode has recaptured a lot of the joy and manic fun of the earlier iterations for me. A lot of fun stuff thrown in just for the sake of it and sometimes things escalate way faster and more drastically than I was expecting. The multiplayer is a huge laugh especially with people you know (with the caveat that you need to find a server that doesn't have any hackers ballsing it up for everyone) and the quality of the PC version is just sublime both graphically and in terms of the feel of the controls. I drive and fly with a 360 controller and run around shooting with a mouse and keyboard with zero issues.The biggest downside on multiplayer is that even two of you can have a hard time getting a full roster to do 4 man missions sometimes and even then half the time one or more people you play with will die or up repeatedly like it's someone else's fault then ragequit so you have to start the whole process over again. If you want to ensure you have fun with the online missions bring your mates. It's not impossible to enjoy the experience with a group of randoms but it is very hit miss. Also sometimes a hacker in a malicious mood can really things up for you although Rockstar tend to be very good at correcting anything permanent that happens to you it's still annoying and disruptive at the time.Overall I give this 9 rabid fanboys out of 10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-29,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Im not gonna argue with the croud but im not apart of the disliking for getting rid of mods. GTA V is a great game. I found the updates are amazing as they are always adding new content. Although in their recent update they got rid of modding. Now dont get me wrong modding is fun but i think what they should have done is remove modding from multiplayer but keeping it in single player. in single play you cant harm anyone by using mods but its good they removed modding in multiplayer as it stops PEOPLE FROM BEING REALLY ANNOYING. But if a modder is in multiplayer and given you money i wont complain but being annoying that strikes a nerve. I would highly recommend this game and i think you guys are going about this update the wrong way. Just by disliking the game your just giving it bad reviews on such a great game and this is giving the wrong impression on people so please reconsider. the least thing you could do is give the game a thumbs up instead of a thumbs down when the update that brings it back if that ever happens.,Grand Theft Auto V

Problem is that if I refund then I loose the pre purchase in game cash bonus.I can't recommend what will undoubtedly be a fantastic game when it's fixed (as I can't play it) and I strongly advise potential new buyers to wait until these problems have been resolved.

They should have quit updating GTA online ages ago and started working on new games and allowed modders to change GTA for the better because modders do it much better than their devs. you R* Gta online never buy sharkcards from these s instead get a modder to drop you money.,Grand Theft Auto V

Speaking of the open world getting around with jets and helicopters would have been fun but the controls are a mess. I can't remap the controls to how I like so I just gave up flying and went back to Battlefield 4. Now they banned mods so this game pretty much has nothing going for it.

This is a first is any game ever... I am still kind of in shock that I got banned from a video game... I submitted a support request with Rockstar that was immediately closed with a form response.There are plenty of games that are buggy incomplete or just not that fun.

2015-05-01,0,0,319,False,Recommended,GTA V!How could I put something negative in here? It's GTA! Arguably the best game series is back! Although this game has been out for over a year on consoles I believe the PC version may have been worth the wait. If you haven't seen a single GTA video yet I'll sum it up. In this game you can just freeroam build an empire do jobs do heists get money use stock markets. Yeah pretty much everything you can do in real life including attending your local strip club. Only there are seemingly no consequences! Something negative about all GTA games so far happens to be the amount of bugs and glitches found in these games. Although every game in the series has been groundbreaking there tends to be a lot of issues with these types of things.

2016-06-07,1,1,207,False,Recommended,So after a lot of time playing this game i decided to edit my review.The story mode is very good it's fun its kinda weird sometimes and there are a lot of side missions.Oh the online mode yea. Only thing i can say Why doesn't GTA have a proper Anticheat?Rockstar servers are sometimes the worst and now i even quit the game because of 2 weeks not being able to log in the password reset email not sending and the support not answering my ticket.So buying this game comes with risks but the game itself is great even tho its already in the last stages of a videogame death so play it until its completely dead.I almost changed my thumbs up to a thumbs down because i cant play the game anymore and i've met over 80 people who also have this problem and some had to quit the game for the exact same reason. Thats really sad.But the thumbs up stays for it still being great and fun.,Grand Theft Auto V

The leave Banning of player to a Bot system and a Bot can never make mistakes look at YouTubes bot system for dmca's it's not flawed at all or can be abused. In all fairness the time i got to play was ok i got to take part in some PvP and play with a few friends the game is not the problem its the support you get after you get banned they treat each ban like you deserved it even if you don't do anything to brake ToS or EULA but they have a little thing call interfiring with a player's game expiriance (that is vauge t) that basicly can be anything from lagging in a pvp game to herassing a player all the time. I did neather i don't think but lagging is a problem for any p2p server system as you are playing from a host pc that could be the other side of the world to you and lagging to people closer looks like teleporting and that could get you banned i guess as they don't review cases by human eyes to check it's automated and the support staff can't even check to see why you were banned at all.,Grand Theft Auto V

Don't buy every gun you unlock or you'll have a literal arsenal to scroll through during combat instead of 2 or 3... When you're never using any weapon other than the advanced rifle and OP pistol it gets annoying fast. Also dont get any of the MG's until you can get the minigun. Complete waste.Play on passive mode or make a private session/friends only session if you're afraid of PvP.The AP pistol is the best weapon in the game and everyone knows the Kuruma is OP.Learn to drive a motorcycle learn to love explosives.Also I put turbo on a scooter,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-07-10,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,As someone who loved this game at one time it kinda sucks that i have to leave a negative review but it has to be done. This game has been completely ruined not only by the shutting down of Open IV (whether or not they retracted this is irrelivant it shouldnt have ever happened to begin with) and also by the complete and utter destruction of the in game economy. In an attempt to get rid of hacked money and modded items rockstar went on a rampage taking away items and money from people whith no regard as to whether or not they actually hacked. The ingame economy is absolute garbage. the economy is super inflated and the missions and business ventures in this game ARE NOT a viable source of income. playing as a member of someone elses MC club or CEO associate is completely useless as you gain almost little to no money per mission. I could go on and on about this game but the fact of the matter is that GTAV is dead and greed is the killer.,Grand Theft Auto V

From the fun and immersive story to the nearly limitless online play it's one of the most fun titles I've ever played. I think so far the only thing I've found to dislike about it is the poor optimization. I myself play this game on relatively high settings and pull around 45 60 fps. That being said a few friends of mine have struggled to run it on their low to mid range pc's. So if you are gaming on a low budget system I might go as far as to not recommend it unless you don't mind low video quality.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-06,0,0,23,False,Recommended,As a returning player I can say that I am surprised with all you can do in this game compared to the early 360/PS3 realease. Hitting X to duck in cars first person view of course and let's not forget NEON LIGHTS! PThis game was truly made for PC.With that being said however making your game appear next gen doesn't necessarily mean that it's next gen. When these companies start releasing games with less bugs and problems along with being able to reach a wide variety of GPU setups then I will say we have reached next gen. It was not always how shiny the graphics looked it was about how smooth the game was and problem free it was. This helped us enjoy a game even more so than how it looked.This is coming from someone who absoulely loves Rockstar. They have truly upon PC gamers by banning the usage of mods. If modding capability is a deal breaker for you then this probably won't be your game. I love modding but not enough to sacrifice $200 of invested money into GTA's shark card system. NOPE.All in all I get to see 3D chesticles in a strip club via first person and listen to my own music! 11/10 would get thrown out of strip club again.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-01-03,0,0,64,False,Not Recommended,This game should be considered a early release at best. There are so many bugs in this game and many of them could be fixed but as long as GTA is making them money who cares. The loading times are god awful and simple things like doing a check before you join a online mission to see if a lobby is full before loading it would be great instead of making you load the mission then telling you is full then loading the world you were just in again of course followed by GTA is not available and disconnecting you from online. Then there is the hackers or modders if you perfer to call them. There is no reason for this GTA already has a detection system in place. Hackers get away with it becuse they know that they will not be banned right away intead gta once it detects cheats it puts them into a quene to be banned the following week of whatever when it could be done right away. What the heck happened to the fun i use to have stealing any car in the game and storing it now I am forced to buy my cars to put them in my garage. Funny how only cars that are worth higher than $950 000 all have trackers. That way you have to grind for a car. Then there is the horrendous mission lay out let's use the lamar missions for example not really spoilers here but they are all the exact same things steal car kill people get surrounded and kill people oh yea how could I forget the most annoying character with absolute nothing of value to say has the longest cut scenes. This is just a couple of the massive amounts of problems with this game There are so many one could write a entire book on how bad this game is. The worst part is you would not know untill you played a decent amount of the game bringing you past the return period. So do yourself a favor and don't waste your money here there are far better games than this.,Grand Theft Auto V

I am talking about main story not about side missions online though is hard but fun with friends i hardly ever play this game without my great friends. i think many can agree with me rockstar is almost forcing you to buy in game cash becous every new car is extremly expensive. but non the less great game to free roam with your mates and arround pro tip dont buy a tank,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-21,0,0,1114,False,Recommended,A spectacular game with an amazing interactive single player world which you can be lost in for hours and hours at a time. An amazing open world filled with beautiful sights to be discovered both on land and under water. Then on top of this you get one of the most amazing online gaming experiences yet. Spend hours in the world that you have come to know in single player but now with new missions new safe houses friends and random people from all around the world.

2015-05-05,0,0,52,False,Recommended,10/10 This game is a must have. And here's why If you haven't played this game on consoles before this just know it's like a perfection of many gamers dreams. It tells an amazing story with really interesting characters to boot that actualy has very mature and realistic story compared to any other GTA . On top of that the gameplay is amazing and tons of fun you'll never be bored and once you are you can play online with friends. Which is where the game truly shines. The multiplayter perfects open world multiplayer by giving you tons of choices of what t do and how to personalize you online perosna. This game does everything right and never ceases to keep me entertained whether it's on pc or console.Now let's get ot why everyone hates this game. Yes rockstar is actively reventing mods and yes they have absolutely every right to do so. Let's get this out of the way YOU ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO MOD ANY GAME a developer may support it but it is always said that the games are generally made the way and are meant to be modified. However Gta V is a special case because unlike before Rockstar is actively stopping this. They have right to do this because you agree to let them and it is their intellectual property.You may have bought the game but they own the rights to the game GTA name abd it makes sense that they would protect like so. Mods remove their control over the game even in singelplayer which with hoow smooth annd easy the transition between SP and MP is they might be trying to prevent a more sneaky modifictation to make it through by even keeping them oout of singleplayer. They are simply trying to making the game more enjoyable for everyone.And let's face it Rockstar is a business. mods will extend the game's lifetime immmensely also increasing the time before they can expect a succesful GTA on Pc. Even though many PC gamers believe that is just fine it isn't and Id rather have a newer game than a bunch of mods. If they can release a newer game sooner it can be better and even more polished than this one.Even with that said however I do understand the need for outcry for complete lockdown. It's not hard to see it from both sides but something this complicated if left solely to the dev will take forever to fix. Gamers and modders should pu in their part to rockstar by at least not modding for now and simply making you point clear to them and the problem will bi solved much clearer.However I digress back to the matter of whether or not to buy this game. The answer is simple absolutley yes. It is understandable if your wary or completely against it if you wanted to mod but I would reserve judgement. I don't see Rockstar permantly banning all mods they are a smart developer and knows there is a huge lovew for mods. Up until they come up with a solution or the community finds a workaround. Until all that is fixed you will still have one of the omst polished and well made pieces of entertainment to keep you engaged.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-09,0,0,54,False,Recommended,Rockstar made a very good job here it is a huge sandbox with a lot of freedom requires a little high VRAM not a problem because of the good port wich has lots of settings for you to get your right experience monitored by video memory slider that allows you to ignore the suggested limits or take care of your hardware GTA Online offers a very satisfactory experience with lots of activities like parachuting street racing and of course the heists you can easily spend a couple hours without noticing the only issues I find are the long waiting load screens and the banning issue for single player modding I encorage you as a gamer to try it i had agreat experience with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-23,0,0,387,False,Recommended,This game is great for new players and players who have owned the game on Current Gen or Old Gen Consoles For players coming from console i can say it is well worth paying for the community are alot nicer you rarely see people kill you for no reason like you do on console. Online also has the chatbox which makes it alot easier to host events and things in a lobby every player will see it and most likely read it and maybe join in with what you are hosting ). For Singleplayer you can use mods which just makes the game so much fun there are a variety of mods out there that lets you pretty much do what you want But i would be careful about what mods you are installing as some of the mods secretly transfer over to multiplayer which gets you banned so for now i would install the mods and just play Singleplayer and when you want to go online close the game and delete/uninstall the mods then play again and you will be fine. ),Grand Theft Auto V

2015-06-14,1,1,204,False,Recommended,I got to say this is my first GTA game so I had a lot of expectations that needed to be met in order for me to like this game but I can't really compare it to previous games all my expectations were from hearsay. I got this game when it first came out but due to finals I wasn't able to play it that much until May. I've since put 144 hours into this game the most I have done with any game that I own on Steam in that month and all that time has been in multiplayer I haven't even touched the singleplayer. This game is so good that my dad who pretty much only plays WoW saw me playing this and decided to get this game and has loved it.It would take me too long to describe the pros for this game so here are the cons I have had issues with my latest driver (GeFore 980) and this game which has caused me to crash multiple times. However its a simple fix all I have to do is go and instal the 347.86 driver. (I haven't fully tested this out but I think the problem was when I had NVAA running I'll be sure to edit this to see if it works out) It can take you a while to get some of the more expensive objects such as vehicles or appartments but if you do heists and missions you can get that money in a surprisingly quick time while still having a blast If you don't have 3 other friends to do heists you will be waiting for randoms to join your game. However the wait time has decreased significantly since the game first came out. Now you might only have to wait 3 minutes but there is a good chance that it will be full sooner than that. there is no way for you to give money to your friends but that is understandable because that is how the hackers were able to give sooo much money so it's understandable whyOn the note of hackers are there hackers? yes. Do you see them frequently? More often than not you don't but you can from time to time. Are the hackers a bad thing? Absolutely not. They don't ruin the gameplay at all BECAUSE 1. If they decide to be and start killing you you just go into passive mode and they can't do anything to you.2. If you don't feel like going into passive mode you can always join another server that won't have one and it is as if nothing ever happened.3. Half the time you can get money from them because most of them are nice.4. They turn the crazyness of GTA Online from 10 to 11. There have been times where there were UFO saucers in the middle of downtown Los Santos blowing people up and my only reaction was laughing because I just got blown up by a god damn UFO xDOverall I got to say this game is amazing. I know that some of the cons may seem really outstanding but that's because I haven't listed the awesomeness and hilarity of this game. It is absolutely normal to be driving down the street crash into a NPC car get mad at it shoot the driver start going on a rampage (because it why not?) accidentally shoot a player (by accident I mean that it was unfortunate that the player had to cross paths with you during your rampage so now they must die) they get mad they call in a helicopter they start shooting at you with missiles and machine guns and then the next thing you know the entire server is fighting each other. In downtown Los Santos. With so many cops shooting at anyone and everyone that you would have thought that the national guard was being called in. All because you were doing 100 in downtown and got mad that you lost control of your car and slammed into a NPC.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-09,0,0,102,False,Not Recommended,You might wonder why I would not recommend this game. I'm sure it's a great game and has been great for many of you. Yet it hasn't been for me and here's why.If you are considering buying have a read first.I bought this game on the 22nd of March 2017. 2017 two years after release keep that in mind.Having a high end top specs system I would be able to play this game on the highest settings possible but I couldn't. After 5 to 10 to sometimes 20 minutes of gameplay crashes took place over and over and over again making me play the same first missions over and over and over again. But wait it got worse GTAV started giving me blue screens of death. On top of that my computer during regular use started malfunctioning. GTAV was hurting my hardware slowly but surely. So I did what we all would do go to google and look up why. At this point I found out that a lot of people have had all these issues from crashes to blue screens ever since release back in 2015. So I went to Rockstar's tech support.Now you would figure that after two years they would have found the reason why and would have fixed them. Wrong. After three weeks of being in contact with Rockstar's tech support it has been made clear they have no clue why this is happening. They have asked me to fix so many different things and play test and are now running out of ideas. Everything is still the same as it first was. When my hardware started malfunctioning on regular use I decided that this game was not worth destroying my computer so I opted for a refund.But wait there's more. Having playtested all those fixes I ended up with 11 hours of gameplay on Steam. Steam doesn't allow refunds when playtime has exceeded 2 hours no matter the reason. So I asked Rockstar's tech support but no budging came from that end either. Well played Rockstar well played.In the end I bought an expensive faulty probably console ported game that I never got to play that damaged my hardware that won't get refunded and used up way too many hours of my free time trying to fix it.That is why I do not recommend buying this game.,Grand Theft Auto V

To enjoy the high graphics the PC port of this game offers you need an extremely powerful GPU and graphics combo. I can generate the graphics full blasts at 25fps which is suprisingly low for a brand new alienware. Also there is a large number of hackers in the community already ruining the experience for newcomers like myself. It is also very unclear as to what missions you can do to rank up as a low level player. there is no rank balance either. as a level 5 i played with level 400 people which is insane. wasted 60 bucks and hoping for a refund.,Grand Theft Auto V

It makes complete sense for online trainers to be banned as it would destroy the multiplayer mode and render rockstar's goyimcards obsolete but graphics enhancing mods would likely benefit rockstar (in terms of attracting new customers) more then the users themselves.0.5/10 slightly better than the holocaust,Grand Theft Auto V

Heck it managed to freeze my entire system multiple times.*edit* after 10 more hours of bugfixing I just got the same canned response from Rockstar games support as 2 weeks ago. I am now trying to get a refund via Steam as the game is not working for thousands of players and R* doesn't even have the decency to acknowledge the bug.*another edit* After more than two months I gave the game another chance.

2015-05-14,0,0,193,False,Not Recommended,If you are only buying this game for the online multiplayer I would not recommend buying it at this time. Currently loading into matches takes forever when you aren't getting kicked because the host drops the lobby lots of people use exploits (such as summoning a tank to fight in deathmatch game modes) and the racing game mode is just plain broken.

Its new and different thats for sure but there are a few things that drives me insane when playing this sheit.First off. Thats for the new dlc but how the and I gonna afford all this sheit like seriously. Were you sane enough to think so some way for NON CHEATING PLAYERS to get money. You give out these double money and xp weekends and stuff but I hate it. Adversary mode is trash and I despise it soo much yet you want me to play it HA funny. Theres no real way of making actuall money in this game unless you bust your for hours spending your precious life on this damn game.Second of all the GODDAM CHEATERS. New DLC meet Cheaters and their magic of spawning in clowns with railguns and chromed out vehicles with guns on them. Rockstar dont bullsheit me on saying your dealing with cheaters/hackers.....whatever because your not doing anything. Every session you join there's at least 5 or more cheaters just around with normal players just trying to enjoy the game. I understand the christmas spirit but holy when your turned into a tree with tazers going off thats when you like question your sanity. Hate to say this as well but cheaters are the best source of getting actual money atm and its stupid.ROCKTARDS FIX YOUR SHEIT ON PC NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!One last thing BATHROBES WALMART BATHROBES SERIOUSLY.

2015-10-30,0,0,123,False,Recommended,DISCLAIMER This review follows a purchase made not even remotely close to the events of the Summer Sale so do not be deterred. This is not a rant on how Rockstar does their buisness practices. Now settle in for a review on a game not a company decision.Despite many negative reviews on the multiplayer I have not ever encountered any hackers even in a full lobby. Connectivity may be an issue if your speeds are not very good so those with low network speeds may want to steer clear. The multiplayer is a great experience although I would reccomend friends tag along with you for the maximum experience. The more the merrier! With the inclusion of small storylines in multiplayer and Heists online for these things alone I could reccomend this game. The insane amount of customization and endless side missions like golf racing parachuting and deathmatch modes is really just icing on the cake. However leaving the story mode out would do a serious injustice to the immense praise this game deserves and receives. Without spoiling too much the overarching storyline that braches across three characters as Franklin Michael and Trevor each in their own worlds that are quite an experience in themselves (...Trevor...). The plot development in each characters personal life could almost make you forget that you have two other characters to play as it is so good! And for whatever reason if you get bored with the main story an abundance of side missions in the form of Strangers and Freaks and most listed in multiplayer are available as well in singleplayer. Subjectively this is one of the best games I have ever played. Objectively I think this game should still be considered a masterpiece to rival some of those instant classics for some. TL DR If you want a game that is damn close to perfect in an open world environment with great plot and character development with multiplayer that could be seen as an independent game to boot all wrapped into one package... Look no further.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-08,0,0,127,False,Recommended,This is a near perfect game. The modding community has just started but Rockstar has been keen to shutting it down and i'm not sure how long it will take for them to let some mods through. Everyone knows what GTA V is so no need to summarize that aspect but people are seriously giving negative reviews because you can't do something (mods) that a) aren't necessary for the gameb) have just begun and will grow exponentially within the next couple of monthsc) can actually ruin online when s decide it's okay to cheat The game is great the metacritic score says it on it's own. regardless of mods this is a tremendous pc port that has been greatly fine tuned and optimized. I can't understand why people feel so entitled when this game is far beyond it's price tag on it's own. like i said keep in mind that mods have only just begun and Rockstar will probably make legit statements soon regarding them... don't listen to all the butthurt jerks.,Grand Theft Auto V

Yay!!Can carry more than one type of weapon i.e. rocketlauncher AND grenade launcher etc.Thumbs Down Cars still inconveniently disappear sometimes when cutscenes finish or outside of a garage etc. (All GTA games do this weird.)One of the main reasons I play on PC is because I don't like the console controllers. Luis from Liberty city made me buy one (or was it Microsoft) for that attack helicopter mission (Sexy Time) and now I've found that I need it to not only fly helicopters and planes but also for swimming underwater and parachuting pain in the butt...(At least you can switch seamlessly between the controller and the mouse/keyboard) Note get the controller with the wired USB and no more batteries...Otherwise turn off the radio and you should have a pretty good time in Los Santos/San Andreas.,Grand Theft Auto V

But they never fix races instead they keep all the ramming and mic blasters. And almost every lobby has a hacker in it to the point where you have to play in a private session if you want to play freemode. There hasnt been any new heists since they were added.

2015-05-08,1,1,70,False,Recommended,"It's the classic GTA formula you know and love except mostly bigger and better. But not in every way.+ Overall the gameplay and movement feel nice and fluid I'd say it's the best out of any GTA game so far. I did use a controller with the auto aim enabled though. I find that using a controller is much more enjoyable for moving around in third person and driving vehicles but aiming with a controller can be tedious so I turn on the auto aim to fix that. I tried switching constantly between keyboard and controller but it was too clunky so I decided to stick with a controller with auto aim.+ Each main character has an unique special ability that makes driving / shooting more fun and rewarding than ever.+ A lot of world filling content. Basically a large amount of content that makes the world feel alive and believable while adding a touch of humor and satire. This includes side quests dynamic events TV channels Internet websites Radio stations billboards text messages emails civilian discussions and more.+ A lot of video settings to tinker with. What you'd expect from a good port.+ First person mode is a great addition.+ The 3 main characters are great. Very good acting. Trevor is hilarious for the most part. The story is generally pretty good overall if you think of it as some sort of parody. Soundtrack is OK. Some good stuff some less good stuff. That's really subjective though. While the ""realistic"" restrictions has been somewhat reduced from GTA 4 it's still not perfect. For example you can't do fun things like trying to jump from rooftop to rooftop or car surfing your character's legs are just gonna give up and go into ragdoll mode. That can be funny at times but it's more of an annoyance than anything and you can even die unintentionally because of it. The mini games (Tennis etc.) are a nice distraction but... again they are a bit too realistic to be fun for more than a few matches. The novelty wears off quickly. Another ""realistic"" restriction I didn't like was how you can't permanently save a car in your garage. I mean what's the point of modding a car if you're going to lose it forever when you inevitably leave it behind or get it destroyed? And the realism is weirdly inconsistent because the cars of the 3 main characters always spawn back at their safehouse no matter what you do with them so... I don't get why they're not allowing us to save our own cars permanently too. A bit too much of the main story revolves around 2 of the main characters being childishly mad at each other.If you absolutely want a score I'd probably give it a 8.5/10 mostly for the sheer amount of content and the good stuff generally outweighting the bad stuff. It's honestly a great game and despite its flaws it's still one of the best games of its genre.",Grand Theft Auto V

I couldn't find a single car that didn't feel like it weighed 4 tons and neither of the cars I tried could take a corner. It really wasn't an enjoyable feeling. After some races I tried to play some freemode and found out the character is really unresponsive as well.

2017-03-03,1,1,661,False,Not Recommended,New Review Take Two killed it. I will never buy another one of their products. Good luck trying to get people to come and play the new GTAs and RDR. Although 13 year olds will still buy it and GTA will soon just be used for baby sitting.Old bad attempt at humor At first it was awsome car chases random stick ups you name it my friends and I did it.Except cheat for which pretty much everyone I used to play with got banned for except none of them did once the ban hammer update started I logged off and haven't gone back on but I bet I probably got banned while away.The single player is awesome and if it goes on sale for 15 or 20 bucks and you haven't played the singleplayer I'd say go for it otherwise don't even bother at this point the game's life is almost over anyway you don't ever see full lobby after full lobby.The saddest part was the last time I was on the session was empty it was snowing and I stood on a cliff overlooking the city in which I had fought tooth and nail for everything I had the stars shown through the snow that lazily fell from the sky with a bittersweet feeling I got into the muscle car that I worked so hard to buy when I first started out. I drove slowly down the snowy trails my long gone friends had once fondly called deja vu road I soon reached pavement. I merged with traffic and went on a tour of the northern expanse of the island. I slowed to a gentle crusing speed as I worked my way through the upper class suburbs. The streets soon transitioned to the business district to which I attempted to cross at a high speedI didn't make it.I launched from my seat and tumbled through the air as I passed over the hood of the taxi I had hit. I rolled a few feet and stood up slowly. Looking back at the car for one last time all I saw was a totaled wreck. I turned away from the very thing I had obsessed over buying for the first couple jobs.I jogged a few blocks until I came to the hood. A few gangbangers eyed me suspiciously as I walked up to a sedan and drove off in it as if it were mine. In the rearview I could see the glittering bank tower to which I had spent countless hours to buy a small slice of that I could call my very own. Inside the cathedral of glass and steel I could imagine the vehicles I had collected yet barely used sitting underneath cold LEDs waiting to be called upon for an eternity. Once again a moment of distraction caused me to veer into a telephone pole.No matter I had reached the pier seemingly unconciously. i walked out to the end while gazing at the glow of the lights on the landing strip at the airport from which I had scrambled fighter jets and crash landed helicopters on. I soon reached the end of the pier the end of the road the end of my story.I stood at the corner looking out upon the city I produced the pistol given to me at the start of my journey the cornerstone of my criminal career. I had left all my other implements of death in the posh apartment I used purely as a safe house for staying in the city.I looked at my city my heaven and hell and then GTA crashed because this game still has sh*t wrong with it they should have fixed long ago.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-14,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,Bought the game a week ago and haven't managed to get beyond the prologue thanks to constant crashes (specifically when trying to enter the getaway vehicle but there are also freezes at various mission points before). My system is well above the minimum specs (Win 8.1 i5 4690 3.5Ghz 8Gb ram GTX970 Geforce 4Gb) I'm running all the latest drivers I've spent days on any support forum I could find trying any possible fix I could find (reinstalled validated game files ...) but nothing works. All my other steam games run fine without any issues. Official RockstarGames support up to now has been limited to 'is your system up to date and do you match the minimum specs' (even though I've sent them my sysinfo and crash logs). And of course a refund seems to be out of the question... Very very disappointing.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you already have it on console and have a pretty good PC(especially a Graphics Card) I HIGHLY suggest it(I have it on console from back on the PS3 release).The minimum specs are incredibly for a game this huge but you can still but on ridiculously high graphics options up to needing a Titan X without even using 4K. For the player already having it on console However people without top quality computer will not get much more out of the game than what the console version already does(well it can't be worst the console version is what you get with the minimal specs). But if you have a good graphics card and you can crank up the graphics pretty high(I got a GX970 myself) it's really worth buying it twice.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-17,0,0,289,False,Recommended,Wow GTA V...It's here the PC master race finally gets their hands on GTA V. This game on ANY platform is SPECTACULAR probably one of Rockstars best works. Here are some pros and cons of this game. I'll only be looking at the singleplayer side of the game for now might update Online in later.PROS Great NPC varietyAmazing graphics and open worldSo many activities3 Different playable charactersMemorable charactersCustomisation So much of it!A long long story taking me around 20 hrs without doing side missionsBut with every good game there are the consCONS Need a reasonably good rig to run this gameA few glitches here and there (Glitches will be updated later in the year)Rockstar Social has it's problems (Haven't encountered any personally)Price maybe could be a tad reduced considering this game has been out for 2 years nowKeyboard controls are not the best (I tried playing with mouse and keyboard couldn't get used to it so switched to Xbox One controller)So all in all in my experience I defiantly spent my money well and this games selling point is probably Online so if you have any friends who play this defiantly pick it up. If not I'd still get it just for the experience. And remember to check if your computer can run this game Pretty sure around 48% people didn't reach minimum requirements for this game.

2016-05-19,1,1,67,False,Not Recommended,After having fun the first few hours the game rapitly starts to feel dull. repeating missions over and over hackers no safe playing in public lobbys playing in a private lobby no fun alone heists only with 4 playersAnd dont get me started on the open world. All this game lives from is gimmicks. You can do a lot of stuff on the map but nothing that doesnt get boring after 5 minutes. Military field golfing and all the other stuff no real content all just little gimmicks. I miss the challenges the minigames and the gang wars of Saints Row. Having the smaller and simpler map Saints Row has way more stuff to do on its map.Also the zombie like NPCs. We all know the funny fail videos on youtube. You walk past an NPC he starts attacking and insulting you without reason. Going to near to an police officer he starts shooting you.Also the drivers are crazy kamikaze freaks that are out for a kill in every way possible. The NPCs in GTA5 are the worst and lazy Ive ever seen in 20 years of gaming.For a game that lives from (pseudo)realism and immersion I cant feel any immersion in this game at all.If you create such a gigantic and really beautiful map give us something to do on it beside finding bugs.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-02,0,0,305,False,Recommended,"The long awaited GTAV PC.. What should you expect? ANY MAJOR BUGS/FIX'S Okay now expect some issues at first. Mainly lag. When i first got the game i couldnt drive a vehicle without such bad lag and stuttering the game waas unplayable. After some researching i realised that there were new ""BETA"" drivers for AMD which wouldnt show up on my autodetection software for auto updating my drivers. A quick google of ""AMD 15.4 BETA DRIVERS"" will help you get that fixed. As my game does now run superbly. (after i have made a few changes to settings) NVIDIA have also released a ""GTA V READY DRIVER""Now im no computer guru and i dont have the best setup ever. Id like to think of my computer as a good PC kinda a bench mark for alot of Gaming PC's .. Its a couple years old now but features an i7 processor and x2 AMD READON 7850's ... So its not exactly a rust bucket. I have noticed (this seems to be more of a game engin error) rendering issues mainly when driving fast. The game sort of coughs and splutters a bit and i get drops from 60 80fps all the way down into the 30's for a good few seconds. Which is a significant drop and can be noticed alot. Have some hope guys rockstar have done a very good job and im sure they will get this issue fixed as a few on my friends have the same issue. **THE GAME IS STILL VERY PLAYABLE JUST STAY AWAY FROM RACES (if you have this issue)** GENERAL COMMENTS Im still suprised at how the the game runs using a mouse and keyboard the driving especially is very well done. Other GTA's has a very clunky feel if you didnt use a controller. But not on here folkes. Also I love the shooting when using a mouse it feels soo natural with me being a FPS player. The Online ooooh the online. Fantastic. Im sure you know by now what can be done online so i wont bore you. But it is so fun (when playing with buddies) The servers are a little bit ""DeSynchy"" but nothing horrid. SINGLEPLAYER This is definately a game for those who have loved watching the Evolution of GTA ever since the birds eye view days right up to where GTA IV left us. You may be thinking 'Other than GFX being updated what does this offer thats new in a singleplayer aspect?' Truthfully not a hell of alot. The only feature that i can think of my self that is 100% new is the character swapping how you have multiple characters as part of the story line and you can swap to any character whilst doing pretty much anything. Oh apolagies the first person feature too. So first person. Truthfully for me a bit of a let down you can tell its a feature added into a thirdperson game mainly the FOV but also the general feel you get. Its hard to explain but it just doesnt feel like a modern FIRST PERSON VIEW experience.Now i havent completed the story line or even got very far into it due to my social and private time being destroyed by the addictive nature of the multiplayer but its looking like this could be a very strong fun durable 'campaign'.If you really have any questions feel free to comment.

2016-02-17,0,0,1409,False,Recommended,"GTA 5 or more importantly GTAO is one of the best online/GTA experiences ever The campaign was good and brought me back to that familiar GTA story feel that GTA4 killed for me. Swapping between Michael Franklin and Trevor is interesting and fun to see what is going on just before you jump in Story and attempting to get 100% completion to which I managed 89.7% Kept me involved for about 101 hours according to social club ONLINE However makes up the other half of my 450+ hour play at the time of this review. This is exactly what the franchise needed. IMO WIthout going into too much detail as there is alot to online i will say its not perfect but makes for one hell of a good time i often find myself spawning into lobbys where WW3 seems to be taking place Starting off was hard just stick to missions and robbing stores and you will get there A few quick tips for beginers.BUY ARMORED VEHICLES!!!! SHOOT FIRST....MAYBE? BECOME A STICKY BOMB SURGEON.DO NOT WASTE AMMO.BUY ARMORBUY SNACKSBUY REBREATHER (Trust me)DONT TAKE IT TOO SERIOUSLY!!!! Its a game with guns!!! people will kill you... ALOT As far as i have seen R* seem to update and put out dlc for technically ""FREE"". The vehicle prices are insane but they do suppliment with double rp and $$ weekend events but still if your not into paying more real world $$ for ""SHARK CARDS"" then you will be doning alot of mission grinding Heists can be fun and annoying all together. basically expect to fail 8/10 attempts and even get the one who drops at the last part kicking everyone back to lobby if you can manage a solid crew this isnt as much of an issue and finally HACKING!!! yes it happens ive experienced it about 6 times and yes dropping money on people just beware record your session if possible and report any real ""ill gotten gains"" to R* support For what its worth I hope this helps Ive been going solo and youtube has been a huge help there is alot GTAO has to offer for thoes willing to get their hands dirty and spend a little time in Los Santos",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-12-19,0,0,395,False,Recommended,Every couple of years Rockstar Games produces great games that you can spend hundreds of hours playing and never get bored of because they are so fun. There is no exception with GTA V. GTA V is a fantastic open world game set in the present day. The huge world of Los Santos and Blaine County is yours to basically destroy. The single player campaign is excellent and allows you to play the story as 3 very different people. The story consists of some very well planned missions and side quests but the main feature was Heists. These are very carefully planned missions that allow you to basically rob a specific point in the world and gain boat loads of cash for it. None of these are boring and you can replay them tons of times so you can proceed through the heist in a different way than last time. If you don't like the single player style you can get online with your friends in GTA online which is very similiar to single player and you get to use this huge map how you want to. The online DLC is fairly common and when it does come out it is very well made and definetly satisfies everyone. In both modes you can customize your character in tons of ways you can purchase beautiful cars and apartments/houses that may cost a lot but are definetly worth the cash. Aswell as cars you can purchase boats planes or helicopters and bikes so that you can traverse through the open world sandbox how you want to. There is so much more to this game and it is definetly worth the money so instead of me going on you should just go and buy it. You will spend so many hours and have so many fun times.,Grand Theft Auto V

Take Two attacked the modding community something I and many others simply will NOT stand for. Thankfully Rockstar was able to smack some sense into Take Two and they're no longer actively attacking the modding community.I leave a positive review to say thank you to Rockstar. I realize it was very likely a reaction to the overwhelmingly negative reviews and reactions from every sensible person who plays videogames. But I still appreciate them getting Take Two to back the hell down let's home Take Two gets the message. You with our family we'll spam yours with negative reviews.Now this doesn't mean I'm happy with Take Two I agree with the majority of people regardless of whether they're apologizing now they still shot first.

2018-03-25,0,0,55,False,Recommended,Now I know plenty of people have MANY complaints about this game. It's a reasonable concern. The game has its fair share of issues. You have to know how to tune them out. Let's start with the positives The story The story is very well done for a game that came out almost 5 years ago. It has it's moments of comedy seriousness difficulty etc. The story is in depth and much longer than most games. The content Yes I understand GTA Online is practically useless. However there is so much content to go along with it. Consider how much time went into the drug clubhouses the cars the races. All of it. There is so much content to be unlocked. Now we'll talk about some of the negatives. Hackers As any good game it has hackers. Now GTAV definitely has some more severe hackers people who can ruin your whole experience with the click of one button. GTA Online GTA Online is cool however it is practically useless. Most GTA Online is good for is flexing your cars your cash or doing Jobs. Other than that it's not that great.I know this is one of the shorter reviews however there isn't much to say about the game. My hours don't do enough justice for how much time I've actually spent in the game. Should you buy this game For the story mode or for the Job factors of GTA Online.I rate this game a 7/10.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-03-20,0,0,1366,False,Not Recommended,Awesome game singleplayer is alot of fun. Took me about 40 50 hours to finish the story. Online gameplay is different but also really enjoyable. The community is risky players range from average 13yr old rage kids to 30 yr olds showing off their pimped rides and everything in between (tryhards russian screamers noobs modders etc). It is hard not to like the game because there are plenty of game modes to enjoy. Racing shooting flying parachuting running the most cycling players over in trucks... There are however several issues that makes me give this game a thumb down. The servers are by far issue number one. I have a decent game PC and run the game at 45 60 fps on high detail. I installed it on an SSD enabling me to load the single player in about 1.5 2 minutes (still quite long). Logging on in online however can take up to a full 10 minutes. Once you are online you can join game modes or just roam around. When joining a mission or a heist you will have to conquer another loading screen. This will take 1 3 minutes. After this time there is a possibility that the room is already full which means you have to load back into the previous session. I was planning on writing down an elaborate story about these types of issues in the game but I might as well just hit play again and use the 10 minutes of loading time to masturbate so I'll round this up. TLDR I recommend pirating this game to check out the story mode. If you enjoyed it feel free to buy the game and support the developers. If you really liked it give online a try. Be warned though Out of my 417 hours of gameplay I've spent approximately 80 of them logging in or stuck in loading screens.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-14,2,1,217,False,Recommended,2 hours in witnessed homoerotic dog freaky times with commentary. The unabashedly violent narrative is awesome the writers and comedians working on the single player storyline are brilliant.Almost 200 hours in the work that went into creating sympathetic portraits for each character is shocking. I mostly play FPS' not RPGs this is a stunning blend of both. Additionally the environment and sound detail are exquisite.I would also like to take a moment to respond to boiler plate feminist critiques. The game lacks a femaile protagonist and I think a future version should feature one but the story and archetypes in play here are wholly nihilistic with the exception of Franklin and even that story line is very dark. There is nothing happy about these entwined stories but they are written exceptionally well the voice acting is amazing and the 'in game feel' (empathy for character) is striking. This is not a game that objectifies women it's a game that objectifies every last slimy detail of male fantasy and free market capitalism which by most 3rd and post wave feminist critiques is a heteronormative and male dominated world. The game's storyline is tragic for all involved and the immersive elements (radio talk show hosts reality TV shows corrupt beauracrats plutarchs autocrats mobs the rich and famous etc.) all suggest that our world sucks. There isn't much you can do to change in game what is effectively a portrait of modern society but it gives the player some pause some reflection on very well researched tropes and incendiary topics without holding back. Think of this game as the video game version of the monologues but documenting US culture unapologetic rapey terrifying confusing but well told.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-12,0,0,347,False,Not Recommended,"TL DR GTA Online used to be amazing now I have to pay the carpenter to come out to my house almost once a month. The singler player is fantastic though. This game is ing amazing when it works. 90% of the time I play I can for about 20 minutes to an hour. Then I get the infamous ""unknown network error"". Literally everytime I try to play this game I get kicked out of the server before I can decide that I'm bored. It happens all the time. Every fix I've looked at online has talked about port forwarding opening ports switching routers using LAN cables. I'm sitting here like.. ""why the doesn't rockstar just fix their game?"". Tons of people have this issue and they're all told the same thing. ""It's your fault."" you Rockstar.Not only are the connection issues enough to make me wanna put my computer through the ing wall but the game is rampant with hackers. 9/10 lobbies have either some guy giving everyone tons of money (Which is great because let me tell you something. If you want ANYTHING better than a ing sedan be prepared to spend HOURS playing this game. You used to be able to heist pretty easily but now that's ed unless you have 3 other friends because there's always atleast one guy who leaves the heist in the middle of the session which completely s over the entire operation. Granted it doesn't happen every time but when there are now more cars worth 1 million dollars or more than there are worth less than 500k it's enough to make me wanna put my computer through the ing wall. Heists aren't the only option and there are actually many different ways of making money. The problem is that there isn't any variation in the amount that you get for your effort. Almost every activity in the game that isn't a heist is going to cost you about 5 20 minutes and net you about 5 25k. So I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that the hackers are almost ing necessary. Which is atrocious.)... I realize at this point I've droned on enough that you've forgotten what I was talking about before the parenthesis so just know that the hackers in the game are both a blessing and a curse. Half of them will shower you with riches the other half will consistently with you until you wanna put your computer through the ing wall. The combat has gotten pretty stale now too. Everyone and their mother has a minigun and an rpg. Armored vehicles are everywhere. Pretty sure there's a in car that shoots rockets now too. Don't get me wrong it's all cool in theory. Unfortunately though every fight nowadays boils down to trying to shoot through the tiniest little openings in the armor on these rediculous vehicles. TBH though it's still fun. Killing people that are just douching around in an insurgent is one of the most satisfying things I've ever done in a vidya game.AND THE ING COPS. GOOD LORD. They are literally demons. They're ing demons from hell and each one is worse than the last. They give no s. They show no remorse. They have eyes ING EVERYWHERE. Oh and god forbid you accidentally bump into one of em. They're relentless to the point where fighting other players is a goddamn cancer because the entire time you're trying to do so you also have the entire god damn police department trying to you in the I miss the rdr days when the law would eventually give up realizing that they are inferior to you. It doesn't make any sense. It gets so bad that you literally can't fire your weapon without declaring war upon Los Santos. It makes me wanna put my computer through the ing wall. The single player is great though. One of the best single players I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Trevor is my soul mate.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-08,0,0,144,False,Recommended,Briefly Worth the price. No mod support.I think already the single player is worth paying the full price. The storyline itself ain't that innovative or special but it's working and it's very good entertainment. It is however the mood you get and the immersion that makes the single player aspect so great.Online aspect of the game is pretty much what you would expect from it. I would have wished more variety from the gamemodes now don't get me wrong there is so much to do but if you are someone who have a lot of time on their hands like me then you will eventually get bored atleast if you play with random people which I do not recommend. Heists are just the kind of variation I would like to see more in the future a great addition to the game.No support for mods apart from making your own radio station makes game short lasting however and this is a big minus. Especially when looking back the history of other gta games modding community was there already. Actually because of the lack of mod support I was seriously thinking about not recommending this game but once I saw numerous other reviews already negative because of that I changed my mind. Saying that encrypting game data makes the game cheater free is total BS most of the cheating tools are third party anyway as far as I know. There also exists lot of online games which include mod support and are cheater free. It's like putting the cookie jar on top of shelf and saying you can't touch it all the good kids won't but does it really stop a cookie monster?,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-11,0,0,83,False,Recommended,I wish there was a neutral rating on steam because GTA V was actually a very enjoyable game in story mode. The graphics were stunning which complimented the epic action scenes and stunning environments of the game. Combat is simple but not easy. The AI is still dumb as hell but what can you do? The story is amazing and put together really well. The voice acting is sharp and it's clear that a lot of time and effort was put into each scene. As usual driving the plethora of vehicles is very fun however the flight controls can take a while to get used to.All of this is only half of the game. The other half is GTA Online.It's not fun. All of the OTT action and humor that made GTA's story amazing is lost in the multiplayer. It's riddled with hackers and the lag is appaling. Money is very difficult to obtain. The easiest way to make some cash is by doing hiests. However due to the rather toxic community working with randoms can be a choir and trying to get in the same lobby as your friends is even more of a choir.Overall get GTA on sale. Whilst the story is great and you can sink a lot of time into it the lack luster online mode and the lack of any new single player content leaves much to be desired from GTA V. For now I'll recommend it but only for the story mode.P.S There are micro transactions to get cash in the online mode. Thanks Rockstar. Just what we needed /,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-17,0,0,89,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game primarily for multiplayer. Sadly the main feature of the multiplayer Heists are quirky as hell to get working if you don't have a complete team of four friends on standby at all times. Expect 50 % of your time looking at a loading screen for no particular reason getting kicked out of the mission as soon as someone drops (which happens frequently even with friends) without return to host lobby. The automated feature to put friends in the same session also works only partially which means that you'll be spending time trying to gather up in the same session over and over and over again. Why don't just add a grouping feature Rockstar?We all stopped playing multiplayer after all this frustration waiting for hopeful fixes. Did I mention that loading times are really long even for high end rigs and that there still is random slowdown of FPS?Pick this one up on sale and don't expect much from the multiplayer.

2015-05-13,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,I'm not giving this game a thumbs down to make some sort of statement about modding or optimization. For the record I have tried no mods and the game runs better than I expected.This is a good game but I want to be clear It's not perfect.The singleplayer is generally very satisfying and the map is fun to explore but none of the characters are appealing enough for me to want to root for them. Michael honestly deserves most of the things he tirelessly es about Trevor's insanity never amused or moved me that much and Franklin just didn't have much originality in the scope of GTA protagonists. Maybe I'd have grown to like one of them more if there had been one protagonist instead of three I constantly had to switch between. In terms of Gameplay GTA V offers a huge world to explore but never really capitalizes on it. I was very pleased to see the return of purchaseable businesses but was annoyed at the clumsiness of dividing them between three characters and I was deeply disappointed that there was no option to buy safe houses in other parts of the map as in many other GTA games. Such would have been a great feature for this game considering how huge the map is. More than anything though my biggest problem with this game is that it feels set up solely to get you to play GTA Online which I found underwhelming. Here the game offers you the freedom it denies you in the singleplayer but forces you to participate in missions and activities with other players in order to progress. Aside from some missions most of these activities aren't that fun and detract from the freedom that makes GTA enjoyable.That said much of the game is really good. Rockstar has put way more energy and passion into this game than is the norm in these sad times and that much earns this game my respect. The map is refreshingly large and exploring it feels like an adventure. The first person mode is a great deal of fun. The cars are exceptionally well made and beautifully detailed. I'm not saying that GTA V is bad or even that it's not a good game. It's just overhyped. I'll still play it and I'll openly say that I like it quite a lot but it's not perfect.TLDR I don't regret spending the $60 to play GTA 5 but neither am I thrilled that I did. It's not something I'd recommend against buying but neither would I actively recommend buying it.,Grand Theft Auto V

As most of the mission is simply progression without $$$.As for multiplayer its pretty bad. The loading is pathetic. I have upgrade to SSD and it made a difference ALOTS. altho its still way to long to load between each mission. Not to mention half the time it get stuck in limbo or is just way way too long.I dont recomande it for Online unless they fix the loading. But for the Single player its great. Alots of nice feature. Just bad that there isnt more way to make money than a 5 10 minute taxi towing random encounter worth of 90 1000 $Overall I give it a 6/10. when they fix online and up reward or more paying mission in SP I'll give it a 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-07,0,0,1133,False,Recommended,Great game. Good story. Wonderful port save for a few issues. Beautiful graphics. Now for the kicker Rockstar has never come out and supported mods for the game.Originally posted by Terk Here's the thing. The method currently being used to mod isn't really what most people think of as modding.ScriptHook is an example of DLL Assembly Code Injection which sneaks foreign code into the process in order to provide a method for an additional payload of code to hook/modify the game process in memory.The problem with this is that there is no way to tell what the payload is. Nor is there anyway to prevent the payload from working in only some areas of the game.That's the point a lot of people don't understand here we're not talking addons. We're talking DLL files that have been modified to allow a user to run ANY additional code they want and have the game accept it and execute it. There are no limits to what can be run with this and the trainer that comes as the included demonstration of scripthook is a very benign usage of the potential.To give you an example of the dangers of allowing DLL Injected clients to connect to multiplayer servers or any other client for that matter until recently in Reign of Kings hackers using the same method that scripthook uses were using injected assembly code into DLLs to modify files on the computers of other players on the servers they connected to and in many cases even the files on the servers themselves.When we're talking about DLL Injection there is no such thing as singleplayer mod or multiplayer mod. It's just foreign code being run anywhere the user wants. The only way to prevent it is to check the integrity of the DLLs of any client on connection and cutting the connection as soon as a disprecency is found. It may seem like overkill but the alternative is a complete loss of security for anyone using gta online.,Grand Theft Auto V

The single player story is amazing certainly better than all three of GTA IV's stories Inventory and weapon management is a much improvement to its predecessor's Customization of your character's and cars is back. Online play is fun as well. Aside from a unconsequential free roam you lose money and have to buy or find weapons (no real pickup locations). Although car performance improvements have to be unlocked with racing it still is well done. People are getting upset for being banned when connecting to GTA Online with a modified game which is the case with every other game out that has a competitive system during online play same if you join an exploitive job or hang with people doing things they are not supposed to do. It is a great buy just for single player if not for multiplayer also as long as you aren't stupid and decide to modify you game when you play online.,Grand Theft Auto V

There is too much focus on combat and it feels as if they've just thrown some racing missions in there to appeal to the car fans. The game needs more mini games and more to aspire for than just a few heists to do over and over again. It's amazing the way the in game web browser works and everything but the only thing you can really do is buy vehicles and properties.I would love to see much more customisable properties and more to do with the money and maybe even more heists.

Never been so wrong. My god what a pain. Loading the game itself it's a pain taking also up to 10 minutes sometimes (and I've updated my pc recently it doesn't suck). I'm talking about online of course don't care so much about the single player. Joining a heist is pretty much impossible when finally you made it players are leaving the session during the mission making it fail. In almost every session you join you find cheaters flying or with god mode.The game itself is pretty much boring since there's not so much to do if you want to play the recent DLCs with the new missions you'll have to gain somehow millions to buy the new stuff (which at this point are easier to gain in real life since every mission gives you crumbs). It could have been a great game but it feels so much empty to me.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-09-01,0,0,605,False,Recommended,First off I just wanna mention that I played this game for Xbox 360 back in the day so what you read comes from a true veteran of the GTA v community.My first point is the story it's fun and the three main characters are well designed and feel real (despite you can make them look like total morons ) also the mission can be pretty fun from sneaking into a house to repo a car to flying a crop duster plane into the back of a titan plane just to attempt to steal what is inside. The story has wacky funny moments but if you buy this game for just the story you won't be dissatisfied but you will be missing out on a large portion of this game and that is of course GTA online now let's get one thing straight the online portion did not actually exist when GTA v originally released but there has but there has been many a update since the initial release to the point where a beginner wouldn't even realise just how far online has come. There is a lot to do in gta online so I'll just keep it simple there are missions that give you cash. There are offices biker clubs bunkers and with the recent update hangers that can help make you money in freeplay but leaves you open to being greifed by others but they are some of the best ways to make money and have fun without the tediousness of having to launch/join a mission lobby now in terms of what you can buy for both online and solo there is a lot of cars planes boats and of course Guns and since the gun running update rockstar has began focusing more on customisation of said guns planes cars etc however the most annoying thing about this game in terms of online is that many of the things to buy in this game are quite ludicrous is terms of price but I personally think that if you put the hours in you can earn everything this game has offer because the feeling of starting with nothing and having everything at the end is very satisfying and you can definitely spend hundreds of hours playing this game and if you have friends all the better just don't give in to the temptation of buying shark cards and you will find that this game can be a lot of fun to play.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-29,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,This is very difficult but I'm afraid I have to not recommend it. The quality of the game world mechanics and all the open world possibilities are awesome. For that it would surely be a wonderful game to play.But the problem with all the later GTA games is the way the developers try to force a specific story on the gamer. It feels like playing in a sandbox with some big kids trying to keep you from playing with the cool toys. I seriously don't understand why there is no Sandbox mode in this game and you are forced to either mill through the stories they come up with or you have to install some patch to enable the locked features. It's just boring.Certain weapons clothes garages cars etc. can only be found if you go through the motions of the quests in story mode. Even in multiplayer it feels like someone is holding my hands as I'm trying to play.The fun of an open world game is to be able to wander around and try new stuff. Having to follow an immensly detailed list of actions kills all the fun and creativity for me. There is no sens in creating such a wonderfully open responsive world with so much to discover and then nailing it shut and putting gamers on rails during the whole experience...I had hoped this GTA5 version would have less of that but it is actually worse than 4 in this respect.So overall I'd say this game is very disappointing for me and I probably won't be getting 6.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-08-28,0,0,267,False,Recommended,In my opinion GTA V and online are fun and enjoyable. The things that ruin the game though is the pathetic amount of hackers still roaming through the game ruining the fun and the almost constant grind the game puts you through. The game does need to be reworked prices being changed and jobs having better payouts but If you dedicate a day or two in the game like I have you start to earn money quite quick. (Once you get into things like being a CEO and gunrunning money becomes easier to get yet in my opinion it's just better to vehicle cargo once the warehouse is filled with standard and medium range vehicles making all the vehicles sourced top range. Rockstar put a x2 bonus on vehicle cargo before the Smugglers Run DLC and I personally made 15 million in 3 4 days),Grand Theft Auto V
2018-10-03,0,0,0,False,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY. I ended up requesting a refund because I couldn't login to the game. Also I didn't even expect to have to do a login since I only wanted to play the single player story. Also beware even if you buy the standard gta 5 non online I suspect it downloads the online on you because the download will wind up being 80 gig. Not to mention the fact that you have to login even if you're only playing the single player story.,Grand Theft Auto V

Hackers aren't even as bad as everyone says.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-10-24,0,0,165,False,Not Recommended,I cant reccomend this game to anyone because of just how terrible it is when playing online. Doing heists is the only way to make decent money online and yet they are impossible unless you have 4 or more friends playing with you. Almost everytime you try to do a heist someone leaves halfway through which cancels it entirely making you sit and wait to reconnect to a server online for 5 minutes or you'll end up with people with intense autism who die over and over causing you to restart the entire mission.Secondly it is really hard to mod this game. In GTA 4 and San Andreas mods were a huge part of the game. In GTA5 however you can get banned for using them even offline and yet hackers are rampand online (and yet never give me money ( ) constantly killing everyone in the server.Single player is aight defintley not worth the money though.,Grand Theft Auto V

So far they're all interesting except the crazy guy I really like being the father cause he's cool but also has issues with the fam (. The game is solid love the stories graphically still nice and there's tons of stuff to do! Also for some reason I've laughed hysterically multiple times during this game I've never done it for any other one...for example I was casually walking and I wanted to push the door opened but instead I accidently fire a shot from my gun and everyone goes insane and I get instantly mowed down by the cops xD. Something hilarious also is that you can just flip people off while on a vehicle...oh my god I've been testing it and just sitting by people while I'/m on a motorocycle and flipping them off..and the guys literally grab you and throw you off your bike it's so stinking funny xD.Overall 11/10 highly exceeded my expectations.,Grand Theft Auto V

Pay to win hackfest. 4. No ability to actually interact with the world that isn't through the barrel of a gun. No grab no substantial melee no human shield ability. No ability to pick up objects people or bodies. Complete lack of true customization.Pros 1.gameplay mechanics have improved over the last installment and the graphics are much better. 2.Mod community 3.

2015-11-18,1,1,167,False,Not Recommended,"This game has stunning graphics and that's it. The story and gameplay aren't worth it.There is absolutely no freedom when you are in a mission. Any slight deviation from what it tells you to do results in the mission failing. The closest you get to free will in this game is the rare instance where it basically gives you a bright flashing text saying ""HERE ARE YOUR PREDETERMINED 'FREE' CHOICES"".You don't even have that much freedom outside of a mission either. You can die completely out of the blue from random ""events"". The cops must have access to secret alien technology since they are able to inexplicably turn the front wheels of your car by just tapping the back of it. In reallity they were just too lazy to program the cops to actually go to the side of your car and perform a pit maneuver.The cops also apparently psychic abilities and teleportation powers.The story is forgettable. Every character is designed to be as irritating and unlikeable as possible so surprise surprise they end up being incredibly irritating and unlikeable. From the protagonists all the way down to the NPC's.The only character that's even remotely likeable only shows up once for the sake of literal and inexplicable ""torture porn"". It's so painfully obvious that this scene was just put here to force a controversy and get more publicity for the game. A good writer might have had this character return later in the story maybe to try and get revenge on the characters but that does not happen. In fact this part has literally no effect on the main story and could have effortlessly been left out.The entire world of this game is wasted on everything being a cheap joke written by a 12 year old who just discovered Family Guy. Every ""joke"" in this game can be summed up in one sentence ""I am doing something wrong and not being self aware about it"". There you have it. Literally every single joke that gets constantly repeated through not only the characters but billboards televisions radio stations and logoes.It's sad that the artists and programmers who had such attention to detail had to be lumped in with whoever wrote and designed the gameplay for this polished turd.The only thing even remotely redeemable about this game is the online multiplayer but even that's quickly turning sour.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-26,1,1,2166,False,Recommended,The game combines great game play consisting of third person and first person view and action packed missions great radio stations and next gen graphics perfectly. A huge map adds to the excellent open world experience. Realistic first person game play provides great satisfaction in action packed missions. A must play. This is a game which one must literally play before he dies if he is a gamer.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-07-24,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,The missions are great the heists are amazing the characters are pretty interesting so all in all the singleplayer part of the game is amazing. You wouldn't expect anything less from GTA.But the multiplayer is a whole another deal. Sure all the missions are fun and the heists are even better the other game modes (like Races team deathmach and rpg vs insurgent) are just amazing. But the problem with that is that there is never over 30 players per server and with 25 people you are gonna be lucky as hell to find 7 more who want to play with you. Even if you decide to wait 20 minutes to start a match with 8 people and one of them leaves the game just kicks everyone out of the loby (And sometimes to a whole different server) so guess what now you have to wait all over again if you want to get into the game. Okey okey for missions and heists you need 2 4 people total so it's not that hard to get that manny sure but 90% of the missions (the begginer ones) are so generic and stupid i can't believe it. Almost all of them go like this 1) Go to the spot of the meeting or whatever 2) Wait for everyone to go into the position 3) Watch an unskipable boring cutscene (Not always the case) 4) goes down and you have to kill everyone and take a bag or a vehicle 5) Drop it off at the spot. tl dr Singleplayer 9/10Multiplayer 3/10 The only reason i gave multiplayer 3/10 is because unless you have some friends to play with its dead at this point. Huge loading times empty lobies nowhere near enough players per server boring missions. If you plan on buying this game now for the multiplayer don't bother because all you are going to be getting is one big disappointment.,Grand Theft Auto V

The game is slow things turn to pixels and when you're in a fast care everything lags like hell all because my PC wasn't strong enough to handle this game but my Xbox One was. If they can make a version that runs well on something less powerful than a computer they shouldn't have the specs for the PC edition extremely high in minimum.The only reason I would reccommend the PC version is that the game can install mods.

2017-04-24,0,0,523,False,Recommended,Hello I just wanted to start off by saying that I review a game for what it is also compared with the previous titles in the series if a game in any franchise is messed up it's messed up I'm not going to sugar coat it and defend it to death like a fanboy.I also want to point out that I played Grand Theft Auto ( III Vice City San Andreas IV and now the most recent V at the time I'm writing this) with that said I have been playing these games pretty much from the start with the exception of Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.Now if I am to rate the game purely for what it is and what it wants to be it's a fantastic game.If i rate the game from a Grand Theft Auto standard it's a dumbed down consolized game that appeals to people who let's just say have a hard time with games.The single player is awesome it could be a lot better my only wish is that is a bit longer on the mission counter.I was very disappointed with Franklin's side of the story he comes from the hood but for some reason Rock Star didn't bothered to give him a better story what I mean by that the gangs are barely used as mission structure so much potential was wasted with Franklin the fact that he lives with Denise from GTA San Andreas wich was CJ's girlfriend none of this is pointed out.If I was in charge of single player I'd Introduce characters from San Andreas.I would focus like two separate stories one with Michael and Trevor the other Franklin and Lamar with guidance from the old grove street families members Sweet and CJ the only ones left alive after the end of GTA San Andreas.The gameplay is awful.. driving cars motorcycles and flying planes (helicopters are alright) feel stiff on rails extremely sensitive and feel too much like an arcade game.Cars explode too easy and i'm not talking about falling from a 30 story building one example is.. I drove a car hit some mailboxes lost control of the car it started to roll and backflip all over the road touched the asphalt and exploded.Motorcycles drive really bad I can go as far to say that GTA Vice City is 1st GTA who has motorcycles has better driving.GTA IV driving was perfect a bit over the top but overall was great especially motorcycles felt real and genuine.Police is another thing that kills this game you can hide in a back alley miles from where you committed the crime and they will drive into that alley.The AI never misses their shots that's another thing that kills this game dead you can't go on a rampage because you get dropped within 6 shots.. yeahAnd don't tell me to use the characters special ability because the game is centered around that and if you want to play the game the classic way you die too fast. Because if you go against 6 dudes that never miss a single bullet without the special ability you get your A$$ handed to you. My opinion that's Bull$it.Imagine if Mortal Kombat was in a manner where you can only damage your opponent with x rays or special combinations ain't that bull$it ? yeah it is.. what if I want to beat him up just by kicking and punching but I digress.The Radio stations also for me it feels uninspired and many people feel the same way from what I read online.The radio overall was a letdown. Especially the Talk Radio didn't like it all that much.Now of course i did some nitpicking but unfortunately the things I pointed out kills the game if you come from GTA IV you will be very disappointed with this game.SO TO RECAP You can't have fun while driving.. car flips around if it lands on anything other than it's wheels it explodes not all the time but a good 70% of the time wich is a lot anyway.You can't start shooting left and right the cops come and drop you so fast.The driving part of the game feels out of place. ( i got used to it now but I still don't like it).SO.. do I recommend this game? definitely yes BUT take in consideration what negatives I pointed out wich are genuine game breaking and unfunny.Thank you all for takeing your time reading this cheers.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-01,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,This game is boring as hell. Same old heists and t missions. Now the situation on PC online is that no one even joins the heists or mission. So basically in GTA V online you join and t around by driving in random places. Not to mention you get spammed by t Prison Break heists invitation. GTA V offline is worse. Best GTA story mode was in GTA 3 which really had a story. This story mode has no story in it and full of racism and adult content. Now they have openely added hookers and strippers that show their boobs in the game and you can literally them.Worst part is that if you want to enjoy all the features like $10 million plane etc then one thing is guaranteed that you can never make that much money by playing Heists especially when no one joins them. If you try to use trainers to get money so that you can explore all the features of the game then Rockstar BANS you for so called CHEATING. How the hell a game who fundamental concept is cheating and crime can BAN you for Cheating? Basically they don't want you to enjoy the game the way you want to. I am really disappointed with this game. I don't recommend anyone to buy it.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-24,0,0,218,False,Not Recommended,I don't know what to say about this. Because while the campaign is still amazing to this day and the added first person view feels very natural the multiplayer is a mess. So if you wanna try the singleplayer go for it.As for GTA online the thing that keeps this game alive and adds replayability I just can't recommend. Don't get me wrong it can have it's charm and fun moments but everything feels like a job and a grind unless you are a spoiled kid who has shark cards. Even with shark cards it will put you at a loss if you try to spend it wisely. Buying a drug house to break even could take you 20 hours of repeating the same quest over and over and that's if no one who hacks or has millions doesnt blow up your cargo making you wait 2 4 hours real life time to fill up your drugs again. It's and it feels nothing feels satisfying the physics between players lag and rockstar cares nothing about you progressing and wants to break your spirit until you buy their microtransactions. To add to that they are extremely ban happy on innocent players but yet 99% of matches (not joking being serious) have 1 2 hackers. The matches that don't have hackers will eventually. They never get banned and you will be in these matches for hours with nothing happening. They will teleport you lock you in cages insta kill you force you to use emotes blow up your car glitch your missions until they break. This all happens in a game run by a multi million if not billion dollar company. It's a blatant and insulting slap in the face to people who love their product and while the constant updates and pure ton of content are amazing it still doesnt help the fact it's all overpriced and too hard to get to be worth it. Don't buy this game if you want multiplayer it will drain you,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-07-13,0,0,1256,False,Recommended,gonna start off the bat with BUY THIS GAME WHILE ITS ONSALE. yeah i may make it sound like its great and all but if you want your money's worth buy it when its onsale 45 dollars at most. if you're white and have a ton of money go buy it idfc.so like you'll spend 100 hours in story mode at most if you plan to goof off and replay it but just doing main missions can take 5 15 hours depending on your speed. if you use mods you may spend more time in it but if you wanna play online mode you've gotta uninstall them which absolutely sucks. if you speedrun it then maybe 5 10. keep in mind at least 70% of story mode is driving to your destination. franklin is as black as this box you had to hover over to read this text btw so watch our for police my only complaint with story mode is how it can be super tedious sometimes and how rockstar doesn't really utilize the open worldness since its so empty. IMO it's the worst story out of all the GTA games (1 and 2 don't count 3 is debatable between worst and 2nd worst) but that doesn't mean its bad.now for online the big part2 minutes minimum of loading with a god like computer because rockstar refuses to use dedicated servers so you've gotta use peer to peer if you have no friends you'll get bored after maybe 100 250 hours. with friends you'll have a lot of fun 1000 hours before things start to get boring for me at least.the problem with this game is repetition and grinding. there's a lot to do but all the adversery modes are boring with a few exceptions. after a few hundred hours you've already experienced most of online so you're mainly just doing freemode missions and businesses to make money or fighting some tryhard that thinks putting a KD ratio on his college resume will get him anywhere in life. SPOILER ALERT it doesn't actually get you anywhere and shows how much of your life you wasted there are also modders which is pretty much 99% will ruin your day and 1% will be nice and give you money.this game is also super buggy and has a lot of glitches that can give you the upperhand in combat or making money. also if you plan to use glitches in combat with others at least do it as self defense and not attack people with it otherwise you're just gonna get looked down upon. if you've ever played dark souls people will point down at you if you use glitches. (to the people who doesn't get the joke pointing down is the ultimate way of showing disrespect in that game)as i mentioned earlier tryhards and hostile people are extremely annoying. these are the people that will kill you for no real reason what so ever. typically they mess with lower levels so the higher level you are the more safe you'll be (theoretically) but there's always a threat. it's also the worst when they destroy some business supplies the feeling you get is just pure hatred right afterwards. if you're one of these people please go kindly die.nevertheless this game is extremely fun. aside from glitches repetition grind and people ruining your day it will give you a ton of entertainment. initially i bought this game with my friend but he didnt like it too much so i made friends while playing this game and i still talk to them today (yeah i'm a weeb for having online friends i already know). there is no right way to play this game which is great and all.,Grand Theft Auto V

But the scripting/hacker dilemma is out of control and has been so for some time now and that's inexusable for a company of Rockstar's proportions to let that slide so heavily.I take long breaks (weeks to months) inbetween sessions but everytime I return I'm immediately greeted by a hacker/scriptor via some form. A few rare are friendly but they all exist and operate openly causing city wide disturbances mass spawning vehicles money and npc's aim bots god mode superman flight city carpet bomings. Anything you can think of.Rockstar and supporters irresponsibly put the burden of hackers on the consumer by telling us to fill out reports to solve the issue but I paid for a ""finished"" product that functions as described and I don't remember reading about a hacker faction/regime in the game description. One could literally sit all day going session to session reporting and never even reach the stack of shady sneaky cheaters. If the game's hack detterenant system is that ineffective there's something essential wrong in the system itself and that responsibility does not fall on the shoulders of the consumer.When the online gameplay is no longer a hackers circus paradise I will change the recommendation but there's just no excuse to rampant hackers with a budget of GTA V's magnitude regardless of gameplay or otherwise.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,This is most likely the worst PC port I ever saw. It should be playable if you got a licensed XBox controler OR a numpad.Otherwise you cannot do airmissions at all and anything involving controlled flight comfortable.I have no idea how any programmer worth his or her money do that but they totally FAILED making mouse control for the entire Air parts. They took the existing concepts that have been around for 2 decades and did everything to make it useless.I can't fight the controls in addition to the path the NPC's and the other players.If steam would allow refunds I would ask for one. I can't remember when I was last so utterly infuriated at a control system. I doubt there has been one like this since the old days of the sega mega drive and that one at least has nostalgia on it's side.The FPS part has issues too. It is basically a cover shooter but without effective cover that gives more then 90% protection helpfull placed cover due to the open world self regenerating health/shield mechanic or high HP and cheap revival that make cover usefullBut with AI that can jump up behind cover aim and shoot you and go back into cover before you even have a chance to aim at them (much less for the headshoot you will need) AI that has no issues hitting a mooving target no mater how impoossible it is for you to hit them while moving weapons that can one shoot you regardless of armor and healthOtherwise it is a racing game with oversized hitboxes making not hitting anything near impossible driving physics that result in even the smalest impact at low speed either totally stopping you or letting you make pirouettes on the street minute to half hour long chases where you enemies are the traffic because the target won't even be on your minimap much less in your sight no in world target markers or path markers making it hard to even know who or what to shoot or where to drive a small angeled rotating minimap as far from the center of screen as possible to minimise orientation while also dodging traffic cars that can't be stopped by anythng less then a RPG or sticky bomb while having a driver that can die from a single bullet,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-28,0,0,476,False,Recommended,"I've played this game thrice now each time on a different platform. Each version has been more fun and chaotic than the last. My first playthrough was on the now inferior Xbox 360. The graphics were gorgeous. They were a sight to see. Third person shooter 3 playable characters who worked together in heists and missions. Gameplay was solid. The attention to detail in this game is amazing and you'll have to play it to know what I mean. Now here is where one of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever comes in. GTA Online. It's really hectic and not quite what I had in mind after watching trailers and stuff. But still on October 1st 2013 my friends and I went to our houses and logged into Xbox Live. We decided to make our crew. We kept going back and forth on names and when we went to enter them they had all been taken. Then my friend Luke told us to just start playing while he got a name. 15 minutes later he says quietly ""Done."" Two seconds later I get an invite to the ""Love Bunny Crew"". And our crew tag was LOVE. Jesus that makes me laugh every time. We had a blast. It almost felt like DayZ in the sense that you couldn't really trust anyone. Except in here unlike DayZ almost EVERYONE was a total prick. At least in DayZ there is about a 50/50 chance that they are friendly. Ugh. Anyway I loved it. But then I lost my disc in mid 2014. I heard about a possible port er 'remaster' to the next gen (Current gen really.) consoles. I'd had a PS4 since December 15th 2013. Exactly one month after its launch. And almost a year later GTA was being released for it. Keep in mind my current gaming machine was built in early January. A few weeks before the release this trailer was released showing off GTA V in first person. This was mind blowing for me! I had always wondered what it would be like to have a GTA V in first person since I saw some gameplay of GTA San Andreas and GTA IV in first person. I thought it was going to be game changing. In reality while it is nifty it's kind of gimmicky. I went to GTA Online and found out that I could transfer my old 360 character. Boy was I excited! Same drill really. Fun open world chaos. And the multiplayer was the same ol' ""shoot first ask never"" routine. It was fun. But the my machine was built two months after in early January that next year. I was ready for the PC version to come out because I wanted a game that could bring my machine down to its knees. This isn't the game. I can run this 60 frames per second easily. Director Mode and Rockstar Editor were added this time around. Pretty much the WHOLE reason that I bought it AGAIN. Worth it. The other day I tried going back to the PS4 version mainly because I'd misplaced my keyboard that day ( don't ask) and it was UNBEARABLE. 30 frames per second no mods and JESUS CHRIST did the PS4 crash it? I don't know does a bear in the woods?So in short PC goodness 10/10 would club hooker to death again.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game really seems to focus on getting people into the online aftergame to sell DLC rather than having a even more epic single player experience than the last game.I suggest buying it but it felt like a smaller version of the last two games in the series....,Grand Theft Auto V

Sadly many say they get bored of the game pretty fast.At the end all i can say is that it depends on the person playing you may get bored but you may have the will to play again.So game on!,Grand Theft Auto V

And all the while I'm RESTARTING like 200 goddamn times.AND THEN THE GAME STOPS READING MY KEYBOARD!MY LOGITECH USB CONNECTED *WIRED* KEYBOARD SO MY CHARACTER IS *STUCK* IN PLACE for some reason despite being not stuck JUST A SCENE EARLIER!!!!!!!Do 5 year old psych ward patients program this game? What kind of an imbecile do you need to be to program a game THIS POORLY. AND THEN to levy a creepy private info wall that both needs your steam account (for SOME REASON) AND needs you to REGISTER with Rockstar?WHY AM I REGISTERING WITH YOU ROCKSTAR. So you can steal my info? Try to control me? Spy on me passively by raising a last minute blue balls private info ""pay""wall that I have to give you all of my favourite s ex positions on so you can control me? Basically Rockstar is becoming the new EA.Here's the funny thing GTA V isn't even that good. It's too realistic. Vice City was classic Rockstar. There was a strategy layer where you had to capture turfs and earn money from them buy businesses...there were jumps everywhere the cars felt amazing...Same for GTA III. Since GTA IV the GTA series have been getting more and more boring and realistic and just meh.

Spent 40 bucks on sale for a 4 year old game and I'm treated like some goddamn pirate? Are you serious Rockstar?The game itself is good in single player cannot deny it. The online though what they claim to be a huge success by the way is another story. I could notice that the online is filled with hackers after 1 hour of playtime only. It is unacceptable that a company with so much money and followers such as Rockstar doesn't do much to prevent something like this or does it so poorly that the effects are unpercievable.Stay away from Rockcrap as of now. I swear to god that if they put some stuff like the social club in their new game I'm not gonna buy it and so should do you if you don't like the way they're treating their costumers.,Grand Theft Auto V

One of these topics was the creator about calling us freelowders if we havnt goten Shark Cards. Yes this hit me in the bad way because I dont have money and really hated that fact. Now I wont buy one while I have the money. The second topic was the money. I know this will happen again becuase rockstar wants us to pay money to just have the in game money taken away later just to repeat the process. The way they did it was unfair knocking everyone down to 200k I had 6 mil saved up from last year yet all of that is gone. The third topic was the prices in game. It is no dought that some of the prices has been raised to massive proportions. It is hard to get some of the thinggs you want now. The final topic was how this would effect the funds of GTA VI if it comes out. We have estimated that most people including myself wont get it.

The missions in single player is absolutely entertaining (especially Trevor ones). The heists were absolutely fun and exciting to do. Finishing single player is totally worth doing so over and over.GTA ONLINE RATING 5/10 Because of hackers. THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS.I really love the game but lets go over to GTA Online. I love how there's always new content in GTA Online. There are so many things to do but you can't do everything in one day. From mini games like arm wrestling to car racing and all that to CEO jobs MC missions heists and everything is very entertaining time will past so fast playing GTA. The only downside for me is that there are plenty of hackers roaming around the free world in their 'godmode' state eating 10000000000 headshots and not die at all. Hackers can also make you want to lap dance for them because they are a bunch of fa.ggots who like men to lapdance on them. They can also teleport anywhere they want to so basically they ruin the game for legitimate players in public servers. /Where is the option for private session now? I can't seem to find it either. Get your shiit together Rockstar. EDIT NOV 23 2018 I am still amazed how timeless this game is becoming. My opinion still stands on how bad Rockstar support is though.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-08-20,0,0,8,False,Recommended,From a technical and design perspective Grand Theft Auto V sets new bars. The world it presents is unrivalled in authenticity and vibrancy. It feels fluid and alive. Time passes organically characters' lives progress and there is a simply astounding quantity of side activities in which to engage. It's quite possible to explore the state of San Andreas for hours without moving the main story forward a stitch. In fact that's part of the fun. And it's all been polished to a glossy sheen. The controls feel great the visuals are lush and a brilliant graphical interface empowers players giving them all the information they need and only the information they need exactly when they need it. However the writing isn't quite as sharp as it has been in previous installments the humor is a bit broader and less sophisticated and the main characters aren't as well developed (probably because there are now three) but this only impacts the overall experience a little. It remains a very impressive game.Keep in mind though that much of the content is unequivocally geared for adult audiences. And even then it will not be for all tastes. Grand Theft Auto V puts players in the roles of criminals who show little remorse for their evil actions and often even take pleasure in them. It's a dark fantasy with the potential to prove immense fun for those who are mature enough to properly appreciate its adult humor and able to clearly distinguish between right and wrong. It is not a game for younger players with developing psychologies. And adults who don't have a taste for role playing a life of crime should probably give this game a wide berth.,Grand Theft Auto V

Grinding out 5 million for one thing gets old real fast when heist only give you around 300k. I've been playing this game since release day and am very disappointed in what it has become.

2017-10-18,0,0,298,False,Recommended,Okay I think I have a lot to say about this.First things first this game is wonderful. I beat the game a couple times on the original xbox 360 version and I'd rate the story mode 4/5. Lots of things to do in this game and the map is pretty big. I really enjoy riding a bike up the mountains and then parachuting off or surviving with a 5 star wanted level while on the tallest building in the game. Singleplayer in this game is fun already and adding mods ontop just makes it 10x better. Would I reccomend getting this for the singleplayer? Yes. Oh hey! There's also a nifty 'online' mode. I had lots of fun doing multiplayer in GTA4 so surely GTA5 has an even better online mode seeing as there are millions of things to do in singleplayer right? Well sure I guess. GTA Online has lots and lots and lots of activities to do. You can rob stores play golf murder people have an arm wrestle (RIP fingers) rob banks race etc. There is just so much to do. However I wouldnt do multiplayer unless you have friends to play it with. 9/10 times there is a modder in an online server that likes to bomb everybody thats in the server or just spawn random stuff to annoy players. Even if you play in passive mode (Essentially disables PvP) they will still often do stuff like blow up nearby vehicles teleport control you and your vehicles etc. Now if you either play in a closed session by yourself (limits the available activities) or play with your friends the game is pretty great. Money is NOT as hard to get as people make it sound. I got the game a few weeks ago and already managed to get a nice apartment and some vehicles. It just takes time. Even if you play for an hour a day you can easily rob a few stores and get at least 10k a day. If you are looking for fast money whenever you get invited to an organization accept it. As long as you are within a radius of your CEO you will get paid around 5000 every 30 minutes and if you do missions with your ceo you can easily make 20k or so in an hour. Anyways thats my review.TL DR Singleplayer is great Multiplayer is not always great unless you have friends.,Grand Theft Auto V

The world is just so packed with content and small details that it's mind boggling. The multiplayer is cool I guess. I mostly just did the heists with my friends but the PvP stuff there is cool but not enough for me to dedicate hours to it. I'm here for the single player and it's just so spot on. The visuals not just for a game of this size and scale but for any game are seriously impressive. The characters and voice acting are film worthy (GTA would make for a great show on TV). The missions are great especially the heist missions. Planning is simple yet fun and feel like you're really planning one but they are still streamlined enough that you don't get bogged down. I really really love that Rockstar did the 1st person mode. Having to download mods for that in past GTAs resulted in not the best quality but it really works in GTA V. When seeing footage in Youtube videos it always weirds me out when I see people plating in 3rd person as I remember ""Oh yeah GTA can be played in 3rd person."" The shooting driving hand to hand fighting and all the rest of it just works so well and is so well done.

Once you have that your pretty much set. You'll also need a house to store your garage in. I'd suggest some shack of some sorts. Then use your Insurgent in missions and to be a prick to other players cause they all think the Armored Kurumi is better. Wrong that one blows up with one sticky the Insurgent requires around 5 stickies to blow up. I don't suggest buying the homing launcher as it easily doged. Clothing wise suit your self. I myself cant settle down and find the perfect outfit but thats alright I have some combos I like. Story mode is intriguing to play. Online though... I guess sometimes it can get annoying cause people leave missions. Or a certain player keeps killing you for no certain reason. But hey passive mode is a thing so you shouldn't really complain if you get killed constantly Unless its a hacker using cheezy things to insta kill you do report. P,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-13,1,1,287,False,Recommended,GTA 5 s first innovative step is to drop players in the shoes of not one but three protagonists which they can then switch between on the fly. In missions that involve all three players are given a tactical edge as they re effectively given three vantage points to view the action through.Can t target an enemy with a clear shot with one character? Simply switch over to a second character that just happens to be situated in a raised position with a sniper rifle.In some of the missions GTA V's multi pronged interface offers different ways of playing the same mission. In one instance players can cover one character with a sniper rifle as they sneak onto a boat or they can play the character on the boat and transform the experience from a shooter to stealth mission.The quick change mechanic also keeps the action moving at a pace. Finished a mission but don t fancy the lengthy drive to the next one which just happens to be on the other side of the map? Simply switch characters and get stuck right back into the action.Every mission has a rating ranging from Bronze up to Gold and a list of mini activities players need to clock in order to score a 100 per cent completion. For the first time in this series players now have the option of going back and replaying any mission they ve attempted at any point in the game they choose.The missions themselves vary from tried and tested templates familiar to GTA fans to some truly imaginative action packed shenanigans we won t spoil for you here. The centrepieces of GTA 5 however are the Heist missions.At certain points during GTA 5 s narrative players will be given a target to take down. In the past this sort of activity would simply take the form of a self contained mission but here players have two approaches in how they tackle a score. They re initially briefed on their options and are able to pick out crew members to assist on the job.Each member will want a percentage of the take and usually their percentage reflects how skilled they are at what they do. Crew members also improve with each score but their percentage doesn t so it s possible to level a rubbish hacker for example up to the point where he s rather good at his job but he ll still only ask for 4 per cent of the score.Once the method and crew are selected players may find they have to scour the city for some equipment like high grade military tech for a bank job or a fast car stashed in a parking lot for a getaway. Once all the equipment is assembled the heist commences and without giving too much away because really they house some of the best moments in the game it s some of the best game design Rockstar has pumped out into the world in ages.All the GTA playbook is brought to bear driving gunplay precise timing and the ability to outrun the cops with a four star wanted level as the Heist turns from nail shredding tension into a high octane action set piece.Not only are the Heists immense fun to play they feel like a natural evolution in the GTA series. Best of all a lot of this mayhem has an immediate pay off in the form of cash once all the crew has taken their cut naturally.And there are tons of things players can spend their cash on. Weapons armour clothes masks car upgrades custom jobs and properties and businesses are all up for grabs. As was the case with GTA 4 GTA 5 is set on a sprawling map filled with activities to occupy players for ages.Los Santos is Rockstar s cracked version of Los Angeles and anyone who has been to the City of Angels will crack a wry smile at the recognisable landmarks and neighbourhoods it contains.The city is simply bursting with events and mini games. Players can take part in a round of golf a game of tennis or even attempt a triathlon. They can improve their aim at a firing range transport contraband via land or air or engage in a spot of skydiving. Incidentally each time you use one of the three characters in the game in some sort of activity you level up their abilities.If you play a lot of tennis your stamina will go up. Spend some time at a firing range and your skill in firearms will increase. No activity is a waste and God knows there s enough of them to keep players engaged for hours.The map of Los Santos also feels looser less claustrophobic than GTA 4 s Liberty City. While i loved 2008 s Rockstar flagship release I have to confess that the constraints of the Liberty City gridlock prompted me to drop a small fortune on cabs.This hasn t been the case in Los Santos it s possible to navigate the streets highways back roads and off road routes without taking your foot off the gas and given the beauty and attention to detail of the world around you driving for extended periods never feels like a chore.In truth GTA 5 harkens back to the Bacchanalian sense of chaotic freedom that existed in the earliest third person GTA games (III Vice City and San Andreas). In Los Santos you re restricted only by a lack of attention and your lack of imagination. This is a town where you can enjoy a rollercoaster ride race down the side of a mountain on a bicycle or buy a parachute nick a dirt bike and then head off into the hills for a spot of motorised base jumping.There s also a rather decent story underpinning all of this action even though it will strike fans of the gritty GTA 4 as somewhat more hyper and more deranged. Rockstar North has always presented GTA as a twisted satire on American culture but given the extreme turn politics and media in the USA have taken in recent years GTA 5 s satirical edge is sharp enough to sever bone.The three protagonists at the centre of GTA 5 are all pretty unsympathetic characters although it s a testament to how well written they are that they re not bad company for the 26+ hours it ll take players to blaze through the main story mode.Franklin is a hustler from a rundown area of Los Santos who has grown tired of boosting cars for a repo business and is looking to make his mark as a professional criminal. His job causes him to cross paths with Michael a retired heist man who is being driven slowly insane by his selfish family.Franklin s looking for a mentor. Michael even though he initially doesn t know it is looking for a protégé and most importantly a way to end the mind numbing tedium of his day to day routine. It s not long before their activities bring them to the attention of Trevor a violent former partner of Michael s from back in the day. Once he s added to the mix everything goes sideways.This trio of characters are pretty hard work initially. Franklin is arguably the most likable of the three but since he s a criminal on the make he s hard to root for. Michael in his own words is a great thief but he s pretty much rubbish at everything else imagine Neil McCauley from the movie Heat stuck in a never ending episode of The Osbornes and you ll get a clear picture of his existence.As bad as the pair of them are however they re almost angelic when compared to Trevor who is probably the darkest anti hero ever created in the gaming medium. A raging psychotic driven by equal parts speed and hatred Trevor comes across more of a force of nature than an actual person.He s erudite and intelligent but wholly nihilistic and completely unpredictable. He s the sort of bloke you d cross the street to avoid. Trevor is as likely to slit your throat as he is to defecate on your carpet as he is to offer you a lift to work all depending on how badly hungover he is.Verdict 76/100,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-08-06,0,0,301,False,Recommended,If you've never heard of this game get examined. The best of the GTA series so far and one of the best open world games. The story is fantastic and very well done. That's all I'll say on that no spoilers here.Fair warning Using a keyboard and mouse with this game sucks. I definitely recommend using a gamepad. The PC version also requires you to create a Rockstar Social Club account whereas the console versions didn't.Tons of cars motorcycles boats planes and helicopters to choose from most of which mimic real world vehicles. The handling is pretty good on most of them.Single Player For being a bunch of criminals the trio of protagonists are a likeable bunch. You have your middle aged upper class family man retiree. Then there's the younger guy from the hood. Oh then there's Trevor a total psychopath. Through the course of the story the three end up together.Blood sex torture kidnapping drugs murder arson swearing racial stereotyping corruption... if you're easily offended don't buy this game. Don't buy it for your kids either that's just a stupid ing thing to do and as a parent you fail.GTA Online Sadly full of cheaters and modders even more than the Playstation versions since it's so much easier to mod a PC game. If you want to play online I'd recommend getting in with a good crew or playing with friends. Aside from the cheating the only other bad thing is the way communication with the servers is done when near other players. If one lags everyone lags and physics seem to go out the window. I never really ran into this on Playstation and have rarely seen it on PC but it does happen. Aside from those negatives the missions races and other activities are fun especially with friends.If you want to get public lobby's solo there are ways to make it happy. Google that Is it worth the price tag of $60 for what is really a 2 year old game? It was to me. I haven't enjoyed a GTA game this much since Vice City.,Grand Theft Auto V

Cheaters in this GTA Online can reset your (not just their your) level spawn in NPCs and change their playermodel give themselves weapons from singleplayer (like the taser which can infinitely stun players) and even spawn in ing objects. Like a windmill or the giant yacht from singleplayer.

There are so many hackers and cheaters that make your playing experience a terrible one but the game is fun.I was about 2 hours into my GTA Online experience and I met this one hacker. He insisted on teleporting me in the middle of the ocean over and over again. By the time I was able to swim to land I would be dead. Hackers ruin GTA.I finally met a nice hacker that gave me some cash bags. I bought myself a Zentorno and maxed it out. Then the hacker spawn killed me for 30 minutes because I ""used his money wrong"".So even though this game is full of hackers it's still fun.BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE.

2016-09-03,0,0,304,False,Recommended,"This game is awesome. GTA Online is one of the best things ever! I never play with random people though. We create a private lobby with friends and then we have tons of fun. Like literally TONS. After the latest racing update it's even more fun. Racing is more ""crazy"" and feels like Trackmania. I love Rockstar for what they did with the game.However although I never met cheaters but from reading forum posts reviews on Steam I can see that it is really a big problem. It's a bit shame that Rockstar are not giving more effort on banning them and leaving innocent people alone. So advice for anyone who is already playing this game or going to buy it in the future take few friends and play it with them. Don't go into random lobbies because it's not really fun. Not only because of the cheaters but because it's just random deathmatch on the streets.

I have only spent money on the game copy alone and you see 300+ hours and I don't even own a decent car aircraft or even a decent business. Sure I didn't know what I was doing the first 100+ hours but why should I have to know? Why should I have to go out of my way to watch guides on how to earn the most money possible when that option should be there in the first place. The only way to make any decent money is through the businesses (which take forever to actually generate a good income) doomsday heist (which is more of a ""lategame"" heist plus anybody can force the whole heist to restart over and over) or just have a modder give you money. Don't take this the wrong way GTA 5 is one of the most impressive games I've seen over the years. The problem is that Rockstar treats it like Valve treated TF2 and CS GO.

Either the lobby is full or the session timed out. Not a very good online experience at all. Again I am disappointed in Rockstar but more so in their behavior towards the modding community.Edit So after a long drawn out battle with Rockstar Support over bugged crates hackers/modders random bugs missing car emblems crashes and lost progress I find out that Rockstar is finally after years of being released trying to fix the issues of hacked money &amp modders cheating. Poorly but they are trying. They are also giving away $250 000 in free cash to anyone who logs in before Halloween which seems like a pittance compared to the high prices of vehicles usually over a $1 000 000. I walked away from the game since support wasn't willing to fix my account even with uploaded Youtube footage of bugs and hackers. Rockstars support or lack there of for this game is appalling. I have never played a game where I had video proof of a player modding presented it to support and they stonewalled me until the ticket was closed.

2017-06-30,0,0,864,False,Recommended,Am sorry but your Single player modding is bleeding in to GTA Online. it hard to make money and do Missions as is with out modders useing god mode in the mod manu as well as nother mods like pick a random player and blow them up. crash the lobby. GTA has a lot of good player who are cool and love the fight.also players who just want to do mission and not get killed but thats not what GTA was about. If they stop players killing other players it would not be GTA anymore it would be dum as fact is the Modding Issue with OpenIV is you the modders who take your too GTA online if you did not do it then none if it or the fight with modder killing GTA online would be happening. I ing hate All you modders out there who take it to GTA online. It's your falt not Rockstars I like this game i would Recommend it. it can be fun. it be even better if all you modders stop Massing with GTA Online!,Grand Theft Auto V

Online is quite controversial because of the random bans which has never happened to anyone I know and hackers which I have never really come across except level 10000 people... Personally I love online but even if you don't want to touch it the game is worth it just for singleplayer.,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-05-06,1,1,145,False,Not Recommended,I think anyone could talk about this game for hours but I ll keep it briefWith a developer like rock star make a great game and then goes on to promise that the game would be constantly be supported by great FREE dlc you are blown away and expect a lot. Then the devs went and took a sledge hammer to the foundations and broke that like it was an elderly person with brittle bones syndrome. I will not be talking about the single player because it is good and I believe it should carry the game but then the updates affected overall performance and really messed up the great experience i had. The multiplayer even after ll these years feels gimmicky repetitive and boring without friends but this doesn t mean anything. The micro transactions are ridiculous and while the DLC is free all of the new guns vetches property and other extravagant thing must be bought with in game money and in short are way to expensive because there is no constant way to earn a lot in this game making it feel like a grind. In short great game but the devs went a royally buggered it up. Honestly it feels like this game is dying and is desperately trying to stay relevant to kind of like Dwayne Johnson in Tooth Fairy but at least that movie was from the start GTA online could of been a diamond but turned into a heap of in the shape of a diamond,Grand Theft Auto V

But even without mods the game is still a good time waster from playing custom game types found off the internet like murder maze oh even a good stand off between you and some friends vs the cops.Either way I find the game fun without any custom mods improving my fov.However one little thing that annoys me and I don't know if this just affects me but my game randomly freezes so I stay still but other can still move and I unfreeze and there a mile in front of me.9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

The most fun to be had in this game is ignoring what the game designers want you to do.garbage update december 2018 game is still full of scriptkiddies and tryhards I can't even play the new content because script toddlers keep turning me into props exploding everybody and just generally doing what children do which is because....This game has no anticheat. Scriptkiddies are as common as trees in a forest. 98% of all money I've spent has been given to me by scriptkiddies. This game is a joke even indie game devs can manage to figure out some form of anticheat. This is p a t h e t i c Old Review I do not and also can not recommend this game to new players or potential buyers. There's *no* anticheat whatsoever and that's only the first and biggest in a long line of severe status issues.Summary of SP It's a good GTA game I guess I beat it once but the only reason I have this game is to play with friends.Summary of Online The world's greatest game engine with the world's worst game built on top. It's no Superman64 it works fine but the game mechanics themselves are abysmal. It's a game designed to make you and everyone around you into the world's worst for meager reward. Tedious repetitious grinding that other players can interrupt destroy or steal. A multiplayer grief simulator where griefing is actually rewarded. The perfect game for absolute trash.Current State of Online (OCT 2018) Still full of scriptkiddies with trainers this coupled with the abysmal community and the incredible level of toxicity the game is designed to reward avoid playing with anybody in a public server. You can do this by (while in an online server) opening your task manager opening your resource monitor and suspending the process for 5 seconds before resuming. Ditch the leeches.Oct 18th 2018 Take Two files search and seizure warrants in Australia instead of having their game designed well programmed well just generally made to not be a big mess full of hackers. Why make anticheat when you can just try to use irl law? Bunch of in trashbag idiots. RDR2 is going to be ing terrible.Oct 2018 Wow this is just.. terrible I really thought *something* would get better. Reinstalled played for an hour. The first 3 games were full of hyper aggro s that kept exploding the stores I was trying to browse the remaining 2 games were full of gigantic props spawned in by scriptkiddies. Absolute trash companies with 1/16th the budget can manage their game better. Install FiveM and forget Rockstar exists because holy what an incompetent group of dumb idiot upsMarch 26 2018 Rockstar's crap anticheat software just managed to ban hundreds of people some of which had their accounts straight up wiped. The sentence below this one is from February and describes how the game is full of modders. Rockstar can't even ban the right people holy what is happening? Every few months this game has some new drama come out about it it's crazy. Rockstar is the game developer equivalent of a high school lunchroom.Febuary 2018 Modders are a constant problem playing with friends is equally problematic and this game gets worse every day. It's depressing. Unrelated note I find it abhorrent and annoying that rockstar put an RDR mission in the pc version of GTAV knowing full well that they never ported RDR never will and the PC release of the next Red Dead game will probably be a full year behind the console release. I won't be buying any more rockstar games for many reasons and this is one of them.Online in depth Apparently the mastermind behind GTA in its inception was a guy and his team who were eventually fired after an executive above him got jealous that the online was so incredibly popular. Sam and Dan Houser did this by sending him on a 6 month leave not paying him for the leave firing his staff while he was gone and firing him when he returned (as well as other insane practices). For this they received a $150 million dollar lawsuit from their own former employees so if I'm not being clear enough &gt &gt the people who run this game are *literally criminals* and aren't even associated with the things that made GTA Online a cool experience GTAV a good game initially and GTA as a whole.&lt &lt It's evident made extremely clear by their obvious mishandling of this absolute mess of a game.The engine is fun to play inside with friends but it's hard to enjoy since the game design is a garbage fire and might be the worst online of any game I've ever seen including korean MMO's. 'Handled poorly' is being generous it's filled to the brim with modders and it's designed to reward you for ing with other players. No moderation no game balance nothing. This game is made to make you so angry you end up paying for ingame currency (that modders can spawn for you but won't unless you pay them see how gtav created a nonexistent criminal economy accidentally through the world's iest planning). Regardless of which though both scyophants and the children of even dumber sycophants still ended up paying for this currency and thus funded this awful refuse dump of a game getting 4 releases. People actually pay for GTA currency. Sometimes I spend an entire day with a gun to my head wondering if I want to live in a world full of people who pay for GTAV money.Oh and Rockstar's incredible ineptitiude regarding this pay for garbage model has created an environment in which players are paying players to mod them in money. They're so idiotically inobservant they somehow created a criminal economy in a game about criminal economies and yet have no idea how to handle it. It's both embarassing and ironic. Fire whoever's putting these ing heists together fire everyone working on them. This doomsday is trash. These heists were trash. Everything good about online has nothing to do with this awful tedious monotonous repetitive absolute ing DRECK. I like how people will reference GTASA when talking about this game. Which is literally nothing like GTASA.I'd say this is absolutely without a doubt 100% confirmed no lie I'll sign a contract the******worst most unbalanced poorly thought out poorly designed no effort pile of diaper scum trash game I've ever seen in my life built on the most advanced game engine I've ever seen in my life******Did I mention take two sent DMCA takedowns to SP modders meanwhile the online is quite literally filled with modders in every server?Play GTAIV and save yourself the frustration. This game is bad. It's so bad I wouldn't buy it for anybody nor would I admit to playing it. It's an embarassment. It's gross. It's the gum stuck under the table. this game,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-12,0,0,896,False,Recommended,GTA V is a really fun game....That said...One of the biggest problems is that it's STILL being sold for $60 USD. If possible only buy it on the rare chance it goes on sale. Another issue is that hackers are constantly finding new ways to grief other players. If you even suspect that there's a hacker and you are with a group of friends that make up the majority of the lobby just vote to kick them out. Otherwise just find a new lobby. Do not stick around. The only exception is if there are hackers / modders that are giving out free money. They're doing God's work because the other major problem is how expensive everything is. This game is literally built on microtransactions. The only reason it hasn't been lynched by the gaming community is because the payouts for in game activities and jobs are more or less reasonable and you can actually advance without stopping to drop extra money on the game if you really don't want to.3.7 out of 5 4 out of 5 if you play with friends.

The reason for that as if ironically it would sound but the amount of cheaters in this game is very disappointing and frustrating.

2015-04-13,11,58,393,False,Not Recommended,I have spent $60 pre ordering Max Payne 3 before it was released. I spent $60 US on GTA 5. I have never played either game and most likely I never will. The problem I have isnt with the games per say it is with the rock star social club (which is a fancy way of saying always online DRM with a lot of snazzy social features). At some point i must have logged onto my steam acccount at a close friends house and now somehow in a way that only rock star can explain my steam account is linked to his rockstar social club account. That means that when i try to launch many of rockstars games i get one of two different errors (depending on the game). Both errors can only be fixed by submitting tickets with many screenshots serial numbers and screen shots of serial numbers. In my life i have bought 1000's of games (many with very restrictive DRM). In my life I have also only submitted tickets on MMOs. I have neither the time nor the patience to waste more time (other than the hours of research i have wasted on the internet looking into this issue) than I already have. I wont be submitting a ticket so that rockstar can be convinced I am not attempting to pirate their triple A multi billion dollar franchise. I would rather spend my time playing any of the hundreds of games i currently have access to. Their DRM (if they have any) is not so restrictive that their customer service gets overwhelmed when they launch a product and/ or patch a product. This seems to be a problem only rockstar and ubisoft have.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-08,0,0,2062,False,Not Recommended,"You will complete the story in 24 48 hours and you will just simply run out of things to do fast. Earlier GTA games had better and longer stories. Now most of the game is just side missions like stunts (as if you can't do stunts on your own and they really had to show how ""hard they worked"" on the side missions) collectibles (collecting things which you run into by luck) and just simple missions like going from point A to point B killing someone going to point C to finish the mission. GTA V story mode has not received any updates which would bring new vehicles weapons or anything at all. Zero.In December 2013 Rockstar announced that they planned to release downloadable content in 2014 that expands the single player mode and creates new story for the lead characters 20 however no single player expansions have been released.They didn't think that single player DLCs would bring them much profit so they dropped the single player and worked only on Online where they could concentrate on the 12 year olds who bought the shark cards with their stolen parents money.GTA Online is the main reason why they don't lower the price. GTA Online is broken. Cheaters rule the public sessions (something like servers but only for max. of 30 players) and normal players are their es. They can take your weapons crash your game (so you have to restart and enjoy the continuous loading screens) even when you are in passive mode (where normal players can't do anything to you) they can kill you with the cheats they have. About a year ago one person shared a way how you can get into a public session just on your own (in private sessions invite only sessions friends only sessions you can't do missions of updates where you have to go to point A kill people take supplies and drive it to point B) so there would not be any other people who could destroy your supplies and just make your gameplay into wasting time. You need to break a broken game in order to play normally. Sounds good right? GTA Online is now all about wasting time. Kids just shooting everyone they see in freeroam calling other people noobs and just non stop raging. Cancer. Besides the community anti cheat everything you have to love the time they take to fix things. For example the phone icon near the map which basically tells you have unread messages or invitations to missions. After some update they somehow managed to it up so that when you enlarged the map (pressed Z) the phone would not be right next to the map but a few inches to the right side of the map. How long did it take for them to fix that? From 6 months to a year probably. They took that much time to fix a god damn sprite position. And the broken chat while spectating other people has not been fixed probably since the release for PC. And these are just simple things that they have not managed to fix. They fix only the things that impact the income for their company. That's it. In 2016 cheaters were running wild. They had the ability to abuse game features so that they could remove other players money. It was the personal vehicle insurance feature. What did they do? They disabled the feature. That's it.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v ZsXpW NJw_YYup that's exactly how the flag waves when you drive the car 3 mph.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v OTiNq rIfLoAnd you really have to enjoy the only normal thing in Online heists. And to actually enjoy them you have to inspect people you join or people that join your heist lobby from head to toe so you don't waste your time with dead brain people. So even when you waste all that time to wait for people to connect even after kicking all the level 8 people after your inspection from head to toe you have to be lucky enough to actually not get people that would crash into the back of your car and it gets destroyed because of it. And here you are sitting and thinking that you could have had fun playing the game after doing something and being tired.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v asa08_Vxwl0So yeah the only excuse for the price is they think that they are doing a good job with GTA Online even if the person is not interested in it you still have to pay the money for it even if the single player mode had no real updates and the price is still the same. And the only way to prolong the single player experience is by adding modifications yourself. Take Two/Rockstar had a thought about killing the main most popular single player modding program that has been around 10 years already. They wanted people to come and play GTA Online so that they would get fed up of the endless grinding in the game and buy a shark card that costs more than their entire game (80$) and you could buy not even all the things from only one update. This was the reason why GTA V had been negatively Steam reviewed by people.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okhttps //www.youtube.com/watch?v JDxBnZSb1j8The player base of this game is mostly brain dead people.You could invest those 60 30$ more wisely rather than into this crap.Also here's something more to read on the game https //www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/6wxgvm/gta_online_is_a_victim_of_accretion_where/",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-16,2,11,173,False,Not Recommended,THE FOLLOWING IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE READ THE FOLLOWING WITH A OPEN MINE OR F*CK OFF i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360/PS3 graphics and Xbox one/PS4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy. the graphical changes between current gen console GTA and PC is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist DLC it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the PC version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst GTA to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between PC and console i'd say console is like a 8.5/10 and PC in its current state is like 3.5/10 MY OPINION MAY CHANGE WITH ROCKSTARS PROGRESS BUT I AM UNSURE IF THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE MY OPINIONTHE F*CKING HACKERS CHANGED MY MINDnew score is actualy 1.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-13,0,0,29,False,Not Recommended,Bought a copy through the 'Social Club' by accident and found out instantly upon installation that it was from an outside source that controls your keys. I didn't much appreciate that but the game was still there despite not having steam achievements or integration. So I purchased it again on steam only to find that it has the same Social Club garbage plaguing it as well. Now apparently you can't share an account with another user and play at the same time despite having two copies of the damn thing so you move along to customer support and they say they can fix it but end up transferring the Steam key to another account so you're left with the initial crap version you didn't want without telling you. Then they move you to another employee later on to tell you that they could only transfer the Steam version because it was purchased last. They'll suggest you link your steam account with the user that they're transferred your key to while losing your progress (even though there is no option to) and insist they cannot do anything about it even though they're in full control of your account. It took me two weeks with short and single responses during this period to get nowhere so basically I purchased two copies for cryptic responses so I still can't use either version nor can I get a refund because of their slow responses. Being forced through an outside source is a major flaw that puts this corporation in control which I won't be doing again with any other purchases. Avoid Rockstar purchases at all costs. The story mode was terrible boring with a bunch of FMV cutscene filler. I got it for online to play with someone else but there really isn't anything to do there some 'races' that are like playing Hot Wheels for little kids point to point races run around and shoot eachother for no reason mode 'heists' that feel as though you're accomplishing nothing transform races another kid mode basically. The only part of the online experience that is eye catching is being able to drive around together which gets old really fast being that you can go into a select number of places marked on the map and the others are all like those little plastic car toysets from the '80s store fronts with stickers on the front to tell you what they are with no interior. They've really made no improvements over the last.... 5 6 years? And the game still sucks.2/10. Even their radio humor has dwindled to the point of just being annoying. This game is basically a money grab that's been going on for years push out 'new content' that isn't really new same old just to keep that price tag up to $60 and try to entice users to buy their useless money content.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-19,0,0,556,False,Not Recommended,This was IMO one of the most dissapointing games ever even when It got first released 4 years ago. The Story was short boring uninteresting and the map was also lazy designed with like 90% of the land that is not city being an empty uninteresting landscape of hills. Online... Ohhhhhh Online. Online was good at the start of the game they tried to do a story and the payouts were very good so you could afford almost everything by just playing the game. Because Rockstar Games and T2 are now even more greedy than EA new content is locked behind new stupid paywalls that they add every update now though they could have implemented them in an earlier Paywall (Paywalls are Bunkers MC Clubs and other Bases etc.) The Payouts you get in Heists and Business Grinds that take like 3 4 hours are NOT EVEN CLOSE enough to buy 1 new vehicle. The more business and properties you buy the more your DAILY rent increases. This means If you have a Bunker and a couple of apartments for example you have to pay 20k a DAY ! Rockstar just makes content expensive as possbile and Payouts low as possible so you have to buy Shark Cards. My last thing that I can mention right now is that this game is a nightmare to play because of the optimization. I have a GTX 970 and im playing at lowest and my FPS are like 30 40 FPS. Especially in the Offices during day the FPS is about 20 30. Absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. Do not buy this game. Its gone to and it a middle finger to its Franchise.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-06-30,0,0,99,False,Recommended,"OK lets break this down. Check me out talking like i'm somewhat important in your life or the gaming industry. Fact its Grand Theft Auto. That alone is a name that means something in our universe but people want to turn their backs on the game that gave us so much freedom we get bored with it. The very game that has stood against the monstrous wave of people against it. They've protected our gaming freedom i get that shark cards people off but they aren't EA or Konami. I know i'm defending an ""evil"" with 2 other ""evils"". Remember GTA 5 almost got tanked by schools and the goverment? They made it so cops come after you for the smallest thing even to the point its annoying. Even if you hit a gang member cops come. We still got the game though. The biggest problem to date on this game is HACKERS. People who in my opinion are so down about themselves they set out to ruin the exprience of the game. It's like the darkside of gaming and it sucks. Thats the main problem I'VE seen. See what i did there so no one could be like ""ummm excuse me i've had this problem this problem and this problem."" So buy the game if you like GTA don't buy the game if you don't like GTA (or have the money its not cheap.) This is the part where i plug in some nonsense about ""like my reviews? then follow my curator page."" NO i'm just fat dude sitting at his computer who wants to take the aggro out of the gaming world and focus it on being a gamer not being a critic over every little thing.

It feels like almost every free update you have to spend money on something that gives you ingame money to even buy most of the cool things they add. If you dont want to buy ingame money then have fun grinding missions heists for about 2 hours to be able to just afford a new car or something that allows you to do something else Air hanger or Bunker .

It has beautiful graphics great gameplay so much replayability and humor that will keep you interested the whole time.As for online yes the servers can be janky but I personally love it. I love the interaction (though most of the time it's annoying). For me that's what I find is missing in a lot of games that online interaction with other players. I've become spoiled with how many there are now.But bottom line GTA V is a great game that will give you at LEAST 50 hours of gameplay (but let's be honest that's probably more like 100 hours) between the single player storymode and online.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-15,0,0,138,False,Not Recommended,This is a great game with a terrible multiplayer that's filled with microtransactions. Yes a AAA full priced game with microtransactions thanks to that multiplayer is a grind dull long painful grind. I waited before buying this game for a long time about a year because I wanted to wait for single player DLC... that never came. Game never really dropped the price all that much by that I mean not at all. Modding kept the game alive. Of course with microtransactions modding wasn't allowed in multiplayer something that would make the mode fun but given that taxi missions in vanilla single player are more fun than multiplayer with mods we all had a blast. Now Take Two Interactive and Rockstar Games want to kill mods. All of them. Mods that make this game alive years after release. I cannot and will not recommend supporting companies who aren't consumer friendly companies that treat people giving them money like Pirate this game if you have to it's really good but don't buy it. Don't give them your money.EDIT // So Rockstar released a statement... Let's see Take Two s actions were not specifically targeting single player mods. Unfortunately OpenIV enables recent malicious mods that allow harassment of players and interfere with the GTA Online experience for everybody. We are working to figure out how we can continue to support the creative community without negatively impacting our players. In the first sentence you distance yourself from Take Two. Nice. Unfortunately Rockstar is a part of Take Two Interactive so either it's a case of left hand not knowilng who's being kicked in the balls by the left foot or... you think we're going to forget that you are Take Two as well. Let's say that OpenIV does have a hole let's say that it is the truth... WHY WON'T YOU WORK WITH THE MODDERS TO FIX IT!? OpenIV was made specifically for single player it wouldn't even allow to go online so that's hard to believe but since you like to support the creative community so much why didn't you said anything to them BEFORE bringing up a lawsuit? Modders aren't a malicious force... For 's sake half if not more of Valve games started out as mods! Besides if you gave a dead dog's of a damn about Online then you'd remove microtransactions from the game. Or made Online a standalone free to play game...EDIT #2 // OpenIV is back. Multiplayer still sucks no single player DLC Liberty City WON'T be modded into GTA V. Still a negative review.,Grand Theft Auto V

Mainly China hackers who loves to with people. Inconsiderate bully the weak and play king in the server. basically s your whole day up. Please kick them out of the server or leave to find a new one. No point arguing with China hackers who only type boxes in the chat. im not saying all china people are hackers but most of them are and they are ing cancer. attitude is and they only know how to flex their superiority in the server.

The reason behind the recent OpenIV torm is beyond me The tool does not allow you to cheat online in fact openiv.asi will shutdown your game if you ever try to go online with with openiv.asi installed. They targeted a harmless singleplayer file modding tool while doing nothing about all those memory hacking trainers kids use to cheat online.OpenIV literally saved this game for me because I can't stand this game's vehicle handling it's just so arcady and unrealistic. OpenIV allowed me to make my own more natural and realistic handling file and put it into the game so I can play it without wanting to puke.If they don't reverse this decision I will stick with version 1032 the last moddable version and play it till I die.

The solo is nothing but a masterpiece but the online part which is the main reason people play this game nowadays must really and sincerely be one of the worst I've ever played. Just look at all the other reviews saying the same thing !Endless after endless loading screens game filled with cheaters missions and world riddled with bugs. It's the bottom line of fun you spend your time driving around going from point A to B and often restarting because of bugs. And don't start me on other players ruining even further the game.A shame a real shame.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-17,0,0,257,False,Not Recommended,Ok I'm not normally the guy to leave bad reviews on a game that I enjoy just because of some stupid political but OpenIV actually kind of hurt. ive never used it in GTA5 because i mostly play online and yer not supposed to mod the online stuff. but on GTAIV i used to use that tool all the time to mod out all the textures in my game and let nikos car be a bugatti and all the taxi's where CTS's and so on. that tool was an amazing way to customize your GTA experienc and make it lest of the same old tired gangster story that it actually is and mor of a custom fun experience. killing this tool hurts more than just angry gamers like me that liked to have fun ing wiht littel things theres an entire youtube community dedicated to messing around with stuff in GTA there are numerous mods that not only improve gameplay but also imporve the overall look of the game (hd texture mods) and there are several custom events that cant be done without mods youve killed that off rockstar. youve turned your backs on a large percentage of your players and im not cool with that. heres the deal I get why you did it you where lazy and didnt bother locking down the multiplayer code properly and openIV is able to edit it. hows about instead of censoring people you increase the security on the multiplayer code and fix it so that open IV cant make changes to it anymore or better yet hows abouot you work with the developers of the tool and use what theyve done to make steam workshop mods for the game that way you have more control over where they are running. but i digress you as a dev are lazy and just want those shark cards. and Im done at this point i cant support any further development on any franchise you make untill you fix this up of yours.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-08-28,0,0,2353,False,Not Recommended,"If you want to spend hours feeling frustrated GTAO is the game for you. Never have I wanted to enjoy a game so much yet could not because of the sheer ""maldesign"" of it. Glitchy buggy cumbersome full of modders and to top it all off Rockstar Games leaves MUCH to be desired when it comes to gaming support. Something goes wrong in the game and you need help? Forget it. You get a robo ""copy and paste"" automated response from them. ""Pester"" them too much and they block you from their support page. Game wise loading screens can sometimes last up to 5 minutes or will just lag out entirely and drop you back into single player. Glitches/bugs never get fixed in a timely manner. Everything in the game is insanely expensive and it takes forever to make money (their way of trying to force you to buy in game currency with real life funds). Also due to poor design there is no way to keep modders at bay so it is highly likely that hours upon hours of your time making money in the game will be ruined by someone with a simple mod menu. Every day in public sessions I encounter modders and they make it impossible to get anything done. Most recently Rockstar has conducted a ""money sweep"" removing funds from peoples' accounts for no reason even those who have never received modded money or did but already had the modded money removed in previous sweeps. Some people have had millions upon millions of dollars legitimately garnered through thousands of hours of gameplay taken away by Rockstar. Others yet have had in game money they bought with real life currency wiped as well. As of yet Rockstar has offered no real explanation or given any of the funds back. At the very least GTAO should be boycotted but I'm in agreement with the people who are saying that Rockstar Games should be reported to the BBB. Until they design a better online game and take some lessons from other major MMO's support teams I'm laying low on this game and sticking to a game that provides a more all around rewarding experience.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-09-14,0,0,449,False,Recommended,to be honest i revisted this review cause i know something just aint right. well there are lots of things that are wrong but lets start with what bothered me and so also what i enjoyed of . when i was just a kid i used to mod the first title all by my self. no one instructed me on how to do it i was just looking through the files and i explorer what each code means and i made a notbook list of all codes and so i could change stuff in game. yeah i'm talking about the first ever title of GTA. i read the news now days and i know this game delivered so many hours of fun through all of my childhood. it was there for me even though i never purchased it as a kid. most of us i think the majority were downloading it through pirate websites. now its wasn't really just the first the seconde nor any other sequal it was most of them. ofc this doesnt mean rockstar didn't made any money at all but still it means they didnt gained all that they could have.so i got this game as many of you i think somewhere at the first months after it was realesed and tell you the truth i was disappointed !!! i hate the fact this game was so big that even my connection would have it self when start loading. i have seen the game saints raw the 3rd and i hoped rockstar could have use this technology for their benefit. entering missions was absoulte madness i cold wait 30 to 45 maybe more minutes to start a mission and within the first 2 attempts someone was giving up and left us all to cry for another 45 minutes. considering not all of us kids with 8 hours spare time at a day cycle this was simply stupid. one of the biggest issues was the progress and so in different days i came to play i was starting the game and i had to start with the single player first mission in order to be able to play the multiplayer. rockstar failed to purchase a 20 MB on steam servers in order to deliver us an easy game saving system. its now 19/6/2017 and few weeks ago i was about to start play gta after long time not playing . i got a message saying i cant go in multiplayer cause of messing around with the game files and folders. now 60 + gigs its not a easy task for someone who on daily basis playing multiplayer games and with only about 10 mb speed connection that was seen impossible. yeah yeah yeah.... despite all i still think this game is awesome and at the most part delivered a great expiriance. i know it was worth the 59.99 $ i spent on it. this game still deliver free updated and content even 2 years ++ after. people made so many mods and it have been even much more fun as more mods were intoduced. mods gave you freedom of money in game you could enjoy stuff that other than climbing the ladder you couldnt achive. i just want you guys take in consideration the fact that this game make no money at all from micro trancitions. not that people dont buy it but not many to make it worth to keep maintaing a game 2++ years after it published. i know that ps4 and xbox owners probably are the real income for this game though i know that pc users were here first and supported this game since it born. pc users were left behind for over a year or 2 if i recall corectly. me myself i was ruined when i found out i need to wait . i know that many like me were felt betrayed . anyhow. this is all i wanted to write with the hope that someone at rockstar will take this info and actually do something about it if there is something to do at all. i like this game and thank you rockstar for hours of gaming days of gaming and years of gaming. you are great and you deserve to be treated well. i dont care what people say i know there are devs there who need to put a food on the table and feed their kids and pay for educating them and so on.... you delivered the most out of those 59.99 $ and after this i suggest you guys start make changes of your own to this game. shut down the mod if needed as long that you deliver us with good DLC's or keep it open and let fans create what they want . for all i know is that nothing is for free and you need to keep this studio alive. sorry for grammar and spelling sending love from israel ! &lt 3,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-02,0,0,234,False,Recommended,For me Grand Theft Auto V s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time whilst driving around in an off road buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. Typical! one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well realised world and tells a story that s gripping thrilling and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and there s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent wickedly comic and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary post economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire it rips into the Millennial generation celebrities the far right the far left the middle class the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar s sharp tongue including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first person shooter called Righteous Slaughter ( Rated PG pretty much the same as the last game. ) It s not exactly subtle he literally has the word Entitled tattooed on his neck and the in game radio and TV s outright takes don t leave much to the imagination but it is often extremely funny and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto s San Andreas is a fantasy but the things it satirises greed corruption hypocrisy the abuse of power are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.Grand Theft Auto V s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains hijack military aircraft and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people albeit extraordinarily f***ed up people.Michael is a retired con man in his 40s filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son air headed daughter serially unfaithful wife and very expensive therapist all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang banger stereotype even as he s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there s Trevor a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed up childhood.The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three and it s a credit to GTA V s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times they re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.This three character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto s personality. In doing so it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here many of Michael s missions revolve around his family and his past Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills Franklin can to slow time while driving for example which gives them a unique touch. Narratively it s effective even off mission I found myself playing in character acting like a mid life crisis guy with anger issues as Michael a thrill seeker as Franklin and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car because I felt like that s what he d want.Trevor feels a like a bit of a get out of jail free card for Rockstar providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get out clauses go though it s pretty effective and Trevor s over the top missions are some of GTA V s action packed highlights. It s a successful way of solving a problem that s prevalent in open world games the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both masterfully allowing neither to undermine the other.The actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their individual lives and habits fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the San Andreas map closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him or speeding along the motorway blasting 80s hits or having a cigarette at the golf club Franklin might be walking out of a strip club munching a bag of snacks at home or arguing with his ex girlfriend there s a good chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or on one memorable occasion drunk in a stolen police helicopter.It could be nearly anything because there is a bewildering multiplicity of things to do in the new San Andreas tennis yoga hiking racing on sea and on land flying planes golfing cycling diving hunting and more. The missions are an able guide to both San Andreas locations and its activities touring you around the map and whetting your appetite for independent exploration of it all. The way that we re introduced to San Andreas never feels artificial the map is completely open from the start for example which contributes to the impression that it s a real place somewhere you can get to know. If GTA IV s Liberty City feels like a living city San Andreas feels like a living world. I saw people walking their dogs along the beach in the country as I jet skied past arguing on the street outside a cinema in Los Santos and camped with tents and everything +rep,Grand Theft Auto V

And the servers have bad ping and are comeplete filled with hackers that blow you up or spawn hydra jets (that last one was actually pretty fun).

No. Everything on the side was just like a cherry on top of a well crafted main story.Was the ending climactic? Oh absolutely!And is online any good? Even a few years later? You bet your it is.The game is charming in a lot of ways. During the first mission you are being thrown in the center of the action. Shooting alarms explosions... Your typical action share. But it ends quickly and slows down letting you take the role of Franklin. And let me tell you something... ""Maybe if you get rid of this yee yee haircut..."" You know what I am talking about. Franklin is nothing special. Just a guy who had rough upbringing and uses every opportunity to push through. And the story being built around it is awesome. Just as well as around Michael and Trevor (who I don't know what people like for. He's an all the way through). Where was I going with this? I don't know.

2017-07-05,0,0,265,False,Not Recommended,Story is boring and uninteresting. They went for a new style thats much different from GTA IV including playing as 3 characters instead of one but in my opinion this was a mistake. It doesn't allow you to connect with the people you play as or really feel that they are in any kind of danger. You don't have as much freedom as you did in GTA IV neither do you have similar mechanics and physics. The game plays more as a cartoon where as GTA IV felt realistic. Online is nothing but a mess and will be an awful experience to anyone just buying the game. The developers made Online more of a Pay 2 Win type where unless you drop hundreds of dollars on the game youre gonna be working for a solid week grinding boring game modes to get a single thing you may have had your eye on and in the end it wouldnt have been worth it. The developers are also attempting to remove all mod support for the game entirely so if you wanted this game for that I would recommend taking your money elsewhere. You can easily find hundreds of games on Steam alone that are far better than this pile of garbage.,Grand Theft Auto V

I have not tried to modify the game like Skyrim yet but I can see that this game is perfect for it. I love the concepts of switching through characters who are in different life situations to get their experience as well as the character creation on GTA Online. Once you get this game you do not really need another. One down side is that it holds up 63 gig of space on the SDD and the graphics are demanding even for high end cards like GTX 770+.

Sure some items could be cheaper the textures better optimized and the online connection more stable and the loading times is shorter. But after taking into account you can solve all of this with some investment (better PC faster Internet if you must buy everything shark cards) then practically no game can match GTA's story soundtrack map realism and the sheer variety of things you can do both in story mode and especially online. A must buy for everybody with the time money(23 in sales) and simply appreciation for a high quality very diverse and fun videogame.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-01-11,0,0,143,False,Recommended,So after so many years GTA V is still a game that I play as if it's a new game. The game has been Amazing since ps3/Xbox360 and it just gets better and better. Owning it for ps3 and ps4 wasn't enough and I had to get it on Pc too. Yes a lot of the things ingame require A TON of grinding which you can skip with some micro transactions but from my experience it's not the hardest to grind for something you really want ingame. Most are here for the Online part of the game but if you aren't or even if you are the Single Player is worth playing and more than once too and your choice of First or Third person. New content gets frequently released for online and the game doesn't feel abandoned even by the slightest.If you wanna mess around with friends there are tons of things to do keep your friends close and your enemies closer and if you don't have any friends Trevor will help you out XD,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-01,0,0,425,False,Recommended,"Alright yeah I'll come clean.I played this game for a long time since about 2014 and just about the entire time I was a modder in online. It was on and off because between every update it would be a bit before a new working menu came out but I'll say this my wallet stayed fat. I liked it. I was good at it. I was alive.Then earlier today I got an email that I had been permanently banned lol.But that's it. That's what's supposed to happen. That's just the path of playing this game go into online get a menu around with it subtly enough that Rockstar doesn't catch you for as long as you can and when they do that's it. Game over. Good ending. The longer you last is the better the ending and my ending was great. The bad ending is wasting ungodly amounts of time and/or money to try and get the same things and so much less and not getting banned. At least getting banned gives you the affirmation of knowing you cheated some sort of system for some amount of time.But that doesn't mean online isn't fun. It is fun when you have power. But getting power isn't worth it if it means doing it legit. No one wants to do something where the reward isn't worth the effort/price. The in game currency is at its best deal $8 000 000 for $100 real life dollars. That's nothing. That isn't You can't get in this game for $8 000 000. Never buy Shark cards please for the love of God.Modding gives you the same power for nothing. You get all of the best parts of the game (driving nice cars flying kickass planes owning a nightclub killing twelve year olds with an orbitial cannon having money in fifteen digits) but now instead of the meager satisfaction of knowing you had to work 6 8 hours to make the money to buy one car you now have the mighty conniving satisfaction of having broken the rules and stood up to Rockstar and whatever and have a warehouse full of militarized sports cars to show for it. That's why I did it that's why anyone does it because the only alternative is to a) earn your cash legit (haha no) or b) not the play the game at all.But that doesn't make the game unfair either. Rockstar can design their game however the hell they want and if they're designing games for people that enjoy commitng countless hours of labor to earn meager rewards then so be it. And if you read that statement and think ""that sounds ing stupid"" then the game isn't for you. Don't buy it don't play it whatever. It's your time and money no one is gonna make you play gta online. But if you play the game and break their rules you can't be surprised when you get banned.A lot of people tend to complain about getting banned for no reason and that they've never modded in their life and I find that hard to believe because only an absolute imbecil would play the online for this game without modding. Seriously if not for the fact that making money takes a stupid amount of time on the same missions and jobs then for the fact that there will always be people trying to kill you. Seriously if you want to play gta online and you aren't willing to take the risk of getting a mod menu and spawning in some cash just don't play it at all it's not worth it to you.And if you really did get banned for nothing then it was probably out of pity for being stupid enough to play online legit and they just wanted to take that chance away from you before you wasted any more of your time. And to that end it was probably for the better.P.S. For adding cash (in moderation of course) I personally reccomend Doggo menu or Teteus. It's also got some nifty stuff like vehicle spawners and whatever but it's an injection so be careful. But if you just want a reliable player/vehicle god mode 7r14ngl3 has never let me down. This advice may seem moot coming from someone who got caught but it did take them four years to do it so you choose.Me I'm done. I beat the game and I won. I won when I downloaded my first menu and I kept winning for a long time and that winning was fun. I got my money's worth our of this game and with a little care so can you so I give it my reccomendation.",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-07-21,0,0,63,False,Recommended,Very nice and engaging story mode one that doesnt take itself too seriously but still engages you. Defintely a game to play if you wanna just unwind from playing Dark Souls or some Online is pretty bad though. Load times take forever (both on the ps3 and pc that I own much better on pc though thankfully) servers time out too often like 50% of the time I get kicked out for some t reason and then I have to load again. If you get past these flaws however the online mode gets very additive. There's no better feeling tha buying a luxury with your hard earned (illegal) money after 2 3 days of hard grinding on heists. Communty maps really make the Online gameplay feel complete and enhanced. THe racing imo is more fun than entire racing games such as Gran Turismo (albeit less realistic) and the community from my experience at least has been fairly nice and friendly and most importantly COMPETENT! Most annoying thing about the ps3 version is how incompetent heist members usually are and pc seems to not have the same problem.Overall if you have a good enough internet connection and are willing to put up with the admittedly annoying and extremely flawed loading times and connectivity issues this game is very much worth it!,Grand Theft Auto V

Unfortunately those people are part of the game and you can't easily avoid them in multiplayer. If you're fine with fighting against these people with flying cars and whatnot then good for you. Maybe you could even waste tons of cash to be one. But either way the multiplayer community is not very nice so enter at your own risk.,Grand Theft Auto V

Although if you have friends to grind that money with it may be worth the work in the end.8/10 (sometimes) the best pastime with friends. If you have the money for this game just use it for something else unless you have friends who really want to play this game with you!EDIT Oppressor MKII was NOT a healthy addition to the game. The Oppressor was already one of the hardest things to kill in the game and now you can get a countermeasure for missiles and infinite flight while moving faster than the speed of sound. Only buy GTA V if you are prepared to grind money with even more flying motorcycles harassing you in the process.Oh and also be prepared for an orbital strike destroying your cargo.

2017-12-23,0,0,583,False,Not Recommended,"GTA online whilst once an interesting and fun new idea... Is now an unambiguously cynical pile of rubbish.A griefers paradise where the rich/lifeless pay/grind their way to the biggest and best toys and proceed to ruin any fun anyone else might be having. Make no mistake this is a toxic community and it makes perfect sense why it would be when R* are so happy to sell the tools to make it so.The updates have long since ceased enriching the experience. New content is incredibly lazily produced and is basically designed to sell you shark cards. People like to argue that you can easily ignore this new content but if you don't buy it you get spammed with messages and phonecalls from in game characters reminding you that you haven't ponied up for it yet. Almost makes you miss the days where they were just pestering you to play a bowling mini game and go see ""big American s"". This is a great way to crash a plane/die in a gunfight too since your controls get hijacked until you've dealt with the phonecall in one way or another.The glory days were when the heists were just out but there's only a handful of those and they do get old (cool as they are...).The singleplayer is pretty good but you probably knew that. This is GTA 5 we're talking about afterall... It's bigger than Jesus at this point. I only really write this to communicate the frustration. GTA online was a pretty good thing with a lot of promise and it's been thoroughly thoroughly... thoroughly buggered senseless by the forces of unashamed greed.They killed the magic. It turns out when you do that it makes it far more obvious what the shortcomings are in the driving the shooting and the godawful community.If you have a time machine and can go back a couple of years this is recommendable.

May you be warned though this game is addictive with myself racking up around 3k hours on console.

Begginers will have trouble with the multiplayer which is kinda messy. Of course it is one of the best games for a long time but Rockstar could do much more with resources that other companies miss.

Every single multiplayer lobby is filled to the brim with modders almost without fail. So you want to join a game and do some gunrunning with the boys? Well prepare to have your cargo destroyed from miles away by a flaming exploding blimp spawning on top of you because modders are either not punished or aren't detected well enough.

2018-06-09,0,0,169,False,Not Recommended,"First and foremost its expected that GTA has a good singleplayer campaign and they don't disappoint there. With 3 main characters I thought it could get pretty unorganized but the devs did an excellent job keeping the campaign cohesive between all three characters and giving them each their own unique feel. One is example is they each get their own side missions and contribute their efforts to the main story. Driving/Combat/Thrills are all there and brilliant. An important note In GTA 4 there was a ""tunneling effect"" when driving that has been removed. I thought It added an interesting element to take into account when driving at high speeds but it was a bit overboard on the effect so I'm kind of glad they got rid of it. I don't think it would've worked well enough in this iteration. An FPS mode was added in a later patch honestly was a bit disappointed by its implementation why? Well for one the interiors of the vehicles look pretty garbage hardly any attention was made to them and there's nothing really to interact with inside your car so its pretty pointless in that aspect. I guess if you like racing and shooting in fpv then its nice to have. The one thing I really really missed was being able to buy property in GTA 4 and that's back for GTA 5. But its almost like an afterthought in the singleplayer sure you can buy your garages and it'll save your vehicles but when you buy businesses you can't go inside them they cost a rediculous amount like $150 million or whatever for a beat up old theatre. The sad part is that after you finish the story you don't even get enough money to buy a good portion of commercial stuff. They do offer a bit of content in free mode but it gets stale and highly repetitive after only a couple missions. Helipads and Docks are now available to buy in GTA5 so if you have helicopters and boats you can store them there. Overrall I kind of enjoyed the story in GTA 4 a bit more than in GTA5 you could feel your progression in a very real way you started from the bottom and slowly got better and better the map started to open up more and you could meet new people. The relationship system was equal parts interesting and annoying though it didn't feel tacky. Trying to do stuff with contacts in GTA 5 feels tacky they almost never pick up when you call them and they never want to do anything. If you're lucky you may discover a few new missions.As for GTA online gameplay well that part surprised me a bit I don't think I've ever played in a multiplayer where elements and characters from the singleplayer carried over to the multiplayer space as much as it does in GTA 5. Sure its a supporting actor running the show but its a nice change to see cutscenes missions and meaningful content to do in GTA online. Note Trevor does make appearances. The quality and quantity of customization is really good though in an odd move they made a seperate specialty car shop (not the odd part) that is firstly blocked by an ingame paywall so before they even touch your car you have to pay them and then once you do the customization options cost such a significant enough amount that its almost not even worth it. The DLC thats been added to the online game has introduced some cool content but it too gets pretty repetitive. The sad part is is that what the devs imagined as the most fun part of this content is also what ruins the experience. Basically you have to do a job that almost always involves a bit of transporting and its the rest of the players in the lobby's choice to stop you or make it incredibly difficult that the payout isn't even worth it. Sounds kind of fun right? Well it sort of can be with a group of friends. The problem is for solo players or even groups for that matter are at a serious disadvantage from the beginning. Why? Well for one the opposing side gets access to some seriously OP vehicles and tools (to be fair so does the transporters if you have enough buddies). I'm talking wiping you in one shot type of OP traditional weapons aren't really that good enough OP must have equalivalent type of vehicle to counter it OP. Or there is absolutely no counter type of OP. Everything before that last one alludes to some powerful favorite vehicles of the wealthy. Like a Delorean that can shoot missles and take off and land and also dodge homing rockets with ease or there's the very similiar motorcycle version that seems faster. Apache helicopters attack jets the batmobile etc. But one thing you can't stop no matter what you do is the Orbital Cannon. This sucker shoots down a beam that pretty much instantly wipes whoever and whatever is in its target radius and there is not one godd*mn thing you can do. There are limitations in place like it costs $1 million each shot and it has a long cooldown after you use it. One counter would be maybe to send out a decoy and hope the aggressor takes the bait but if your facing say a lobby that all have access to the weapon then there really is no counter. As you'd expect this entire system opens the game up to a heavy amount of griefing. Hacking is also rampant with groups of people embracing god mode or spawning random obstacles that basically make the mission or free mode unplayable. Below I'll address actually getting into an online session.Loading....(20 mins later)No seriously if your an average joe with an outdated processor and still using a hard drive expect to have enough free time to get a haircut (don't even both setting up an appointment the extra 10 min wait is well worth it) get that done come back and THEN GTA Online MAY HAVE loaded if it didn't get some random error teleporting you back to the main screen or reinstancing you into Singleplayer. I mean honestly this game has one of the worst if not THE worst loading screen I've ever seen slightly ahead of Skyrim on 3rd Generation consoles (PS3/Xbox 360). Because at least with Skyrim it would load decent enough that some of the longest loading screens would still be a surprise. For a game with a budget reaching over $250 million (the highest ever for a video game and topping most hollywood film budgets) that's a huge disappointment. I expect more out of the developer to optimize their game. To their credit the game as a whole is well optimized but the online loading screens are horrendous. And hey if it's just a matter of not having enough time to get it addressed by the release date then yeah I'm willing to give you some leeway if you at least say your working on it. I mean surely after the horrendous launch issues I could understand if it would be on the backburner till that was cleaned up but even now 3 years past release and yet still no fix. It's unacceptable. Money and Time clearly weren't the issues with the game grossing over $6 billion in revenue (most ever for a media form). Its just a simple case of Rockstar the developer and Take Two Interactive the publisher (TakeTwo owns Rockstar Games and its their publicly traded parent company) taking their cash cow and running. That's not a tactic I support so I'll be sure to remember that when I consider buying the next installment if there will be one or a TakeTwo game in general.Final Thoughts If your looking for a game with a solid campaign and a trolley multiplayer then GTA 5 is your game. Personally for me I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this game. There is classic GTA fun there but its overhyped.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-03-28,0,0,185,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Now let me be 100% honest This game is fun. Amazingly fun. If you play with your friends they're gonna shoot your face off with a shotgun and two seconds later you'll bomb them to the moon with a grenade. You're going to drive straight into them and ram them off of the road only to realize that they sticky bombed your car and you're going to spend the rest of the day not knowing if you should get them back or apologize. The story mode... let's be real nobody cares about the story. There's 2 white guys and a black guy who steals cars and they work for the FIB (FBI) and some stuff happens. But the online mode is where its at.In the online mode 70% of the game is epic dumb fun and 30% of the game is annoying filler garbage.Online forces you to repeatedly grind out missions or heist to buy apartments motorcycle clubs garages and cars everything requires you to have money that is very very tedious to gain. Rockstar who's the company that made and maintains the game (obviously) removes every way to easily gain money so that they can earn more IRL $ by purchasing shark cards which give you GTA currency.As a word of advice don't buy shark cards.Shark cards seem okay but $60 for a couple millions in a game that already costs $60 is NOT a good idea especially if it isn't DLC.Speaking of DLC all of it is free and after grinding out that $$$ though the game is very satisfying. At one point in the online DLC heists you have to jack a flying car to take down an organization that'll blow the world into smithereens and you have to go underwater in a car that transforms into a submarine to get information from Russians. This creativity and fun that Rockstar had gives the game its life and is debatable whether or not its worth the hours put into grinding. But IMO it is worth it.3/5 A fun little game to play with your friends for countless hours of enjoyment.Edit gremmer suk,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-12-06,0,0,332,False,Not Recommended,"If ever a game deserved some sort of middle ""I kinda liked some of this game but other parts not so much"" sideways thumb rating on Steam it's this one.The single player portion of the game is fantastic. The online portion (once you beat the heists) is not. Once the heists are done online gets to be a boring repetitive multiplayer mode that just feels dead. The online game world is devoid of most of the features that make the single player game more lively.Single player has animals better NPC interactions (random fights drag races etc..) the missions are more enjoyable and the world itself just feels more alive. Multiplayer has no animals you can't really interact with the NPCs (your character will be a mute no matter which gender you pick) the missions and heists (while fun the first couple times you do them) get old fast and there's just this overall feeling that there is less in the online world to make it interactive.Saint's Row 2 came out in 2008. That's EIGHT years ago and you can make a character with a choice of one of three voices per gender in that game. Even Bethesda recognized that the cliche of the player protaganist being mute was old and gave your character a voice in Fallout 4. The online character creation in this game is lacking SEVERELY lacking in the ONE thing character creation in any game should have CUSTOMIZATION.Rockstar claims that some of the elements of single player were removed from multiplayer because there would be a strain on their servers. What is more likely to be true is that the multiplayer enviroments were dumbed down because of console limitations. Consoles would not have been able to handle multiple players playing fetch with dogs shooting mountain lions or swimming with sharks. PCs could have but because consoles can't PCs get what could have been a fun feature removed.Once you beat the heists and enough missions to see how repetitive they are you will get bored. Sure there is golf tennis darts and arm wrestling. Like everything else they are fun at first and then not so fun after. There's always shopping in one of the six types of shops. Again gets old fast. Rockstar took an engaging single player world and dumbed it down for its online model and hoped nobody would notice. People have though.The single player has memorable characters amazing city and rural enviroments that feel alive (thanks to animals FFS the online world has no BIRDS either) and missions that are fun to play. The online component has a few heists that are fun to play with your three other friends and a few PvP events if you're into that (and lots of opportunities to grief other players if you're into that). Outside of being killed by a pink RPG wielding player in his underwear and an anime mask the online world around you will feel much more lifeless thoughMy advice? Buy it. On sale only. Never pay full price for a game where 50% of it will get boring much more quickly than the other 50% of it.EDIT Oh right forgot to mention the microtransactions in multiplayer. If you hate those like most normal people you'll hate them here too. Most items in MP have had their prices jacked up and since missions and heists don't pay out much you'll either be saving money for a long time or giving Rockstar/Take 2 even more money to buy their in game money. Take 2/2K loves microtransactions in their full price games. My advice still stands don't pay full price for this one. It's a horrible business practice.",Grand Theft Auto V

2015-07-21,0,0,405,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V Well this was definetely a long awaited one for me originally I played GTA V on console and I was thrilled by it! it was such a great open and beautiful game but like ANY game it has it's flaws and I'm going to talk through them enjoy!Well one of the main things that almost discouraged me into not pre ordering was the port when I played GTA 4 I must admit the porting was absoloutely devastating and I couldn't drive anywhere without atleast 40 buildings going invisible... but y'know what? the port on this game is absoloutely brilliant the reason being was because the Max Payne team handled the port GTA 4's port was actually ported by the Rockstar GTA Team (that's why it was so bad no offence) on console I was 100% one of those guys who would just love to role play by myself and roll around in a cheap tuned car instead of a brash chrome bugatti veyron with pink neons wearing a pink suit and a bright green top hat like a lot of players I like realism and if you do then this game is great for that the story mode is great and I never found a single glitch the story line was dynamic exciting and awesome! but... the length I completed the whole main questline in around 2 days GTA 4 took me a week I was disapointed at first but I gave Online and other aspects to the game more chance to improve me lets talk about that huh?The Grand Theft Auto V Online experience for me was... well great! but at the same time upsetting.Why? well I'd love to kinda roleplay and do my own thing wheras I would be very much attacked by anyone on the street I just wanted to make friends man! but I guarrantee you if you go up to 5 people and honk your horn atleast 1 will shoot you take your car and give you the finger... pretty rude huh?races and activites are great but the player customization needs more diversity.Online is great but you need to be ready to be attacked by random guys and that kids is why you always carry your automatic rifle grenades RPG's pistols SMG's snipers and lets not forget fireworks launchers!Anyway I'd give the online experience a 6.5 / 10 and that is high for my reviews.I'd give the story mode experience a 7 / 10 the 3 that was dropped was mainly the length.Now lets move on the game mechanics... kinda... umm yeah. Well basically if you want to play this game DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT have a bad computer now personally I played this on an AMD FX 4350 a mid / high range processor but not the best I would highly recommend 4096MB GDDR5 Space and a 6 8 core processor later I played on an AMD FX 8350 and It was a lot better here's my chart for the FPS I got.low 140medium 100high 80very high 65 70ultra 50 60 I have a mid / high range system but if you want the Grand Theft Auto experience Make sure you have a high powered PC I would recommend the GTX 970 4GB so you can run ultra textures with no lag In terms of processors I recommend the i7 4770k or the AMD FX 8350.Anyway the whole game hits a solid 7 / 10 VERY HIGH IN MY BOOKS!i'd recommend this but don't get this on your minecraft laptop and do not get this game if you have severe anger issues.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-10-13,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,"I really tried to like GTA V. I tried my hardest. At the moment my friend and I are stuck failing to complete a mission online due to crashes and crazy AI. I spent 3 days diagnosing CTDs and freezes with Rockstar support who eventually just had me reinstall .net 3.5 directX and the entire game and social club.The online is shockingly bad by any standards let alone that it's created by one of the richest game development studios on the planet. It took my friend and I 2 3 days just to figure out how to select the missions we want and even then there is a myriad of frustration and problems. When you complete a job the game gives you the choice between 5 randomly selected ""jobs"" (which could be just multiplayer deathmatches or races) or to go back to free mode. Why can't I select the next job from the list like I did the first job? You also receive straight up harrassing phone calls in game from NPCs telling you to buy property you can't afford and THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE THESE CALLS. They can call you in the middle of a gunfight disabling your ability to fire your gun. This has been complained about since 2015 and it's still in the game.The missions are a grindy slog. Setting the difficulty higher means enemies have preposterous amounts of HP sometimes taking 5 6 shots with the marksman rifle to kill and aimbot directly at your head the instant they have line of sight. Enemies also infinitely respawn in missions I've played often directly on top of you sometime headshotting you before they even materialize. Some missions also lack any sense of strategy as there is only one way to approach them (one path in one path out go into this tight corrodore and kill someone).Then there are the unskippable cutscenes. As if we don't have enough unforgivable t at this point why in the world are there so many unskippable cutscenes in online?! It's also relatively difficult to earn money early on especially since the missions that don't pay complete garbage require you to own property that costs $200k minimally. This creates a much larger barrier to entry than there should be as you complete missions which could take minutes or hours and award a pidling $10 20k.The single player is passable. Most of the characters are unlikable psychopaths but I guess that's standard for GTA at this point. Missions are pretty for the most part. The first heist (only one I've completed so far due to numerous crashes and freezes) was great. I wanted to be doing only those missions however it was immediately followed by a mission doing ing yoga with Michael's wife. What the is that Who wants to do yoga in a GTA game? right off.Overall GTA V is shockingly poorly made garbage. It seems impossible to me that a studio could spend $100mil designing something this ugly unfriendly to users prone to crashing and exploitative. GTA V is total .",Grand Theft Auto V

Still worth the 30 bucksOnline Get a rich to actually succeed.EDIT From today on I won't recommend the game anymore at least the ONLINE part. Here is why Shark Cards and artificial InflationIt's a MASSIVE CASH GRAB. If you haven't started like 2 years ago don't even try now.The Lazer (Jet) was recently made available for the personal collection in GTA Online. A DAY ONE VEHICLE for virtually 6.5 million ingame bucks. Thats 80$ in shark cards(!!!). And the jet doesn't even have ANY benefits compared to the one you can steal besides spawning it. It's a ing joke.Don't get me wrong I have yet to purchase any shark card but some folks apparently are. Shark card revenue was at around 700 Million Dollars by the End of 2016 A YEAR. Combined with an additional 10 million shipped GTAV copies since February it's a nice fat cash cow for Rockstar.And yet they aren't introducing any quality content like new Heists and keep to their cheap content because it works. But the players buying shark cards most likely don't know what they are getting into. The value of ingame money has steadily decreased since release due to inflation but they have not adjusted the money you get with shark cards.In the beginning you ""needed"" a Supercar for around 1mil and an appartment for around 500k to be able to enjoy the game in full. NOW you basically need 4 6 times the amount to get a glimpse of new content. That's a massive grindfest for new players At the moment you can do around 700k ingame bucks/hr with Hangar I/E CEO Hangar Bunker &amp MC. BUT it will need at least 2.5mil for Bunker and added up around 8 mil for startup costs. I let you do the math...Bugs Glitches &amp CheatersMoney glitches and bugs benefiting players are fixed in mere hrs/days.Gamebreaking bugs are just as it is and mostly never fixed.Nuff said.Griefers Cheaters &amp Drip FeedingPublic sessions are virtually unplayable if you plan on earning money. They implement predatory mechanics like several paywalls griefers rewards and public lobbies requirements for ""new"" updates that are no more than clones of Finance and Felony with more overpriced stuff boring unwanted and uninspired adversary modes and months and months of drip feeding. The anti cheat protection is still a joke and you will have cheater breaking the game in mostly any public session you join.No Single Player DLCThey also promised a single player DLC ages ago. Not gonna happen since it doesnt make money in the long run. RS and T2 is focused on maximizing their profits through adding cheap copy paste content and I seriously expect them to continue in RedDead and the next GTA as well. That's their business model one that disrespects consumers and fans of once upon a time a great franchise an epitome of sandbox genre games.The bottom lineIf you dont want a second day job to actually be able to afford anything STAY AWAY FROM ONLINE. Rockstar and Take Two are now as obnoxiously greedy as EA Activision and Ubisoft. And if you have established something in Online ask yourself when was the last time you actually had fun playing GTAO besides grinding for cash.Games should be meant to be fun not a massive grind and a second job",Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-18,0,0,178,False,Recommended,One of the most beautifully crafted games I have ever played. Everything from the physics to the single player storyline is amazing. Absolutely a work of art. So much attention to detail and so much to do.However. There is an issue with this amazing game. And it ultimately comes down to Rockstar. If you are expecting community ran servers and nice navigation of multiplayer lobbies you are going to be SEVERELY dissapointed. Rockstar not only leaves glaring balance issues with weapons and vehicles but also is very slow to fix multiplayer issues. They have sinced improved it (from release) however it still lacks many features that should be standard in a AAA multiplayer free roam game.Ultimately The game itself is a 9.5/10 but due to Rockstars greediness and laziness when developing the PC multiplayer I give GTA V an 7.5/10. Most other games given the terrible treatment that Rockstar gave GTAV would be a 5/10 but the absolute brilliance of the game itself outshines the terrible job Rockstar have done with it.,Grand Theft Auto V

Cops and Robbers for anyone who was familiar they should know what I am talking about. Let me start off by saying I just recently purchased this game. It took me a while because I didn't have a PC to run it so as soon as I upgraded this was my first purchase. I started it up and was impressed from the moment I started. They have done so much with this game it's production value is through the roof. There are so many things to do so many subtle nuances so many winks and nods. It's worth every penny. Some people won't like it. That's okay I've seen a ton of negative reviews and it got me worried that this might not be a good game. They were so wrong. The fun I've had playing this and discovering things is just through the roof. It's amazing. When you are running for your life or trying to make a getaway it gets the heart racing! That's just one of the many things that make this so worth while. It has replay value as well. I love it I enjoy it and I am super happy I purchased it. This game gets a million stars out of 5.

Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Oan you believe this is happening? I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you son. A perfect report card all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. You got lint on your fuzz. Ow! That's me! Wave to us! We'll be in row 118 000. Bye! Barry I told you stop flying in the house! Hey Adam. Hey Barry. Is that fuzz gel? A little. Special day graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. Hi Barry. Artie growing a mustache? Looks good. Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No I'm not going. Everybody knows sting someone you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. Well Adam today we are men. We are! Bee men. Amen! Hallelujah! Students faculty distinguished bees please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9 15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. Wonder what it'll be like? A little scary. Welcome to Honex a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you as a bee have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top secret formula is automatically color corrected scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! That girl was hot. She's my cousin! She is? Yes we're all cousins. Right. You're right. At Honex we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. What do you think he makes? Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement the Krelman. What does that do? Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job if it's done well means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees as a species haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But Adam how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. Hey those are Pollen Jocks! Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah but some don't come back. Hey Jocks! Hi Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! I wonder where they were. I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive flying who knows where doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. Oouple of Hive Harrys. Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat and with the other he was slapping me! Oh my! I never thought I'd knock him out.

You're going into honey. Our son the stirrer! You're gonna be a stirrer? No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

2016-10-25,0,0,273,False,Not Recommended,After hearing about Take Two's CEO's opinions that there are not enough micro transactions in not only GTA but many of Take Two's games and perhaps in the gaming industry as a whole I cannot in good consciousness recommend you buy this game for any reason other than to play around with your friends in an invite only lobby. GTA's economy is completely ruined payout for missions is insubstantial in comparison to the exorbitant price of most in game items and the only way to bridge that gap is by paying real life money for a paltry amount of in game money. Now with the most recent ban waves targetting most remaining mod menus and money hacks they have removed any rogue element capable of providing a player with money without the need to pay real life money or days of grinding for a single car (or even a simple customization item for a car in the case of the extremely overpriced low riders).Most importantly they are now also targeting single player mods banning your account completely for altering your single player experience. Meanwhile on the topic of licensed and legitimate single player DLC Take Two (Or Three Or More) remains completely silent leaving the user to enrich their own single player experience with mods before deciding to do an about face and ban all mods. In their latest move they have issued a cease and desist order to Open IV a popular modding tool used by many to add mods to their single player GTA campaign (with code implemented specifically to stop the user from using those mods in an online lobby).No matter your stance on single player and multiplayer mods hackers or ill gotten gains (ironically the entire spirit of GTA) you should do well to avoid getting this game unless you are willing to give hundreds of dollars to a company parading its extortion as innovation.,Grand Theft Auto V

Rockstar's support is just trash you could get ban for no reason and they wont care i seen it happen a lot over the last 2 years3. Rockstar 100% lied about the single player DLC 4. Everything is very very over priced so you will be forced to either get a modder to drop you money or spend your hard earned cash just to play some good content like cmon rockstar yall are greddy af5. No transfer I spent years working on my main character but when i got GTA for PC the transfer was gone and all that time and money was wasted maybe they will bring it back who knowsWell that is it for now there is more but I sadly don't have the time to list them if you are getting GTA just for the single player DLC then go for it but for Online I wouldn't recommend till they fix some problems,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-09,0,0,132,False,Recommended,How much do I love about GTA5?Myself can t judge it.I merely watch the full gameplay process of the offline mode three times buying a brand new U disk only to help my friend install GTA5 on his cracked XBOX though I did not play that on XBOX later on.Then I pre orderd the PC version of GTA5 almostly the first day it is released on steam even though I was still using the little stupid macbook air (even unable to run San Andreas on that).Later on that winter I bought a new computer 50% because I am dying to play this.Now I almost finish the story mode even though the frames never being a stable number over 30.All that t above is my own story of GTA5.Now it is time to talk why I suffered that much to play a game that I ve known the whole story clearly .No complicated firstly or secondly merely two words FREEDOM and REALITY.The game is full of freedom and the freedom you dare not experience in real life is especially emerged.I am not that kind of insane dacnomania in the game not only because that I am not skilled enough to deal with the LSPD.Through my 28h story mode gameplay so far the thing I am most willing to do is controlling Franklin to buy or simply rob a sports car driving 6 kilometers to reach the garage he owns turning the car to a monster of speed and function then drive 6 kilometers back home.The trip is not boring at all when you drive across highways country roads grasslands and so many other topographies.You can drive as fast as you can shoot the who crashing onto your car or say hello to those who also drive thrpugh the quite little town at dawn.Even though I commited suicide due to my unconsciousness I only have to pay 5000 and everything goes back as if nothing have happened.Every meter I drive through makes me feel like I am the main actor of FAST AND FURIOUS.My driving do not need a purpose like other racing games it is so ing awesome that s why I enjoyed driving on GTA5 that s the freedom I expect from GTA5.Then reality?I do not mean things like super visual effects from my cheap computer I mean something that is naturally happening in real life but normally not in the game.I was shocked abou t the details of the game.Even that the gunshot can put out any light I saw surprised me a lot.It is always details that matters.the motto also suits gaming industries.There are videos about 50 tremendous details about GTA5 on youtube.After seeing that you will have the same feeling on the greatness of the game.Maybe time to talk about the story?From my perspective this game is all about several shocking robbery in Los Santo.In between the whole time the love story of T and M could be regarded as the connecting thread.I can t talk much about the humanity because myself is to young to figure it out.For me?Treavor is a kind psycho Franklin can be something in the future and I can understand all that Micheal have done but maybe I can t accept that if I were T.I hate the ending to become a tragedy so I would pick C.Prejuiced by first impressions guys I can control are good guys and those who oppose us are bad guys.Good guy survives and kill bad guys one by one standard Hollywood ending exciting enough!People may argue about that I judge three leading characters simply as good guys.That is because I have gradually fall in love with these three totally different s.Why are the writers in rockstar so ing clever?I don t know why I would spend an hour or two writing this piece of especially when several tests are merely several days ahead.Maybe admire it just like others finished a good movie?All in all I guess if I define GTA5 as a masterpiece there are not that much people would disagree and kick my,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-08,0,0,210,False,Recommended,So after playing this game onboth my old Xbox 360 and now on my PC i have to say its a game worth getting. I have just scrolled down throught the comments of what somepeople are having issues with. First one will be getting banned for using Discord overlay system. I can understand that the Discord overlay system some people really like and enjoy but in my opionon i dont use it and i really dont intend too as you can really easily ALT Tab out of the game just to see who has joined the channel. On top of that you can also play in boardless windowed mode (as i do because i alt tab alot).Second one is complaing about hackers.Yep i perfectly understand where people are coming from with this as i have had it in my lobby but what do i do? simple i make an invite only lobby and invite my friends to play. It makes it stress free from hackers as well as after finishing a job since you go back into that same invite only lobby.Last one that i would like to talk about is there customer service.Ofcourse everyone has had some sort of issue ether it being IG (In game) or OG (Out game) i have had many issues with buy GTA Online cash and not having it shown IG. I contected customer support through e mail saying 'I dont have the money i just spent on IG' (something like that). After a day they sent me an e mail apologising on how it had became an issue and few hours after that i got the cash.I really do feel sorry for the people who are having issues with the GTA Online service personally i havent had any issues as of yet though i would recormend that people just run the game in boardless windowed mode with NO voice channel chat overlay.As for the game itself i love it theres so much to do with random people and even with friends. I have spent hours on GTA Online and every time i do i always enjoy myself.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-26,0,0,87,False,Not Recommended,"I would love to say that I loved this game but I can't not now in it's current version. After pushing back the release date of this game multiple times there are still too many infurriating bugs with this game. There is the huge issuse of extreme framerate drops which are common even post patch an issue that happens regardless of the settings you are using.Even with the framerate issue I got through the campain portion and enjoyed it. After buying all the properties and ransacking the town with tanks and choppers i grew bored and decided to try out the online portion of the game. I was impressed at first I liked the idea of having your own character within the same map you were familar with and incorporating characters you had already come across made for interesting missions but there is a huge caveat.... It was fun when it worked.I kept track of all of the different times there was an ""unknown network error"" or if my mission unexpectedly stopped (not including when people left). Over the course of about 90 minutes I had 7 such issues. 7!!!! what makes this worse is every time your network errors occured it automatically loaded the story mode and had to reload online. This is a slow and annoying process that probably took at least 15 minutes of the 90 i played. If you take into account the time spent waiting for others to join and the frequent times when the host terminated the game or kicked you from the mission the amount of time you were actually playing was probably close to 40 minutes.So it is very simple why online mode sucks right now I spent 50 minutes waiting to play 40 minutes worth of game. This is not my only experience where i had a plethora of issues it is merely only the only one I bothered to keep track of. There are also numerous other bugs and glitches I experienced while playing not to mention the number of times I had waited only to have the host leave and ruin the set up or heist mission.I really want to like this game. I pre ordered and tried to remain positive even after numerous delays but now I find myself thinking why wasn't it delayed longer if the game still has this many issues.My hardware specsfx 832079708 gb ram 1600 mhzwd black 1tb hdsamsung 840 120 gb ssd (for os plus a few things)",Grand Theft Auto V

In fact getting into a game without a ""godmode"" killing everyone and trapping you is actually makes it enjoyable while roaming around in online. The single player is well done and well written.

2018-05-08,0,0,114,False,Recommended,It's a testament to the incredible world constructed by Grand Theft Auto V an island brimming with interesting people and colourful places and countless things to do but also with an unmistakable playful character of its own that I am able to spend the past several months avoiding the main story missions entirely while still having an incredible amount of fun. I've instead spent this time walking and driving around admiring the many landmarks of the world killing and stealing and doing good playing games and taking challenges and coming up with challenges of my own losing myself in the bright lights of Los Santos and the endless deserts of Blaine County. During these several months of total freedom I've felt immersed in a way unparalleled across any other video game before or since. I almost want to abandon the main story for good at this point becoming just another wild citizen in this wild world.If you're a boring sap like me who wants to buy all the latest open world FPS games just to play them like a walking simulator GTA V is worth the price of admission right there. (Well the excellent mods are also a factor.) Lots of games have worlds you want to live in but Los Santos is a whole level above that from the moment you start the game you're living in it already.,Grand Theft Auto V

If you're like me and love cars it's the game for you you get a car take it to the modifications shop (Los Santos Customs) and after a couple of minutes boom you got a masterpiece of a car.While levelling up to unlock all the car modifications guns upgrades and etc. the process is very enjoyable.9 5/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Just make fun of their miniscule reproductive organs if a hacker comes after you they can't stand that.I started on PS3 and when the PC version dropped I got it straight away even though my system at the time couldn't really handle it (GTX750).

2016-09-10,0,0,48,False,Recommended,"I've had the oddest of experiences with this game on PC. I originally played it with a Radeon 290. Some framerate dips but overall it ran really well no problems played on high settings with some performance demanding things pushed down.Upgraded to 390x textures take 5 seconds to buffer out. Some are totally nonexistent. Full geometry missing when you're driving fast. Framerate was fine but its totally immersion breaking watching the game world pop up around you everywhere you go. Even if I set the settings to low. I never run anything on low.I'm playing The Witcher 3 on ultra getting 45 60 fps (I have some things like grass density water quality and hairworks below ultra for this). So I don't think my pc is too underpowered. I eventually got it to run alright but it became one of those ""tricking my game into working"" experiences. Digging through forums that say ""oh I changed the launch settings to _____________ in this command line and I set my memory prefernce on my ram to __________. Also stop running any virus protections software and aim your desklamp at a 45 degree angle toward the darkest corner in your room.""I'm not too tech savvy I just want to play the game.

2017-05-07,0,0,470,False,Not Recommended,"Pros Single player is pretty good but gets old.Graphics are awesome.Cons Multiplayer is Modders constantly make the game no fun. But even if they aren't around one guy with one rocket can undo two weeks of work trying to build up wealth to buy something.This game is purely pay to win. If you don't want to spend a few hundred USD to get some decent stuff and then just fart around trying to ruin other peoples' days while they try to ruin yours don't bother.Also full of massive obvious bugs. I'm playing on an i7 3770 2x8gb DDR SSD and GTX 1060 and load times vary from maybe a minute or two to 15 or 20 minutes. when you try to join missions which are the only way to get out of the normal game world that is totally unplayable it will tell you that the session you're trying to join is full and then even when you hit cancel it will give you a 20 minute load time even though you didn't go anywhere.Overall the game consistently leaves me completely off by the time I log off and I make more in game money by watching grass grow from my front porch than playing their missions (when they'll let you actually play them). My advice is to save your money and buy a game where the people who make it actually want it to be fun rather than sucker in stupid people to pay a lot of money to buy the greatest stuff and try and compete with ""hackers"" that are invulnurable and teleport themselves to you or you to them to kill you because that's somehow fun even after years of the game being out.",Grand Theft Auto V

I like the game i play it regularly but i leave feeling like i haven't accomplished much. They push the game like a facebook game online and they've completely forgotten about single player.They also didn't stick too much detail into the single player. The characters are each okay they aren't that special. The special abilities and the 3 or so heists are really cool additions. They completely throw out some of the cool aspects from GTA IV. I get that it wasn't the most popular in the series but the main characters especially niko had a lot of character. You empathize with him you get to know his morals and how he thinks. What drives him whereas in 5 you get 3 characters each mostly motivated by money greed that sort of thing. And it just kind of falls flat on its face.

2016-03-24,0,0,22,False,Recommended,This is game is fun to play even though I despise most of the characters. I do not like the grind in the multiplayer at all but I value the sheer amount of fun things to do as far as gamemodes go. This might have the worst soundtrack of any GTA game. I do like that parachutes and other gameplay elements were not locked behind a DLC single player paywall. I actually respect that this game has enough content that it does not need single player DLC. The heist missions are some of the most memorable missions in any GTA game ever. This is not my favorite GTA game but it is still a good game to get when it is on sale. I genuinely had fun and got to 94% completion on PS3 years ago. I had enough fun to buy this game again for PC. The optimization of of this game is actually good for Rockstar standards and it runs fine on my rig. I have always enjoyed the sense of humor of Rockstar and this GTA follows along with funny TV shows and radio segments like the others. This game is actually decent satire at times. I like the way it pokes fun at Conservatives Liberals video gamers Hollywood celebrities etc. Some of the content can be a little frustrating at times but it is far from the most frustrating GTA game imo. My favorite game in the series being Vice City and that game sure as hell had some frustrating parts. I'm just happy this game runs good and it is not infected with something as as GFWL (Rockstar Social Club is not that bad). Hopefully the next GTA game released on PC runs this good or better and it is not held down by horrifically bad DRM (looking at 4).,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-13,0,0,467,False,Recommended,I have play this game for over a year on the Xbox 360 not once did I complain about the Heist the lack of vehicles lack of missions and etc. I didn't care about all that. I cared more about the experience. My friends and I doing dumb sh** in GTA Online. First of all the Single Player aspect of the game is great. It doesnt follow GTA 4's mistake of repeating the same type of missions (ex. follow target kill target go to place to kill target etc.) each mission in GTA 5 feels unique especially since Switching Character was a thing and makes every mission unique and diverse and how RockstarGames used this aspect was very well executed and it made sense in the missions.For GTA Online I really enjoyed what I had played on my last gen Xbox 360 the experience of an open sandbox game and with your friends. Planning epic planes and gettaway cars because my friends and I were going to rob a convinience store?? That sounds stupid! And it was but that was the whole point of GTA Online having FUN in anyway possible especially with your friends. GTA online isn't ment to be played alone I recommend you bring a friend with you if you dont have any friends then make some friends!!!!Everything I have explained about GTA Online was on last gen I can't begin to explain how much the PC version captures everything that I loved and gives me more. A more rich and visual improvement over the last gen console. Personally I don't see a huge difference between the current gen consoles and the PC nor does it matter what matters is that everyone who has been waiting for this on the PC may now get to enjoy one of the greatest open world sandbox games on the PC.GTA 5 and Online 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-11-01,0,0,66,False,Recommended,Through the years they improve too much GTA at this one they focus on Graphics and online plataform. You only can play GTA V with a good machine because of high graphics people will say u can make a medium pc and play as well but you will not have the same quality and enjoyable playin with a ultra graphic fps.On this GTA you can also have a good history but you need change your Char every time whern u are enjoy the history i didn't like that part. Online history is better playin because you make your own history.This GTA V is really big and open world so you can spend lots of time playin and find every single easter eggs they put on this game not only enjoy free roads and tunnings.Design is incredible scenario and environment with a huge scale of graphics will make your mouth open for some time. Like the others GTA's you can drive car motorcycle bicycle helicopter boats and some aircrafts. At this you can also drive submarines get inside network connection and buy stuffs.Tuning design have lots of improvement and now you can make you car even faster or cooler than the past GTA's was.History is a little hard at begin but you will adapt after a few hours playing and will enjoy every role and every char. I think they made this to don't let the game keep same boring thing where you need keep chaging hairstile cloths make your char more stronger. Every char has they own skills as driving make plans or get stuffs for robberies.If you want get a fully and complete experience like other GTA's franchiese games you will need for this one a good machine to make this game run at least 90% or close to full he is really heave for perfomance.I do recommend him i love GTA and i play this from the first one was launched.,Grand Theft Auto V

2018-09-14,0,0,294,False,Not Recommended,"Just a Disclaimer this is both at times my opinion and an honest review so don't get made at me if I offend you in any way Oh GTA... by the looks of me you may think that because of my decently quanitative hours that I spent towards this game that I like the game and had fun 100% of the time I played it. WELL looks can be deceiving. GTA V is at first a good and solid game but when you encounter your first noob try hard or hacker your whole experience gets wrecked. Noobs will try to ride off of your success F.E. if you have a heist loaded up there is a chance that a noob will join in thinking ""Oh I can get easy money off of this."" The try hard will push him/herself to the limits to be the very best the can be or at least that's the vibe I got from them at first. But the more and more you cross paths with a try hard the harsher they get. Try hards can go to the point of putting you down using profanities and a combination of words that will certainly not make yourself feel good. They can do this if you were to do something little like accidentally die or do the opposite of what they told you to do. But finally the hackers. Hackers can sometimes prove to be useful by giving you little bits of money or saving you from try hards that are bullying you just to get a kick out of it but around 75 80% of the time they are they to mess up you gaming experience by bombarding you with RPGs tazers or just launching you up in the air and burning you with magical fire... yeah because that makes sense. There is ALOT MORE that hackers can do. F.E. they can teleport into your car and kick you out of it they can summon a cage around you and finally they can troll your cargo meaning they can destroy your precious goods that you can collect for money. Another thing that I will rant about are the heists. Heists in GTA are fun for the most part which basically means if you fail too many times on a single section it will start to get infuriating and aggrovating. This is because whenever you do the section and fail so many times you start to get sick of that part and will eventually make you want to rage quit. Also I believe that some parts of heists are incredibly unimportant towards your final goal. Heists in general are just plain boring my example will be the first heist. You drive to where you are going to rob then you drive back to Lester's base after that you drive back to your house. The second part is you driving to a parking garage then killing a bunch of people then you get into another car which is bullet proof and you drive back to Lester's base. And the final heist is you driving to Lester's base driving to where you are going to rob (really the only fun part about this heist is you choosing between Crowd Control and unlocking the Vault/Safebox) when you get there you rob the place then GUESS WHAT you just drive. So basically the point that i was trying to make here is that for most heists 60 70% of the gameplay is just driving.One final thing that I will rant about is everything is unrewarding. (This one is just my opinion but maybe it will apply to you too) Whenever I started playing GTA I wanted the Deluxo/the ripoff of the DeLorean from BTTF. I wanted the Deluxo because it could fly... I mean who doesn't want a flying car so i worked my butt off grinding money to get the Deluxo and occasionally newer and better equipment. But then the most glorious moment in my GTA career happened I got the Deluxo and I have to say driving in it was fun for the first 3 or so times and then it just got mundane and eventually it became not as great or as epic as I thought it would be all of those hours ago.So I'm just going to say that GTA is not worth $30 I mean the graphics are amazing but overall the experience isn't worth.In my opinion.",Grand Theft Auto V

Now i have come to this conclusion due to the events of a story which no one gives a flying about and will be shared below (I really don't have a good story just some dank memes.)Just before anyone doesn't say anything because they never read this at the time i had an I5 3330 with a 3 Ghz clock speed and a 3.2 Ghz Turbo speed and a GTX 640 with i don't even remember.Having some nice little online multiplayer banter with the squad one fateful night. we were doing some missions and what have you generally on that day to day grind now one of my friends was a massive sweat and played a load on the PS3 so when he transfered his save he had a missile launcher we completed a mission and were left on a off great hill in the middle of nowhere i was getting like maybe 25 30FPS at best even though there was barely anything to even try and render.Now my realm 5 mate turns around with this hot little RPG and says something along the lines of Hey watch this and shoots me square in the face with the RPG. After respawning i had a total of 10FPS and could never play the game again.TLDR Those recommended specs are basically the minimum specs. story above because i can't be arsed to write the entire thing.,Grand Theft Auto V

I know it's impossible to know heists and their setups detailed but there are youtube tips n tricks for it.Also everytime i had off passive mode and finished heist/setup people always killed me for no reason... This thing and that random killing me solved enabling passive mode.Then there are few negative things like striped bodies (this problem had my friend) &gt PROOF&lt and after fixing it my friend and me (i had it before) have dotted skin &gt PROOF&lt (dotted skin is visible only at multiplayer characters not random pedestriants and story characters like Lester)These things are not harming my gameplay so that's why i am not that mad about them.Anyways this game is good but prepare lots of patience on multiplayer...Updates After 80 hours of multiplayer that stuff above is like nothing and you would just enjoy game BUT you ll start finding a lot of cheaters. I wasn't focusing on them that much but after repeating heists i got kinda bored and started doing CEO missions n stuff about it. Cheaters are just idiots that you can easily vote kick from session (public server).ALSO rockstars logic about reporting cheaters is really (there is no ing option ""cheater"" or ""hacker"" ...).After 160 hours of multiplayer you ll start noticing much bigger and worse bugs than before and cheaters will be like casual players to you you see cheater you vote kick him report him and go to another session... Also you'll be doing only Pacific standarts to make money with CEO missions at same time to maximize profit. That's (sadly) the only option of making money in this part of game (level 90).After 360 hoursok O",Grand Theft Auto V

But it is also very grindy that part is fun tho most of the missions are a little different so your not repeating anything unless you do that same mission over and over.There are also some cons. Such as hackers in id say 40 percent of the lobbies you go in there is a hacker they can either be really anoying or completely peaceful and even helpful. Also there are tryhards these people will stop at nothing to ruin what your trying to do even if it is very expensive. Which can get pretty annoying at times.

2018-08-09,0,0,137,False,Not Recommended,This is for GTA V Online(SP Story was great) If you dont have friends to play this game dont play it. If you dont want to grind for money dont buy this game. If your lobby ends up with more than 10 people in it(which inevitably will happen) there's a 90% chance that a hacker will ruin your game and destroy your cargo. If you dont like extremely dense amounts of toxic players and hackers then dont buy this game. This game is essentially a glorified beta game just being filled with content where grind and real life money is what matters and if you have enough of it you can overwrite even the most skillful players. Like I said BETA game. Its not very buggy but there is an unlimited amount of ways this game can be improved convenience wise and as epecially in actually caring about hackers. Pretty much everyone hates Rockstar at this point not just for gta but for their other games such as bully(im not a bully fanboy fyi). All they want is to make money out of this game so they add new content which costs a ton of ingame money but they make this money hard to get by making even the best ways of grinding money insanely repetitive but cover there tracks by then making little side quests to keep you entertained. This all pressures you to just spend real money on shark and therefore feeding there need for more money. Dont get me started on loading screens I have an exceptional pc and I know im not the only one with this problem. The only reason I could see myself playing this game is because my friends are playing it otherwise im steering extremely clear of it.

But R$ does nothing to curb cheating. They do nothing to stop people from spawning money or making water erupt from under you. It's rediculous.

2018-02-04,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Been playing GTA on console for about 2 years switched to pc as soon as I got one and oh my god it's amazing and if you have a good pc you should install a graphics mod like redux I got it and it looks like real life and with a pc you can get higher fps. I for example have an Radeon rx580 8gb 16gb ram ryzen 7 1700 oc 3.7Ghz and I have redux mod and it honestly looks like real life and I still play at a very solid 60fps. If you don't have a good pc I don't recommend but if you do get this game. The game itself is very fun to play the storyline will make you laugh out loud and it is very well written. Online is a whole 'nother story it is updated like crazy awesome vehicles but it is very much a grind now and it's very boring unless you pay extra cash for in game money or if you mod online but this will result in a ban if rockstar finds out. So it's very hard to have fun online when you are nonstop making little money and not enjoying what's in the freeroam. I personally mod offline which is perfectly gone and it's really fun. All in all it's fun but wait until black Friday or Christmas or any other sale so you can get this game cheaper I know for sure black Friday and Christmas it is 50% off which is a really good deal. Back to the redux mod you should get it if your pc can handle it it causes a 5 15fps drop from the original fps but not only does it make the graphics look insanely real it is a complete overhaul of the game better explosions better ragdoll better water waaaaay better reflections (My favorite) and the weight of the car when turning stopping and going is very realistic. Also the plantlife sways in the wind better and the sky and environment looks real instead of like the vanilla which looks like a filter. I give it a 7/10 regular vanilla version 10/10 with redux and other fun mods you can add to the game. This is just my 2 cents.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-04-12,0,0,444,False,Not Recommended,Honestly the past weeks I got this game have been the worst gaming experience I ever had.I am talking about GTA Online. The loading times are obscene the game takes 2 minutes or more to get into GTA Online after that at any given time it cant kick me back to GTA V single player or show the FAILED to SAVE message.The game does not check if any session you are trying to join is already full and then you have to wait 2 loading screens.There are no messages or progress bars during loading you have no idea of what is going on.You can get kicked from the session YOU ARE HOSTING.The player gets stuck and cannot move at any time you finish a mission or event the game hangs and the only solution is to force close the game. The community is one of the worst and there are no penalties for a**holes someone joins you heist and leaves theres is no ban from heist or cash penalty. During a heist of coop mission players cannot die or else is auto fail dead players should just loose part of the XP and $.Passive Mode protects you from other players but then you cannot attack NPCs or cops.Instead of having a locker at home of safe houses the players can carry all the guns they bought so almost everyone is carrying a rocket launcher and sniper rifle all the time.You cannot sell your guns cars or houses/garaged there are workarounds but some of them are just stupid.Items are level based I can understand that at an MMO but not at an online action game theres always a single player with a fighter jet fu**ing everyone up and them people just leave the game session the same goes for guns and worst of all clothes. There are well documented bugs that never got fixed I cant say how many hours I lost because of the WANTED LEVEL BUG in the PRISON HEIST mission.The game have serious issues and most of them arent hard to fix but by the issues I searched in the Rockstar and Steam foruns and how long they are being discussed I see the DEV simply doesnt care about this product so players have two options Give up an leave Learn to deal with the games issues,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-10-02,0,0,9,False,Recommended,This game is excellent to say the least. The story is strong the characters are all wonderfully written and the dialogue is voiced by some of the best I have seen. It has a ton of content but the content does not make you feel like you are fulfilling a meaningless checklist. The city is open and beautiful and the remastered version makes it a thousand times better than its last gen predecessor. It doesn't matter what type of gamer you are there is something here for almost everyone. The game manages to include so many elements that it's really hard to limit this to just an open world game. One second you're sneaking into someone's house to steal a car and the next you're fleeing from armed men on a jet ski. My only beef with the game (the only reason it is not perfect) is how unintuitive the controls can sometimes be how stupid the AI has been designed in a few cases and how confusing the story may be to follow at times. Otherwise I give this game a 9.5 out of 10. If you have a next gen system this is a must play.,Grand Theft Auto V

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern.

However it goes on sale for 40$ semi often definetly within like 3 weeks.

The attention to detail is amazing example if you hit someone with the hatchet it leaves blood splatter on the hatchet!Gameplay Are you joking of course the gameplay is amazing it's GTA if you are new to this market after 80 hours of grinding it may seem repetitive.

Pros Extremely well written story Main/side characters feel real and develop thoughout The actions you do actually feel like they matter Los Santos feels alive Smooth driving mechanics Action is great Trevor It looks beautiful Free Updates for multiplayer portion of the game Fun to play with friends Awesome soundtrack that appeals to every taste (Famous artists even host the stations) The different UIs Plenty to do (Even after finishing the main story) Cons The game has infrequent frame drops on more insense scenes on higher settings No Story DLC ( Only a con because Rockstar said it would happen/Rockstar makes good DLCs) There is the occasional hacker onlineThis is one of the only games that I can call a 10/10. Every time I see it in my Library I want to play through it again. I bought this for $60 on PS3 and $60 on PC and I definitely do not regret either purchase.

2017-12-28,0,0,421,False,Recommended,The Grand Theft Auto series has made a remarkable presence on the gaming community as a whole this title is no exception. GTA is one of the (if not most) controversially recognisable gaming series of all time and one of the most successful as well. Overall this title (especially online multiplayer) is fantastic but like anything is not without it's faults. Rockstar has sinned in a variety of ways some which they cannot make up for no matter how prolific their attempt would or could be. Despite these faults in the recent months GTA V has become notorious for a variety of compelling reasons online cheaters being the most significant. This issue needs to be addressed and continually combated in a good professional manor (key word being good). Many people have been banned significant portions of these being cheaters and hackers but although minute still a percentage innocents who are being unfairly maimed in the form of a ban due to other people's venomous behaviour. However although not going in depth in an attempt to keep this concise I've kept detail to a minimum. I highy reccomend if you have a resonable pc of certain specification you buy this game. It's fantastic and has a compelling story (which can become competitive and boring but take it with a pinch of salt the GTA storyline is like no other). However simultaneously the online version of the game continues to flourish despite this cheaters have become a large portion which is a huge drawback to online. Overall Graphics 8/10 Story 8/10 Online 7/10,Grand Theft Auto V

Shutting down mods was a bad move You have just put a lot of people off your games and I bet that you pull this will the new Red Dead I wont know because I'm not buying that and supporting like this. People making mods just want to add to your game and discover new possibilities with your game engine all mods provide more insentive for people to buy your game therefore leading to... wait for it... MONEY! Now you are shutting modders down because that is not enough no you need people to buy microtransactions so they can have a slightly bigger apartment that they will never go in and a tank that they can just get blown up in by hackers hackers are the real evil apart FROM ROCKSTAR THAT IS. Leave modders alone we will leave your games alone. Its not worth buying this game for the online and the desprete cashgrab that it is.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-06-16,0,0,168,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V (SP) GTA 5's singleplayer is one of the if not the best singleplayer experiences I have ever had. Even without the missions there is so much to do in Los Santos. Each character's unique ability also makes it all that little bit more fun. There's also modding which kept the games sales going up and kept the singleplayer fun even after 100% completion. But of course Take Two is trying to shut it down. So you can stop harmless SinglePlayer modding but not cheaters in Online? Disgusting. GTA Online GTA Online is also a really great multiplayer experience or at least it was until the mod menu users / cheaters came along and started blowing everybody up under the name of random people and trapping them in cages. As I said earlier instead of stopping harmless SP modding stop the cheaters griefing every lobby they come across! Now I'll talk a bit about the updates this game has had. I love them all (mostly). I see a lot of people going ""omg this military crap isnt gta anymore flying cars wtf"". Personally I think these additions are all very cool the only reason people complain about them is the way they get used by tryhards griefers etc. The Doomsday Heist update added a new and amazingly fun heist to the game which also let you experience the new vehicles added to the game (just incase you wanna ""test drive"" them or something). Sure R* might mess up now and again and add a griefing tool to the game *cough cough orbital cannon cough cough* but it's mostly pretty fun (but expensive) vehicles weapons properties etc. Again to sum it all up I really like all the military stuff they have added into this game keep making these updates R*! TL DR Game itself is great Take Two and cheaters are not.EDIT Recently R* has cracked down on the cheaters step in the right direction also have updated the GTA Online portion for the recent updates added to the game.EDIT 2 This was made in 25th of February 2018 just received news (and confirmed) that R* / Take2 has taken down most or all the most popular paid menus. Nice! Of course there's still other menus but I'm sure they'll crack down on those too.EDIT 3 Game has gotten Mixed reviews because of cheaters making a negative review and crying about how they got banned LMAO.",Grand Theft Auto V

2017-01-16,0,0,261,False,Not Recommended,"why NOT to buy the game for anywhere the full price (and the reason it has such low ratings now read the other negative reviews)Rockstar decided to poop on all of their big PC fanbase that made all of their money years ago by releasing the game for consoles and never saying they plan to release the game for PC until after a couple of years ""thanks for your money losers"" so let's get this one out of the way we got the game way too late after they milked the consoles.Online game is designed badly It's ALL about farming the ""business""/""making big money"" DLCs all take more money from you than they even bring in Hey wanna sell cocaine for 420K? no problem all you need is to invest 3 million. and of course you need to work very hard for those 420k and you can't do it alone (cos of time limit) so you gotta find friends cos general public community is crap. so you never really make the investment back in these money making schemes you end up farming money for tens of hours just trying to make back the lost money by the end of which you're tired of farming the same missions and you just move on. DLC cars millions per car fun vehicles millions You end up trying to make money but you gotta keep putting in more money it doesn't pay up unless you play hundreds of hours just farming (which by that point the game has lost all of its meaning) Full of hackers online expecially chinese ones that don't speak with you long loading times wanna do a nice mission together? don't count on strangers very toxic non communicating people so you can only count on friends you make. game is designed so you farm and group activities are too few and far in between and aren't that fun. eventually you buy a house and have a few nice cars only to realize you had little fun making the money to get them. read the other reviews it's not just my opinion.Offline mode story It's worth playing but not for the full price 20$ is fair. very left wing agenda driven you can see the political views of the game makes creeping in all military man are bloodthirsty killers (you kill a lot of US soldiers in the game) cops are standard (but btw you got only 3 female cops in the entire game you have to search to find their spawn place you kill 99.9999% male cops thanks for the left wing equality rockstar) everything right wing or patriotic is demonized in the game you're pro border? you're a racist that kind of stuff. more anti right wing anti gun in the TV programs they show on TV. one of the characters you play is an insane serial killer but he makes a clear political stand against TORTURE by the US gov that of course after a mission where you tortured a guy yourself. hypocracy (i'm not even american). the only honest thug is a black dude named franklin which plays like carl from San andreas so it's nice. i cringed through half of hte single player cos of the above it's visible and annoying.PROs game is super big beautiful and lots of things to do in the story mode but the lack of a convincing story and characters is annoying the game leaves you feeling empty at ht end of the day both in single player and multiplayer it makes you feel cheated.",Grand Theft Auto V

The story is clear from the beggining it's all about him his family present life and ghosts hi's retirement and Franklin and Trevor are there to fill in the gaps even tho they have stories on their own and it's not a bad thing it makes the game more dinamic and gives you a rest from each character I liked that.I'm not playing the online mode I'm not sure if I'll ever play it so I can't say anything about it.",Grand Theft Auto V

For example with 10mil yachts and rediculous options of certain stuff that cost way to much.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-03-08,0,0,253,False,Recommended,If you are looking for a game with an amazingly rich detailed and expansive open world with a convincing narrative and a variety of character then this is the game for you especially if you are a fan of messing around in an open world enviorment without consequences. Int his regard the game is close to a 10/10.However if you are looking for an online experience that you can enjoy with friends look elsewhere. The online enviroment is filled with hackers and items like cars and clothes are extremely expensive forcing you to spend real world money to afford anything worth owning. There is also a massive amount of unorganized minigames but very few people populating them therefore it is very difficult and frustrating to actually find a lobby for these games. In the end GTA 5 offers a lot ignoring the online gamemode it would be a crime not to recommend a game that is such a staple in gaming culture.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-12-14,0,0,63,False,Recommended,"This is single player game review. I have NOT played online at all.In a nutshell GTA V is an amazing open world gaming experience. I've played GTA 1 very very very long time ago I liked that one. I played GTA 4 until it got stuck (was okay game). pros + single player world is inviting with plenty of missions and free roaming+ cool personal characters with each having their unique skills+ graphics look good still+ no ""console port"" feeling (that was in GTA 4)+ radio channels are great+ all kinds of mini games and activities ranging from dart throwing to stock purchases+ cars!+ cops!+ the heist missions! (man I like them so much first you choose your plan steal equipment go for the mission and espace)+ random encounters (dudes robbing somebody money car coming)+ AI creates create fun situations (cops smashing into something that hits something else that hits you...)+ nice progression with weapons unlocking one after another as game progresses+ so much to explore+ day/night cycle looks amazing+ selfie cam D+ there's just so much awesome stuff in this game I cannot remember it all+ profanities (Trevor has pretty creative words at his disposal)cons profanities (not for everybody if you don't want to hear profanities and characters insulting each other and drivers giving the middle finger to you when you crash their car... then probably not a game for you) I did not like missions where you have to change the character that kills the pace of the mission (it's not that bad there's only few missions like that so far but still) You have to like cars to like this game ) plenty of driving in this game.I played only single player game and if you are after a great open world experience in modern world then there's good chances you're going to like this game.",Grand Theft Auto V

This game is not only a good story many menus scenery and visual enjoyment is also very good. As the game development say giving a very stunning visual effects. Especially the first vision is to let people personally on the scene. Franklin Clinton as a new era of the boy give people a sense of intimacy. He and Mike's story is because of his work he does not value for money and status. Later and Mike a little become a lifetime of good brothers also by a gangster become a billionaire. Michael De Santa a crime ridden menopausal middle aged man a relationship is not how harmonious family who peddle poison robbed a bank he put money and status than anything important in order to have money and betray brother Already think not commit crimes by mob boss forced once again return to prostitution and with ever betray brother met him. A variety of events and finally back to the brothers love. Trevor Philips is a good in killing and blood kill crazy he and Michael de Santa is life's brother was later betrayed by michael de Santa alive in his friend did not know of this event every day by the blood and wine to survive he ambitious in ordinary people view he is a metamorphosis and once After meeting and once brother Michael de Santa.

2017-06-21,0,0,734,False,Not Recommended,Played it on Xbox since Day 1 both the single and multiplayer.Bought it on PC to play more and also mod the singleplayer from time to time.Singleplayer &gt topHOWEVER The multiplayer went to sh*t since bankrobbery came out. From that point on I knew they wouldn't give a singlwe **** about what the community wants. Every DLC made it harder to enjoy the Game without buying these f*** sharkcards. The multiplayer went with every Update / DLC more into Pay to Win and that is (in my view) unacceptable for such an expensive game. I see why it is this expensive and I surely am Ok with paying such a price (as you can see I even buyed the PC version later on) but if you make a Game and sell it then you certainly won't need such Pay to Win politics. I really enjoyed playing GTA V in the beginning but know it is one BIG sh**hole. Sorry Rockstar / Take Two but f**k you. You got my money so have fun with your victory wank 'cuz this was the last time I bought something from you or more like wasted my money!And NO not even Red Dead Redemption 2 will make ANY difference.And the BIGGEST MOST DISGRACEFUL EVEN PITIFUL thing is that you practically banned all modding from this game (and I talk about the singleplayer) by shutting down OpenIV. Everyone that worked in order to accomplish it should be proud about the fact that they practically banned the only reason why this game was still useable. You really don't give a single f**king sh*t about your clients do you?And I won't even start on how you are able to ban innocent players on a massive scale but there are still unaccaptable high amounts of hackers online. GOOD WORK YOU F**KERS be proud!tl dr Game was good at launch Multiplayer went since Bankrobbery more and more to Pay to Win Rockstar / Take Two don't give a sh*t about their clients / community DON'T EVER BUY THIS GAME (unless you get it for like 5$ max),Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-21,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,"I used to like GTA I used to like Rockstar but time and time again they treat us the gamers like Today Rockstar Games and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and it's all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propeled grindfest.Once upon a time I would have recommended this game I would have recommended any Rockstar game but not anymore.Edit I know none of you want to believe your precious Rockstar is at fault here I know you want to put blame solely on Take Two but that isn't the bloody case. Rockstar Games is the publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series Take Two owns Rockstar Games but they infact give a lot of autonomy to Rockstar Games. The people that initiated the C&amp D were Rockstar Games AND Take Two despite what you want to believe that is the way it is. The people you think support mods no longer exist. Management changes in companies and the last time I can recall Rockstar ""supporting mods"" was back in the GTA IV days which is a long time ago.Stop defending Rockstar.

2018-08-31,0,0,30,False,Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto VA game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games.I have been an avid GTA fan for as long as i can remember from the overhead 2D originals that captured our hearts and ran over them for bonus points to the classics of the series now GTA VC and San Andreas and GTA4 So i stepped into this game with mind pre blown ready for a whole new destination (well a rebooted one) And some new characters to get lost in and around.GTA5 did nothing but astound me from the graphical detail to the brilliant story despite its minorly cliche plotpoints. I felt like the whole experience was unique to me. But without further hesitation lets get into this review!I usually break my reviews into 4 categories. Story Gameplay Graphics and Music. Followed by an overall section that details my overall thoughts on the game and a more structured final decision. If you don't like long reviews please feel free to scroll down to the overall section.Story The GTA series has always had a fairly decent and intricate crime story in play Usually just a paid thug sent to do random jobs for someone who is willing to pay. Thats the overall premise so far. But GTA5 took it to a different level This time you have 3 main characters. Franklin Michael and Trevor. Who all have their own stories to follow but along the way become more and more intertwined and friction and friendships are discovered. I thought this was a phenomenal idea because following the adventures of Nico in GTA4 everyone had experienced pretty much every aspect of crime From Liberty City's organised mafia crime to the gang banger crime of the ""hood"" in SA. They gave you 3 different types of characters all with their own story and personality and it really helped fill out the game in so many ways. The story is diverse taking you basically across the island and back again through its standard playtime With loads of side story missions available along the way. This game has a seriously fleshed out game world with tons of backstory and history to catch up from the start which can seem daunting but once you're in. You're in for a wild ride.Gameplay Grand theft auto has always had a very generic gameplay you play as a hero...or villain as the case usually is really. And you run around a fairly...linear open world and commit mass crimes from small time burglary to mass genocides. But GTA5 has upped the standard again. The game world is huge and the gameplay is smooth as glass. From stealing cars to gunning down police the game has solidly build the world around you (the player). Occasionally you'll discover a bug i guess you'd want to call it where your car would do something stupid or your character will slip down a hill that should have been a clean traverse and annoy you for a while. But the overall gameplay mechanic is fleshed out and been modelled incredibly well. The gunplay is pretty great using a fairly generic cover system as most 3PS games do these days But even still its done extremely well and is well worth the experience. I didn't get a chance to play the online side of the game on PC but i played it vigorously on console to my own detriment i know. This game has alot of content for the MP side of things but not really a whole lot of content if any at all substantial content for the SP campaign which is a terribly large let down seeming the game is so expansive and detailed.Driving can be frustrating especially at the start when you're becoming familiar with the vehicles and the world its incredibly easy to crash and die in this game which i happened to do very frequently but its one of those become accustomed to scenarios once you become familiar the difficulty quickly disappates flying helicopters and planes is very similar in this regard Very rarely did i discover a bug that caused my car to just...launch into the air or make me launch through the windshield. Maybe once or twice in my entire time playing GTA which overall is a pretty astounding effort.Graphics This game is beautiful. To say the least On a fairly mid high end pc this game runs like glass at max settings. 70+ FPS solidly at all times even under what i would consider the games largest strain massive amounts of vehicles and people all gathered together at once or even flying a jet across the skies overlooking the city scape. (My PC specs are in my profile)The game is stunning at all times...Very rarely do i take a step back and look at a horizon or go explore just to see the worlds detail but i did it with this game and i'll happily do it over and over because of how much love and dedication has been put into this game. I have a few screenshots on my profile that help show the worlds detail. Its an experience for sure!Music Probably the weakest point of the game...Not because the music is bad..because its far from bad it has basically music developed by real artists when your in vehicles on the internal radios which helps you feel like its realistic definitely but the actual musical score for the game is very bland...A few high and low drops for dramatic effect but nothing breathtaking and nothing unique to this GTA...which i guess is very common in the GTA series as a whole. But the music while driving is extremely addictive catching myself singing songs i wouldn't normally listen to or just getting lost in some classic rock or country was a great way to pass the time driving across the world.Overall This game is a must buy for anyone who loves the GTA series or any of its clones. It has been masterfully developed and detailed by a loving company who has done very little in terms of games badly. Perhaps its largest let down is that the game is a money sink for online play...Things cost far too much in game money that its almost not worth it and you can buy cash cards from the steam store which i found to be rather stupid and to be honest a bit of a slap in the face for the gamers who love this game. But the singleplayer is near flawless and its GTA through and through. I recommend this game whole heartedly and i hope you love it as much as i do.Drive frantically!",Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-29,0,0,118,False,Not Recommended,Extremely buggy. Rockstar should have never put out a PC version if they were going to do it like this. Steam big picture mode does not help the situation so it is hard to say what the source of the repeat crashes. Rockstar suggests that it is a video issue which is laughable. I guess that I will dig up my old XBox360 if I want to play GTAV. Major fail by Rockstar and/or Valve.,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-06-12,0,0,535,False,Recommended,I have spent many hours on the 360 version playing GTA V. I loved it but when GTA finally came to P.C. i had to have it. Therefore i will compare the 2 versions quite frequently so be warned.GRAPHICS The game looks fantastic both for the P.C.. and xbox 360 versions. However with the P.C. the frame rate is soooo much better and after playing the P.C and going back to the 360 i don't know how I put up with the frame rate. the interface looks much better for the P.C and the lighting is suberb almost no graphical glitches of any kind.STORYThe story of course is also great. Bassically Its 3 Friends Franklin Michel and Trevor who after robbing a bank go their seperate ways. After finding themselves all in Los Santos they start to plot and scheme to make a ton of money. With plot twists and epic charecters I can say the story was well written and very entertaining to play through. The side quests were fun and the side charecters were hilarious and i am so glad i played through the story before entering online.FREE ROAM. The map of Los Santos and neighboring Blain County is huge. The map is sprawling with detail and even some secrets. A great place to return to after GTA San Andreas. The weapons are simalar in damage and design to be fair however the attachments give the weapons a whole new depth something GTA has never experimented with before. Something else GTA has never experianced before was the 3 charector switching. You can play between the 3 protagonists each with their special power. Michel can slow down time Trevor can become nearly invincible and Franklin can slow down time in his car. Speaking of cars there is a huge variety this time and on P.C. you can now look on the insides of cars wich have great detail inside each of them. For example a super car has a nice radio comfy looking seats etc. A crap car however looks rigid radio torn out and just looks ugly. The speed and handling is different for each and is fun to master each. Overall a great and fun free roam experiance with all the fun you can imagine.ONLINENow this may be the experiance you picked up the game for. The loading screens are always slow but however you have to forgive them for loading such a great online experiance. Once you start You have access to pretty much every car you want and certain missions to help you rank up and make some dough weapons are locked at first which you must rank up to acheve them but DLC weapons which on a side note all dlc is free which is awesome But DLC weapons are unlocked from the get go which is good for newn players would have to contend with everyone else with much better things then them. The customization for players are there but its not really the best. there are tons of clothing options hoever and its fun to dress up in your own unique way. However one major complaint about online is how hard it is to make money. Though heists are there it takes a long time to make just a few hundred grand and with all this expensive DLC items Like yaughts offices and cars many people are resorting to hacking which ruins the overall experiance for everyone when they decide to greif. However Rockstar seems to be on top of hacking for now but Hackers Mainly Jordans menu and Infamous Always seem to be one step ahead. However looking past that missions are fun playing with your friends are better and i still reccomend GTA V for anyone who is looking to have a great time offline or online. My Rating for GTA V is 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2016-05-11,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Welcome to Los Santos where everyone is either a hacker or that guy who gets a tank just to everyone every single second. Nonetheless this game is great for singleplayer. The modding is amazing and so is the game build and graphics. Multiplayer is playable in solo sessions or with friends but NEVER go into public lobbies. With the multiplayer barely even playable this game is NOT worth $60. Waiting for it to go on sale for at least 50% off would be the best deal in my opinion.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-11-06,0,0,250,False,Recommended,Not a lot to say except this game is solid. You play as 3 different characters in a great. The main purpose of the game is to strike it rich by ANY means necessary. Online mode has tons of features and allows you to play almost however you want.The story and characters are full of back story that you have to play the whole game to fully understand. Graphics can be adjusted to allow for insane graphics. You can play in 3rd person or first person mode. Controls by default feel good but you can adjust them if you want. My biggest gripe is flying controls but like I said you can adjust them. You can level up stats and each character has a certain special which comes in handy.

2015-05-03,0,0,287,False,Recommended,As someone who has patiently waited for this game since day 1 of release for consoles and never played a single bit untill the 14th of April 2015 i can definetly say that this game is the most fun that ive had out of a game in a long time.If you are on the fence about getting this game by far throw your money at the screen (even if you own a console copy)Grand Theft Auto V is extreamly easy to run and is a relieve that it is so with all the rushed games this generation (hint hint Ubisoft) with the minimum specs of a 9800 GT and Q6600 2.4GHz! Currently i run this game on an average set up with a 560 Ti graphics card and a i3 2105 processor with a smooth 60&lt fps most of the time (on mostly 'normal' settings) but dipping down to about 40 in the city during daytime.The only complaint that i have about this game is a small graphics glitch that i have seem to be experiancing where occasionally bars appear forming out of cars for 1 frame and can get distracting. Although this bug will hopfully be fixed with patches drivers or future Directx.Overall i will give this masterpiece a 10/10,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-04-20,0,0,39,False,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto 5 is a remastered version of an insanely popular last generation title which has been built from the ground up for current generation consoles and also ground up on a separate build for PC owners. Given the modding community has been enormous for the franchise since the release of open world GTA 3 each release to PC in this franchise really does generate a lot of interest.In this iteration we have Franklin Michael and Trevor who live in the region of Los Santos. Though we don't get to go to Liberty City or Vice City we do get a little bit of time in the state of North Yankton Canada. Two of the three protagonists have a big job together and generate some history prior to the events of GTA 5 and this leads into the story where Michael encounters his new adopted son Franklin.The story is definitely the most interesting in the series and it really does run like a dream for PC owners. The story goes for a considerable amount of time but I played basically all the easily available missions and had it complete in less than 35 hours. There are a few bugs and the steam forums seem flooded by technological noobs and there's a serious issue with SLI but the game really does pay respect to the PC community for the first time from the games developer.The game features an all new angle which allows the player to connect to the protagonist a lot more and because of the new first person mode I found myself less obligated to go on rampages and to drive well. In fact driving is so much easier with this new camera angle. For the first time since GTA3 was released it really does add a lot of value to the game but it's not refined like most first person shooter game development companies release I hope this will be more apparent in the next game in the franchise.We also have a stock market by which if you aren't familiar with what you can earn by investing in which company in which time you'll miss out on much of the post campaign content. The system itself is intriguing educational and fun. I ended up having all three characters have about 170 million dollars thanks to the stock market and one of my characters will be earning half a million for every week that passes so I definitely can't complain.You're able to buy properties visit bars strip clubs play sport buy weapons and of course pick up hookers. The controversy has officially passed for me in that the ability to be able to access the mature content isn't really interesting anymore even though it's really important to the game. If a gamer is playing only for the mature content and violence I'm willing to bet that player isn't legally old enough to play the game.I was hoping we would see smarter AI firetruck missions ambulance missions and vigilante missions and all of those features we saw in San Andreas and Vice City but I was disappointed. The wanted system is easy to evade and presents no real challenge there were no additional missions besides taxi missions and the game is really quite easy. As with my previous points it doesn't pack a lot of interesting content besides the main campaign and a few extras but the game veers towards being an online focused game. I applaud this but I don't at all consider myself a multiplayer player though it's currently one of the most popular online games in the world.I feel all these things along with proper SLI support are the only things this title is missing and it's otherwise a complete version of any GTA game.Perhaps for the next title?Having completed this game on Xbox 360 and PC now I can highly recommend this title to any adult who shares an interested in the franchise nostalgic or not. The story is totally worth it and the AAA PC release is beautiful and scalable to many different computer hardware configurations. It's a title that's worth having in your collection.I'm really looking forward to GTA 6 and the possibilities of playing around in an equally beautiful North Yankton Liberty City or Vice City.,Grand Theft Auto V

2015-05-03,0,0,355,False,Recommended,A massive game packed with content. Rockstar really took their time developing this game and it shows in the world they gave us. The game is so large and packed with content that it is likely that people will be finding new secrets for a long time to come. Tons of activates and a great online mode that is great to play with friends. The online mode really encourages you to play with friends because some things like heists are nearly impossible to play with random players. All in all a massive game that other triple A developers should try to strive to deliver with their $60 releases. Rockstar really is a Rock Star of the gamming industry.,Grand Theft Auto V

2017-05-03,0,0,362,False,Recommended,I wrote a positive review before but soon deleted it. Here's why.Singleplayer Cannot complain one bit. Very fun and in depth storyline with insane happenings which suit the usual Grand Theft Auto atmosphere. Lots and lots of cars and things to do outside doing missions e.g flying a plane into the twin tow Maze Bank building. Multiplayer Where do I start. Hackers every fourth session I join usually killing players for fun and not even dropping money (I'll talk about that some more later). The community is toxic people killing other people who are simply driving around (RDM'ing). People with Hydra's demolishing whole lobbies because of their overpoweredness. And now people with flying bikes rocketing the crap out of everyone. But that's what passive mode is for.Now let's talk about MONEYYYY. If you are lucky enough in GTA online you will come across a hacker that drops money for you adn you don't end up getting banned. Rockstar are so anal about how you should get money. Missions or Shark Cards (NOT WORTH IT!!). This takes AGES especially if your heist crew are idiots who blow themselves up (Heists is the main way of getting money). So money dropping hackers in my opinion are genarally welcomed into lobbies and are seen as SAVIOURS to people who are poor (most players). So that about wraps up my review on GTA V. Overall it's kinda good but kinda isn't. Maybe you'll find it more awesome than I did.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-06-15,0,0,285,False,Not Recommended,It WAS a really good game. However part of the fun was the Single Player and part of the SP was Mods. With Take Two cutting out part of the experience to bolster microtransaction sales this game just ain't good.,Grand Theft Auto V

Online is also great due to Rockstar constantly giving out deals and releasing updates for new cars missions and heists. It's one of those games where you always have something to do and its hard to get tired of it.

The lobbys are unstable often dropping most of the players or just failing to connect in the first place.If somehow you can look past all that and still want to play the game how it was meant to be played then get ready for a grind. Everything you want will cost an outrageous ammount of in game currency compared to what you make.

At the time of typing this the game won't even launch Crashes on startup and the clunky system titled ""GTA Online"" should have been fixed at the release of the game. I would have accepted another delay if the game worked for everyone.",Grand Theft Auto V

2018-07-27,0,0,162,False,Recommended,Great game with soooooooooooooooooo much to do. Takes some grinding but what game doesn't? Also if you aren't a fan of grinding you can head to microtransactions that I wouldn't reccomend but if you're up for it more power to you! And if you aren't a fan of ethier look to the community for things like FiveM and live out everything you want in a community run server full of funny cool and just over all chill bros. Absolutely love the game and everything you can do with it!,Grand Theft Auto V
2018-09-12,0,0,109,False,Not Recommended,hello there so i have played this games som hours and now i want to review it.first of all this game is great nice storry big world ect.but if you want to play without loging into the social club (piece of that ruins everything thats good about the game)than good luck starring at a blank desktop.i literally tried do play this game for the last 2 months but i had no chance to login for playing because this bastards of socialclub developers didnt let me do this.i buyed this game 2015 i registered it and also at the social club but after 1year break they desidet to lets make his e mail unverified again because why not!i then tryed to verify my e mail every day 1 5 times for about 2 monts now and if you want a support that helps you out? good look getting one because you need a verified e mail!! if it wasnt enogthe that i bought this game on steam and bound it to my google fb and twitter account than i dont know whats the deal for doings so.and yes i use the right e mail and no i did not get a single one. and no its not in my spam folder am not from yesterday.this game is realy good but if you cant get the chance to play it why you gonna want to waist your money?am out thats it. you rockstar!,Grand Theft Auto V
2016-11-24,0,0,243,False,Recommended,The game is fun but I think that once you get most of the missions / heists done it starts to get boring. One thing that I dont get bored of in this game is racing. I wish there was more midifications that you could to do vehicles.I think that the game is worth the penny if its on sale.,Grand Theft Auto V
2017-03-10,0,0,147,False,Recommended,I love this game! Optimization on this title is exceptional especially as compared to GTA IV. Campaign is great but its likely youll experience cheaters every once in a while online.,Grand Theft Auto V
2015-05-02,0,0,119,False,Not Recommended,"GTA Korean MMO Edition. The single player campaign is fantastic but avoid online like the plague. Masses of bugs desync issues server issues etc etc. The code is so bad that friends and I cant even ride in the same car because we both see different things due to desync at any decent speed. Often We would see another player get out of the car and start running away under NPC guidence only to snap back into the action a few seconds later Add to that the fact that to get anywhere in the game requires almost superhuman grinding for levels and money and you have a sandbox with very little to do. Upgrades are hidden behind arbitrary walls for race wins (can join a friend and grind) clan level (seperate xp grind) money (dont have to grind this you can use real money!...or grind) or RP (have a guess....yup grind)Rockstar ""support"" is a joke. I had an issue where my character wouldn't load into the game at all. Searched forums no help. Rockstar are aware of the problem but without a subscription to hold their interest they could give 2 craps. Their ""helpful"" advice is to wait at least 4 hours and try again. I submitted a ticket and got a reply....a week later...asking if i was still having an issue and that was it. Gee thx muchly.The vast majority of players I see in game have glitched or hacked their way to glory due to the incessent grind and have been subsequently banned. This is after mission rewards have been nerfed into the ground. One fitted out car can cost upwards of $1 million. 1 mission will gain you $20k/20 minutes. Including ammo/ armour costs that would be over 20 hours of grind back to back for a car.In Online you have to make your own fun because R* have no intention of providing any.TL DR single player is brilliant online is one long grind.",Grand Theft Auto V
