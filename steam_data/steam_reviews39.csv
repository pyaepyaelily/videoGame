2015-07-18,0,0,2727,True,Recommended,Rust ) the best best i ever played also the most buggy and not optimized game i ever played ) just count....14 euro...2 games old rust legacy and new Rust every week update and they are working not more then 2 years. This game is growing going to be wonderfull but dont expect so much at this time because its still alpha only think that really me off is they are not running old Rust version it was faster with greatest map ever darker atmospheric and easier to play how you like shooting was easier and whole graphics was strange fitting more to radiactive island then new Rust graphics which is more like Borderlands series. Sooooo....if you want somethink to play it everyday with ppl Rust is the Best Choice.....but if you want to play few hours at a week...FiFa or Battlefield is probably for you... Rust gives fun also new internet Friends really great feelling about your own awesomenes....but it will for exchange sucks your time energy and you will forget sleeping for a years )EDIT very important...this game is no more for 2 0 ghz procesors it made old crap from my Xeon 3 0 quadcore 8gb ram 1gb graphics!!!!!its evolving to somethink really big and it will need normal new computers so eveone whos buying this game for low requirements will just suck up....basic and lowest pc to play it on very super low settings is 2 6 dual core 4gb ram 1gb graphic card!!!! i had it and it runs like 20 30 fps after i upgraded pc to 4core xeon fps jumped to 50 but still....i cant play it even on medium settings...soooo..yes it is best survival multiplayer game ever but no you will not play it on cheap notebook only the old version Legacy was pc friendly....you still can play it but bigger player base is obviously now on New version,Rust

2017-07-08,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,I've owned this game since it debuted in 2013 and let me tell you even with all the changes to the games engine it still is a slog to sit through. Nothing you do makes a real difference and that fact is compounded by the fact that any random can ing shoot you dead within a few minutes of building your amazing structure.I'd recommend something like miscreated or Dayz mod for arma 2 if you want a good survival experience.,Rust

2015-02-20,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,Short and to the point. The Legacy version of the game provided hours of naked wagglin' fun. Sadly the new version doesn't improve on the main issue of the hackers and most bugs. If the game allowed for single player I would highly recommend but as the game stands now it's pretty much every other survival game made so far.The lack of zombies is welcomed. So I guess they have that going for them.,Rust

2014-03-19,0,0,28,True,Not Recommended,A unique game and a very fun one at that. A fun one for about a day. The gameplay is pretty unique and extremely entertaining and most of all time consuming. You gotta survive you have to acquire weapons friends resources build a house and basically sustain yourself while other players try to raid your house or simply assassinate you while you're out in the open only to grab your goods and use it for themselves. All this only to be killed by a hacker from across the map then spawn in your house then be killed in a fraction of a second again through a wall and you lose all you've done. Its a great game but the number of hackers is insane. IN. SANE. Every game has hackers but not likt this this is just beyond words. A minimum of 4 hackers on every server. No exaggeration.Verdict Don't waste your time and money on this joke until something is actually done to ban hackers.,Rust

2014-05-03,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Rust is a very unique and creative game with many challanges intact. I enjoy the risks of searching Rad towns and villages exploring the powerplants hunting in the vallys and calling airdrops. Overall Rust lacks a few things protection from hackers and modders are not up to standered. I couldn't count the amount of times I have been found specificly on a map in an impossable to climb hill unless you take a certain path I found about 30 minutes into trying to find. Another downside is that once someone is OP they are next to impossable to kill. That may sound great if you yourself were OP but if the glove was on the other hand you would understand.I would recommend Rust if you are up for challenges and adventure. But don't get to hyped up as it is only in Alpha.,Rust

2014-04-16,0,0,87,True,Recommended,I think this game is perfect priced with a survival rpg gun play 1st person shooter building and realism to a point and i would say the game has a lot of friendly and not so friendly encounters but over all i love the game and rate it a 3 out of 5 (at the current stage). But i would say this game is still only in a early stage and still has a lot of things to be added and bugs to be fixed as a lot of you may know i have 75 hours on this game and cant wait for future updates! Overall i think the game deserves a 3 (at this point in time) it will mostlikely will become a 4 out of 5 they should not limit this great game to PC only it shoud go to XBOX or PS 3/4 tell me if u think i rated fairly.,Rust

2015-06-07,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,I only have bad thing to say about this game. First of. When you join a server you will soon realise that you are on the bottom of the food chain and the only way to get higher up is to raid and hit barrels. After like 10 hours or maybe 2 5 if you have a bit of luck then you MIGHT be able to have a blueprint for a real gun... But that is kind of your only goal when you have gotten yourself a gun then the game is kind of over. 1/10 for the love of god don't buy this game.,Rust

2015-03-01,0,0,386,True,Not Recommended,Rust has had it ups and downs. Currently it. is. bad. They've made everything much harder and time craving with the new updates. You cant demolish buildings stones are almost impossible to find and wolves are still OP as f**k. Speaking of animals before you could run and hit animals with the same speed now you get slowed down slightly when you press the hit button. When the animals travels faster than a speeding bullet getting resorces is impossible. Now we also have to repair the tools you have. REALLY?! It makes the game even more frikkishly annoying and unberable. We also have to find blue prints everywhere in barrels airdrops and whatnot. DOES THE DEVELOPERS JUST LOVE F*CKING UP THEIR GAME? It seems like it. Unless they can find a way to fix these bugs fast as humanly possible I won't recomend this game to anyone who want to have a good time. Side not to the dev team CHANGE IT BACK TO THE PREVIOUS VERSION aka how it was 2 months ago.,Rust

2017-04-10,1,1,7,True,Not Recommended,Wasn't a fan I tried this game out for about 4 days played about 7 hours tried about 12 different servers and it always ended the same. You spawn (and if you don't get murdered right away by a spawn camping troll) you go and collect materials to survive and make tools so you can build a shelter. So you run along getting things you need (if you dont get kiled by a troll) and make a house. Then you have to eat so you go hunt (if you dont get killed by a troll) then you build a fire to cook the meat (if you dont get killed by a troll) from there I cant tell you what you do becuase I kept getting KILLED BY ING TROLLS. Everyone talks no one will help you players attack you on sight for sport you spawn again with nothing and if players dont get you animals will. The game is truely the most frusterating thing I've ever encountered. I usually enjoy games like this and thought this one would be a hit but it comes down to the amount of jackasses playing it that ruins the game.,Rust

Although it currently has yet to break away from Alpha stage this game does not dissapoint. Personally owning a mac which is not the ultimate gaming machine I can say that this game does not lag.

With these items you must become civilized with clothing a shelter and a abundant supply of food and drink. Beware humans can be your worst enemy in rust!,Rust
2014-01-15,0,0,48,True,Recommended,Great survival game that mixes elements from DayZ and Minecraft. About a 1 hour learning curve playing solo but the game is intuitive and fairly simple once you get the hang of it.The PVP is a strong selling point for the game. Once you have gathered and crafted resources built up a base you and some friends can start raiding other groups' villages and loot all their belongings or of course you can just be friendly and build up an empire and recruit. Your choice! Which is another pretty cool feature of the game.,Rust
2014-04-29,0,0,840,True,Recommended,Rust Legacy (1st one) It is very good the grafic are great. when it is dark out I would not recomend having the grafic at Max because you wont see anything without light. The game is a time to win game where the longer you play on the game the stronger you become and also skills will also come into play.Rust Experimental (new verison) The new version really puts the Sandbox world into Rust unlike Rust Legacy you dont need the time and effort to dominate the server all you need is some players a good spawn (Forest Grasslands) and you will have everything you need. Because there is no C4 Gernades Mods or Defences. you can break into a house with a rock (Given you have enough time) As the game progreses I am sure the dificulty of defeneding and attacking houses will be changed.,Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,58,True,Recommended,After getting over fears of what other people were saying about the PvP aspect I decided to purchase this game. To my surprise it's actually quite fun. My friend owns a server and we host a very popular Arena PvP event that satisfies the psychos need to kill poor people pretty well. That being said never trust anyone who you don't know and never leave your house with anything you don't want to lose. You can find servers with a lot of friendly people but even still the jerks like ruining anything that can in any way possible. Playing alone 6.5/10.Playing with friends 8.5/10.Remember it is still just an Aplha. It is rather buggy and basic but that doesn't mean you can't have fun.,Rust

The guns have ZERO recoil so someone with 1 hour play time can just spray an AK and kill you you should have left the guns as they were they were all fair and not broken. I wouldnt reccommend buying this game. It lags the updates are complete rubbish and the game no longer requires anymore skill to play. But then again i guess all the squeeky kids can play!

It's best to go as a group in order to gather resources and hold your ground.Even if your only interest is in the PVP servers I strongly advise that you visit the Building only servers.

There is no SP mode and there is still a huge memory leak from 2 years ago in a different version. I miss Legacy when some C4 and a shotty would mean you ruled a server.

2016-05-06,1,1,1,True,Not Recommended,This is one of those cases where something that should be minor ruins a game.I used to play this game a while back when the only available character was generic white man that everyone else had. But they added race and gender at some point. Which is great! Except one thing.You can't change your character. At all. If it changed every time you spawned I'd be okay with it. But it's perminant on your account. I don't care about the race of 'size' thing. I just wanted to be a female character. That's all I want. But I can't.,Rust

Its impossible to get into this game.Once I built a base. Literally 10 min later guys came with a flamethrower and burned down the door and shot me. Yeh again impossible to get into this game if you get killed everytime you try to make some sort of a start. Killed even when im carrying nothing valuable!Community ruins the game.

2016-12-16,0,0,1093,True,Recommended,So why is the community in Rust particularly intense? Well it s a super stressful game. Anyone can kill you at any moment and take everything you ve worked for. At best you have a verbal agreement with someone and all you can do is hope that they don t betray you. Rust is turned into more than a survival game it s a social experiment in humanity. It s an exercise in trust stress loss and disappointment all the time.if you love to farm on hours on end this is the game for you,Rust
2016-08-22,1,1,23,True,Recommended,It's a funny and great game however you really do want to play with friends. Those who cry about clans being OP need to wake up and actually talk about the flaws of the game and the benefits of owning this game. For example the flaws are the poor optimization and the lack of stability of the game which ends up with quite a few glitches per day. However the benifits of owning a game such as Rust is that you can enjoy playing a game which has such a little developers team to play with friends and just have a laugh. I would only suggest that the Dev team worry about the glitches for now the ones that they can fix anyway. THEN they should worry about adding new things if they update the game and add more and more things without fixing glitches and errors I have a bad feeling that people will spend time catching up instead of just playing the game whilst things are being stabilized. Honestly in my opinion I would recommend this game as long as you don't mind losing your gear and to be honest if you can put up with glitches then yeah enjoy the game. Once again it's not about the clans it's about the game itself and how it's being developed as a game in a whole.#CarryOnFacePunch,Rust

2016-12-08,0,0,371,False,Not Recommended,Pros Interesting mechanics Addictive Gameplay (Could be considered a con) Large mod community for various kinds of players Really fun with a few friendsCons Some mechanics actively encourage griefing and toxic behaviour. There is little to no effort by the devs to encourage positive/friendly behaviour. Made for people with a lot of time not skill or wits. (The players who play a few hours a week are devoured and toyed with by the players who play half a day every day) Quite as solo no servers are properly made/balanced for solo playIts almost a good game but it is quite clear the devs prioritize making stuff that will enslave players to play longer rather than make the game a bit more balanced and friendly. This is game that literally makes money by encouraging players to grief each other.

2016-02-27,0,0,749,True,Not Recommended,Don't bother buying. Almost 200 hrs of playtime so I don't give this review lightly.Great game but the devs don't listen to community about bug issues and the bears/ wolves are OP. Max HP n gun won't help you when they spawn on top of you.Animals have the ability to walk through walls doors buildings rocks and will kill you when you're sleeping in your base. That's a known bug for over a year.If those issues were ever fixed ... I'd happily reccomend this game until then watch the forums to see if fixed. Other than that its a great game ... I should say the basis for a great game as in it lacks any kind of transportation system.Hopefully the devs will see this and maybe actually fix something to make it playable again.,Rust

If you understand as this page clearly states that you may run into issues because this is hardly a finished game then you will have a lot of fun. It has been frustrating but I cannot walk away.

2014-01-25,0,0,753,True,Recommended,"My old review had become...well old. Time again for a refresh. I'm one of the ""old"" players the ones who were around when people were still trying to figure out what this new fangled ""Early Access"" crap was. I've been with Rust since the days when there was only one map the rock lasted for ever and the sun meant salvation (praise be). So...I know what I'm talking about (my hours prove it).BREAKDOWN (for lazy bums) Rust is a survival game. You hit trees rocks people...yeah you get the picture. It's good. Buy it. Don't become a tower sniper or I KEEL YOU.PROS Great dev team. These guys (unlike literally every other survival game dev team who are out to rob you and run) deliver on promises and are constantly improving the game. Landscape. Rust has very good graphics (unless you run on a potato in which case it might be time to upgrade that Apple 1 you're running it on and stop blaming the servers) which makes the landscapes turn out nice. Trees water mountains...all very capturing. Brings a tear to my virtual eye. Player interaction. This all really depends on what kind of player YOU are. If you're a COD/CS GO player who wants to make some guns and ""rock and roll"" then you should OFF and go back to playing that because we don't need more trigger happy animals running around. If you're a sweet farmer who wants to peacefully build you will likely be chewed up and destroyed.If you're an engineer or minecraft player you'll enjoy this game because building is logical and similar.If you are a trader forget every server except RP ones.If you enjoy a game that gives you stories like DayZ this is the one for you. Hell here's a story right now. I was the leader of the Knights Templar Legion X Arcani BARON Oil and the Father Abbot of the Church of the Great Divine One in the Sky all in the span of like 4 months in Rust (all were successful except for Legion X because of a Roman crackdown). RP Servers. By far the best portion of the players in this game go to the roleplay servers. I highly recommend finding one and playing on those. You can even meet devs or s (looking at you Maejohl (jk I love you don't kill me))CONS Lag. Yep. I'm complaining about lag (gunshot). Grinding. It must be said. This game requires some devotion on non modded server for solo or small group players. I'd recommend not setting extreme goals which need millions of resources to accomplish or it just won't be fun. Incentive not to KOS. This is a biggie. I feel like crafting needs new directions like those in Life is Feudal that take awhile to acquire and make people specialists in some fields (herbalist cook mason miner weaponsmith jeweller...) After all killing a master mason isn't the best move when you need a house. Lack of Dynamic Weather. Rain and snow just don't cut it (and meteor showers but 'em). I want a sea storm from hell or an earthquake that devastates the land. No vehicles yet. I WANT SHIPS AND CARS GODAMMIT. Caves. These BS ground caverns are the first places to be taken on a server and are ridiculously easy to fortify. That being said the problem is that there are only like 3 per map. I'd like to see 30 40 caves per map not exactly minechafts or dwarven expanses but something to light a fire in and get out of the rain with. BP (blueprint) system is a . This needs a complete revision (which the devs have planned).MIXED BLESSINGS Building. Don't get me wrong I like Rust's building system a LOT more than some others but there are a few minor problems. Certain locations won't let you place a wall or roof when there's an open space after you BUILT A 20 ING STORY WALL. Another problem is not being able to connect a building to the landscape too well (building a wall into a rock) but that's slowly being fixed. Slowly. Landscape Altering. I want the ability to at least smooth land temporarily to place a building or cut that pesky hill off the top of a mountain so I can make my mountain retreat. Or summer home below. Or maybe a slave plantation like I did that one time (don't ask but people DID volunteer to be slaves.) Radtowns. They can be walled off they're for the most part inaccessible (building wise) ugly and the bp's they have require you to visit them and die multiple times. Still they provide a break from an otherwise endless tour of forest snow and desert. And the Sphere rocks. If you read this to the end Congratulations!

2017-03-20,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,Well I gave it a shot. After wandering around for a good 90 minutes beating a rock against trees and getting killed over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again (presumably my rocks were the best rocks and everybody really wanted them) I have to say this game is one of the most boring ways I've wasted 90 minutes in recent memory. There looks like there might be a robust crafting system but as you need more than just wood to craft just about anything I couldn't craft since the only resource available within a lifetime's walking distance is just more wood. I did one time find a differently colored rock which yielded some other rocks when I smashed it with my rock but of course I did not have time to figure out if that helped me as I'd exceeded the 12 seconds allowed between deaths and was overdue for the bullet I caught from somebody somewhere hopefully they were able to use my rocks?

2016-06-05,0,0,497,True,Not Recommended,Me and my enitire team went to an official server to build an epic base. we met this guys called s7en Civility. Civility was one of those edgy players who nobody likes and we had about 20 people together ready to raid him. We saw him as a worthy oponent because he to had a large team but he would backstab his allies and kos people who would help him. Everyone who hated him joined us and we probably had about 20 and many explosives to build rockets. We where scouting some land near civ and we him and a small group we decided to attack him... we came around a rock completely silent after sneaking behind it and as soon as we peak 2 guys rush us with aks. my friend goes down and i run into the crevice of a rock after i got far enough away. After a little bit Civ comes around the corner and pre fires me. He has what some people people know as esp hacks where he can see entities through walls including players. the entire server knows he cheats and has been reported many many times. you guys have yet to take action and he cheats so blatently please ban this player.

2016-06-17,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Rust Online game about surviving in the wild. To grow and develop you will have all the time to communicate with the outside world to collect wood coal plants food crafting weapons and more. Since the main purpose of this game it is survival you have to exert a lot of effort to avoid death from other players. Most gamers do not like to bother and just kill everybody and take valuables. Thus it is possible to reduce the time and resources to craft collection but on the other hand you can blacklist and open the hunt.,Rust

2014-04-09,0,0,238,True,Recommended,This game is a fantastic mix of Minecraft and DayZ. Hunting and gathering materials and building massive structures are very similar to Minecraft. The massive open world environment and harsh community are similar to DayZ. This game does take a massive amount of time however as you can play for up to 6 hours at a time and not run out of stuff to do. My only complaint is the removal of the zombies and the horrible degradation mechanic where items continuously degrade overtime until they can not be repaired again. Besides this Rust is one of the best games I have ever played and I am excited for what it will become in the future.,Rust

2016-04-24,0,0,45,True,Not Recommended,This game is not ment for solo play at all! I got this game a while back and just started playing for the first time when I read about the updates it had. Ive watched countless hours of good fun game play. Most of these videos included friendly team efforts and everyone having a fun time. I on the other hand have played about 17 hours on a single server. The server got wiped about 5 days ago and I have not made a single dent in the game. Two of my bases have been taken. Once I had to leave for 30 minutes mid build and when I came back I was dead and my base stolen. The other bases I spent 3 hours finding a spot and making the base. 3 guys basically walked in destroyed my sleeping bag and killed me. I absoultley hate this game! If you want to play by your self just dont buy this game! To many people have groups of two to five guys who will kill you. I guess this game would be easier to play with you had a friend.,Rust

In a large bowl whisk together the flour sugar baking powder salt and nutmeg.2. In another bowl beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes and the undersides are golden brown about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit or chocolate chips nuts etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more being careful not to burn toppings.,Rust

2015-05-25,0,0,100,True,Recommended,"Note This game will most likely force you to come back and check up on your character and your property only buy this game if you have a lot of free time.Story The year is 2025 after the Five Nights at Freddy's Fans taken over Garry's mod with their Steam workshop items relating to Scott's game King Garry has been overthrown and Garry's mod has been changed into Freddy's mod. Garry and a million other players escaped the F.N.A.F regime and traveled to the islands know as Rust. However the planes containing Garry and his players have crashed all over the islands. Garry managed to collect the players and promised to make a new game with no animatronics no maps relating to Chuck E Cheeses and no jumpscares. However King Garry was killed by his players due to the fact that he promised a game with paid mods. With no leader to control the people the players split up forming cities and houses in an attempt to survive the islands of Rust. However the players started to become vicious cannibals and bandits killing other humans for their resources which led to people distrusting other neighbors and making weapon blueprints to fend off the intruders. This went on for months until one day a bandit had made the ultimate weapon blueprint ""The Atom Bomb"". This weapon was capable of destroying any fortress and also leaving off a permanent area of radiation. The bandit and a group of his friends traveled to each island and blew up every urban building. The sound of The Atom Bomb had reached all the way to the Steam Community and made Lord Gaben concerned. To help the survivors of the explosion Lord Gaben has sent half a million pilots to drop supplies onto random areas of the islands. This only made matters worst as the Rust inhabitants fight off against each other to secure the goods. With no hope of helping these animals in the jungle Gaben purged all the inhabitants and allowed Facepunch Studios to have all rights to the islands. Facepunch use the events that happened in the islands and made the early access game called Rust to commemorate that tragic events that happened.Review Rust is a first person survival game that allows players to collect resources and expand their shelters to defend themselves against other players. In this game you can't trust anyone except the people you teamed up with like steam friends and other friendly people. In my opinion the fear of getting killed or having your shelter destroyed is one of the most important aspects in making the game fun especially when your collected resources is at risk of getting stolen. Another aspect that makes this game unique than the other survival games out there on the market is that you have the freedom to uncensor a Since now a days the media shows uncensored female parts why not uncensor a mans genitalia. The only problem I have with this game is that it forces me to come back and check up on my character and property just to make sure everything is okay which can really interfere with my schedule. This game features Wild naked people Thrilling survival experience and randomly generated large maps to explore. Considering that this game is also a sandbox game don't let creativity get to you. It's best to make something simple like a house so that you wont waste enough resources plus resources are hard to come by depending your location. I only recommend this game to people who have a lot of free time on their schedules.Cost $19.99Rating 83/100 Great",Rust

2014-02-19,0,0,40,True,Not Recommended,In this game it is necessary that you have group of friends to survive with. doing this by yourself would mean that you would die from bandits very shortly or even die from starvation. friends are necessary than being by yourself. the other thing i should mention is that there havent been any updates for a couple of months so probably the devs just lied to us about that they will update it. never buy this game,Rust
2014-11-18,0,0,396,True,Not Recommended,Rust is actually a fun game..but what sucks about it is that the game is littered with hackers and it's not your normal aimbot hackers. These hackers can fly speed run super jump shoot through walls see people EVERYWHERE on the map see EVERYONES storage chests and go through walls. When a hacker can do the same things an admin should only do..you know the game has a problem. Good luck finding a server that doesnt have hackers and has fair active admins. It's nearly impossible..and you'll end up getting frusterated with finding just a good server.,Rust

2014-02-08,0,0,49,True,Recommended,Rust is the type of game in which you need the maximum amount of patience to have a good time. So when you start off you have 1 torch 2 med kits and a rock. You have to get materials mainly wood to make a house tools and weapons to defend yourself. If you dont like PvP you can find some PvE servers ( player versus enemy ). That way the only thing that can kill you are the ridicoulousy strong bears and the hella fast wolves. Once you get a house you need to make some weapons to kill animals and other people ( when the time comes ). Animals will give you cloth and food which you still need to cook and players will give you anything that was in their invenory at the time of their death. For me i was killed a lot upon respawn so i suggest right when you spawn you move to a safe area thats not out in the open. This game was a 9.75/10 AcidThunder,Rust

You can experience the updates!At the moment there aren't really alot of big updates but I love reading the dev blogs and looking forward to play the new content!Now this game is brutal. As in Don't whine about losing.Seems harsh but when playing on a server even noob friendly you are going to die. alot.Ofcourse this will suck. alot.But as you play more and more of this game you will get better and know how to defend yourself after getting your base raided a few times you learn and start to see the raids as feedback what to do different.I've met alot of noobs who kept complaining about dieing but as soon as they got geared up they enjoyed killing other players and forgot that they were beginners one day as well. So it does show some human instincts.Also when you have a base and gear the current end game content is PVP. Don't complain when you are killed just start over and try to get revenge. When someone kills you don't spam the chat claiming someone is hacking they aren't 9 10 times. They just got you. If you do choose to whine and calling people hackers you won't be taken serious. They will treat you like a 11 year old. I've seen 5 6 players who kept spamming about people being hackers everyone got tired of them and started hating them admins banned them for bad behaviour. If you get killed just say something as ""Well played!"" it is sportmanship if you kill someone you are happy about it as well so try to stay friendly and you will have a great time in rust.The game is kind of blank at the moment the biggest content is PVP which is great fun. Don't expect to much besides the PVP but it has great potential worth an investment right now if it is to blank for you wait 2 3 months and try again with the new content )For me this is one of my most fun games espescially to play with friends!",Rust

2017-01-23,0,0,204,True,Recommended,Very fun game but gets repetitive The game lacks qute alot of content but developers have said there will be things like electricity added.The game can be completed in a short space of time maybe a week or 2 depending how much you play.The gun shooting is really fun and quite hard to get the grip off but you can do it also guns are nice looking.The graphics in the game are very nice but the game runs quite bad maybe about 40 percent better than ARK.To be honest i would only maybe 10 pounds max on this game until more content is added but overall with friends is a very fun game with nice clothing weapons building raiding.Would recommend this game if you dont play games for long and dont mind waiting for content to be added otherwise dont buy it.Too be honest i was bored within 2 months of playing and ocassionally play now and again to try new weapons and items.,Rust

The grass is an annoyance that you can just turn off with the game breaking console. The official servers are unmoderated and unplayable due to hackers. Which basically forces people to pay for their own servers since they can't host their own.This game is a massive cash grab and the devs themselves have said they're going to pretty much scrap rust as it is now anyways. I'm sure I've wasted my money buying this as it probably won't be long before the devs decide they've made enough money and ignore this game entirely.,Rust

On normal servers (really and server) unless you have a group of more than 5 people lpaying with you you wont enjoy the game. You spawn in with a rock and a torch attempting to make tools and a house for yourself. But everyone in the community is kill on site and will not be friendly to you. The maps are really small for the amount of players on it for you to feel anywhere close to safe to go out and get materials. Everyone else will have armor and very good weapons while you are naked and have a rock. Unless you are a masochist and love dieing for no reason dont buy.,Rust

2015-11-13,0,0,212,True,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you.,Rust

2015-01-31,0,0,1715,True,Not Recommended,It saddens me to give Rust a negative review because it used to be a great game. With the new implementation of the XP system it's much more difficult to enjoy the game without investing a significant amount of time into farming resources which is very boring and repetitive. I don't recommend this game for a few reasons one being time spent. You can play this on unofficial servers where things don't take as long to accomplish but either way it leads to my primary problem. Those that spend more time than you will always beat you regardless of your skill. There is such a large spike of power as you progress gaining access to certain items and weapons. If you enjoy hitting nodes and trees for literally hours this is the game for you.,Rust

There are some bugs yeah but not as many as most of the full games on the market has.It's super fun game to play but it does require a lot of time especially if you play vanilla and there is only one month before every wipe.I would like to see some mode where you could make a custom game like a singleplayer game and you would have unlimited everything so you could basically learn the basics in there. I know there are modded servers but I mean one where no one else could join and you wouldnt have to harvest that much or at all.Make this game even better and it's the game of the year or even game of the century&lt 3,Rust

2014-07-18,0,0,19,True,Recommended,This game has a lot of potential.The overall idea/setup is really great.Of course it is an early access so this migth change but the game lacks a few things. Survival is really great. I would even add more to it like thirst and stamina would be great in my opinion. Gameplay quite fun but needs more FPS like behaviors for the player character. Resources While the ressource system is ok it lacks some more ressource types in my opinion. Could have some rarity as well for some new ressource types. Items Lots of items seems useless Like lots of food like items... While all animals drops chicken meat... Hackers I've seen a few hackers so far. Quite annoying... Building options Quite ok for early access but it definetely needs more depth...Overall the game is quite fun I recommend it if you don't mind too much for all the things mentionned above.If you have friends to play with it sure is a lot of fun.,Rust

I logged in after work to find i had been killed okay that's fine it is Rust after all they happened to be in my house when i logged back in a i spawnded in my sleeping bag. i clubbed them to death with my trusty rock. then after 30 seconds they were back trying to kill me again so i threw my spear at them and killed them a second time. then the SAME person was back AGAIN within another 30 seconds. now i know that sleeping bags allow you to respawn but there is a timer to it. plus when they first killed me it was with an axe which they didnt have on their body. and when they came back the second time they were armed with a spear and it takes time and 300 wood to make one of those. so with my little rant over i must say as a game Rust is amazing even in its early(ish) state but the hackers definitely ruin the game. i've had too many run ins with them in my short time playing and because of that i dont think i will be playing it again for a while but definitely give the game a try if you find it on sale and want to give it a go just be warned that the hackers are everywhere. so i give the games a thumbs up because it is awesome. thank you have a nice day.,Rust

2016-02-07,0,0,71,True,Not Recommended,This game has the most infected community I have ever seen in game. If you like Warz or H1Z1 then you might like this (Without zombies tho). This game is bad in my opinion it is a game where you are suppose to be a bully to survive. Don't have anything? Does not matter a guy with a big sniper will shoot you anyway. Just spawned with a rock at the beach? You are right now a sport to kill for players without any life aka no jobb or school what so ever to take time from them. If you work/school or any other reason can't be online 24/7 than I DON*T recommend this game. If you have like 5 friends or more playing to guard you while you are offline than sure. Perhaps you will survive.,Rust

The server I am on is relatively small to lessen the chances of getting into an encounter. My Listu Pros No Zombies Just good ol' fashioned mother nature and a server filled with s all to ready to teabag and loot your corpse to contend with!Once you pick up the basics it becomes easier to follow and understandNatural land generation makes for beautiful surroundings.Hunting is fairly realistic (unless said prey is stuck on an invisible wall).Constant look out on your overall condition and what factors bode ill for you.Loot is fairly hard to find outside of RAD towns and Airdrops making them more contended and a definite target.Cons Blueprints are rare as balls even in places you'd expect to find them.Forging is a process which takes too much time and way too many resources for minimal turn out making it a bit of a chore.Random spawning can sometimes drop you right next to players all too ready to paint the surrounding area with your innards frustrating for new players.The building system can be extremely confusing for novice players.The randomly spawning Prefabs are often just for show outside of RAD towns making them nothing more than disappointing landmarks.Often not enough warning about dangerous animals being nearby (They should be louder and growl/bark when they are charging giving you time to react).You can't see someones name until you're literally close enough to lick them. Making friendly fire a constant issue as people panic.,Rust

2016-02-04,0,0,129,True,Not Recommended,In my opinion this piece of game.. how many years in development and its still a buggy glitchy horible example of early release games on steam. not only has the new up dates ed the resolution to where i must play in fantasic and windowed otherwise i get a crash 2 min into gameplay. regardless if i do it or not the game still crashes. 10 15 min to load a server to be dissapointed time after time. a year ago when i bought it was worth the money but now its an unplayable POS that takes up space. you want a honest opinion. garry for releasing an unstable game and only tweaking that is not of urgent importance. but besides that. the maps are large beautiful endless. the concept is great but raiding is utter t. so dont plan on building a master project because someone WILL come along to purposly destroy all your work.,Rust

2014-06-24,0,0,207,True,Not Recommended,Taking in my experience of Rust so far I cannot recommend this game to the average player. To skip right to the point the only reason anyone would want to buy this game is for the basebuilding and communication between players. Combat collecting resources walking(Moving in general) etc is completely unenjoyable. The lag is so bad in some of the servers (Primarily the offical server) that you may glitch backwards and or be unaware of a players location as well as your own players at any given point. This server lag is unbearable as well as destroys attempts at combat gather resources... This is only one of the major problems with Rust hacking is another huge reason. You will find a hacker on every server (Official Servers) Its unaviodable and destroys the survivor experience. The admins of these servers are hardly on and if you want to report a hacker you need video proof. Most people will not go through the work of taking and sending a video to ban another hacker so these hackers aren't leaving. In combination of the lag and hacking this game is very unenjoyable. I highly do not recommend this game unless you are tolerant easy going care free etc. If you are going to purchase this game don't play on official servers even though there are fewer people you may more vastly enjoy the game with a decrease in lag and hackers.,Rust

2014-01-08,0,0,26,False,Not Recommended,About as much fun as hitting a tree with a rock which is incidently what you'll be doing a lot of.Maybe when it's fleshed out it'll be a good game. I personally enjoy DayZ a lot more as there are so many different situations you can find yourself in (taking hostages bandit hunting being a bandit etc). In this game it's pretty much KOS or wander round with a randomer (or a friend if you can find them) hitting rocks with rocks to get rocks.Also while I realise this is a survival game I found it almost impossible to meet with friends. Although I'm sure if you bothered to learn the map layout you would eventually.A plus to this game is housing though which is implemented pretty well.All in all not a terrible game but definitely not outstanding in its current state but I suppose it is early access things will change (and hopefully improve).5/10EDIT Yeah even at release 3/10EDIT2 Also DayZ,Rust

That really is this game in a nutshell if you're not in a good area.But really this game is GOOD in my opinion. It's fun and you have alot of things to do wipes let you start a new playthrough and so on. I think the problem with this game are the players who already have a gigantic base and good gear who kill newborn (A.K.A freshly respawned people) who just want to start the game. Also i think going back to the blueprint system in this game is a PAIN. IN. THE. you have to find blueprints for every major thing you must craft to progress in the game and boy i sure had a ING GREAT TIME trying to find some.7/10,Rust

It's biggest downfall is the community hackers and griefers plague nearly every server luring newer players to them with promises to help get them started. The promises fall short new player gets killed and you repeat that for about an hour (or however long you can tolerate it).All in all even though the game is in it's Alpha stages this game just isn't fun and i don't foresee it getting any better in the near future.

If you have any level of humanity you will probably lose it playing this game I know I have lost most of mine. When I play this game I try to be kind generous and cater to new players. This is very hard when 90% of people kill on sight and want to make your gaming experience a living hell. I will say this if you can find the right server with the right people and admins this game can be a complete blast.

2017-09-03,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I've played ARK since it was about the same stage this game is now and there is just no comparison this game is NOT a serious competitor.I probably would've spent longer trying to hammer through the usual noob confusion but this game has no single player mode which means no pausing while I Google all the things I need to know (since of course there are no tutorials yet) and also constant profanity and if I dare to ask a question verbal abuse from the other players. Toxic playerbases are the rule not the exception this is a constant in MMO gaming so I feel that a singleplayer mode is essential for those people who don't like to constantly cuss fight with everyone around them. I won't be trying it again until there is one.I'll check back in a few months. Until then my two cents If you have twenty bucks to burn buying games in this stage is always cheaper. But this particular one unlike some others I've played isn't very well done at this stage so buy now and maybe it'll be worth playing someday.,Rust

Also stop putting a middle finger to the people that ACTUALLY WANT YOUR GAME TO BE ING GOOD.

Some people just can't handle it because everything in this game has weight. every gun every stack of wood each syringe you have has to be farmed or found giving it meaning. The only thing you sart with is a rock and a torch. Everything has to be earned found or stolen. You die and you are back to that rock. The crushing weight of failure will either make you actually kill yourself or make you stronger (after about a week of depression the first time around it gets better).Go out and buy this game it's a blast! (PS Trust No one. Not even your own brother. Girls are ok though they usually only farm and sort boxes. Just watch out if she got a black boyfriend stalking her he gonna fight you XD. ) Ask any Rust Vet they will tell you this is all true. If they don't they haven't played enough or are sheltered in some huge 30 person clan and will never see the light through all thier cancer. Peace Futures Nakeds",Rust

2016-08-11,0,0,45,True,Recommended,Fun survival game especially with friends! Just be prepared to fight others off if you're in a decent populated server. Things can get pretty hectic! You have to fortify and lay out defenses for your base while figuring out how to do this and stay alive with all your stuff while logged out when you eventually stop playing. I know that sounds intense and nerve racking! Because it is! That's what makes the game soo great though! Real people trying to steal and take your stuff while you're gone or aka sleeping ingame. It makes you feel like you need to be active in your game or your stuff will get taken unless you can stop invaders with traps and strong bases. That's why I recommed it! The game is interesting and can fully come to life with an active community. Just remember it depends on your server for how many people you'll have to worry about. Anyways I rate this game 8/10. It would have gotten more if it wasn't rage inducing to lose things sometimes...,Rust

2016-09-21,0,0,112,True,Not Recommended,I can't get anywhere in this game unless its a modded server. As soon as I spawn in a server there is somebody who is eons ahead of me. I have over 100 hours invested in this game and haven't been able to get a gun. I haven't been able to build a base without finishing it. People are in groups of 5 or more on this game that make monstrous bases and I can't seem to get any leverage and nobody wants trusts anybody to invite the new guy in. Its a fun game but you have to spend hours and days on it just to watch your hardwork be wiped or get destroyed by other players.If I was actually able to kill somebody or make a gun or get leverage on somebody then there would be a fighting chance. Ive wasted so much time and have given this game so many chances. Its just not worth my time at this point...,Rust

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter white sugar brown sugar water cinnamon and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.,Rust
2016-03-05,0,0,634,True,Recommended,After playing hours of Rust this is my review.Pros 1 Game is so fun if you have your friends(or better if you can make friends out of this game).2 Crafting is simple and fun.3 Voicechat over game.4 Killing naked people has never been more fun.5 Crafting better guns is a big factor of winning a gunfight.6 Active community.7 Updates.Cons 1 Game performance is somehow poor on rainy days or inside big buildings.2 Game takes a sh*tload of time to load.3 Bears/Wolves somehow can get inside the building.Overall 9.5/10 would crush naked people with rock and get killed by a bear inside my house again.,Rust

This was all built for nothing and was gone in about 10 minutes when the biggest clan raided me last night. I totaly hate this game but i totaly love it to. In Rust we dont trust and we do what we must.This is a game for the cs gamer with a sense of inovation and creativity. 10/10,Rust
2017-07-25,0,0,46,True,Recommended,think of it like minecraft ark and just a hint of skyrim combined to make one awsome survival game.... you are a naked man stranded on a beach woth nothing but a rock and a torch. you use that rock to cut trees mine stone sulfer and metal. after mining you can build/upgrade a base and add defenses like turrents and traps. once you get eneouph weapons and gear you can go to other bases and raid them to steal all there stuff and maybe even kill them if there online,Rust

2016-04-22,0,0,580,True,Recommended,I'd like to start off this review by saying that at the time of writing this I've only played around 20 hours so my opinions are subject to change (but I don't think they will). Primarily something which annoys me about the negatives reviews of this game is just how whiny they are. Oh no you can't choose your gender or skin color? Who the hell cares its a first person game anyways. Just put some armor on and you cant see what you are congrats. Also people complain about getting shot repeatedly as if they don't understand that that is exactly what the game is. Regardless you can circumvent that by just joining a nice semi populated community server. The first server I found was super friendly and no one RKed so the people complaining probably haven't tried to find a good server.Regardless I feel that this game is worth anyone's time. Buy it it's fun.,Rust

2016-06-02,0,0,590,True,Recommended,"After playing the game for some time it has come to my attention that Rust is in possession of the worst survival community of them all. In no other game will you be shoot in cold blood so many times as in Rust. "" You're a freshspawn they don't care they 'shoot to have fun'. ""Perhaps it's the children within these that haunts every survival game of existence. For me Rust is a unpolished diamond there are some serious issues that has to be resolved for the game to be worth your money. But that being said I still don't regret my purchase. Hell I'd even buy another copy to prove my point. The game is simply unbeatable if and when compared to other survival shooters out there. It feel the most polished and even when counting its flaws people can get a lot of fun out of it.If you're planing on buying the game I'd suggest you'd want until the animal AI has been patched (fixed). At the moment as of writing this review I've been killed more than a few times from bears or even wolfs that're running strait through my base and killing me whilst I am either sleeping walking or crafting. You aren't safe unless you construct a base consisting of at least 2 levels (top one to sleep on). Not to mention that they some times just spawn strait in front of you and as such happens you're most likely not going to have the proper equipment in hand to take the bear/wolf down.It's a shame really that Garry doesn't priorities this in front of any form of weapon attachments and or a XP system.In terms of value for your money there is some but perhaps not enough to justify its price. I'll let you decide whether Rust is worth your money or not.",Rust

2016-07-29,0,0,120,True,Recommended,After playign this game for 30(+) hours I can safely say that this is one of if not the best survival game i have ever played. HOWEVER It's core gameplay is held back by 3 things game crashing bugs( as this is an alpha) graphical errors where textures will look like they came off a PS2 and the abrasive community. At it's very best Rust is an excellent survival game with smart crafting and Exp mechanics where you find satisfaction in every inch of progress you make whether alone or with friends that you've made. The world is beautiful and interesting while also being frightening and hostile. You have dynamic interactions with other players where you have to talk and act as you would in real life in order to make allies save your own skin or kill to survive. At its worst Rust is an uneven ugly cluster**** of more powerful players mowing down noobs before they can even begin building a base all while your framrate drops and your character stops moving i nthe middle of a firefight right as you crash. This game is VERY frustrating however once you push through the first few hours or so on a single server and you begin building yourself up you begin to see the fun in everything you do the pulse pounding stress of whether your base is going to be raided the race against tiem when you went out with all your gear and a helicopter shows up the fight against a bear who happened to be near an airdrop with life saving resources and weapons. All of these make the game so unique in that you never know whats going to happen next. Overall I say get it now or if you're skeptical wait until it's on sale. Overall I give it an 8 1/2 out of 10.,Rust

2016-02-28,0,0,515,True,Recommended,"I highly enjoy this game because of it's great dev team and astounding progression and different ways to go about said progression.You start out completely naked with nothing else but a rock and a torch. Its from this point right here how you decide to progress. You can progress by gathering materials making yourself a nice home with a metal door and codelock or you can make yourself a bow and some bandages and kill other starting players for their materials. You can also sit by monuments and farm blueprints which allow you to make a specific item and that knowledge to make said item stays with you no matter what until there is a server wipe or you exit to a different server. No matter what method you use of getting higher in the game People will attempt to kill you or break into your home and take everything you own.What makes this game so enjoyable is the fact that it just gives you the tools and the community itself makes about 90% of the game. This game is made for the community to build on it. There are raiders people who build impregnable bases and camp their tower all day firing at people and people who partner with others to stab them in the back within 1 hour 1 week. You shouldn't feel bad for killing anyone and I mean anyone. Whether it comes to killing new spawned people or fully geared assailants you shouldn't feel bad for killing anyone.Now you may say ""Why should I kill a newly spawned player? They can't hurt me and they aren't a threat"". Although this is true at the time it's what they're gonna do TOMORROW is what matters. You battle for resources and eventually if he outfarms you you are on the losing hand and you have to waste more materials protecting yourself against them. So you've farmed up and geared yourself with metal and everything needed. What next? Raiding. Raiding is the main endgame of rust and it still manages to keep things interesting no matter what. You may find a base with so many walls and defenses it may just be full of so much loot and goodies that you can't wait to start to invade their home. Or you may hate someone so much because they stole your stuff drew hilarious signs in front of your house or are just straight up disgusting bandits that probably need a lesson. All fixed with a little clever invasion strategy. To invade someone you need to know a few basics. 1. The base layout. How large is their base? How many walls are there? What kind of walls are they? Do I have the materials to get inside? Are they online? Can they retaliate?2. Invasion tools. There are MANY tools you can use to invade someone's home. If they don't have a tool cupboard you can build straight over their main walls. What if they have a roof? Find the weakest spot of the base and use any explosive you have to attempt to get inside. The tools you will most likely use to break in are C4 Rockets paired with a Rocket Launcher Grenades or pickaxes/axes/bone clubs.3. A raid base. One of the most important things when raiding is a small base you create to make yourself a spawning point extra materials and a safe place to keep all the enemy's stolen belongings.There is so much more to this game. Finding weapons exploring monuments and clever decision making in dangerous situations is what builds a smart player in Rust. Always think a situation through and never trust anyone holding a gun shouting ""Stop for a second"".",Rust

It allows for a lot of creativity and building your house so it is difficult to raid for others is its own puzzle game (I do hope traps will be included in the future).

Saddly a lot of people hacking and you start being paranoid.If you are playing alone(just like me) get ready to trash 100 hours and become a war veteran mature. I have a really important advice for you if you are really gonna buy this game. 1 It is best if you can play this game with your friends(lol definetly play with your friends)2 You do not have to play in the official servers. There are also modded servers and some of them are really fun.Im saying this because life in vanilla servers are REALLY REALLY REALLY harsh. And if you are playing alone you will eventually erase the game swearing.(most of the people in these comments which has around 10 100 hours are not happy because of this reason)In my opinion this game still worths the price and better then %95 of the 2015 2016 games. Not because this game is so superior but the new games are so trash and most of them are button smashing. sadlyFinal verdict Has its own problems but still a good game with a huge potential. Most of the new games are too boring so i think this one stays as a option.,Rust

2015-07-16,0,0,1170,True,Recommended,i really enjoy playing the game in the current state i think some of the additions are a little overkill and i wish yall would keep it like it is the recent improvement in graphics were outstanding and its almost perfection. i think attachments for weapons is overkill and will hurt the game. keep it basic and apocalyptic. its perfect. just saying. i think adding more weapons and attachments will draw more of the call of duty countestrike fps audience and will drive off your core survival fans....,Rust

2014-01-05,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Well it started out with the idea i liked about this game thought what the hell let's try it.After starting the game popping in the game world after 20 seconds my head was being bashed in by another player.I was dead just thinking what was hapening... respawn then ok.After i respawned i got like 20 wood by bashing into a tree i thought ok. Time to build something like a house (shack).After finding a nice spot i was getting hit again by a lunatic behind me.. as you can guess i died again.After respawn i found out i lost all my wood in the dying process... great.Well i tried to find another build spot but again after 30 seconds my head was being bashed again..

2015-05-09,0,0,180,True,Recommended,In this review i am going to give you my honest opinion about the game. The old Rust sucks balls. The new rust is amazing and actually feels like a survival game you'll make some amazing friends and have amazing experiences (some too sexual for my liking) and in general have fun. Not to mention the amazing base building that this game has. Would definitely recomend,Rust
2015-05-30,0,0,98,True,Not Recommended,You used to be able to run this game on a potato and they made it so that it's hard to run even on a mid range computer. Also this game used to be fun. I played it a very long time ago and I just came back to it recently. The game is completely changed I used to know everything there was to know about the game and now it's gotten to where I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. They changed it so much that it's not even the game it used to be any more. I would've rather they kept the game it used to be then pumping out updates. It's not the same game anymore in any way.,Rust

2016-05-31,0,0,50,True,Recommended,"I have put about 50 hours into this game through its development from a zombie survival game to a radiation based faction shooter all the way to what it is now A cluster . If you have come to me to ask whether or not you should buy this game you should first ask yourself ""Why am I stupid enough to come to Dylan? "" And if you still need my advise then I would highly reccoment Rust. Rust is a versitile game that caters to all playstyles whether you enjoy a game that you can jump into for an hour and have some fun or a game that you can easily put 1000 hours into and build an empire. Rust takes an overused and washed up genre and makes it fun again. You can truly feel completely enveloped by the games serenity and chaos because Rust has the captivation that grabs you by the balls and has you singing for your mother. I give rust a 8.5/10 because of all of the factors listed and many more and I hope to see it develop into an even bigger masterpiece.",Rust

2016-07-23,0,0,112,True,Recommended,I've not played a lot of Rust but from what I have experienced so far I am extremely pleased. I have had so much fun running round harvesting materials for my base and the hunting is great because you need to be dead on if you want to eat. I won't say that other players are friendly because they are far from it but I think part of Rust's charm is that it makes you very weary of everything and everyone which gives it a great atmosphere. Another great things about it is just how much you have to work to get started but then how rewarding it is when you achieve something. Rust is one of the best MMOs that I have played. If you decide to buy it just watch out for bears,Rust
2016-07-23,0,0,1093,True,Recommended,I think rust is one of the best games i have ever played Rust is not flawless but definitely worth trying out. As a solo player i must say that solo rust is very hard mostly because of the huge groups on some servers. Some pros and cons Pros A game that will keep you awake at night and dream about running around with an inventory full of loot. (Also kinda a con i guess)Starting on a newly wiped server and getting set up is ing awesome and might cause you to be stuck infront of your PC all day.Devs are active friendly and clearly cares about their community this is also shown with the weakly updates (Every Thursday) with a devblog most recent https //playrust.com/devblog 119/#more 7158Cons JUST BUY THE ING GAME!,Rust
2016-07-23,0,0,476,True,Recommended,i recommend this game if u have lots of time to sink into it. And i mean like hours upon hours of time. This game is pretty much a grind fest. The problem is all of your stuff is left extremely vulnerable when u go offline,Rust
2016-07-23,0,0,233,True,Recommended,Rust is a very fun game. The crafting system is not deep but it is well hashed out and large. Furthermore Rust has great building and survial components as well. However it is a game that you can not really play alone. Moreover if you have any kind of life your not going to get very far. Though it does not really matter anyway due to wipes. So really all your work you put into the game is for nothing. Rust is a rage inducing game. I get my pleasure from inducing that rage within other players.,Rust

2016-07-22,0,0,151,True,Recommended,"Sighing Simulator 2016First 20 hours consisted of being shot within 5 minutes of respawning every time I spawned.I filled the chat with nihilistic musings about how no one makes any progress if everyone's a complete and utter low life br&gt Other voices joined me and soon I was running Skyfus' Sanctuary for the Sick of being Shot at. There weren't many members of the building but we helped nearly every newspawn that turned up on the door. We were loved and adored and all the neighbours were on peaceful terms with us.Then the squad moved into the neighbourhood. We don't know what they actually call their group so we've developed the affectionate term ""the squad"". They harrassed (and continue to harrass) the entire area including us. We had to cut off the charity toward all nakeds because the area around our base was a constant warzone.The squad has maybe 6 members but the most notable are (nicknames instead of steam names) the Psycho the Caesar and the Cynic The Psycho was the one to initially declare war on us after the time I tried to help him and he attacked me leading to a teammate of mine killing him.The Caesar was a player who added me on Steam after a random encounter that we both passed off as a misunderstanding. After talking for a while the seemingly nice man revealed his nature as one of the squad and proceeded to raid our base with them.The Cynic heard my complaints about how we're just trying to be nice and challenged me. No matter what I told him about my prior experience with KoS (Kill on Sight) culture in survival games the repetitive frustration it creates or my empathy for helpless newspawns stemming from the fact I used to be one he just kept citing I was in it for the exp sharing. If I really wanted exp sharing I wouldn't waste my time on newspawns and instead invite all my steam friends to play. Oh well...Everyone else in the area remained strongly out of favour with the squad though and to this day the only thing keeping the squad in our neighbourhood is the fact they have the most advanced recipes. The day they fall is the day we can finally be of service to the community once more.TL DR people are s the game is sighing simulator 2016 and you'll need to invite friends on or form alliances with randoms (careful with that one of my allies got ed by a mole) if you want to make any sort of progress.Oh also animals scale vertical surfaces built into the terrain instantly and walk through your walls/foundations. Bears death10/10 Would sigh again",Rust
2014-09-15,0,0,84,True,Recommended,Rust is an amazing game in my opinion. It feels like survival not only against the environment but like DayZ against other people as well. I myself prefer a smaller server with up to 20 people max and like to go on a server either while it's new or fresh after a wipe. Because otherwise the difference between you and the other players can get way too high. You can be naked with a rock and they'll have full kevlar and M4's and can raid your base rather easily. Stay modest with this game unless you have like a full clan of people with you. But while there's all that you learn to have fun with the game itself farming from the animals and from the radiated areas as well.All in all as it is 8/10,Rust

Plenty of things to invest your time in and every now and thing you'll meet a friendly player. However the 95% of the players you meet are gonna make you hate this game. This game's community is one of the worst. You'll get shot for no reason and the fresh spawns will rush you with their rocks because what do they have to lose. Because the fresh spawns do that the fully geared players will shoot on sight even if you're just passing by minding your own buisness. I really hate talking bad about the game's community because some of the players won't KOS and are really nice. If those players made up the majority this game would easily be an 8 out of 10.

2016-05-05,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Worth a buy if you are battle hardened and have some pretty sick survival skills you will regularly die of people bears and the elements. You will also need to survive unfair encounters such as 1v4 or guys with guns while you only have a bow. If ready to die a lot but gain a lot in the process then this is the game for you.

2016-11-26,0,0,61,True,Recommended,If you plan on playing this game by yourself I would suggest against it. This needs to be a multiplayer game where the enjoyment is from doing something with your friends not from accomplishing something ingame on your own. I just got this game yesterday and played it for 13 hours with a couple friends and I had a great time. I logged in today and our two bases were raided and we lost all our metal and stone and whatever. If I had been playing this by myself I would have been super Since I was playing with two other people my enjoyment was with playing a game with them and I'm not so mad about it.,Rust

2014-12-15,0,0,7,True,Recommended,There seems to be so many mixed and poor reviews here for this game and I'm unsure why. It is a blast to play even for someone like me that only recently purchased it. If you like a mix of survival pvp and a sprinkling of building mechanics this is YOUR game. The Legacy version (included) is still going strong and you can find active servers quite easily. It is PvP though so I would highly recommend a lightly loaded server in order to get your feet wet. The experimental alpha version is less populated but that is still in development and is missing quite a bit of the content of the legacy version (as well as the number of players.) That being said it is still being developed very actively with changes that seem to come on a frequent basis. The graphics are also quite nice in comparison.Pros Tons of online servers some modded as well with a very dynamic builder/pvp gameplay mechanic.Actively developed alpha version which looks to become a great game if legacy is any indicator.New Alpha version also comes with anti cheat software which should help guard against some of the legacy issues.Cons If you are new to the game prepare to be killed a lot. Trial by fire is the best way to learn to protect yourself and your belongings (think Day Z style gaming not co op minecraft.)The newest version is indeed alpha. Content is scarce but it is growing frequently.Although there is a lot of building mechanic within the game this is survival and pvp up front and building shouldn't be considered the main points of the game.,Rust

We are starting to be decently geared with bows and swords and feeling pretty confident in our two story house.Two men enter our yard. They have machine guns. They kill all 6 of us under a minute and take all our stuff.5 hrs work gone in under a minute. 10/10 will play again and again and again until nothing can touch us.

2014-01-18,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Barely anything spawns besides tress once appeared in the world you have a rock a torch and 2x medical kit once you go off you need to go and find item to collect so you can create. You can find wood easily due to the trees the biggest problem is finding food there is no easy mean to finding food I ve played for about 5 hours exploring and finding little bits of metal and in all that time I ve seen wolfs which have killed me and one pig. When I tried to kill this pig it took me 10 mins to kill this big with my stone you get after you spawn.My review of this game is that it s fun first time you play it but once you die of hunger due to the lack of spawning animals you find this gam really needs to work on its spawning of certain items.Another thing the developers need to consider is a single player side to this game and also once you die you shouldn t have to be left with what you spawn with As I ve said I spent hours on this game in could have had plenty to defend myself and build items which is why I wanted to buy the game in the first place but I couldn t because I kept on being killed and starting from the bottom either from wolfs zombies or other players.Please don t let this put you off in the future I hope they see this and very much consider this problem and fix it I of course know this may not be what the developers point of the game but it s very hard to survive when there s nothing there to help you too.,Rust

2015-06-17,0,0,1111,True,Recommended,"Rust is my all time favorite game. It brings me the most joy adrenaline and stress of anything I've ever played. The ability to succeed is based on experience skill and trust. It is the ultimate PvP experience and with the way the team over at Facepunch rolls out updates it's only uphill from here.Experience allows you to know which walls to hit with C4 how to sleep in that bush while you have the Airdrop on you and how to build a near impenetrable base. Skill is used to wield various weapons and know your limits when matching up against people. Can you kill those 4 nakeds chasing after you with only a spear and a hatchet on you? That's your call. Trust lies in the people you surround yourself with. Rust is an almost completely unpredictable game because you have no idea how people are going to react to the way you play. Killing that silly naked who wanted some food for free may have seemed like a hilarious idea at the time but maybe not so much when he shows up with 20 friends in full gear to your front door. And allowing that guy access to your whole base after you've only known him for 2 hours? I can tell you from experience it's not fun to log on and find that your base is no longer yours. They let me know that loud and clear as they screamed at me over their mics )Be friendly or be mean it's your call either way you have the ability to succeed immensely or end up homeless.PROTIPS Throwing spears are op AK is best gun pipeshotty is best gun for the poor don't build next to a spawn find some friends don't be too friendly don't eff with a clan unless you can back it up wall off your toolcupboard have an ""airlock"" in your front entrance pillars are 100% worth sharing sleeping bags saves 2 hours trying to find your friend if you wear clothes you will get shot 90% of the time if you're naked you will get shot 50% of the time everyone can hear you c4 people saying ""friendly"" almost never are nakeds aren't always what they appear to be hv ammo isn't worth the gp building on rocks makes for easy defense ladders really don't cost that much don't keep all your loot in one place keep up to date on glitches craft on the run have a ton of sleeping bags you can never have too many doors you can smelt/cook 4 items at a time don't plan your house too big salvaged tools are bad burst fire your gun deers come installed with vtec don't trust beancan grenades explosives can blow up the chests inside geared doesn't mean good or smart follow these tips and I'll still kill you )TL DR Best $20 I've ever spent.",Rust

2017-01-05,0,0,142,True,Recommended,"Before I start let me just say I enjoy Rust but I write reviews to help people decide whether they will invest their money in a game or not. I will list the pros and cons with a nuetral approach (as nuetral as I can get). With that said here is the review Rust is a great game with barely any bugs/glitches. The main ""issue"" is the playerbase. Most people who play Rust will only befriend you when you are fresh spawns and 75% of the time they will betray you later on. If you find yourself in a situation where you are a fresh spawn and they other person had a gun they will shoot you because they like wasting bullets for rocks and a torch. Also 50% of the fresh spawns that you will encounter that won't betray you later on are the ones that charge at you with a rock without saying anything.Aside from SoS PvP there is your base. If you don't want to get raided you must spend the first 3 hours collecting supplies so you can get 1 layer of honeycombing so you don't get raided and don't even think about using a standard key lock because if you forget to make a spare and don't have 100 wood lying around when you die you are trapped in your base with no key to unlock your door and escape your own home. On your first day of Rust you will be excited if you made a base. If you did your research on base building you might have a nice home to come back to the next day. If you did not do your research chances are you left the game with your base made of twigs which can get knocked down in 5 swings from a stone hatchet.In conclusion you won't have a problem with rust if you are patient enough to get supplies before interacting with other players or you could take a chance at befriending a freshie and maybe he won't betray you!",Rust

2016-05-28,0,0,672,True,Recommended,They change the game too much it used to be very nice but they listen to people who complain about dumb and don't know how to counter it like pipe shotguns etc. Pretty toxic game but it's fun if you play with 2+ people solo is aids. I stopped playing it for like 2 months and came back and it looked like a completely different game. Very active devs though so that's good. Overall it's worth a buy if you like hearing kids yell racial slurs at you after camping your home and murdering you multiple times. People talk about the game because they think it's filled with hackers that isn't true. Out of my hours I only recall a hacker once killing me but he picked me back up and went on his way. People are quick to accuse of hacking which is hilarious. 8/10,Rust

2014-12-19,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,I got this game a while ago and only played it a little. It looks much different now (in a good way) and there are many new features. Visually it's an appealing game.The reason I don't recommend it is because it's just not fun to spend hours dedicated to collecting resources only to be killed and stripped of them. I've tried a bunch of servers all resulting in the same thing an advanced player kills me and takes the stuff I spend a lot of time gathering. Seriously what am I a naked guy with some spears and stones supposed to do when a guy with armor and a gun comes running at me? Don't think you'll find a server where nobody randomly kills each other because apparently that's just part of the game Rust. Some servers just have more of it than others.I gave the game a second try in the hopes I'd find a server where me and a group of random people could work together to survive. Typing that makes me laugh knowing how this game really operates. If you don't mind working hard for something only to get screwed over by someone then by all means give the game a try. I personally have better things I could be doing.,Rust

2016-06-12,0,0,61,True,Recommended,This is a fun and original survival based game. It has a good amount of weapons to craft and the system of blueprints is very creative and makes it a game where you actually have to work and have an objective to grow as a threat to others. The building system is all around pretty good and the resource system is as what you would expect chopping down trees and mining rocks. The system of character generating is a downside forcing you to stay as the randomly generated model 50% of being a man or woman and the skin color is random too. I see why they do that cause it would be annoying with a bunch of little black midgets that blend in with the dark attacking you even though that would be a flaw of character customization it still takes away from the experience of being your own person that you want to be. The combat system is also flawed with so many hackers and really weird and difficult struggles when shooting. The optimization needs to be fixed cause I run games bigger than this with way better frames and this is choppy unless you have a really amazing computer. Overall there could be improvements but it is still a fun and unique open world survival game.,Rust

2015-07-10,0,0,20,True,Recommended,Ever since the defeat of the Galactic Empire life has been pretty slow for me so I decided to have a look and see if any games were on the market so as to pass the time. I came across Rust and as Foremost Military Commander of the Rebel Alliance I fancied my chances in this videogame. After downloading and having some ill fated attempts at playing solo I convinced a good friend of mine to accompany me on my escapades. It all started well. It only took a few seppukus in order for us to locate each other and we promptly set out on our merry way across the lag/wooden spiked yet strangely beautiful landscape. We made early gains creating a lovely home and gathering a plethora of useful supplies and we couldn't have been happier. My friend then decided to take upon himself the role of the team explorer and made some excellent finds that increased our Net worth dramatically. However like any true capitalist he became greedy straying further and further from our little bastion in search of blueprints and granola bars until finally the truth of the situation in which found himself dawned on him. He was lost.At first we didn't make much of it and I carried on as usual gaining planning permission from the local council to extend our house and add 4 more floors and a balcony. My virtual roommate however by this stage had gone mad with greed as he amassed loot faster than Taylor Swift amasses ex boyfriends yet I was impressed and for a while even encouraged him. The story of his travels is one in itself and I refuse to digress so let me return to the matter at hand. As I returned from a wood collecting trip I was jumped so hard not even a good samaritan could save me and the naked white men who emptied my naked pockets took the my and locked themselves in the house.Not one to be trampled over I wrote these two strapping young men a strongly worded letter over chat and resultingly guilt tripped them into returning my house to me after they had stripped it clean and they remained true to their word. Slightly shaken and with new found agoraphobia I decided to wait for my friend. One hour later and with no sign of him returning soon I build up the courage to leave my house but alas a wolf finished me within seconds. I face my demise cheerfully before remberring the very fact that I was locked out of my house again and alone. The wolves were relentless in their attacks but I eventually fought my way to the house and waited outside. It had been been like 3/4 hours by then and my friend finally made it back. Our embrace was sweeter than any John Green book could ever claim to be and we lived happilly ev..*Speared in back by 12 year old*TLDR If you are between the ages of embryo and 14 then don't get this game but other wise yeah it's perfect for interstellar travel.,Rust

2017-05-29,0,0,59,True,Not Recommended,I played this game for a while now and its all the same stuff over and over again. You start off as a naked man just wanting to start a family and build a home. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. Once you get enough wood and find a nice area to start building you get murdered for said wood and get back to chopping. You may catch a lucky brake after the 100th time of dying and getting wood again. Durind this break you get your foundation up and start actually feeling good about your experience playing the game. Eventually you cut enought trees down for a nice log cabin and can start upgrading. You go out and find some nodes get some stone iron and sulfer. After you wander far away from home bashing rock after rock after rock you decide its time to go back home. On your way home you see a group of people who you might think are friendly neighbors. Upon approaching them you see that they have guns. You have not gotten to the point where you would be able to defend your self so at this point you have to hope for the best and be as nice as possible to avoid being murdered for your progress. They will shoot you 100% of the time and you'll realize that this game sucks and like me uninstall and find a game worth playing. Oh yeah and people also cheat all the time so have fun with that ),Rust

2015-03-17,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,Worked for hours in a laggy world on a server with no pvp but it turns out if I have to get off at any given moment to something someone can kill my character while they sleep. This in turn defeats the purpose of NON pvp servers if you can't stop somewhere safely. I tried to get my character somewhere safe but the matter I was dealing with was more urgent than getting my character in a house so I can have my crap when I get back.In otherwords I do NOT recommend this game whether you're in pvp or in non pvp. Either way you're bound to get screwed over and I know most of us know about the lag in this game making it a slow game to progress in. If you by chance have a good computer good for you more power to you but for others don't waste your time with this laggy wasteland of a game.Now something to add. There are also exploiters that will ruin your game too. For no ing reason so the game all and all isn't worth even 10$ let alone 15$. If you even consider buying this take my advice and buy something else.,Rust

2014-08-18,0,0,60,True,Recommended,Played this game for a little bit almost 2 full days worth of gameplay I can honestly say it isn't as good as fanboys make it out to be but still damn good. Going to go over pros and cons then my personal experience.Pros Great Survival game really keeps you on edge and in suspence especially during night. Building your own house is a pro and a con it's very repetitive annoying when you make mistakes and boring when you don't unless we are including the adventures you could have gathering materials. This is all especially true if you want a big house it would take me a couple hours to find a spot build a house at least 3x3 in size with 2 floors that is entirely secure with metal doors/bars a watch tower and a storage room. Great early game when you are running from animals helplessly with your stone hatchet getting your first weapons like a bow and settling into the game is where it shines. It has alot of petential to get better. With the game being early access it could be terrible but it's already good the devs have stated that they will most likely keep an option to play this version of rust forever so if the game starts to suck you can always come back to the original.Cons Late game is honestly pretty boring when you get to that point where you have a fortress and are decked with guns and kevlar clothing it can get easily boring unless you plan to go F with people for satisfaction all you really do other than that is kill red animals hoping they drop more stuff for you to potentially use or stockpile or find research kits so you could play the entire game again (on that server) without having to farm red animals for drops Dear god the community I've mentioned before that people can pretty much only F with others for enjoyment at late game but it's to the point now when about 10% of players won't kill you on sight and if you want to avoid being killed by a player you should join a server that you know has regular users that are all offline. At the time of posting this there are several available methods of hacking that are undetectable that can do things like allow you to see invisible admins on modded servers go invisible yourself and the usuals like wallhacks and aimbot these are most likely temprary because as the game get's better the methods of revealing hackers should eventually arise.My personal experiance It can be a super serious game where it's as if you were a sociopath who will have to shoot anyone you see or it can be a funny game where you will be chased by a jumping naked man with a rock blasting music through their microphone causing you to die because you fell over laughing IRL. I rate it 12 alpha models out of 10.No but really it's like 7.5/10 and it could possibly get better when the updates roll out.,Rust

You simply start off with basic tools and have to collect food metals stone wood etc.. and build your base. The only way I could easily describe this game would be to relate it to Minecraft you have to survive and build your base while hunting and gathering. Other than that there's no mining and it isn't exactly like MC its better. The game is also exacly like DayZ just less developed less zombies and it focuses more on the aspect of surviving. Note that the game is still in Alpha and being developed but the game is easily worth $20.,Rust

2014-04-15,0,0,292,True,Recommended,The beuty of this game is that its only as good as the innovation of the players. Facepunch leaves you with basic mechanics and lets players continue on from there. But eventually it comes down to this your either an elitist or your scraping by just to make a living. Will you get killed by players yes? are there players who are friendly who will lone you a hand when you need it? yes Form alliances know your neigbor claim your plot of land once you establish a place in the server this game becomes incredibly fun. and how you have fun is completely up to you one of my favorite things to do in rust is find two new spawns in rust and force them to fight eachother to the death with rocks. The winner becomes my slave. Another day i might give food to a starving new spawn out of sympathy. The most important thing to remember in this game is there is going to be a point where a gun is going to be aimed and how you play this game is going to decide whether your on the other side of the barrel or your the one holding the gun.,Rust

Besides that it's a wonderful game i don't have many complaints besides a few minor bugs but that is expected in an early alpha game.

2016-11-23,0,0,598,True,Recommended,Like being creative and making unique fun bases and settlements? Rust has that.Like PVP with full loot? Rust has that.Like investing countless hours and forgetting what time it is? Rust has that.Like constantly being on the edge of your seat not knowing if your next breath will be your last? Rust has that.Like raging at your screen because some naked guy just snuck up on you and threw a spear at the back of your head and then took everything you just gathered for the past hour? You're such a masochist but nonetheless Rust has that.Rust has a lot of quirks and other interesting mechanics that really make it stand out from other sandbox games. Despite its brutal nature and the countless hours you can waste from losing everything you just worked for just to have your base raided the game itself is extremely addicting and just a blast in general to lose yourself in. If you really do like PVP and being creative this game is a great combination of the two. Just a forewarning though you will die. You will lose everything you worked on. You will occasionally get trolled or griefed.If you're completely okay with all of that you will have fun.,Rust

2016-08-19,0,0,686,True,Recommended,For the price this game has been set on I would definetly recoomend this game a shot. IF your computer can handle the hazard world of rust. I've got 100+ hours on this game and this is what I have to say.Pros Making new friends (Still don't trust anyone.) Good Community (community likes to share ideas) Still have lots of more to add (more in store for the game) Doesn't feel too repettetive (Something new everytime) Graphics are amazing Listens to Community (sometimes but mostly yes) ing Garry ( I love you.)Cons Latest nerfs have been for solo players (nerf pipe and crossbow) Very clan sided (currently) Requires a beast to run well (still lags a bit with a 1060) It is repettetive in some ways (grinding with the new xp system) Crazy load times (can be annoying) Graphic options and Settings are quite confusingIf your overall feeling of this game is good but one little thing makes you upset you should remember that this game isn't perfect by all means. It's still in alpha and it has more to fix and more to come so you should always reconsider what you think about this game. If you really do have an issue then just press F7 in game and send the devs a message yourself. They need feedback in order to make changes that people want so before you start ranting about one little thing focus on the positives.9/10 would be mauled by a bear again.,Rust

2015-02-02,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,"Rust used to be a promising prototype for something bigger and better. This Rust is now called ""Legacy"" and was superseeded by ""Experimental"". Experimental scrapped essentially what was good and tried to introduce ""cool"" features none of which are actually inclined toward gameplay.Seeing how it goes I don't think the game will ever be good at some point. Spending a year redoing all from scratch unable to reach the point where it was before going procedural in a game where you need to be able to navigate through easily adding visual effects you will turn off after an hour of playing because you can't see (hello lens dirt!) or clothes that won't balance anything breaking the ING BOW! (with all the games out there featuring a bow they could have gone with anything but what they did...) and last but not least running like an asthmatic turtle even on a decent PC.I think people put too much trust in Garry a guy once able to create a great sand box where people did cool things in (Garry's Mod) but unable to actually create a Game with fun in it. Because the best things in Rust are the mods made by the community. I hope for them it will last.",Rust

2014-04-11,0,0,2,True,Recommended,You know lately I've been feeling a little constricted by modern society. But now that this game has come out I can freely run around naked in public hitting people with rocks and get eaten by red bears that give off chicken meat when you kill them. Yes chicken meat. Although it is still in the Alpha stage Rust gives off a vibe similar to the popular game Minecraft. Rust tests your survival instincts and skills as you explore the abandoned cities and encounter other things such as mutant wolves and bears. I mean my first time playing a cute red doge came up to me and practically ate my nuts. My second time I was chased by 8 bears and 5 wolves not even 1 minute after respawn. ALthough the process keeps repeating for me playing with friends or just playing solo Rust is a game that definately has potential even though it is great now. My point is don't get your nuts eaten by a wolf.,Rust
2015-06-27,0,0,179,True,Recommended,SO MUCH FUN! Really though!,Rust
2015-06-27,0,0,490,True,Recommended,Rust is a great game and I highly recomend it but it gets a few things wrong The survival factor of the game seems nonexesitant because the only time you ever worry about dying is when you log off because someone is going to murder you. It just needs to focus less on the PvP side of things and more PvE because not once have I died of thirst or hunger and usually the only time you die by something other than a player is if you drown or when you accidently run next to a wolf or bear which you barely see anyways but I know Facepunch won't let us down and I still really enjoy playing this game.8/10,Rust

2016-11-04,0,0,482,True,Recommended,This game is amazing if you want the best rust experience try to get some friends to play it or find some people to team up and get a team. The feeling when you are getting raided or raid somebody is insane! Its amazing when you succeed in defending but even if you don't just take a break maybe 1 wipe cycle and than get back in the fight. You won't get bored of this game evey wipe cycle feels like you have been born again. If you don't like the vanilla aspect you can always play on modded servers! GL and HF see you in battle!,Rust
2016-11-13,0,0,119,True,Not Recommended,Too many problems the community is awful mole bears that go through rocks and instant kill while tanking nukes. In its current game state is only fun if you can find a low pop server with 3+ friends.,Rust
2016-11-28,0,0,674,True,Recommended,Rust This game cant be explained in a review nor can you ever read if the game is good or not because its one of those games where everything can happenFor example You plan to go and mine some metal to make a upgrade to your base and from no where you see 3 guys with guns running to your base and its your job to defend it to the max.What im trying to say is that if you give it some time and you are patient this game is a ing master piece I really recommend it,Rust
2016-12-11,0,0,675,True,Recommended,Everyone who's complaining about the community just never got a foothold in the game. Yes you get killed a lot even as a naked but it's not really without reason. You will do the same to others because you simply can't risk betrayal or a blindsided attack. If you've been farming or you're carrying gear you do NOT want to die. And naked guys WANT what you've got for the quick come up. So you cannnot trust ANYONE. Kill that naked and let him cry. Die as a naked and don't be salty it's survival after all. I personally roll around as a naked but you better believe I've got a shotgun I'm not showing you just in case you decide to pull one out too. Your adrenaline will never flow in another game as it will in this game. The critical nature of dying is what makes it more fun to live!,Rust

2017-03-14,0,0,2626,True,Recommended,This game is like no other.This game is one of the most addicting bittersweet games I have ever experienced. I hold most of my greatest memories of playing in this game. I would recommend it to anyone weather they are solo have friends or are looking to make friends. Many of the reviews are negative due to the reviewers lack of playtime. This game has gone through some rough growing stages but the result is amazing.Grind is talked about a lot below me and it is a double edged sword.It makes every loss crippiling but makes every victory one of the greatest feelings in your life.This game takes time to learn.This game has a lot of hidden features and bugs and takes a while to master the PvE portion (300 hrs). The PvP portion is much harder to learn (1k+ hrs) but is much more rewarding.This game is hard for solo play.One of the most ed about topics on this game is the lack of solo abilities and while htey are at a disadvantage there are many solutions.Head to reddit.com/r/playrustlfg to find a group or clan to joinLook in the steam discussions to find a friendAsk in game for a group (you may get double crossed)Talk in game and make friendships.Look in chat for people recruiting.&gt Go to a solo/duo/trio server and play solo there it is much easier and requires less time to know what your doing.Combat is a crazy experience in this game there are many ways to improve.Look on twitch and youtube for adviceWatch people PvP on youtube or twitchFarm for PvP'ers for the to teach you about the gameGo to a battlefield server to practiceGo to Combat tags (Under modded) to practiceCraft a p2 and spam click.Building is one of the most creative things to do in this game and many clans are always in need of a builder to help them not get raided. The way this is mastered is throughMath major and know how geometry worksLook at Youtube videos and take the basics out of it (dont copy)Download fortify to master youir building skillsGo to a building server and do it in game.Rust is an amazing game and is def worth the buy.It is very cheap on or Buyrust.com as it is always on the humble bundle for a really low price.,Rust

2016-11-02,0,0,201,True,Recommended,Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough 2 cups all purpose flour 1 pinch salt 1 teaspoon olive oil 2 eggs 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese softened 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese 1/2 cup provolone cheese shredded 1 egg 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto Alfredo Cream Sauce 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 cloves garlic crushed 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce 2 cups heavy cream 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil 2 eggs and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth 8 to 10 minutes add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese cream cheese mozzarella cheese provolone cheese egg and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream raise the heat to high and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile in a separate saucepan warm the marinara sauce over medium low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli and return to a boil. Cook uncovered stirring occasionally until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.,Rust

2014-01-06,0,0,388,True,Recommended,DO NOT BUY YET!!!!!!!from my expirence in this game i have found that all of the oficial servers have 128 several hundred people online and they are usually all full which is stupid because you die within a few seconds. the community or modded servers usually only have between 0 50 people on each one which is good because you dont die every 5 seconds and you can actually can get something done. and the insta craft mod and no sleepers mod is nice especially when your new. but my main problem with this game is that thier is SOOOO many hackers in this game. and everytime a hacker blows up every wall piller foundation and roof in your house you have to start all over from the beginning and spend another 100 hours making your house.if you rage quite deffinently dont get this game or youl go through a couple of monitors and keyboards for sure.once they fix the hackers and maby make the game not soo frusterating when you die or get raided then this will be an amazing game.thier are player vs envirenment servers that other players cant kill you but i feel they are too easy and only usefull for new players.this game is alot better if you have some trust worthy friends to play with.also you NEED an ok graphics card to play this i tried intel hd 4600 and i got 19 fps once i turned grass off and turned the graphics settings down to thier lowest. just look up to see if your GPU can play the game if you really want to buy it in its alfa stage.,Rust

2017-08-22,0,0,551,True,Recommended,One of my favorite games. I believe it is the most difficult survival/pvp games out. You don't have to worry about nature killing you as much as another player trying to kill you and take everything you've farmed for. Not for everyone but for its price it's 100% worth it. Developers are always updating the game. It's come a long way in its original state (legacy).,Rust

2016-11-09,0,0,130,True,Recommended,"Rust is a very enjoyable experience. It is a beautiful environment to run in with a decent crafting and building system. Getting killed and losing what you've spent time gathering may seem frustrating but it does put more value on anything you possess in a way that other games don't. And the potential for you taking someone else's stuff or breaking into their buildings kind of makes up for it. That being said I have to add that you probably are not going to get far solo unless you are on a private or low populated server. Team up or you're probably going to have a rough time generating some sustainable progress. The game is still in developement... the means of unlocking item creation is being tweaked yet... some animal behavior and pathing is goofy... etc. This didn't really bother me though. I've become cautious after getting burned on games in developement (Star Forge) but I feel like I've already got my money out of this ""work in progress"" game. I recommend Rust to the survivalist who likes to create. If you like to look over your shoulder while you gather form alliances or just want to build on your own private server try Rust.",Rust

Most of the updates in this game are just showcases of what people have built. Animals and Hostile Animals go through rock killing you. Items can fall through the world which is really frustrating.

2016-12-27,0,0,277,True,Not Recommended,I admit it. At first i loved this game so much. I After figuring out to actaully build i really got the overall gist of the game. The game is beautiful and very well put together especially compared to other alpha games like DayZ. Now everyone seem to agree on how toxic the community are. This was a thing that i noticed from right of the bad. I could not undertstand why people would kill freshspawns just without any ing reason. I really tried to understand the different mindsets of people that i encountered but i just couldn't. Now you may wonder why i dislike this game. Well. My friend and I spend almost 30 hours creating a huge house only to have some hackers hack our building privilege which led them into blocking our main enterance. WTF RUST.,Rust

2017-07-26,0,0,95,True,Not Recommended,I cant recommend RUST the game have some good points but after grind build your house farm components shoot some one and die alot there is a HUGE hole about what to do next in pvp is kill and mug everyone even if you dont need nothing after that is boring pve well maybe radtowns but is again a 1 2 times and become boring is like the concept of the game is missing there is not feeling of progresion i play in a official server with every month wipe or patch wipe is hard believe a 4 years EA and still need wipe things plus this wipes dont make you feel atachment to the game. If you play solo this game is not for you why? ok maybe if you like be gangbang and lose hours of your time. Is hard to find a friendly players. When you lose all is start again with only a rock and you lose all way to many times. People are gonna harass you nop is not only trolling or grifing i play to have a good time not for watch people screaming in the mic bulling others etc i dont know what Facepunch is doing.At last if they add more things to do more goals to reach lol more things to craft the lack of content is huge is a bit hard to believe thats gonna happen after 4 years of EA but well. maybe after that i change my personal review.,Rust

2015-11-22,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Originally this game wasn't so bad but now it is nearly unplayable. Buggy laggy and full of hackers with s camping the spawn areas just so they murder you and steal your starting rock. With that said if you somehow can survive long enough to get the materials nessesary to build a crude structure rest assured someone will come by and blow it to pieces. Not to mention venturing into any open spaces invites almost certain demise from players camping in the towers overlooking said open areas. Would I recommend this game?

2013-12-22,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,"Don 't get me wrong the concept of the game is good infact the gameplay gunplay survival or overall game mechanics of the game are great. BUT its the people or community that play it which lets it down. For example you could be strolling along you have a good base built with a metal door and a 9mm pistol and you decide to pick up some supplies. All of a sudden some random bandits confront you and same something on the lines of ""Yo what's up ma n***a"" and then instantly shoot you in the face with a shotty. Garry is a great dev and he has made a pretty good game but there is just something lacking in Rust that can put a pretty solid wall in between pure banditary and just holding someone up you can do this easily in DayZ but due to the more fast paced feel with rust it truly hurts the game.

2014-06-08,0,0,611,True,Recommended,Nice sandbox concept. When I got the game with some friends we spent 24 hours on it in a single weekend.For those who know it it is similar to a post apocalyptic Wurm Online played in first person with much less building decay (actually none if you are active in it every so often) and no skills only blueprints to learn.Main problem is finding a decent server I guess. First one we joined was filled with a group of s who raided our house 5 hours into the server then spent the next 3 days finding our new home to raid it again. The other one we joined was filled to the brim with admin abuse. We kept ourselves discreet and raided the BIG guys from the server. That's around 80 C4 we stole plus all the we couldn't carry we threw it away. We knew they had another base which he had raided earlier (nothing left). 2 hours later they come knockin' at our door filled with kevlar and bullets...It didn't get much updates from since we bought it and we have already gotten bored of it but if it gets consistent update we'll surely get back to it.Another noteworthy thing the game runs on Unity. Interested to see what can be done with that.,Rust
2015-07-05,0,0,131,True,Recommended,After getting into this game because my friends were and still are big players I realized that I would be shot hammered axed and killed on sight.

2016-06-24,0,0,164,True,Recommended,Good game Difficult at first but you start learning what you have to do,Rust
2014-03-27,0,0,247,True,Not Recommended,Rust has changed since this post was first written and not for the better. If we overlook the issue of hackers which in fairness was a problem in Legacy the game is still not what it was. The resource gathering has gone from relatively time consuming to flat out boring and far too grindy to achieve anything of note. Again the time it takes to get any form of decent equipment is much too long for the game to be fun lower teir combat is irritating to put it mildly. But don't worry some guy with a gun will come and take that tacky house you have spent four days building. The Random Gen maps are also really annoying. It wouldn't be so bad but the devs have made them far far far far too big. A game is not fun when you have to spend two hours looking for your friends but then die horribly to some bear. Although it may look prettier and now has a workshop rust is not the fun game it once was. It breaks my heart but i can no longer recommend this game (LEGACYRust is hard to describe. The trailer does quite well. The PVP aspect of the game is strong as well as the gathering of resources. Rust is a survival game unlike most. The buildings could be improved however raiding them is extremley exciting even if you're the victim. If you have just bought the game and have suffered from your first raid then don't worry you'll be soon drawn back! The map is huge and full of great content as well the ideal setting for cavemen to do battle! If you're reading this review then tell your friends as the game is quite hard if you go solo. A party of 4 6 is best as you work fight and die together!,Rust

2015-06-12,0,0,115,True,Recommended,"Starting with the good things The maps are huge and randomly generated for the most part. There is a decent amount of order in how the map is generated which makes it easy to find out if your friends are near you. Landmarks like Lighthouses or other buildings can also help with this. Exploring is fun. Finding a rad town or walking along the road and breaking the barrels and finding items you want is very exciting. The crafting system is complex but pretty easy to figure out. You don't need to go on a wiki to find the crafting recpies although the rust wiki can be very helpful for things. Building is fun but expect to run out of materials fairly fast. The game is a grind but is for the most part fun if you're patient.Now for the bad things Raiders. Pretty much if you have a life outside of this game you are going to get raided frequently. You better have a large group to play with if you are playing on any server that regularly has players. Yes you can protect your base but there are always ways to get in. Being a fresh spawn is VERY hard If someone who has anything sees you you are probably going to die. 99% of the time other players are hostile and unforgiving. They don't care if you're new. They don't care that you have absolutely no way of fighting back or even that you have nothing on you but a rock and a torch. They kill you just to kill you and for no other reason. Very toxic community. If you even dare to ask how to start off as a noob you will get bombarded with rudeness (for the most part) or people saying you're butthurt or ""cry more lol"" if you so even respond to them killing you. I really dislike the ""This is rust be good or get out"" mentality of the community as if because it's hard you're supposed to just suck it up and deal with it. Suggestions for the game Singleplayer mode This would be very useful for people who just want to get some practice in before playing on large servers. Nerf the raiders It is far too easy to raid small bases. Anyone with some C4 can raid an offline player. It should be more of a challenge to raid small bases even if you are further ahead than the people who built those bases. It's also impossible to protect yourself even if they have guns unless they have terrible aim and you can somehow kill them with your axe or rock. It should be possible to protect yourself as a newish player against enemies.Overall right now expect an early access quality game. It's buggy as of now because it's still in alpha.Would recommend if you're into survival games and are willing to help test out an unfinished game.",Rust

2016-12-28,0,0,519,True,Recommended,Have played 200+ hours on rust mainly during the period where experience was a thing. It was rewarding to build your base and make allies for trading and defence. I originally started in a server about 3 days after a wipe so other players had already begun to establish their bases and become pretty menacing. Community is pretty toxic with majority of people kill on sight for freshies but that's what made it so fun! We had to break our resources into little shacks so we could gather enough to instantly sprout a large base. Definitely worth playing with friends as it makes it so much more entertaining even when being raided. Successfully defending an attacking bases is what made it so rewarding. With the xp system even if your base was completely destroyed you could get help off others in exchange for crafting given you were a decent level. However without it when your base is griefed (a downside of the toxic community) you have lost everything and have to start from scratch. All in all great game but without the xp system there's no reason to be loyal to a server if you have been griefed and they begin to die pretty quick after the wipe. Part the reason for my low play time recently. BRING BACK THE XP. (Also didn't play when blueprints were around but heard they were great so either xp or bp. But the new system is such a grind.),Rust

He notices my character's race and says something like ""I hate black people"" and we go into battle with rocks. I lose and he revives me and is a little friendlier i believe. Then I took my oppurtunity and killed him with my rock. He said he hated people like me (I dont think he was talking about race) and I felt good about killing him ).More recently I was walking up to a road (keep a distance from roads) and as I walk through a bush and into the road I see three highly geared players and I turn around and book it. They chased and one called my a n***** and told me to get back to the fields (. And even worse these guys were s and I just finished calling one of them a stupid for telling calling a guy a redneck and telling him to go to school because he misspelt waste ""waist""Now i know how it is to be discriminated against as an African American and i do say i do not like it.

2016-08-25,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,Got it ages ago played for a few hours and had a blast but stopped when my friends pc could not run it. He recently upgraded his graphics card and we decided to give it another go. We notice a new xp bar in the bottom left of screen. After what feels like hours of cutting down trees I look in the bottom left... Ding! Level 2. I still cannot craft a stone hatchet. This new xp system ruined the game completely and totally and it also made all the complaints I have that I was willing to deal with stand out more. Why the hell can I not change my race or gender? Why does Rust literally have the worst player base of any other survival game I have ever played? Spawn get shot spawn get shot spawn get shot. In my few hours of playing this game I came across about 10 people. 7 shot me in the face. 2 attempted to shoot me in the face. And finally one man decided that my naked woman needed to get down and dirty with his naked man. I've put hours upon hours into DayZ modded and standalone and never have I found such a player base. And DayZ is infamous for KOS even against people with no gear. Xp sucks maps feel too small for the ammount of players. Instead of meeting another player being an interesting experience that can have multiple turnouts you constantly hear shooting then fall on the ground letting out a bloodcurling scream. Like I said I can deal with the fact that I am a naked black woman. I can deal with players being I can even deal that the only thing the enviroment can do to you at all is throw a bear at you. Food and water is ing everywhere no wonder people are constantly killing noobs once you have a base built what else would you ing do? The xp system is the final nail in the coffin for this game. Maybe the game gets better once you used to it. The same could be said about catching yourself on fire. The beginning game is simply not fun and leaves you feeling completely cheated out of your money. Waste of time money and hard drive space. Don't buy until the xp system is gone at least and even if it is removed make sure you are willing to deal with rage. I'll give it another go if they remove the xp system but until then this game.,Rust

(Please note I am actually running on a decent computer basically my computer is a piece of american cheese while a potato is 10x worse.Complaint #5 I paid 20$ for this instead of torrenting it.

I log on every thursday waiting for the update to come out to hop on a server and begin my week long adventure. Every week is something different new map new base location new base design new friends new enemies. Over all I must say if you have some friends and plenty of free time this is a game for you,Rust

2016-07-08,0,0,983,True,Not Recommended,"This coming from someone who has 900 hours in this game.. I am telling you to not buy it. If you do not have AT LEAST 3 very active friends (30+ hours/week) you will get on. This is not me saying ""you might get on"" or ""you'll probably get on."" I am indefinitely telling you that you cannot play this game. That is unless you just want a to join a server with such a small population that you might as well not even be playing because all you're doing is PvEing. This game used to be fun it used to have a lot of bugs a lot of issues community was still toxic but now it is a new breed. This game is not a survival game and I honestly think they should remove that genre from it's steam page.. It is a pure long term PvP game. Plain and simple. I have so many AMAZING memories from when people would just get on and play by themselves or with friends and talk to each other talk raid argue and fight. However this was all in spirit of Rust. Now the spirit of Rust is still the same thing but slightly different. Youhave talking and arguing and fighting. However all the raiding is people who have more people on the server with them than you and/or play WAY more than you. I'm talking kids who run 90+ hours/ 2 weeks on steam just on this game. In the old days people didn't care as much. People honeycombed and tried smart base designs but I feel most of them were more creative and appearance heavy while still trying to protect. Nowadays you are FORCED to build the most compact honeycombed you can. It actually isn't an option. If you want to wake up after a single morning still alive you HAVE to build this way. I'm not sure what has changed but people used to not care. People used to build their way and it was not all the time but generally mutual. Now everyone's bases look the same/are built the same way. When you blow through a wall that's not a 2x2 you better believe there's another behind it.. and behind it.. and sometimes behind it... It requires way too much work for so little reward. Like I said if you or your friends have even a small bit of a life outside this game you CANNOT play it.",Rust

2016-02-28,0,0,131,True,Recommended,This is a very good game it may have a lot of grinding but is extremely satisfying when you get a base down and is extremely irritating when you lose everything to some guy who puts an arrow in your skull. Reccomended for players of the survival genre. If you like dayz there's a good chance you will like this. The devs update a lot and the development is no where near stagnant at the time of this review. People can be very salty online and it is not a game for those who rage easily.It has a good building system and like practically every survival game its way more fun when played with friends.,Rust

2016-01-26,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,Seems like a great game when you watch the trailers. However the world is very bland and is an incredibly hard to run at a smooth framerate. I have people I know playing at low medium settings with GTX 970s and still not getting great framerates. I played this game with a laptop with an 3rd gen i5 and a discrete graphics card with at least 1gb of ram. I get 11 fps at minimum settings. I made the mistake of buying this game without looking at the reccomended specs. The problem is this limits the playability of this game to fewer people. The expanses of what you can do in the game are very limited and I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone who wants a game with many different possibilities.,Rust

2014-12-29,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,"I've played 64 hours of Rust most of them in what's now called Legacy. What seems to be a ""throw everyone in an empty world"" simulator it ends up being most appropriately compared to human fecies. We've had alot of fun mostly due to funny bugs and ugly animations. Two hours after joining a server starting with nothing but a stone in your hand and a torch in your bag you feel like you've ""completed the game"". You're now seated in an impenetrable fortress with 30 000 wood in your chest and 10 furnaces running an industrial smelting operation. And you can craft everything in the game.As far as a survival games goes this really is comparable to human fecies animals can't attack you Zombies are removed. Gathering metal from one vein gives you metal for days and 10 trees chopped down would suffice for building an impenetrable house.",Rust

2014-05-28,0,0,786,True,Recommended,JULY 2016 EDIT So recently man babies have been whining about the recent XP update. Just get some friends and you're fine.Should you buy RUST? I say yes.But why? Well I can't even answer this. Perhaps it's the fine mix between scavenging and PVP. With the map's size (CURRENTLY) you can always find a player in a playsession in a server population of around 10. Unlike DayZ where you can go a literal 42 minutes without even seeing a player. In RUST you have to stay on your toes. The gunshots are loud espeically from your perspective. You can even scare yourself when a radioactive bear tries to make you his next snack. People can hear them from quite far away and that's why many fear shooting at all. But there's nothing more horrifying than hearing voices outside your house during the night or even worse no voice but footsteps. Is it a player? Or an animal? If it's a player are they friendly? Do they have weapons? These questions race through your mind during those crucial moments and determine your very survival.Base building in this game is amazing. You can literally erect a base in minutes but if you're not careful it can be destroyed in the same amount of time. Gathering wood is your main task and it's not easy mostly due to the fact that wood stacks can be found in large fields and there is no cover there. And unlike DayZ updates are often mostly on the experimental. Recently the entire game has been remade and updates are pushed out on the daily. Friday updates are something I look forward to and the community while they can be quite unfriendly are open to ideas (sometimes) (Seriously sometimes i'm not even kidding.)So this concludes my RUST review. TL DR Buy RUST It's unique!,Rust

2016-06-26,0,0,84,True,Recommended,I just thought I should come and write a review after seeing that some of the negative reviews are misleading.This is now my new favourite game.Going into it I had prepared myself to the thought of being owned that I would be killed on sight and stand a good chance to be raided and thus I have had a magnificent experience.The graphics are good they do a decent job of what they have to.I never experienced any problems with optimization and with my 960 gpu have had very smooth gameplay.It is hilarious playing this game as you run into such funny situations here is a small list of somethings that I have come across in my short time 3 man death squads where you must frightfully and with alot of fun escape and hide from. a group of naked men blasting reggae music through the mic and spreading positive vibes. a group of guys travelling around looking for other people to have rap battles with and also giving you all their valuable items. good members of the community teaching me how to build and giving me tips after breaking into my house leaving as friends.The community isn't that toxic as I thought after reading reviews (South African servers) not at all it's survival of the fittest and if you want a post apocalyptic survival game you can't be surprised that it sometimes resorts to killing on sight and that you can't trust anybody.I have been raided killed and I have lost everything its heart breaking and very terrifying. but not as much as it is a learning experience.I can't wait to sink more hours into this.I wish I had found this game sooner.You won't regret buying this game I say get it.,Rust

I thought I would like this game I really did! It looked fun and from everything I've seen it was! But when I picked up the game I knew I wouldn't like it. With a lack of singleplayer and servers filled to the brim with players who will kill on sight it's not a good game. I understand the game is in early access and will be changed (hope they add singleplayer) but unless they change a lot of things I wouldn't pick up this game.If you wanted a Pros + Cons list here is mine.Pros Good idea Pretty game Vast array of items Lots of detailCons Players will kill you on sight (and if they don't they will soon betray you) You have to SEARCH for MINEABLE rocks and trees If you log off your player is still there to be robbed looted and killed (It will happen EVERYTIME) You won't survive a slight tap on your headIn summary Great promise but I wouldn't reccommend it.,Rust

Topic 2 spawn the spawn points in rust are fairly ed up it is merely impossible to find a fellow friend in the vast wasteland of Rust.

2016-06-04,0,0,1240,True,Recommended,Ok This game IS SO DAM GOOD but also has some INCREDIBLY ANNOYING STUFF in it I have played Rust 170+ Hours and i enjoyed every single one. This game is really fun! Has some amazing Funny Modded servers to some Hard and challenging Vanilla servers. There is Battlefield servers there is x100 servers. Alot of different play styles. Ok i gana be honestt i DID have some Bad memories Which is LAG. The performance of this game is GARBAGE i Have a GTX 960 and I7 4790 Quad cored and 16 ram (To be Brief). And when it comes to some 2v2 Ak fight i drop to 30fps Which is a PAIN IN THE So I lose the advantage of the fight. ALSO those God Dam Animals can climb 90* degree angles (Some Superman Ok i gana give some Advantages of the Game an Disadvantages.Some Pros+Amazing Survival+Good Hunting Idea+Super active Devs+A lot of Guns+Need some skill+Can Wrek Some Noobs+Adictive Gameplay+Really good Crafting system+RAIDING WHICH I LOVEOk now for some Cons Hard for Single Player Dudes Really hard to master Hackers Performance is GARBAGE Animals climb rocks Really Buggy A bit to grindy Need to be super active on the game (If not you'll be easily raided) Really not friendly peopleOk this is been a fun time making this review I honestly moved from Vanilla to Modded as i am not super active in this game. So my review may be different But i had play Vanilla for a long time.I give it a 8/10 Just abit to rough on new people and Buggy I DO RECOMEND THIS GAME WITH SOME FELLOW FRIENDS ALSO FOR HARDCORE SINGLE PLAYERS!!!!

2016-06-17,0,0,150,True,Not Recommended,Abolutely toxic community. I like to think that the community that populates a game is a reflection of the game itself like what it has to offer how the mechanics affect gameplay etc. In the current state this game rewards violence as the ONLY mean of making progress which I really hope it's not what the devs had in mind.The tactic everyone follows is Manage to survive until you find a nice place to build your base start getting weapons and prepare to wreck some asses (if yours hasn't been wrecked already) wreck some asses and dominate the zone get tired of the game because now you have a massive unraidable base and start to kill on sight becoming the predator that once chased you when you were starting repeat. I think I will be giving this game some more time to be developped and I hope devs find a way to balance gameplay and progression because now this is literally nerve wrecking. Maybe in one year or two...,Rust

2014-08-06,0,0,67,True,Recommended,This game is a great survival game minus the hackers on the offical servers but if you don't mind dying a couple times everyday official severs are great because of the population.

2015-08-10,0,0,787,True,Recommended,Rust is the best survival game on the market. With that being said it has some flaws in it. let me give you a run down of the Pro's and Con'sPro's if you like a competitive survival game you will love this. the building element is strong. the fights are balanced. the game is very populated. the game is updated every thurday with new stuff coming out every week. (Recently the updates have been dry) the game is supported in every popular language even pirate! It has a lot of potential very polished never really gets boring promotes team work (but also gives the lone wolf some light) Raiding is fun Defending is fun Con's To run the game you need a average or above average computer the game contains nudity if you did not know (you can blur it out in the F2 menu) the game is stuck in Dev Hell its been in alpha for 2 years and will prolly never leave its state of alpha the thursday updates have been slowly becoming more and more dry as the year has evolved the devs have not held up to there promises (i remember during march they were saying they were going to drop cars in the coming weeks then drop a generator sometime after that and now were in december almost in the next year and they havent dropped anything really game changing then If your raiding in this game chances are your going to raid someone that is not even on which isnt even that fun the crafting system needs some serious help all in all i give the game a 7/10 its great its kinda going thought a slump right now its dry the community is tired of the same old same old. but its still one of my favorite games i can say that i have enjoyed my 500+ hours in the game (which is nothing) would i reccomend it Yes i would but the game has some issues stated above.,Rust

2014-02-12,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,Rust is highly unique for a videogame in that it is not fun. Your average game of Rust starts with you spawning either in the middle of ing nowhere or on top of a bear. From there you wander around aimlessly until you find someone willing to put you out of your misery typically an armed 14 year old Lebanese kid on a power trip. If you're feeling particularly sadistic you can convince your friends to waste their money on this turd of a game. Finding them will prove ing impossible however unless you joined the Ukrainian boy scouts and possess the orienteering badge needed to navigate the generic environment consisting of plains with forests plains with rocks and rocky hills modelled I'm guessing on some Eastern European . If you manage to find your buddies you can expect to engage in the fun of building a base only to have it get raided by people with more advanced than you or better yet have the server reset after 3 days or so making any of the tedious t you do in this game utterly meaningless. The game used to have zombies too but these were removed likely because the developers thought interacting with the the borderline community was close enough to fighting a zombie that having NPC zombies was effectively redundant. Game sucks Early Access is a total scam and Valve can suck a for offering one and only one refund per Steam account. If I were able to get a refund for this terrible game I would absolutely want one. Infact just avoid all these online survival games (Day Z State of Decay Dead State etc) as they're universally terrible.,Rust

2016-04-18,0,0,1040,True,Recommended,I recommend this game to those who are patient and ready for anything to happen as you will get killed frequently and raided daily if you don't have proper preperation. The game in itself is well done and is updated weekly with meaningful features being added/implemented. The community though is absolutely dreadful and with nothing but a rock you still get shot with bolt action rifles and ak 47's. The game also has decent optimization but requires a good computer just to run on reasonable settings. That aside though the game may be repetitive in the aspect of building a base and raiding but from the other players you NEVER know what to expect and anything can happen but that's the fun in the game. I give it 8/10,Rust

2014-03-28,0,0,103,True,Not Recommended,Its a very fun survival game but the community and development is very very VERY . The community is so bad it can be so depressing to see your house raided every week after all of the hard work you put into it and now you have to start all over because of some internet wanting to steal your stuff. The community of rust is 5% good people 20% stupid mean people that shoot on sight 70% 'bandits' (which apparently are people who raid people's houses or pretend to be your friend until your guard is down and then they stick a shotgun up your and fire.) and 5% people that hide away and never come out of their base. And bandits don't raid to survive they do it because they think it's fun. Also if you have looked at videos of Rust on YouTube it's usually the creator of the video raiding people and shooting freshspawns. The Administration is a problem all the power goes to the people who pay to keep the server running so this could include people who teleport to you and kill you just for the fun of it. They will ban people just for raiding their base.Another problem is the development it is so easy to craft guns (which I think shouldn't be in the game) which only takes about 1 1/2 game days to make you almost never die from the causes of deaths in the description of the game and when you disconnect from the server there is something called a 'sleeper' which is just an NPC which sleeps on the ground holding all of your stuff meaning anyone can come along shoot you in the head take all of your stuff and leave. 8 hours of work gone right there.That's Rust everybodyThat was the old Rust. The new Rust is even WORSE! D,Rust
2016-09-23,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,I am fed with hut simulators / grief simulators. I want a realistic survival game where you create / join a village and contribute further to it instead of build my own house and see it gone on the next day i login where the F are the guards guarding my hut / mansion / keep while i sleep? Every guy who joins to play the game joins to rule over others and not do someone elses bidding so put BOTS and AI for that why must i build a hut all day and see it gone over night? There are 2 sides here 1. Masochists who enjoys hut design simulator building a hut so it is destroyed by 2. Sadists who like griefing hutsTHATS ALL THE GAME HAS TO OFFERIt is not survival working for something to see it griefed or grief someone else die and then rinse and repeat. Survival is about picking a location settling down farming chopping mining crafting selling your goods recruiting NPCs to your village so it grows having farmers to produce food crafters to craft armor weapons clothes having traders to sell this food and materials at other players villages taxing people using money to hire guards that patrol your village using money to build walls and SURVIVE from bandits which do not grief from top to bottom but loot and burn a fraction of everything and kill a fraction of the civilians because they know if they kill everyone there will be NO LOOT next time or take over the land and claim it this is what a survival game should be and not a building hut simulator.,Rust

2015-12-22,0,0,597,True,Recommended,One of the greatest survival game out there even it's early access!This game creates communities and requires teamwork in order to keep your base up and gears safe from the other players. When you're out there in the world of rust just remember this Never trust in Rust!PROS + Graphics are great and getting improvements along with updates.+ Active dev which is constantly adding more things in the game and also fixes problems quite fast.+ Big and randomly generated maps.+ Fun to play even in +100 player servers.+ All kinds of modded and vanilla servers.+ Weapons are well balanced and they look like they're handmade.+ Blueprint system.+ Anti cheat system cheaters are going to enjoy long VACation after cheating in this game!+ Sleeping bags.+ Looting and gearing up.+ Great in game voice chat!CONS A lot of griefers and trolls Early access games always has some bugs but people uses these bugs as advantage to raid peoples bases. When you have good base you'll want to keep an eye on it almost 24/7 so anyone could not get in and take your stuff. Mostly impossible to play alone.Score 9 out of 10.,Rust

2016-01-30,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,While this game is very fun and enjoyable it still has its problems. Currently the game really has a lot to it in terms of exploration and crafting. You can get a good head start by finding things within old ruins of cities and buildings. I really enjoy the survival genre and have it as one of my favorites within the genre. The major issue for me currently is animals can just run straight up mountains and walls which maybe wouldn't be so bad if they also couldnt just walk through walls into bases you've built. On atleast 3 different servers I've had to pack up and start on a different one simply because I build a base get gear And a bear clips through the wall with 500hp and 5 bullets and a few arrows doesnt even phase it. You're able to respawn at sleeping bags/beds you craft but this does nothing when animals that can kill you in 3/4 hits ignore walls and can just sit on your sleeping bag. It's so frustrating infact I would ONLY reccomend this game if you can overlook the current major flaw. Until this is fully polished up in the coming months/years I would highly reccomend The Long Dark another (single player only). Once a few bugs are polished out this review will change from a no to a yes.,Rust

2017-05-29,0,0,23,True,Not Recommended,I definitely do not reccommend this game to people who do not like repetitive gameplay... rust seems to have a great concept going for it however you must be prepared to spend 2 5 hours crafting and farming and ultimately get killed by a wolf.. oh and by the way when you die the chances of you getting back all that stuff you just lost is slim to none so you can kiss that 5 hours of work goodbye,Rust
2016-07-02,0,0,8,True,Recommended,Product received for free. The rawness of Rust really astounds me every time I log in I've found tribes of naked people gangs of hoodlums and community's designed for survival. Much like other Survival games you'll question why you put so much time into your base just to see it raided one day your shelter destroyed and valuables stolen. You'll lament at the fact you got murdered because you stepped outside to collect wood and stones. And you'll find yourself obsessively preying on harmless noobs when their naked body runs past you. Only to find they were carrying a rock and a torch. But you'll love every second of it.The enjoyment comes from being unattached to your belongings and contributing to the predator/prey game dyanmic. Whether it be working towards a sense of security for you or an alliance with other players or unleashing mayham for unsuspecting players you'll feel a sense of satisfaction from completing your tasks. Between it's various versions and different servers there's a good deal to do.,Rust

Here's what I did my first few hours Logged on explored and met an extremely nice guy who invited me into his home gave me tons of free stuff attempted to teach me how to play and actually built me a home of my own. Then I logged out. I logged in several hours later to find that someone had killed me (IN MY OWN HOME) with a flamethrower and then screwed with my door so I couldn't even leave my own home. I then asked the community (if it can be so called) how to get out of the situation this griefer had put me in. They suggested I have sex with myself. It was at that point that I left and I will not be returning. Rust may well be the best game ever but if the community makes it impossible to even want to play it then what's the point??,Rust

What a rush even with all the hackers and toxic players it's survival at its best! I can see this becoming a contending title hanging with some of the best of the genre. Music and weapons are awesome the maps are cool and the caves and image effects are realistic. Still needs work specially with the animals but wow. AAAAAAAAAND now it's $9.99.

2015-12-29,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I was looking forward to this game seeing how i love the wilderness survival type games but when i bought the game and started to play I ran into a problem.My Laptop can run top of the line games such as GTAV at 50fps+ with fairly high settings but when i started up rust I couldn't even get 20 fps max. Even when i lowered all the settings to their lowest it didnt help much. SO unless you can trust your computer in running this i would take caution.If their wasn't an optimization issue which might onlybe my laptop I have no idea I feel this game has a lot of potential and wish I could have put more time into it but im not playing in 15fps game where everything and their moms want to kill you.,Rust

2016-07-30,0,0,109,True,Recommended,I can safely say Rust Legacy was one of my most favourite games of all time. I have sunk countless hours into building bases with my friends and raiding other places with c4 we found in a airdrop. I Know the whole Legacy map back to front where to find the best loot and where all of the towns and rads were. I remember building an eight story base with my friends and the intense moments of some other clan trying to raid us and we had to spend two hours defending our base. Legacy was what Rust should of been yeah I know there was rampant hackers who could raid your base and fly but it was so enjoyable to start fresh and build another base that it didn't matter to me. The low graphics didn't ruin the game because it made it more avaliable to everyone because it wasnt this big demanding and my old low end PC I had could run it. BUT the new Rust changed that at first I was thrilled that they had a more improved Rust comming but I think now that I have played it I find it to be absolute It was buggy and poorly optimised and still had ing hackers. They brought in more cancer than they got rid of and added this xp system. Sure it looks great but the game itself is so unenjoyable to play on your own. I loved Legacy but the new Rust is a up in everyway and should be fixed. Please FacePunch fix your ing game..,Rust

2015-07-10,0,0,1170,True,Recommended,I have a love / hate relationship with this game.As a player with a couple of friends Rust legacy was brilliant but spoilt by cheaters which was a shame I must admit the game requires most of your spare time to build up on a busy server a game you would need to play every day or you will no doubt be raided and lose everything.Teamwork is essential it is possible to be a lone wolf but you will be beaten down by teams eventually. I have been a server admin on a few servers but it really isn't much fun in the long run. I owned a server for a while the amount of time required to maintain it promote and look after the population was essentially a full time job. I can honestly say that blurring the lines between gaming and work is hardly fun or rewarding in the long run (unless you are making money of course!)The new version of Rust started out extremely buggy and I did my part to report bugs and contribute via Reddit and the Facepunch forums after a few months of doing this and not seeing much progress I gave up completely. The team at Facepuch are quite good as game developers but project management is certainly not one of their strong areas. To completely dump a game's development and start from fresh during the height of it's popularity was a bad decision.It seems now that Rust has many of the features that legacy had and will no doubt become as great as the old version I'm just not sure that the timing is right. Much of the community have had their fill of the game and have moved on I don't want to slip back into playing for 8 hours a day as I have a busy life away from the computer. I have tried to get back into the game but find that the servers wipe far too often due to updates when these are less frequent I may give it another shot.I still recommend the game though I have had many laughs with some great people while playing Rust. A game that can hold my attention for 700+ hours is definately a winner in my book even with it's flaws.,Rust

Highly recommended a good quality mic and try to make some friends in game in order to be a powerful group. Otherwise if you prefer to go solo around there you'll have to expect a hardest and longer game progress but enjoyable anyway.One advise This is a game. Don't get angry if someone betrayed you or your base has been teared down to pieces. EVERY SINGLE BASE is raidable.Bare in mind this is a *VERY ACTIVE* work in progress and things could change a lot in a couple of updates so if you like this game you better check the official Devblog at playrust.com every week .,Rust

2016-01-30,0,0,1280,True,Recommended,great game for meeting new people. Friendly and they help whenever they can. They treat you like family let you stay in their base. Super fun game. Bears are mean but thats ok. Admin gives us cool stuff too. Met some really cool clan named Kilit they showed me that I had my door on backwards and removed it for me like I said really nice people. They even gave me codes to their bases wow so nice. I dont have many friends since I am 500lbs and I live at home with my mom and eat donuts and drink monsters all day so to me Rust is the only social life I have. Sometimes my glaze covered fingers hit the worng buttons(see i just did it again) on the keypads and the locks get changed and my friends get mad at me. Sorry I didn't mean too. Its just that I am morbidly obese from playing RUST 24/7. Doctor says i have scurvy now so theres that. Thankfully I get to live off the welfare that is paid for by the taxes the KILITs pay for since they all have jobs and pay taxes. If you guys are reading this i just wanna say i love you and your welcome to stay down here in my basement anytime. Me and Lexi can spoon and she can drink my monsters and burp like she does in the streams. I watch them all the time best shows ever made. On the last episode I saw you raid some named zYe. He just wanted to be friends so I gave him Jellys door codes and he made himself at home. Mmm jelly donut sounds amazing right now.....MOM MOAR DONUTS NOW!!!!!! OK well i gotta go.

2017-08-02,0,0,1068,True,Recommended,"Hello and thank you for reading this review and I will explain to you why this game has gone down hill and why I still play this game. There are a couple points I will be reinterating and some points that other people have made. So lets go ahead and begin.1. Building in RustThe building in rust is remarkable and that is what alot of people bought the game for when it first came out in 2013 and why I bought it. The original has had it's moments when people were building in the air and they destoyed the bottom so noone could raid it when it was at the top of the map and noone could raid or get you. They fixed that with stability in later updates and if people tried then they were trolled made fun of and people just gave up and made better bases. Now when it comes to new rust or what old time rust people like me call it still (Rust Experimental) they changed it in a bad way. They started at such a good way when experimental was first out and then overtime the little kids and Zerg clans when to reddit and every public forum and complained about raiding was too hard and costed way too many resources. Gary Newell then listened to the zergs and little kids and made it to where that people could place twig foundations anywhere in toolcupboard areas which basically means the tool cupboard is useless. I know alot of people are going to say ""But without the toolcupboard then you cant make it out of Wood/Stone/Sheetmetal/HQ and place stuff in it."" and yes I would admit that but the problem is though is that they might just make a update where you can put auto turrets outside and just let it camp you the whole time in building priv areas. Gary needs to bring it back where Only You and whoever has building priv be allowed to build in those areas.2. Aimcone on the AK47Remember old rust players when the ak47 did not have a aimcone and that it took skill to kill someone and it took luck to get certain shots on someone. Remember how the AK47 used to be cheap because there was no components (will get to the component system later). So many kids and Zergs later again went to Public Forums and complained about how hard it was to use the ak47 and people complained to everyone and supposidly new people wouldnt like how the ak47 was. So Garry Newman said it lets feed into the BS and make it easier to use the ak and make it more like COD where its point and shoot. More and More people like me and others complained about how the update ruined it and then Gary said that if you don't like the mechanics of the game then did you at least get your money's worth out of it (or something like that) and we complained and some people wanted a refund but I still think its stupid to refund if we put thousands of hours in a game that is still freaking amazing and terrible at the same time. I wish that Gary would just not listen to the Zergs/Trolls/Little kids and just listen to the community who has been here for years.3. ZOMBIESEvery old time rust player will remember the Rad Zombies that were Red/Green/Regular zombies that would kill people and ran really fast or really slow and took like a stack of arrows to kill. Well he listened to the dumb people on public forums and removed it even though everyone in the community later complained and Gary apologized but still wont add back the zombies. I think if everyone spammed the forums of every public forum that gary reads then I believe that he would add them back.4. Bugs in RustAlot of people have realized that the team has been taking less and less time to fix the bugs and more time adding content to please the masses. One of the bugs that they finally fixed was the EAC Disconnect which was a nightmare during raiding because if that happened then you basically got screwed and people would take your stuff before you could go back in which took either a minute or if your in a server that is heavily populated then it would take hours to get back in and you found out that you died and you would rage quit. There was also a bug that if you spammed jumped on someone's head then you would get disconnected and that took them a long time to fix it.5. Crafting System (Component XP Blueprint)Everyone loves the BP system and that is why some servers on Rust Experimental still use the BP system and almost none have the XP system because XP SYSTEM IS TRASH. Good old Gary made the BP system which actually brung action into rust and you had to go out and destroy barrels loot crates weapon boxes etc to get BP and it was amazing. They kept this for a long time because it was a working system. Yet again I have to repeat myself Gary listened to the dumb people on public forums to get the BP system removed after having it for such a long time and then Gary Announced the XP system and people were furious because of a couple reasons. Number one reason is because Clans/Zergs had fun with this because they would get there slaves to use there equipment which let the slaves and the maker of the item to get xp and so when the masters get off for the night and the slaves are still on the master can just get back on after a couple hours and they are lvled up so many times. Solo players couldnt play in popular servers so alot of people created Solo/Duo/Trio servers and people left populated servers for these types of servers. Gary listened after about a month or so and made the component system. Component system is not as good as the BP system but WAY BETTER THEN THE XP SYSTEM. The component system added more items into the game which made people like it because people had to go destroy barrels to get items to make a gun which sounds more resonable. Alot more I want to say but im writing this at 9 30 at night.Final Statement.If you love Sandbox Action Games then you will love this but you will also hate it because of the Zergs/COD AIM/Trolls and alot more. So many bugs/glitches/crashes and Ram Issues that make the game unplayable sometimes. The game is really fun so I do recommend but only if you can play the game and deal with the issues that come with early access games.",Rust

They could be like the creaters of H1Z1 and not ever do a damn thing. But they listen to their community and the DEVs they love you guys and the game wouldnt be as badass as it is now if we didnt love and play the game. Give them some info.

2014-06-06,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,The idea behind RUST is amazing. I was excited to find it since I had looked for quite awhile for a game like it. However once playing it for myself I quickly regretted my purchase.Yes this game is Early Access. My complaints aren't bugs although I ran into plenty of them... my complaints lie with the fundamental idea of the game including the harsh start (trying to kill animals for food when all you have is a rock and dying from either hunger or attacked by a hostile animal when you cannot yet defend yourself)My biggest problem with this game however is the multiplayer features. If you do somehow manage to get ahold of yourself with food and shelter it can all be taken away in an instant by one of the many idiots that roam the land with you and will kill you for no reason even if you are running around with nothing but a rock. It's a major flaw of all games which incorporate multiplayer in this way... the problem isn't necessarily the game but human nature. If you like the kind of thing I've explained here go for it... but after all the frustration and anger this game has put me though (I don't usually get mad at video games but what I've mentioned in this review explains why I got so aggravated) I don't think I'll be playing again anytime soon unless some major changes are made. If I have time to waste I'd rather do it with a game where I will actually have something to show for my time within the game instead of countless deaths and nothing to show for my effort but maybe a stone hatchet and some sulfur.,Rust

2014-12-19,0,0,338,True,Not Recommended,Short Version A once great game ruined by developer hubris and contempt for players.Long Version A bait and switch which may come to define the early acess genre. Rust started out as a great game supposedly in alpha. Despite the rough state of the game it was easy to recommend to friends. We hopped in and quickly set about creating a feudal state which stretched its reign of terror over the entire server. Great fun. Then the problems started. The developer stopped fixing easy bugs or introducing any new features. He decided the alpha was in fact a tech demo. He threw out all his old code and redeveloped the game from scratch. He took the new game in a different direction. The new game is simply not fun or even that closely related to the previous game. If you raise a complaint about this however politely on the company servers you will be banned. IMO this is every unethical. Further the quality of the deployed code while never strong was much worse in the new version with many simple features failing to work. The developer treats early access as an excuse to have players test broken code as opposed to gameplay ideas and fails to follow simple tenants of software engineering. To top all this off once you start the game the developer taunts you by suggesting you tell them how they are bad at their job on steam. Facepunch you are bad at your job.,Rust

2016-04-09,0,0,261,True,Recommended,This game is increadibly unique although it seems like it might not be. This game has some amazing featers that greating make the enjoyability of this game skyrocket beyond my expectations but has some very intensly powerful cons to go with it. This game beyond any other has made me more friends on steam then any other game I own or have ever played and nor dose any other game come close. The intence high stakes high reward feature of this game makes the interactions with people more intence or scary and less like meeting someone in a video game as well as makeing the gameplay very addicting. This game also doesnt fail to make you want to be on all the time your constantly scared that your base might be getting raided you need to fix your house ect. It also is a very social game in that playing solo makes things much harder which encorages teams and gets people to convince their friends to purchase it I know I personaly got 3 of my friends to buy the game to play it with me. But this wonderfly sucesful game has its many flaws. I find myself in teeth clenching fist pounding anger for reasons I shouldnt be. this game attracts itsself a ton of hackers using things like aimbot and flying to make the game impossible for other players I found myself extremly angry when a hacker flies into my house takes all my stuff and destroys my house causing me to re start and I didnt even get to defend myself. As much as this should be expected it happens way to often to make the game enjoyable. Another flaw is that because of the high stakes people become very rude and it is almost unbelievable some of the things people will say and do to you. It also becomes nearly impossible to start fresh when a server is full because people with gear will shoot on site other lower level players with bows will shoot on site and nakeds such as yourself will chase you untill you or they die as well as the overspawned bears and wolves which are extremly hard to fend off. After this game being out for about three years now i find it absolutly rediculouse that they havent been able to fix this stuff and that its still an alpha. I love rust but at many times I think that its cons weigh out its benifits and yet i never stop coming back for more.,Rust

Stay away from every player you see because they'll track you down and kill you out of boredom or spite. This isn't a thoughtful survival game it's Call of Duty with naked people. Before you craft your first bow &amp arrow (and good luck figuring out how any of this works seeing as there's no tutorial or manual or guide) you'll have gotten shot by some troll with a rifle and more ammo than he knows what to do with.I think once you've crafted some stuff you start to get bored so you hunt down newbies to ruin their experience too.I should've seen this coming I mean the developers say ""We haven't totally decided where the game is headed "" and then say ""We have a plan... trust us.""

It also doesn't support the use of controllers and this is really one of those games where that needs to happen. Just type in ""Controller + Rust"" and you'll get a pretty good notion that the developers have no idea how to impliment it because the community has been asking for it for the better part of two years. Speaking of community if you enjoy hackers and people calling you a then this is the game for you! If can scrounge up enough wood to build a house and not get shot in the back before you've crafted your first pair of boots then enjoy having someone walk through the walls of your house to steal your goods or aimbot you while you're farming. You know a games good when some 13 year old who found script online can grab your stuff befor flipping around and claiming that the only reason you got robbed was because you left all of the doors in your house open.

2017-06-09,0,0,4,True,Not Recommended,As a precursor for this game and the comments ill recieve after I dont mind raiding at all. its part of the game getting ganked is normal. However this game IS in early alpha and isnt worth 20 dollars. Because of this im getting a refund. There is so many missed opportunities in the game that I cant bring myself to reccommend it.RESOURCESRust is a survival game based around living in the middle of nowhere during a post apocalyptic crisis. you gather these resources to build your base craft and keep your character alive. Its a great concept as its been done to death and really hard to mess up but rust does it. I walked around the map for an hour and couldnt find anything to eat and died 4 times in a row over the course of an hour because all the food is gone. and I understand that its a server based thing but what makes that okay? a basic element of a game is almost impossible to get because everyone else has it. in any survival game it should not be that hard to find food. Every time I mention there being no food in the game they tell me to go kill some horses or something. Wheres the horses? ive seen 2 animals in my 4 hours of this game. Your character starts out with a stone. its a basic tool. everytime you use it the durability gets weakened so you cant keep it forever. Not a big deal right? theres tons of rocks around the map I should be able to just hit one and get more stone? except theres only 3 types of certain rocks that are mineable all these other brown rocks are just decoration. the worst part? if you accidentally hit one of these rocks with a pickaxe or the rock that you spawn with its durability goes down every time you hit it. What sense does this make? So now because rocks are SOMEWHERE in the map you have to go looking for a rock. cant find one? too bad keep looking. the normal thing to do here would be to get wood in the meantime right? Now that youve got all this wood from this basic rock its dead and you have to get another one. You dont have any stone and the only thing that you can use to get more rocks is the stone itself. No game should trap me like this. Looks like you gotta do some killing. WEAPONSsince you dont have that rock anymore time to kill someone who just spawned in the game to take his rock. Take some of that wood and make a spear. before the player even had a chance to protect himself because the server was loading you killed him. My only real problem with weapons in the game is that you can make a ing rocket launcher in the middle of nowhere with scraps from a abandoned oil drum and some old fuel. for me the game is so oriented around killing other people and not actually surviving.,Rust

2015-11-07,0,0,321,True,Recommended,"Oh god. how could I not recommend this game? It is excellent and is only in alpha! Not only are the core mechanics amazing the graphics are BEAUTIFUL. Even when you have the graphics on low and everything it looks great. Some say the game gets repetitive (looking at you. Frankie) but the community has diversified the game and there are a ton of mini games you can try. There is Battle Royale Ruskitball Role Play Team Deathmatch 1 on 1 Showdowns and many more that you can discover yourself. Now DO NOT BUY if you have below 4 gigabytes of ram on your computer it will lag horribly. I also recommend that you have a graphics card that can run games like Batman Arkam Night Fallout 4 WItcher 3 GTA 5. The community in this game is hilarious you will run into so many people with crazy personalities. For example one time I met someone who only ate his food raw uncooked. He said it was his fetish. After hours of spending time with him. He told me that he also likes to eat human meat. He then led me into his house and locked the door. He told me ""It's nothing personal you just seem... Meaty"" He then slaughtered me and cut up my body and of course ate it raw. That was a little long. Anyways... The building creation system is near perfection. It could use some changes but at it's current state I cant say anything bad. For anyone wondering this game is created on the Unity Game Engine. If your PC can run this game fine then BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY. Oh and the alternative Ark? If you want a game that uses Rust's core mechanics weird looking avatars and dinosaurs and costs $15 more than Rust and a ton of MMORPG elements then buy. If not save some time and money and just buy Rust.",Rust
2013-12-12,0,0,203,True,Recommended,"You may have played ""Garrys mod""? Anyway this game is being developed by the same guy (but not only by Garry himself).It's a mix between minecraft and dayz but the zombies will be removed in future updates. I have a high confidence about Garry and his crew i think they will make this game a lot better and hopefully it will be one of the most outstanding survival games there is.My recommendations for you as a newcommer is to look up gameplays before you decide to buy it. The endgame right now isn't that much yet but thats a high priority on their to do list.It's one of few games that i've actually enjoyed in early access._Pros_&amp _cons_+ Building and crafting.+ Large map.+ Garry and his crew (Yeah cred for the devs actually for being so tight with the community).+ Frequent patches. Lack of the endgame content.EDIT Garry and his team have started from scratch again with a better engine. Until it's finished you can play the experimental build (the new engine) or play the old alpha version that won't be updated. Check their progress at www.playrust.com.",Rust

2017-11-04,0,0,401,True,Recommended,I can't seem to stop playing this game. It upsets me that I have to go back to Real Life! The game is good for all play styles. You can play in large groups on high populated servers. Or hang with a friend on a low pop one. Building and raiding is fun. They constantly work on improvements so expect good changes. Addicted!!,Rust
2017-11-04,0,0,562,True,Recommended,The best way to describe rust is that it is a pure sandbox game. You can play the game anyway you like and this will definitely change your outlook on whether or not you enjoy it. You spawn in with nothing and are left to explore an island left in shambles to gather resources meet other players or more likely get killed by them if you're not careful. You can use the materials to build a base of any caliber whether it be for the best defense to be a shop or to be a simple home. If it doesn't work out like you had planned you can try a different approach on a different server or after the next wipe.Over my time playing the game I have learned that if you are looking for a high risk environment and enjoy actively fearing for losing all of your stuff servers with upwards of 50 players are what you should look for but if you're looking for a more lenient game where you can get away with being a peaceful shop keep or anything like that a small server with a close community would be best for you.I have really enjoyed rust over my 350 hours playing it at the time and it has definitely grown a lot since I started. I would definitely reccomend it.,Rust

2017-11-05,0,0,262,True,Not Recommended,Before I start i would just like to say that no matter how bad of a game I have played I have never left a review before because the reviews normally cover everything and I am just not normally the type of person who likes to complain. However with this game I feel like I needed to leave a review. I have logged a decent amount of hours on this game and feel like I have given it a fighting chance and to be fair the game as whole is really fun. The main problem with the game is actually the community itself. They are pure cancer I have never met a community more unwilling to help new players enjoy the game. I have also never seen this amount of cheating/hacking taking place with little or no repercussions because of how terrible the anti cheat software is. For example I had my multi layer stone base with about 30 metal doors broken into using just wooden spears and they were some how able to change the codes on the doors as well. That is just one example of how easy it is to cheat. There is not much much more that I can say about this game other than dont waste your time until Rust sorts it out!,Rust

2014-01-20,0,0,289,True,Recommended,Alpha Ver. Review For the new players definitely watch Rust tutorial youtube videos because they help a lot. Especially map tutorials because you can get easily lost in this game. I recommend to stay near the main road and find spawn resources of any kind. It's somewhat difficult to solo this game but bringing friends or forming alliances with other players will improve your game experience. When you find a research kit and something you like in the game use the research kit to learn that item. Once you learn how to play the game everything from that point is easy. Double wall everything from inside to outside the main wall because other players will try to use c4 to destroy your walls very easily. Once you die you will have to start all over again or you have to run as fast you can where you died so you can get your stuff back.My review This game is so addicting and fun I can't think the last time I had fun since I played Wolfenstein ET or Pre BC Vanilla wow. The game has great potential because its something new fun and cool. I can't wait for the new upcoming updates and actual game to come out. I would like to see a character customization choosing a side to play human or zombie more more weapons name plates zombie world events more zombies a kill count / death count list during in game. I especially would like to see the use of transporation such as cars in the game. The game would be really amazing if there were weather conditions implements such as thunderstorms fog snow etc. Third person shooter view option would be great as well. What I don't like are the death and respawn mechanics and the ability for other people building on your property especially if they don't have permission. I believe that in order to build on someone's property it should be the same thing when you /share doors. I've seen people loose their camps because they needed one more wall to build and they wonder off somewhere to farm and they come back findig someone has overtaken their property because of that last wall.More upcoming reviews... Thank you for reading this review.,Rust

You come accros firend or enimies that may try raid your base to get the stuff you worked hard for but its all apart of the online experience. i would recomend to anyone that gets this game that just dont trust anyone watch videos on how to understand the basics and such and you should be fine!

2016-12-16,0,0,288,True,Recommended,Although challenging and much of the community stereotyped as very toxic and curle rust is a a perfect blend of realism with challange without being frustratingly difficult to play and incredbly fun. I began playing in the beging of the componet system implanted in rust one I belive allows the more casual solo player to get their feet in the water and have a good staning after acouple of hours of learning and some failed attempts. Me and my friends have all bought this game and over the past two moths or so have enjoyed it throughly. I'd highly recomend this game to anyone who enjoys gritty survival aspect games with a nice blend of (very high celling) combat and raid potential.Highly recomend to solo players playing with friends and yes.. clans if you so choose 63/10 nice one guys,Rust
2017-01-05,0,0,651,True,Recommended,Rust is a love hate for meI started and logged probably 150 hours in legacy. I loved it to death. The learning curb was massive due to hackers and KOS.But once you learned the ropes you could live peacefully and then it was kill or be killed. Then they redid the game. And at first I hated everything about it and kept going to the old game.Then me and a friend went in together and learned the ropes and now I'll log in every month or 2 to log a few hundred more hours and log off cause I'm one of the few if not many who are ready for the finished product. I suggest if you dont know how to play then watch youtube to get the feel before jumping in.Other than that if you can find a server that you love and avoid some of the more toxic people then this is the best survival game for the price and the content that you get. Thanks gary and facepunch for one of the few games that I got my money's worth on. Keep up the good work and I cant wait till you're out of early access. Till then I'll be back and forth to see the progress of a game I get lost in.,Rust

2015-07-06,0,0,212,True,Not Recommended,So I have about 170 hours on old rust and the rest on the new rust. Here are my reasons why you should NOT buy this game.1. The biggest reason not to buy this game is because you have to have a jesus computer or the presidents laptop to play this game. I say this because if you don't spend atleast $3000 dollars on a good computer this game will run like because of the unoptimized graphics.2. If you want to survive in this game alone go make some friends. I say this because you will get ed over 24/7 no matter what server you are in because people are s and KOS or Kill On Sight because they just like killing people for no good reason and you need a group of people to stay alive.3. Building.... Dear god... I don't even know where to begin with this one. Overall it's better than the old school building with only 2 materials to build your house out of wood and metal. I think it's buggy as hell but I can't say that because its still in (Early access) whatever.. That's all I really have to say about this game but if you still wanna buy it after reading this review please consult a phychologist.,Rust

2017-05-21,0,0,23,True,Recommended,Rust is an open world PVP survival game where you craft things to defend yourself against either animals or players (mostly players) Has Potential it has great graphics however is not well optimized.. Like my mate has a quad i5 3.5Ghz and Nvidia 980 and 16gb ram and it STILL didn't run well.. is fun with friends however is quite unfriendly to new players on their own... it seems to throw you into this world where you don't really know whats going on and you tend to die a lot from either animals or players. But I do recommend this game if you have a powerful computer and have friends to play this with as it can be at times very entertaining.,Rust

2017-11-11,0,0,66,True,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game in its present form. I understand that it is in alpha. However the constant wipes every week make it hard to get anywhere with building a base or really progressing at all. Likewise you have a lot of kill happy folk who really just want to play Halo and will KoS anything that moves. The only way to really progress much is to find a server with no one on it but then at that point you aren't really playing an MMO. Maybe I will come back to it in a year....,Rust

Well I have to say the game is still extremely fun even though it seems more hacks have joined since Steam Release. I will admit I hate the new durability because your weapons are now extremely week but I just choose to play on servers with Durability.

2016-04-17,0,0,458,True,Recommended,Truly Rust?The Modern Rust A Normative Critique. Rust a well made game. Pretty fun THE RAIDS ARE TO DIE FOR! Rust gets you butthurn alot because people raid you. Overall a well made EAG (Early acess games for you n00blets). Please just get the game! Rust is an iron oxide usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron oxides Fe2O3 nH2O and iron oxide hydroxide Fe3).Given sufficient time oxygen and water any iron mass will eventually convert entirely to rust and disintegrate. Surface rust is flaky andfriable and it provides no protection to the underlying iron unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces.,Rust

2015-01-09,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,"Unfortunately I can't recommend this game at this time. The game really is beautiful and has a ton of potential but there's just entirely too much wrong with it that shouldn't be. Let's first talk about the ""Alpha"" status of the game. The concept of a game being in ""alpha"" but still being released is fairly new and many indy devs have done it well (7 Days to Die Space Engineers Kebal Space Program etc.) while others simply don't. This is one of the latter. Even though the game is technically in ""alpha "" when you're charging $20+ for the game users should be able to expect to see some progress. Tagging your application with the ""Alpha"" label does not give you carte blanche to collect money will providing nothing in return. The payment for the game is with the understanding that the developers are making a promise that the game will progress until completion. Accepting payment then failing to progress (or suddenly progressing in a different direction such as making the game for cell phones with a micro transaction system I'm looking at you Peter Molyneux) is a breach of contract and players certainly have every right to be upset when this happens.When you have game breaking ""features"" missing these should be added promptly. Unfortunately looking back at videos from a year ago it seems as if nothing has actually changed. Here are some of the core issues I've found that seem little different (and by ""little"" I mean it was exactly like this a year ago judging by the YouTube videos) 1.) Setting up a server yourself takes a near act of God. You at least have to be quite technically savvy and there's no single player option. This means you're forced to play on servers where players enjoy sniping you with a bow from a distance which puts the ""bleeding"" effect on you. When ""bleeding"" you will die within seconds. 2.) As mentioned above the ""bleeding"" effect is entirely pointless. You'll die long before you'd have time to create a bandage to stop the bleeding. Worse still even if you already have one prepped and ready chances are you'll die before you can get it applied. ""Bleeding"" should be renamed to ""gushing from the femoral artery."" At the least they should just have you killed immediately by getting one shotted by everything in the game. At least then you wouldn't get your hopes up.3.) EVERYTHING causes the bleeding effect. Every time someone attacks? Bleed/die. Every time an animal bites? Bleed/die. I one time was completely by myself in the middle of nowhere mining ore and just spontaneously STARTED BLEEDING and died.4.) When you die you'll be randomly woken up naked and starting over somewhere else in the game.5.) There is NO MAP. I repeat there is NO MAP and nothing more than the position of the sun and moon to give you a basic idea of what direction you're moving. In procedurally generated worlds this means that after spending hours creating a house then getting a random ""bleed "" you're basically starting over every time. There's no way to find your way back to your house. 6.) When building better make absolute sure that this is PRECISELY how you want something placed. There is no way possible to ""undo"" what you've done until late late in the game when you can ""craft"" explosives to blow up your work. At one point I finally decided that the lack of foreplanning on the structure meant I would just be better off completely abandoning it and moving elsewhere to start over. (Which was convenient because at that point a wolf bit me and I bled out.)This is all just some BASIC functionality here that's pretty horribly broken. The game has its share of ""alpha"" level glitches bugs and balance problems but those are to be understood when talking about an alpha. However when charging people to play the game a year is entirely too long to wait for very basic gameplay issues to be fixed. I managed to make it almost 2 hours before finally giving up. Which truly is a shame. I WANT to like this game. I like the crafting system the interface is solid the graphics are beautiful but it's just not yet in a playable state. And apparently has been in this same state for well over a year. I'm actually quite surprised at the number of positive reviews. As an indy developer myself I tend to be quite lenient when it comes to Alphas but this one just isn't going to get the thumbs up. Not when I know that at the very least adding something as simple as a coordinate system reducing the speed of the bleed effect and adding the ability to remove a house object that you placed would take one developer less than an hour to fix and would make the game immensely more playable.",Rust
2015-01-09,0,0,54,True,Not Recommended,When Rust first came out I had a great time playing and exploring. I learned to distrust most other players fairly quickly because of the scarce resources. For most it's easier to kill a freshspawn and steal their stuff then it is to actually go out and find the stuff. I was ok with this though because in the end you were fighting for survival against wild life zombies and the elements. But the server crashes and overall glitchiness of the game was what put me off. I could have a nice metal shack within a community of friendly players in a good location but all that would be wiped during server downtime and I would be forced to start all over again for no reason it got real frustrating. Recently the game has been unplayable buggy features and unstable servers make for a bad experience. If you don't already own the game I would wait for at least the beta but who knows when that will be.,Rust

2015-01-17,0,0,824,True,Recommended,"Disregard all the negaive reviews of this game. I am one of the most veteran players around my words hold truth.In this game you start naked and have nothing but a rock (and sometimes a torch). You must build eat kill fight and survive. That is the entire game so if you enjoy freedom of choice then there are many adventures to embark upon and many people to meet in Rust. This game is in development and has been taken down and resurrected again. Many people say that this game has taken too many steps backward that is and understatement seeing as how they had entirely started rebuilding from the ground up. This game has updates brought weekly and has had bounds and leaps of graphically updates implemented but most people see this as ignoring what we ""the consumer"" want. Yesterday I saw airdrops brought back rad towns exist again loot crates reappear and the thrill of being chased down after getting an airdrop. The developers are bringing it all back and from there they have stated numerous times that they are going to continue building up from there. I am proud of the work they have done and am ashamed of the people who call these men and women money grubbing monsters. Be very ashamed that these same ""comsumers"" who claim money grubbing are now playing a game that charges people for airdrops that contain end game weapons and armor.I love this game and I have seen soo much progress come forward since it's earlier dayz.

Since it had been released in early access several years prior to THAT even when I stumbled across it in my library a couple days ago I expected a fairly polished product (or at least something that really showed that this game has been in development for years.The first thing I noticed upon spawning in was how horribly unoptimized this game is. I have an excellent gaming rig and I nearly had to bottom out the graphics settings just to get it to run smoothly. I've heard great things about the graphics when they're maxed out but the fact that I can play much prettier games at full bore while being forced to lower my graphics substantially to play this is pretty telling.The next thing I noticed is that the persistent building mechanics make every world a massive mess. Literally anyone who logs on to a server can build and those buildings stay there until the server is wiped which oftentimes happens several times a week on a given server. There is hardly a patch of clear ground in the servers I tried and the poor building mechanics and the need to make your base as hard to raid as possible (more on that later) means that most structures are an absolute blight to look at and very out of place. It's a pretty disappointing system in that there are so many crappy structures that there's very little to explore and even if you like building your structure will be gone in a couple of days anyway and you'll have to start from scratch.Speaking of starting from scratch I hope you have hours upon hours to spend grinding out quality materials because if you don't you will get killed while you're logged off. Yes you heard that right when you leave to do other things you can still get raided your stuff stolen and killed. If you want to come back and pick up where you left off you better hope you fortified your base with top tier or near top tier materials before you log which takes several hours of straight grinding to achieve. Even then a committed team can still break down and destroy the most fortified structures so you're really just crossing your fingers that no one well equipped enough stumbles upon your base. Additionally you're forced to make your base as convoluted as possible to discourage raiders which makes it a huge eyesore and difficult to navigate. There's also little to no functionality to remove structures you've built after you place them meaning a wall or floor placed wrong means you need to either start completely over blow up with top tier explosives or spend a massive amount of time breaking it down with tools. The combat seems to be the main selling point of Rust but it lacks the same punch as games like DayZ or the Culling. In DayZ everyone had guns it was a piece of cake to find them and always ended up making engagements fun. In the Culling melee weapons were able to contend with firearms because guns were scarce had little ammunition and were difficult to use. In Rust you hope that the people who have been playing longer don't randomly kill you because there is absolutely no way you can contend with firearms if you're still using low tier weapons. There's very little logical progression either you go straight from spears and sticks and rocks to rifles and machine guns. Despite the fact that this game has been in development for years there's very few weapons to choose from at all. There are so many aspects of Rust that I really really like. I love the hunting I love the base building I love the friend or foe interactions with other players but none of it is really that good. There are few animals to hunt and there's no way to sneak up on them forcing you to do the same chase shoot chase action every time. The base building is clunky there aren't enough options and it looks awful in the world. The interactions are generally poor because the game is so shallow there's nothing to do but kill people once you hit a certain point.I really want to like Rust and maybe it'll blossom into an amazing game some time in the future. I just don't count on that given how long it's taken them to reach where they are now.,Rust

In game you can became a slave which is not as bad as it sounds you get food water and a place to spawn and all you have to do is help out if they are nice if they are not then as long as you listen you will be fine.,Rust

2017-07-10,0,0,419,True,Not Recommended,The most cancerious community ever sometimes on the populated servers you can't even get out of the beaches for an entire 30 minutes because you keep getting killed by newspawns. Even though the game is PG18 I've met about 100+ 12 year olds. Farming the resources for a decent base will cost you an entire day of farming unless you're with a clan or some buddies that will most likely betray you. I've seen more development from games that are basically still in beta after this day like warframe but thank god that game came out of ing alpha not like this. Sometimes the devs would change their minds and recreate the entire game in another genre and loose all progress made which is why I believe this game should still be in the Dev's thought bubble.The development of the game is so slow because they take weeks to develop something that should be done in a day screw the bugs that come with it the game is in alpha. They mainly make money off game sales and item sales while games like warframe pull it off with ingame currency and player created content.,Rust

There is cheater in official server also which shouldn't be.Unfortunately i would not reccommend this game until this aspect is totally fix,Rust

2014-05-28,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,This game is a complete waste of time. After fruitlessly trying to get started for 4 hours I didn't manage the bare basic of assembling a sleeping bag and shelter. Why? Because every single goddamn time before I managed I got killed by either a bear wolf another player radiation or hunger.,Rust
2017-11-07,0,0,610,True,Not Recommended,I can't in good consience recommend this game. I own over 100 games this is the first game I've felt compelled to write a review for. This game is a perfect example of why alpha's do not work. This game is older and has more funding than almost any other alpha ever and the problems are stil massive. For anyone who knows nothing about this game basically you run around gathering trying to build up a base and your knowledge so that you can craft parts to get better gear. Servers vary in their pvp culture but on the official servers most players are KOS. So you can imagine how difficult it can be if it's just you or you and a friend trying to get started with just a piece of rock when so many other players are running around with AK's. But that's fine I understand that's the game I signed up for and I'm fine with that. Where the frustration sets in is when you spend so many hours grinding only to have your progress thwarted by a server crash. I had just spend the last 2 hours gathering loot in one of the most dangerous places on the map and considered myself very fortunate to have almost made it back to my small base as I was crossing a river the server once again randomly crashed and when I got back on I found I had drowned and all the hard work I had put in was for naught. Things like this are common occurences. The devs are still clearly adding to the game which is great but they really should spend more time into making their servers not complete pieces of lag spikes are so common and the crashes are constant. Maybe one day they'll get it figured out and this will be a great game but for now it's far from complete and I wouldn't recommend the investment of time and money.,Rust

2016-07-24,0,0,132,True,Recommended,Okay Rust is a very good survival Game and open world type. but it's still in Beta with the fact that it can sometimes get you bugs. But nonetheless It's still a very good game as you can see in my hours of playing it. Especially if you have a friend with you. But because it's still in a Beta form or alpha The servers sometimes gets wiped. but that's a good thing to to keep balance of the players so no one can go way overpowered in the game and also the anti cheat tool they use is great but if you wipe a server at least leave the experience point behind for other so that we won't go back to level 1 so Yeah I recommend thi Game a lot and Cheers! to the creators of this Game ),Rust
2016-11-24,0,0,339,True,Recommended,This game is great....and then you get raided and they take EVERYTHING FROM YOU....and then you realize that you didnt have that much stuff anyway cause you used all of it making your amazing base that is still in tact....and then you get raided again....and then you uninstall....and then your friend wants to play Rust so you reinstall....and then the cycle begins again...,Rust

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did.

2017-09-03,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Rust has it's share of problems but it is in general a decent game.My issue with Rust is that it's a difficult game to play online as you can't trust ANYONE. On the larger servers its almost impossible to compete as a solo player and smaller servers (5 6 people) are so devoid of interaciton it gets dull. Primarily Rust needs a single player but it could also do with some kind of dedicated group system where when joing a big server players are given the option of joining a group that way they have people to play with who wont raid them as soon as they log off.,Rust

If you have friends to play with however this game is THE BEST game to play with friends.

2016-08-23,0,0,130,True,Not Recommended,This game is honestly an amazing survival game possibly the best I've seen but there's a huge problem in it right now. If you don't have any friends to team up with every time you play or you just want to survive in the game alone then get used to starting from scratch every single day. It's impossible to survive on your own and actually do well in this game. Clans just have too much power and if you're new to a server then for the first few days that you go on that server you're going to get wiped out everytime as you level up to get your first gun. I like to think I represent the average gamer. I have a job that I have to go to most days so I don't have a ton of time to put into videogames I can usually play for 4 hours usually give or take depending on the day and I don't have a ton of friends to play with maybe one other friend who might have the game and sometimes is willing to play. To actually craft your first reliable ranged weapon a bow takes a few hours of straight farming for the xp then even more time to actually get the resources to make it. That's assuming you're able to go under the radar long enough to not be interupted by constant deaths and slaughters for no reason. Clans are impossible to even consider taking down and usually even if you're able to build a little hut out of metal they'll still get in overnight while you're sleeping and take you out without even giving you a chance. That happens so often it gets to the point I'm just discouraged from playing anymore. I know there isn't a lot Facepunch can do about raiders it's apart of the game and they can't just remove it but something needs to be done to give solo players a chance. It's to the point where I'll build a 2x2 metal house and spend all day making it just to wake up the next morning and find it raided and me dead. I find my house again and try to rebuild then I have to go to work and when I get home I'm raided they blocked off my cabinet and walled me in so my only option is to use the kill command. I trust eventually the devs will do something about this and when they do I'll change my recommendation but for now I only recommend it to someone with 4 or 5 friends who have the game too and can all team up to kick the little guy.Update Nothing has been done to solve this problem. They've changed mechanics but the core idea is the same. To make matters worse ladders can now be put on the sides of walls and can be climbed even if you don't have buidling permission in that area and to craft a counter to that is expensive and difficult so the only way to protect against it is to complete a full roof. That's a problem if you plan on expanding up it means that if the enemy has ladders (and if it's a clan they always will) they will be able to get in your base. They added the ability to put locks on chests and cabinets which is a step in the right direction so theres that. Review still stands however.,Rust

2017-07-16,0,0,159,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a very competitive deceptive and manipulative game where your survival is based on the relationships you can form with those around you. You must do whatever it takes to survive collect resources and weapons store them in locations where no one else can find or get to them. I got this game because my brother needed people to play with. I have tried playing this game on my own but no matter how well you build a base fight off other players and collect guns you will be fighting an uphill battle because everyone else on the server is in a team. The minute you log off go for your dinner go to bed or go to school/work your character is almost guaranteed to be getting his head pummelled in by a rock while others are carrying your precious items away to their bigger better and superior bases.All in all it can be very exciting when you have a team who knows what they're doing. However if you're a lone wolf save yourself the trouble and don't buy this game.,Rust

I personally got mid game gear by camping a town for it's spawns within an hour. some minor bugs have been fixed as well which is nice but still that's all it really is a bug fix.while updates are being pumped out at least somewhat frequently they've really not added much to this game.even the devs don't even know what they want to do with the game just yet. We are in very early development. Some things work some things don't. We haven't totally decided where the game is headed so things will change. Things will change a lot. We might even make changes that you think are wrong. But we have a plan. It's in our interest to make the game awesome so please trust us. y'okay. so we could be beating a rock against a tree one day for all we know the next day we could be drinking a beer and swinging our at traffic for bonus points.(in my honest opinion you'd probably have just as much fun doing that anyway)now let's dive into what EVERY SINGLE PERSON else says.I know what you're thinking GASP BUT VENN that's mainstream!BUT IT'S SO DAMN TRUE.the community is absolute S H * T. You WILL be shot chased camped mugged beaten with a rock and mauled by bears as well just to add to the mayhem.I wouldn't mind playing the game as much if it weren't for the community. you've got your aimbottersflyersKOS PVPersand just general s.and limited hours of potential gameplay. unless you enjoy having to log on EVERY SINGLE ING DAY just to make sure your house doesn't suddenly poof vanish into nowhere. bugs are annoying as well as crippling in some aspects.the map is incredibly boring.mm rocks and trees. rocks and trees. oh look at that what is it? A BIGGER ROCK.we've also go little to no variety. you go from rock to pistol to shotgun or m16. oh and what's this? they all look the same to others.the zombies (or rather mutants) are ridiculous. even in kevlar they will take you down within 4 5 hits.which do I even need to mention how easy it is again to get end game equipment?(cough cough air drop package cough)in short it's just another game that feels like it got a name a quick build (COUGH dayzcopypaste COUGH) and then slapped with a price.admittingly i enjoyed the game for a while but it's just dull.I'll be WAY more willing to come back to it once It's finally finished and polished more.but hey who am I to stop you? right this is only my opinion but don't and whine when some prick runs up and bashes your skull in at night when you log off!happy gaming.TL DR no variety. quick ending community. buggy. large map which is easy to get lost in. no beginner's guide.an unfinished bucket of crap.",Rust

Well that's exactly what the Rust Devs believe...and have done just that in this game. They've given us all forced genders and races that we might not identify with...and have practically told us to "" off "" because it's suppose to be about ""survival"" blah blah blah...

Mainly because I don't want them forcing bigger and bigger things on players too.

If a certain player was to grief other players generally being a nuisance exploiting a game glitch trigger botting etc this is the territory of the ubiquitous ""report player"" ticket which invariably in some games lead to admin bans or the vaunted ""VAC ban"".TLDR Rust is what it is what it is and as a result of lack of character/avatar customisation I recommend the following two options 1) if you don't care/it doesn't bother you that a game chooses your character for you in game players ridiculing you over a player avatar you had no choice in making getting ganked within 5 minutes of joining a server and you enjoy the survival game genre then this game is for you.2) if character customisation is a lynch pin of keeping you immersed and enjoying a game then steer clear of this one.**To the Devs I implore you at least give the player community a modicum of avatar customisation allow us to choose male or female at the very least.",Rust
2017-05-14,0,0,3163,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game had amazing journey during it's early access. It was once rebuilt from nothing due to it became really problematic towards updating the game.In the current state (game just left early access today) this game feels super amazing looks beautiful and I get solid 150 200 fps with gtx 970 4gb and i7 3700k which feels super good. PVP is amazing even tho assault rifle is super powerful and practically impossible to kill with other weapons if the AK guys know what they're doing. Building the buildings works how it's supposed to and a lot has been experienced through the early access with numbers of bugs and weekly updates. (and all the experiments along with the updates)I hit 2700 hours in early access and enjoyed pretty much all of it. I'd suggest this game for everyone who likes to PVP and has time to commit in to the game as it's quite grind to get the weapons but after you get to that phase of the game it's super intense. As you get better in the game it's also faster getting the weapons and you get to that fun phase of the game. (even though lots of people enjoy the early game too and if you're good enough you can beat the ""gunmen"" with bows) Also I'd suggest everyone to gather a group before starting this game as it's much easier with a group.TL DRThis game has had it's up and downs. I've played it 2700 hours in early access and enjoyed most of it.

2014-03-04,0,0,228,False,Not Recommended,"**Update 7/13/2018**Its just turned into pure cancer. The new team system is the most Anti Rust thing Ive seen to date. The vast majority of servers are terrible. Forget solo play unless you want to spend 200+hrs just grinding to have a few good things to just maintain. Its literally no good for anything other than making clan related youtube vids or watching someone just troll people. Too bad it was so promising. And I had some of the best PvP battles in my life in the earlier days. RIP Rust youre now a dead meme.**Update 7/14/2016 at Bottom** Important to read!Waste of money. This game was ok at first and had potential but now (mostly on US servers) you just have a bunch of surburban white kids talking like gangsters who will just kill you on site (even on ""no PvP"" servers) when you first start off. Compare that to when I first tried it before purchasing it on Steam when there were actually people who wanted to be part of a multiplayer online survival game. **Windows 8.1** (rust.exe has stopped working) I get this error constantly on my Surface as well as my 8.1 desktop.**Windows 7** (rust.exe has encountered an error and must close) I can get a few minutes of gaming before this happens. I have not yet played a session wherre it did not crash. So a 100% crash rate is pretty bad for even an alpha. This laptop was brand new/out of the box 30 minutes before I fired up Rust. Every other of my 50+ Steam games work flawlessly including DayZ.For some reason this new generation of the unlaid think that ""thieving"" and ""banditry"" include just killing a new player at random. Dont bother trying to point out that that isnt the definition because they agree with the Merriam Webster definition (as one player quoted) that said that killing a new player with nothing didnt fit into the definition but then claim that the definition fits perfectly. Thanks Common Core!!Wish I could rate this lower than a 0. There are free to play games online that are actually worth your time arent buggy and you dont have to deal with the massive amounts of losers. Just remember when the exodus of idiots migrate one way its best to quietly go in another direction.0/10 (I wish I could donate my game to anyone who wanted it because I would gladly do so)3/29/14 I gave it another chance put nearly an additional 100+ hours on it and was about to give it a more favorable rating. However as I thought I finally found a server that is good it turns out (just like many otehrs) the admins harass you for no reason teleport other plaers into your base to kill you or jsut teleport into your base (they are invisible) and kill you for no reason. I almost feel like I should go to the developers offices and do $20 worth of damage to something since I know I cant get a refund for this piece of garbage.07/14/2016 Tried again. This game just gets worse and worse. So Im running a 5930k this time running at 4.4ghz. Ive tried two separate types of cards a 980Ti Kingpin and Corssfired 290x Lightnings running at 1200/1600. DX12 runs like pure crap. They should've jsut kept it on DX9. It actually looked much much better. And it ran fairly well way back when. Thyeve also added a stupid XP system. So now just foraging (which is a hard enough grind in the beginning) isnt enough. Now you earn xp (slowly) which you then spend to unlock items before you can even spend the resources to craft them. Why is it that way? Because they couldnt just let the game be good. They couldnt just let it run smooth. So they ""fixed"" it. Want to get to know the game and go into a ""No PVP"" server. Dont worry you'll be KoS'ed anyway. Have a problem with that? No worries. There are active Admins who then ban you just for lulz. Its a sad story the story of Rust will always start ""In the beginning it was a great idea with tons of potential..."" and the story will always end on a sad but accurate and well deserved note. Facepunch will be the next DICE. Just keep pumping out the crap. I wish I could get back my hundreds of hours in this game. All except one hour...We had an epic war with another group. We blew through almost all our ammo kevlar etc. Guns were all over the place from our dead bodies dropping them. We were fighting hard to keep what we had built. And you know in all that time (even to this day) Ive never ever KoS'ed anyone. It was a lot of fun. But that was the old Rust. Back when Devs would come into a server check out your base etc. I have uninstalled it. It was on my computer since its release. I had faith in the devs. What a mistake. It will never ever be reinstalled. Ive successfully talked two people into my friends list to not buy it. One I offered to buy him a different game to promise he would never get it. That convinced him. And I wont stop getting people to NOT buy this.",Rust

2016-08-10,0,0,6005,True,Recommended,I gotta a ton (almost 5000 hours) of time in this game! I run a small sever that I have learned to customize. I enjoy programming and customizing plugins for the game. Game Pros Clean menu ( servers can use plugins to add to the game HUD ) Players can host their own servers off their computers for free or pay to have it hosted on a shared/dedicated server Intricate base building system and 3rd party programs like Fortify to help design them Hunting/Gathering Day/Night Cycle Weather System Moddable ( soooo moddable ) Frequent updates ! Dev &amp Community blogs Procedural generated world Gives you a sense of paranoia Generated Biomes (Desert Snow Grass) Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in game and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.Game Cons Game tends to lag/rubber band if too many people are connected to the server Uses a lot of RAM KoS ( This really depends on the person and server but what do you expect?) VoIP needs work (Causes a second or two of lag after letting go of the VoIP key) Framerate/Crashing issues at times with certain updates on AMD cards Runs on the Unity engine (Making it not the best for optimization but the dev team has found lot of their way to optimize) Animals don't follow rules of physics!!

2016-11-23,0,0,45,True,Not Recommended,The game is really a great game and I really want to enjoy it but it's really hard to start. First off I had to figure out how to do a lot of things on my own or ask other people in the server which really sucked because RUST has the most toxic community I have seen. I always get good stuff and when I build a house not even 5 minutes later it's destroyed and raided. It's really hard for new players to play it's like you need a boost or something. If you're fine with spending hours resourcing and other stuff and have that turnout into nothing then buy it.,Rust

2015-07-27,0,0,944,True,Not Recommended,Laggy slow loading unoptimized piece of S**T.Rust is a survival game which would be in the top of it's league if it wasn't for inept devs creating a game that shouldn't require a PC even half as strong as what it does. Rust is ugly ugly as hell yet somehow while being this ugly it sucks up a RIDICULOUS amount of resources to run smoothly on decent graphics and even with a solid PC that runs it 'smoothly' there are still constant crashing. It's very sad to see so many good game idea's turn to absolute piles of s**t because of developer's that hardly know how to code let alone create a functioning game.TL DR Rust would be fun if not for s**t developer's who make an unstable and s**ty product.

2017-07-05,0,0,9,True,Not Recommended,"So I haven't played a whole ton of this game so far this I'll admit. I've run into issues with this game over the course of the eight ish hours that I've played although a lot of them are based around player interactions. My main issue with this game that offers ""skins"" that you can buy for certain armor pieces that allow for further customization doesn't allow you to customize/change your gender.Now of course this doesn't seem like an incredibly large issue but for a game that goes as far as to have you pay for skins to customize your appearance but then to not offer you at least the choice at the very beginning of playing of whether or not you want to be male or female is a dumb design choice. From what I've been able to look into the devs have no plans of changing this and their argument is that the previous build of the game(Where everyone was males) had half the population upset with having to play characters that were not the gender that they want. So their solution to this is to make it ""randomly generated"" with no way to change it. What about the ""half of the population"" that was upset about not playing females but now STILL can't do so because the random generation decided they were going to play a male character permanently?The game itself is alright. It's your standard survival game that banks on it's PvP and community to put together a good experience for the players in game. If PvP isn't your idea of a good game then move on from this game because at it's core that is it's most interesting aspect. If customization was made to at least allow randomized characters but with selected genders I honestly would say the game would be one I'd recommend if you were into PvP(Or if the game was on sale) but with the current state I honestly would say there's games out there with far better customization with better gameplay mechanics as well.",Rust

2017-01-09,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,I've had this game since early 2014. And it's only gotten worse over the years. The game is a unity asset flip walking simulator with no character customization game balance or game content. On top of that it performs like absolute Ark at 4k ultra I get 45 55 fps. In rust I get at max 22 fps. Now. Ark is much more visually impressive and much more detailed. It runs better than this piece of trash. By unity asset flip I mean that literally. Nearly every asset in the game can be found for free on the unity marketplace. The start screen is the unity quality box and they use the standard unity light maps from 2013 to handle the shadow's and lighting. They haven't even bothered to update what version of the engine. I know this because if you recompile the main map for rust in unity 2018 it runs roughly 10 times faster and gains ray tracing.Gameplay wise there is none. No level system no progression each item is a nightmare to make unless you have 20+ people. If you're looking for a survival simulator and don't mind a bit of scifi just go with ark.Ark has single player balanced weapons and armor a story mode and it doesn't require 20+ people to actually be successful in it. It also has some of the most stunning visuals that run rather decently. Overall I give rust a 5 / 10.0/10 for gameplay0/10 for balance 8/10 for visuals 5/10 for performance2/10 for controls1/10 for map design 10/10 for update consistency and long term development.I gave it 5 years to get its together and it never did.,Rust

2016-02-08,0,0,1192,True,Recommended,This game has a lot of potential depending on your interests and what you are looking to accomplish in game. If you are looking for a welcoming and supportive community that is eager to help you enjoy your game play experience you will need to spend some time looking for those people/servers because there are a lot of jerks out there that take pleasure in your suffering. If you find yourself on a server where the main advice to newbies is Git Gud run and never look back.With that said I have really enjoyed playing the game at varioius times and find that it still has the potential to be extremely addicting especially if you are gaming with friends. If you are looking to get started quickly so you can dive into the fun I strongly recommend modded servers that have an increased gather rate. If the cutthroat every man for himself PvP world is NOT your main focus and you want to spend more time on the gameplay you can find a PvE server that would be more to your liking. Hopefully the devs will incorporate both elements in the future so that PvPers and PvEers alike can enjoy the same servers but time will tell.One problem at the moment is the mechanic that allows enemy players to build a tower over your wall into a protected zone at will. This makes it extremely difficult for players to build securely and definitely skews the advantage in favor of those who are attacking.,Rust

I came upon my old review recently and felt it needed an update. From my long time experience on rust I feel my first review is still some what accurate. I feel as now rust is a harder game for newer people. It isn't impossible but is harder. The main issue with newer people getting into the game is getting destroyed by already geared up people that already have everything on that wipe. There needs to be a way for tier 3 and fresh spawns to be split up. I have heard countless stories of new players refunding or not playing rust again because they can't get a start. I also think the AK recoil should be easier to learn so newer people aren't at such a disadvantage when versing someone that has spent hours learning the recoil. Overall the game is still a great game. My advice for newer people buying the game is to play with a team. Possibly go on a battlefield aim train or aimbot server to get a feel for every weapon. Maybe watch some youtube videos to get started to get a sense of what you will be getting into. In my oppinion new players should'nt have to do this. I feel the game should be ""plug and play"" to get new people to stay on the game.",Rust

This game released two years ago has naked men as old as 60 chase down young boys abuse them and then murder them in the name of fun.Jason 11 years old of Belmont told us of his haunting experience on this controversial game ""I bought the game because I had heard from friends it was fun. I turned it on and the first thing I see is three naked men running towards me! They starting yelling swear words and calling me a 'twelvie' shoved their in my face and then beat me to death with a rock."" This experience has had a lasting impression on Jason ""I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in a sweat having dreamt being beat to death by old naked men.""We interviewed an older player who wanted to remain anonymous about his techniques on luring young boys. ""I build a house that is a trap and when a twelvie unknowingly comes across it he falls through the roof onto spikes. I then go inside abuse him and shoot him if he isn't already dead from the spikes."" Our repulsed interviewer then asked him ""Don't you know those are children you are abusing?"" He replied ""Who gives a f**k?"" and then laughed. Our interviewer was unable to continue the interview.",Rust

2014-01-24,1,2,70,True,Recommended,If DayZ and Minecraft were to have a baby it would be called Rust.My first day in rust I was just running around aimlessly until a I came across a few friendlies. We set up camp and built houses next to each other . We spent the next in game week making one massive base together with metal doors to protect us from the bandits. Everything was swell until we heard gunshots in the distance. We climbed on top of our house to see what was going on and saw a few bandits in the distance. We thought nothing of it and went back inside. About five minutes later we heard a massive explosion one of my team said that it sounded like a C4 explosion. We go downstairs and sewe that one of our doors has been blown off. Next thing we know 6 guys in kevlar come into our house holding m4's. We were outnumbered 3 to 6. One of my mates pulls out a shotgun and shoots one of them in the head and kills them about half a second later he is lying dead on the floor. One of the guys tells us to drop all our weapons on the ground as the other guys procede to looting all our hard earned goods. I dropped everything I had on me except for a P250 and some ammo. For about 20 minutes the two of us were being led by these raiders along a road when a guy with a bow starts shooting at them. He dies pretty much instantly but it gave us enough time to run. As gun shots whistle past my chest and head I begin to think this is it I'm done for. We keep running we see some mountains up ahead. We start weaving through the mountains and we eventually loose the bandits. We set up camp and call it home. Over the chat the bandits are yelling abuse at us and saying that they will hunt us down let us re spawn and hunt us down again. That was 5 hours of playing Rust I can't wait to see what happens next.TL DR An amazing game so much fun and it's only in early Alpha!,Rust

Hackers are the most frustrating part of the game by far but there are an increasing amount of servers that have great anti cheat (I recommend Rusty) after a while it does tend to get repetative but the rush of adrenaline you get during PVP and other situations makes it incredible and unlike any game I've played before.

2014-01-15,0,0,6,True,Recommended,After 30 minutes of failed attempts to join a server (Mac) i finally got on RUST last night. I'm am a console gamer mostly now so this was a little hard to get back into. Started off near a zombie that saw me first and took advantage of my ignorant struggle to find the sprint button. Never found it died. Respawn by a radiated town with supplies which I couldnt get to because I didnt know which key searched when prompted. Wandered off into the darkness. As my torch burned out I spotted another zombie running at me at full speed of course. Dead again. Respawn near a field and found a wood pile. Began cautiously chipping away at it with my rock. Looking around on every 3rd blow to make sure no one or thing was near. In time I made an axe with stone and wood and went on the hunt. Fell off a rock while trying to get a lay of the land and began to bleed. Found a player built building with a metal door. With no one around and no way to get in I forged on bleeding and hungry. No wildlife in site. Keep walking keep bleeding. Thus far I have met no one living. I think that if saw a person at this point I would be thrilled even if that person bashed my head in with a rock. Thats feeling of isolation you get from this game after just 30 minutes alone in the digital wilderness. Through the trees I see movement could it be a boar? The boar is the easiest to take down. As I clear the trees I lock eyes with massive bear. Respawn in a field. I'm convinced that this world wants me dead. Yet I want to retry. I want to survive.,Rust

Yes it may just seem like Minecraft with a really high quality texture pack but it is WAY more when you get a group of friends and go on raiding every place you see. Not only does Rust show great PvP interaction it also throws you quite challenging PvE interactions from being chased by a wolf to lighting up a whole horde of zombies.

2013-12-29,0,0,84,True,Not Recommended,I don't recommend it YET so let me elaborate why the game does NOT suck but at its current state of this review i can't help but think this game is horrible do to little kids playing just to be s (not that much of a problem in it self but it is not helping on the matter) having Ddos attacks every hour of the day only to ruin everything you have build. It has way too many flaws around its map system making alot of areas unattended creating way to crowded areas for 200 people to roam within. Come on even a game like the DayZ mod had around twice the play area for a fourth the amount of players. The game isn't full of glitching or errors (only for a few souls who apparently doesn't know how a PC works and s it when they bought it) BUT let's not forget that there are plusses amongst the chaos of this game it just shouldn't have been public yet. The game is great being able to gather build and protect! and eventually raid IF you are into being the of the internet domain. Don't get me wrong the game is ing amazing! BUT the game is broken at its current state due to constant Ddos attacks because Facepunch doesn't use a working host for their game rendering it useless due to way to many loopholes and entrances for hackers script kids and a holes to ruin the game. If you asked me about the game a week ago i would say what a wonderful and complete genius of man could have created this? only to eat my words and crumble beneath that statement...I will definetly like the game if Fapcrunch (see what i did there?) fix their game before every player goes AWOL...Please facepunch this is a crisis for you as a game developer which is impairing your fanbase due to flaws at your end.

2014-01-14,0,0,24,True,Recommended,this game managed to keep me occupied for quite a long time. it is a very good sandbox game or rather it has immense potential. right now the amount of things you can do is not that diverse. everyone seems to shoot you rather than try to be friends however when you make friends it's fantastic. it is an absolute grind though to get yourself off the ground because of the scarce resources and how easily you die,Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,104,True,Recommended,"Having a great time playing Rust. It seems so simple yet every minute you're on your toes. While it does have a ways to go from the alpha it's still a ton of fun. I'm looking forward to what comes next for this game. Just beware this game is not for the easily frustrated as ""kill on sight"" is a common way of life. You will die regularly before you even really get started. Running through the woods starving naked cold and hunted you just have to keep coming back till you get a foothold.",Rust
2014-01-15,0,0,40,True,Recommended,Rust is a fun game if you like hardcore survivor type games. You have to gather materials while managing your comfort/hunger and health. It is exciting thrilling and at times sparks emotion. The sun has just gone down and your trying to find your way back to your shelter pausing for a moment as you spin around squinting to see the mountains in the distance when you hear the sound of grass crunching and a moan.... A zombie is going to get you!The downside of Rust is so far experience hasn't been super awesome because of the amount of hackers in the game. Once the Rust Dev's figure out a way to keep the hackers away this will be a solid game.,Rust

2015-10-31,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I cant really explain it better than this Its just a bad gameWhile i'm not the biggest fan of survival games I know a good one when I see one and this just is bad.First of all Facepunch should have gone with another engine. Unity is made for phones and while my computer easily meets the recommended requirements I still got horrible frames. Not to mention a 20 minute loading time even with the graphics at lowest. Plus i'm not a fan of the character creation system. I (like many others) like to customize what my character looks like. The optimization is bad(in my opinion) and the game itself is bad. Never should a game in early access already be selling items. Finally(while I never experienced this due to not getting an fps past 5 frames) from what I can tell from reviews is that the community is horrid. Overall this game is doomed. This is very disappointing considering it was made from the same people as Garry's Mod. I cant think of a worse title that is in early access.,Rust

The experience will be severely hampered without friends and as it is alpha the servers are acting weird and there are occasional bugs.

2017-07-19,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME This is by far the worst survival game i have ever played by far. If you somehow manage to actually get away from the spawn sites that people love to spawn kill at it is almost impossible to actually gather any resources because everyone with guns has already taken all of it. This game is ridiculously stupid primarily because of the stupid people that play it. I played this game for an hour and have died 14 times. half of those times the people that were killing me left me laying there dying which is for about 60 seconds with no way to just respawn. This game is full of a bunch of 10 year olds that do nothing but talk crap on both the voice channel and the global text channel. My advice....don't waste your money on this crappy game. go buy ark or something with better quality.,Rust

Wait An hour and a half to join a vanilla server after 10mn time out.5. The game is only for good computers i have gtx 650 and i5 cpu and i run it on Potato settings and still 50 fps FPS drops For everyone i guss.6. if you dont have team its will be hard as for you Mostly you will quit this game after 1 week without a team.,Rust

In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Rust

2014-06-08,0,0,56,True,Not Recommended,When I initially bought the game I had a great time playing it but after a while I found myself doing the same thing over and over again. The game is quite repetative in its current state and soon becomes tiresome. From my point of view the aim of the game is to make a base that is indestructable and then go raid another persons house. In order for you to raid someones house (which is incredably fun) you need to make a load of c4 (which is not so fun) this recquires a LOAD of time. Raiding someone and taking all of their stuff is a load of fun but once you are raided and all your m4's kevlar and c4 are stolen you feel like giving up. This happened to me but I persevered and rebuilt after I rebuilt I was raided again. I rebuilt a second time and was raided again. I then went to a second server to escape the raider but found myself out of energy and interest to start again due to the amount of time and effort it required to do what I had done.In its current state I would not advise getting perhaps the developers will drastically change the need for pvp in the game to have fun and replace it with something else but until then I would advise buying.EDIT Played the new version of the game and my opinion has become even more negative. I decided to give it a second chance with my mates and the game has only become worse. In the older version it was relatively easy to build a basic house and find a weapon to defend yourself (might take one or two starts to happen). In the new version this is near impossible. I was playing on a server of 12 (that is including three of my mates) and I only ever once was able to build a chestplate and a pipe shotgun out of around 20 starts (about 5 hours) where I was then rushed by two players with stone spears. I was able to kill one but as I was reloading he stabbed me to death. My point is that due to the massive early game difficulty curve the game is not even fun in a Dark Souls fashion. You could say 'why not play on a server with no to few players?' well what would be the fun in that? I would be king of an empty server my guns only used to kill pigs. A good way to sum up this game is 1) Join an empty server and become bored because there is no fun2) Join a server with a few people die a few times from random encounters but eventually become well equipped enough to protect yourself. Join server next day and find that it is empty due to it not having any regulars.2.5) Players on server '2' were regulars. You join and continue where you left off (assuming you weren't raided). You continue to grind and finally reach top tier equipment. You go to raid someone and take them out. They rage quit because they lost hours spent on grinding. The cycle continues until the server is empty or you are raided and lose everything repeat step 2.3) Join a server with a large number of players. You die and die and die. Maybe you stumble upon some friendlies you somehow become friends. You work together. Or you somehow survive and build. Then step '2.5' happens (you raid everyone quits or you get raided and start over again).I know it sounds childish but I found no reward in this game sure I had fun at times but it all went south when I lost everything. If you're fine with that I still wouldn't recommend as the game is grindy as .,Rust

You're a naked man in the wilderness that builds a kevlar helmet out of cloth and guns out of chunks of metal. Supplies are dropped from planes but for some reason everyone is trying to kill each other in this radiated woodlands? I can understand if it's a survival wilderness game if they just got rid of the modern weaponry and clothing. Also the spawns for resources don't work very well. You spawn in to the server and within a certain radius resources spawn. You leave that area and nothing spawns except wood from trees. You you inevitably die of starvation unless you stay in one place or hope for a server reset.,Rust

2016-06-14,0,0,239,True,Recommended,"The devs say they have no story to let the player write their own story. But this is really what happend! Picture this the year is 2033 and the National Science and Preparedness Association (NSPA) wanted to see how humans would act if the world just suddenly reset itself. So they took all people they brought the civilians to a facility they described as paradise and it was for about 2 4 months. People started disappearing from the normal routines of the facility. The scientist were running tests on the people there. So eventually the scientist got all the civilians ready. So they sent them to the shores of an island. No knowlegde of their past and stripped of their clothing with nothing but a rock a torch and 2 bandages. The scientist had towns on the island covered in radiation and had undead in the towns. The scientist quickly realized the ""nakeds"" couldnt stand a chance amoung the undead they were to fast and strong. So they got rid of the undead and replaced them with radiated animals. The scientist were pleased with the animals challenging for the survivors but not impossible to kill. But the scientist also noticed the survivors were obsessed with killing each other for revenge or just to fend off there territory. The Dev I mean Scientist were not pleased they needed to rethink their plan. So they found a bigger island made bigger and better monuments (Nuclear Plant A Dome and Water Refinary). So they moved operations there they scraped the idea of radiation animals and just let nature take its course Man verses Man and Man verses Nature. Now the scientist expand the trials of the survivers weekly even recently adding females to the island. The Future of the survivers is in the scientists hands now as they overwatch the island expanding apon the research.And thats basically how the lore goes for this game Owl logging off!",Rust
2016-07-04,0,0,26,True,Not Recommended,I spent what I consider a decent amount of time playing this game. Used to be super stoked about the concept of it.Turns out its just not fun. People are super to each other more so than any other game I've ever played. People go out of their way to up your day. Sure people claim that its just people playing realisticaly concerning survival but I've personally seen this overstep this.I mean the only real end game is raiding which is why I'm not mad at the game because its honestly what you can expect when its designed like this. Its just not fun for me and it brings out a certain kind of sadism in others.I would not reccomend this game to anyone even for its sale price. I wish I had gotten Ark or Day Z these games are realistic and have a strong survival motivation but don't have as of people.,Rust

2015-09-27,0,0,625,True,Recommended,So so far i've only racked up a measly 11 hours of game time but I have experienced some of the best and worst things the game has to offer. Starting out fresh on a server can be difficult at first due to the other more advanced players and the occasional freshly spawned naked guy who smashes a rock over your head when your not looking hence it is a good idea to start on server with few players on it 30 50 players was my happy medium ) Once you get the hang of finding a good location to build your base and making it semi safe then you can enjoy the many things to do in Rust which include but are not limited to Building Hunting Crafting Killing players (if thats your thing) Raiding peoples bases and so on. Overall a really enoyable game if you have a bit of patience and dont mind the learning curve of being killed a few times in the beginning but alot less often as you progress.Thanks for Reading,Rust

2017-07-13,0,0,213,True,Not Recommended,Every sever I go on I try to farm for 5 minutes. Then I get gun downed by some guys with Ak's and uninstall. It's not bad luck It's the terriable community. I don't know how many times I have been killed by some cancer squeaker or some salty guy who is extremly cringy. Then on top of it I have amazing friends who watch me farm and also watch me die. They don't help just watch... I always try to get started or get somewhere but I always lose everything I worked on with zero chances of getting it back. The only people in this game that are succesful are the huge clans so if your just a small squad trying to have fun or farm. In short period of time you will be ran over by some rude guys with Ak's playing on a server for and unhealthy amount of time. Those servers even say noob friendly or wiped but it doesn't take that long for the same cycle too repeat its self all over again. I try to have good times and meet people but the rarity of finding somebody kind or trustworthy is usually trumped by either only finding toxic people and giving up or having one of your many 2x1 being raided and losing your friend. It's been stuck in early access for a very long time I have heard and the survival gerne get's boring after awhile when all you do is mine chop build and kill. Also occasionally raid if you ever get that good. I do have to say there are those moments were you do something amazing like take out a whole squad who's raiding you with crazy good loot and you fell stacked. But then it's all taken away from you 20 minutes later again like usual. Let me describ to you what a normal start in Rust usually is. Wake up Find spot for base Get stuff Get attacked by plebs Build a little Then get attacked by pipes before you can even get a door on. Try again but this time you tell yourself not to go outside or bring back the loot then as you start off brand new you never find your spot and get killed a couple times by spears rocks bow's pipes ak's semi's and bears... If you can find a good server good for you hopefully you can make it far.,Rust

2016-07-08,0,0,446,True,Recommended,Although it can be frustrating Rust is a very fun and addicting game. I believe everyone should give it a try you will be surprised by how it draws you in. The people that don't get extremely mad and frustrated from spending hours and hours of gathering and crafting to one second being murdered and starting all over again will enjoy it. As it is still being developed there are lots of changes. My only problem with this game is the people who literally play all day and all night. This gives them the ability to keep crafting gathering and raiding all while you're asleep or at work. To be really good you need no life which is why I am only mediocre but make friends and play together it makes it easier and more fun. Just pay $20 for it it's worth it.,Rust

2014-10-14,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Rust is an impressive game with many interesting features. Experimental needs some work but other than that the game is a golden ticket. I found myself searching radiation towns for the slightest amount of food such as chocolate or tuna. Sometimes I even found blueprints to something like a P250 or a storage crate. I understand why some people give it such hatred but still thats towards experimental. Remember it's called experimental for a reason. Garry even explained that we should trust him in his hours of work. I believe that rust has the potential to become the next hunger games survival. I hope you all realize that even though you get killed by more advanced players with more advance weapons such as assault rifles this game still has a lot of interesting gameplay. Finding an animal and crafting a gun feels like an accomplishment. When you do your first raid you feel like you can cope with the bad and good of the game.,Rust

2013-12-21,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,I would wait a lot longer before buying this game it feels empty in its alpha stages and the lack of singleplayer makes new players feel uneasy especially when they're easy targets for bandits and crafty other players. There are quite a few bugs and griefing is common and easy to get away with such as when a more experienced player locked me out of my hut using layers of metal barricade. Many parts of the game feel underdeveloped but that does by no means mean it cannot get better. My advice is to wait and see how the game develops as it crawls sluggishly out of the alpha. Who knows it might bloom wildly for all I know.,Rust

But if you want to play with your friends you usually go on modded servers but there arnt many people on modded servers on the official servers you cant teleport to your friends and its hard as hell to find them or you die before you even get anywhere close but theres much more people on official servers making it more fun and more suspencefull but it can be boring when theres nowone to raid or to nowone to kill when they try to raid you.,Rust

I have 100hours on record for a reason and I am more than happy to write a review about this game now.Pros Fun and Addicting (To an extent for me) Always something new to discover and explore (Because of the updates) Good community of somewhat nice players Good update system And many moreCons Stopped playing for a reason for me it got a little repetetive and boring at this point Still many game breaking bugs as of expected from an early access (Getting killed by a bear throught the floor) And a few others To do well you need people (Or friends if you have those)Overall I am recommending this game for those who are looking for some fun with friends to build ther best base and survive the nights and days of animal horror and player rampage.I'm giving Rust a 7/10 Good Comunity and a Great Survival GameI am only recommending this game for those who can work with people in a team/clan to survive for the longest time possible.,Rust

2014-06-09,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Yeah it's a little bit of a mess. Yeah they've scrapped the original build for something brand new which has temporarily dialed the feature set back.But you need to understand the commitment that the developers have for this game. I won't do it an injustice by trying to describe how impressive their passion is just watch any of the developer logs or updates and you'll understand.DayZ is a font of laziness and broken promises with /years/ of development time compared to the handful of months spent on Rust. Rust is not only already capable of matching the iconic zombie survival sim it is quickly surpassing it in every way.The best part? The devs don't seem to have any intention of slowing down. They are wholly transparent even down to their day to day workflow. The community is given constant attention. The product is displayed with humility with open and honest perspectives about the various struggles of its construction.I recommend this not because it is a polished and finished product or even because I feel there is $20 of game here right now. I'm stamping my seal of approval on this project because the team behind it seems to want it to succeed as much as I do. So long as they don't slack off or disappear like so many others I'll continue to support their efforts. That's what Early Access SHOULD be about.,Rust

2016-08-31,0,0,688,True,Recommended,Lets just start the off with rust is not a game for the weak. Rust is one of the best games that ive played to this date on steam. I love how every kill in the game is very rewarding because it provides you with resources that you would rather have to farm yourself but on the other hand you could be farming for a long time and just get killed in seconds. Another issue that you can run into playing this game is groups known as Zergs. What these are are Clans or groups containing of 4+ ganging up on one or two players. This leads to the zergs being able to surround the solo or duo players leading them to lose their gear unless they find away to kill the zerg group. Pvp in this game needs alot of work but its not bad. 1 on 1 fights come down to skill if you're using a bow or a cross bow. You have tp land 3 4 shots to down a naked and sometimes the fights last minutes or even seconds if you land a head shot but with guns this is where I feel like pvp isnt the best currently. Because of the XP system right now you have to be level 20+ to even craft low tier guns. This means that the clans can abuse XP share to level up fast and be able to craft guns that solo players will not be able to. This means that as a solo player if your base is being raided or you're farming you will have to fight of zergs with guns and armor with only a bow or crossbow. Another point where the game shines in the light is the building aspect. You can build anything that you put your mind to in this game. You can make exhilarating building that will look amazing but will also defend the raiders and make it hard for them to locate the TC and the loot. The last point I want to make is raiding. Today on 8/31/2016 raiding isnt the best. You have to offline raid most of the time to get the loot you want. If the the you're raiding is online then they can repair/defend the loot and even despawn the loot when they hear C4 or rockets going off. My only tip for Rust to make raiding easier is to make loot take a long time like 10 mins to depawnn. Over all I rate this game a 9.5/10 and its the only game I play other than overwatch. Would reccomend to anyone looking to play a PVE and PVP game. Just know it will take some hours of your life to start up on a server D!The two best servers I think to play Rustafied mediumRustopia Kamaros,Rust

2017-02-05,0,0,10,True,Recommended,So I got this game a little while ago. There is almost nothing to do in in. Building bases is broken the axe looks like a pistol when you shoot and walk it looks like you are just skipping around the ground. There are only about 4 guns in this game.

2016-04-19,0,0,993,True,Recommended,I know a lot of people get extremely frustrated in this game and write bad reviews so I'm here for those of you who might actually love Rust. First of all you can play on servers with very low populations that are noob friendly. You won't be killed or raided if you do this. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy the game. I recommend playing on a server that has 10 or less people during your main play time. Talk to people. Many of them are friendly. It's only on higher population servers where it is a free for all brawl. That can be a blast but you want to know the game before you try that. I also recommend watching beginner videos on youtube. You can't get raided if you hide your self and your items well enough. Especially on low pop servers. The maps are massive. You can hide. That is part of the fun. Stealth. Strategy. If you aren't sure about the 20 bucks go play the game Unturned for free and get good at it. Then if you want a way better version of that you can buy Rust. The strategies you learn in that game will help a ton. Hope this helps.,Rust
2015-03-21,0,0,143,True,Recommended,"COOL GAME BUT!Epic game I love the atmosphere of the game and how any mistake can end your life. I played Rust before in its original state on my friends computer but recently I brought a gaming PC myself and playing the new version of Rust currently called Experimental I had a lot of fun.The game is progressing quickly the devs are constantly working on the game and changing aspects that might not fit the game very well this can also be a problem but I will get to that later.The game spawns you in different locations of the map with nothing but a rock and a torch you are then free to run around like a headless chicken hitting everything and everyone OR using your time wisely to build tools and shelter and progress from there to survive.Survivors in Rust will find that it s better to survive together finding your friends can be quick if you are lucky or an absolute pain in the Do not trust players who don't have microphones it never ends well. Rust is very unique survival game no zombies just the player vs the environment and whole bunch of naked dudes swinging rocks or bandits going around ""practicing"" shooting._____________________________________________________________________BUT!!!Rust is an early access game so watch out what you purchase watch latest YouTube videos because the game changes very quickly features get fixed and broken fixed again or removed. this is a massive problem with Rust as much as Devs are caring for the game they change and remove features as they please meaning that in future the game might now be what it is now. For example my problem lays with removal of the Building Walls Removing option which allowed people to remove walls later on when they want to expand on their homes or fix errors they made by accident. the devs removed the features as they found that player raiding shelters (which is a normal part of Rust implemented by the community and Devs) would take down house when they get access to build in the area by authorising themselves to use the tool cupboard (an object which placed in a house forbids other players to BUILD on and around the building). I guess what Devs have not figure out that the raiders can build in the player's house and completely make it unusable by for example placing a staircase on the doors and upgrading it to stone this would make it near impossible to break through with standard tools near equivalent to the house being destroyed.Other problems include the performance issues the devs are fixing those problems and trying to make the game run smoother with every update but often lag comes from the number of players in servers and abandoned raided shelters (that are now not destroyed by raiders) even though those things such as destroyed abandoned houses in Rust give it its unique atmosphere it can be the game's curse.I have little performance issues when playing Rust other than a little lag every 20 or so seconds which makes FPS drop to 30. This is because I'm running Rust on NVidia GTX 980 oc Video card i7 4790K processor and 8 GB RAM. I have around 80 to 70 FPS when running around but in highly builder up areas it can drop.Overall the game is cool I'm enjoying it very much right now and I really hope the Devs will listen to the community as the new version of Rust progresses further. If you feel like trying Rust try finding cheaper Steam keys on websites such as and help out a charity at the same time.",Rust

2014-01-15,0,0,2,True,Recommended,Haven't had such a laugh playing a game since early DayZ (the mod). Dying in this game was so hilarious First I got eaten by a wolf cause went head on with my rock (bad idea) Second time I ate raw chicken and got poisend because I hadn't mastered the fine art of cooking. Third time fell of a rock couldn't run away from a wolf and got eaten. Fourth time attacked a bear with my hatchet which I thought was a pig (it was getting dark) got mauled and ran away but bled out and the last time I died I went mano a mano with a zombie (bad idea those f****rs are tough!) Though this type of game is also a lot about the pvp I've not encountered any people yet who wanted to kill me (except the guy who ran at me with his rock and I pulled out my hatchet and seeing that he ran away) but nice helpful people who explained me a lot of mechanics etc. I doubt I will keep meeting people with good intentions but we will see.

Now Rust is also a game that should be casualy played and not played twenty four seven there is not a whole lot of connent in this Alpha right now and that is because it is a Alpha so if you are looking for a game like DayZ but toned down this is your game. !,Rust

2014-10-06,0,0,73,True,Recommended,Ive played this game for quite some time now and rust has given me some of the funnest gaming expirences ive ever had. Now trust me getting started in this game is gonna be very fustrating. Especially if ur starting alone and on servers with lots of people. But once u find a group to be with and u become civilized (instead of a ravenge naked man killing people and animals with a rock to survive LOL). The game becomes quite interesting. Also look out for servers that dont have the anti cheat system if it doesnt dont go on those or ur gonna hate rust like all those haters out there. Anyways as u become civilized and ur 1x1 shelter becomes a house then a village then a full blown city. U become acustom to all the items in the game from a rock to automatic rifles. U start forging alliances with other groups or become enemies with others as u look out for any groups of people coming with c4s to take down ur village and take away everything u've ever worked for. Over all Rust is a extremely fun expirience in my opinion and i hope it will be for u as well.,Rust

I better run from this horde of the living dead!""I don't have enough hours on this game to critisize the ins and outs of it but can say that I found it extremely difficult to ""start out"" in Rust seen as you starve pretty quickly because you need a certain weapon to harvest meat from animals and to make this weapon (which I think is a spear) you must spend time gatherng resources.

2016-03-28,0,0,1240,True,Recommended,Joining a server very crucial to decide because that's what you'll be spending your 90 years playing on. If you like very slow paced progression VIA workbenches + components then this is surprisingly the game for you. If you decide to play solo forget it as the 20 clan korean and chinese groups that play constantly 24 hours a day switching 12 hour shifts will you. Beware if you build anywhere on the map that there will be no nodes because of these guys. That is if you decide to join any official server. Doesn't matter if the server is EU or NA or Oceanic they will break through the 400 ping barrier just to come and your day. These guys WILL have 24 ak's by the end of the first DAY of wipe. Now not all of this is necesarily true if you are a modded cuck then you'll just have to deal with m249's and m9 pistols with decently sized clans to shoot as fast as frost to you. Moral of the story is that if you like getting ed this game is great as to my standpoint I'm kind of in the middle of the Yes or No Reccommendation of this game.,Rust

2015-09-24,0,0,780,True,Not Recommended,This game is by far the best example of the worst community of players gathered in one place. Aside from the fact that everyone. EVERYONE! will kill you on sight and take everything u have and not blink an eye about it. The games programming for the game is flat out BROKEN! The majority of players experience In game freezes and massive lag whenever a bullet is fired even just 1. When the freezing stops and the game catches back up you dead and some guy is laughing at you. You could have shot him had the freezing not been a problem for you However for some reason it only happens 75% of the player base. So now your left with 75% of the player base that cant even have a gun fight and the other 25% with a perfectly working game just running around 24/7 killing the ones that are lagging. Ive played this game for a year. Loved it during legacy. I especially hate it now. New stuff is nice and all but the game has more problems than ever. Lastly the majority of servers you can join are owned by regular people like you and me They hae 1 job ban the hackers in the server. Half of them sit on their thumbs and tell you to deal with it. This game attracts and gathers the most selfish crude and disgustingly hateful people. If these are conditions that you like playing under then by all means enjoy.

This game is 100 percent not worth playing in it's current state. Wait for the overhaul."" I've come back and other than the impressive pe to the nis slider that would make Saints Row blush I am sad to say that I'm still displeased with RUST. Since the text above I am re reviewing Rust as of 7/3/17. Since I have last replayed it I am forced to forever be a black woman and thusly and killed for miles away from hit scan weapons for some ironic racism meme. Hackers are the only way I can get fire arms (often dissing the game as they exxplain why they are giving them to you) as just as you get enough of anything for the game to be ""interesting"" (aka not holding down a button hitting a rock or tree) you are shot. With no gear you'll be shot miles away too and I am one of the players to see it as me not doing a good enoigh job surviving or being out played. But after a while I realized this is not the case. It's a lot like the current state of America and no not in the ""ha ha people are way"". I mean it's like the 1% VS the 99% economically. The 1% aka those who joined the server early when barely anyone was on it (not saying these guys have played for years on one server) and build a base in peace (because no one else is on) and then horde weapons and gear for a raid that will never happen which leads to them ""getting bored"" (what they define as bored) in the process and thusly with nothing to do shoot the 99% with said gear and weapons that after an update fire like a weapon from MW2 and with 3 times the range. Rust is badly designed and deliberatley wastes your time and as an Early Access game has no purpose. Garry has said he doesn't have any idea what it would make Rust finished as there is no end goal.http //steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id 944256949",Rust

2014-01-28,0,0,10,True,Recommended,For an alpha this game is very playable indeed. There are issues that need to be addressed and I am sure they will be evenutally. On my system which is no slouch the game gets very jerky when engaging in PVP combat this doesn't seem to happen against animals or zombies.I think the PVE aspect of the game needs to be ramped up. The first hour is the hardest hour in the entire game trying to find and kill a boar with a rock before you get too hungry having to light a fire to stay warm. Then onto crafting a hatchet some clothes and eventually a gun.Unfortunately this is where the challenge ends you can kill wolves easily with a hatchet by this time you'll have more food than you ever need you never get cold because you are wearing clothes and as soon as you have even the most basic pistol with some ammo then the zombies are no longer a challenge.Something needs to be done to make surviving harder I think. The only danger of death after this first hour is through PVP. I have no idea what PVE players do for fun once they reach this stage because the chance of death is precisely 0.Having said that I can fully recommend this game. I just hope the devs take it in the right direction. It's worth 15 quid of anyones money even if it does get a little boring once you have built your house.,Rust

2017-01-17,0,0,466,True,Recommended,"On June 12 2016 Omar Mateen a 29 year old security guard killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a terrorist attack/hate crime inside Pulse a gay nightclub in Orlando Florida United States. He was shot and killed by Orlando Police Department (OPD) officers after a three hour standoff. Pulse was hosting Latin Night and most of the victims were Latino. It was both the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter and the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in United States history. It was also the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since the September 11 attacks in 2001.In a 9 1 1 call shortly after the shooting began Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and said the shooting was ""triggered"" by the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month. He later told a negotiator he was ""out here right now"" because of the American led interventions in Iraq and in Syria and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop bombing.Initial reports said Mateen may have been a patron of the nightclub and used gay dating websites and apps but Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials said they have not found any credible evidence to substantiate these claims. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also conducted an investigation and said it found no links between ISIL and Mateen.",Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,69,True,Not Recommended,Rust is a game of running about with rocks and attempting to find loot that deep down you know you will never get most of the time the best loot is found in air drops and there secured by gangs who already have guns the gangs then get swarmed by rock holding fresh spawns and 5 year olds who dont really know whats going on really the best thing you can do is stay out of sight build a small shack however to do this you must first bash a tree for many long hours and then sit in your hut hoping you dont killed all while you craft boxes to hold your loot you dont have and will never get adding to this great loot can also be found in construction sights but for some reason these are flooded with radiation so you can go insdie and find lots of nice things and if you do make out alive you will die shortly after from either radiation sickness or just more 5 year olds running about with rocks its safe to say everyone kills everyone else unless that is if your part of a group who runs around killing everyone else i would recommend buying this game as its so funny becouse its so bad and also great luck making a base without it flooding with fresh spawns bashing rocks everyewhere,Rust

2014-06-03,10,16,28,True,Recommended,Rust is a naturally occurring phenomenon when certain metals are exposed to oxygen and water for a length of time. The actual chemical make up of rust is 4Fe + 3O2 2Fe2O3. The only metals that rust are steel and iron. Other metals may become corroded but they do not rust. It is an actual chemical change which takes place when metal starts to rust.Everything around us is made up of different chemicals. These chemicals are made up of atoms. The atoms can join together to create new chemicals. The atoms can also join and make up chemical compounds. Rust is a chemical compound. The iron atoms fuse together with the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The formula for water is H2O. Adding the water creates a chemical reaction. The result can be seen as rust.Left in a totally dry environment iron or steel will not rust. It is when moisture is added that the oxidation process starts to occur. Because the air we breathe has moisture in it oxidation will occur even if there is no water added to the metal. There is enough hydrogen and oxygen in the air to allow the atoms to bond with the iron. This creates the chemical reaction known as oxidation or rust.There are things you can do to prevent rust from forming on your metal surfaces. The first is to keep things like tools in a dry area. Rust may form even if the tools are stored in a tool box. However the process is much slower because the exposure to the moisture in the air is decreased. If you are in a humid area you may consider investing in a dehumidifier. This machine also decreases the moisture in the air reducing your chances of rust forming. Things which are normally stored outside like bicycles and lawn mowers can be covered or moved indoors.There are products which will allow you to keep moisture from ruining your tools and other things. Silica gel packs help to dry out the air in small places like drawers or tool boxes. Keeping a couple of these packs in your tool chest will ensure your tools are not susceptible to rust. Also when items which are made of iron or steel become wet dry them off as soon as possible. This keeps the oxidation process to a minimum. You can prevent rust in this manner.,Rust

2015-02-16,2,1,645,True,Recommended,Rust is a great sandbox survival game with fun concepts and large open maps. As of right now features are arguably limited if you are not willing to PvP but even that is fun and exciting. Just making a house with your friends is fun on your own. Every step of furthering your survival seem like an accomplishment. It can be quite fun to compete for an airdrop by killing others who flock to it. People come from around the map to meet at the one airdrop which can oddly sometimes be a great way to orient yourself. I see myself continuing to play even after I have done everything I can do.My largest criticism is the way to find servers. There are the large official servers with many players but I enjoy myself more on community servers. I have found that it is near impossible to find a server again if you got on it from a friend. I can't see anywhere that extends the page to more servers and there is no search. The servers I have been on don't show up in my history and if I forget to favorite a server I will have to wait for a friend to get back on it.,Rust

2015-01-19,0,0,2044,True,Recommended,Here is in my opinion what an ideal Alpha game is. I've seen many negative reviews on this game simply stating that it's a disapointment that they weren't able to create a AAA title in a year of the game being released. The drop of Legacy Rust and switch to Experimental Rust was also a huge negative feature for many users. However where Rust shines is the speed of progress. First off although Legacy was abandoned by the Devs the current version is infact playable with plenty of end game content and mods if you're bored with vanilla definitely worth the $20 alone in my opinion. Secondly there is the experimental version. Although this version was created from scratch very reently it is currently playable with plenty to do. Of course there is also plenty of bugs but those are being fixed as quickly as possible. Although it is lacking in content for it to be a full game the speed to which content is being released is surprinsingly quick with both Radtowns and Blueprints being released in the last update (although both being really buggy).Overall I would recommend this game but only for those with the mentality that they are buying in a sense an investment. The game is not finished not even close to being finished. Yet this game is one of the few that appears to be made for fun with the need of money not the driving force in the creation of the game. And with that in mind the investment of $20 in this game is definitely worth it.,Rust

Basically you do the same repetitive task again &amp over again. This game is all about scavenging ressources for a base you will lose realy fast because of nolifers who play more than you or by zerg clan with 10 people. The only fun moments in that game is when you're roaming and have intense pvp moments but it only represents 2% of that game. Rest of the game is totally annoying and boring as . You want to get good gear ? Smash &amp farm barrels/cratebox. You want to solidify your base ? Smash rocks during 3 hours. You want to get C4 &amp raid people ? Smash rocks during 10 hours.Its probably the most overrated Steam game actualy. People who play it are stucked in an addictive loop and cant recognize the time they lose playing that awful game.

2015-07-23,0,0,523,True,Not Recommended,"One of the worst games and concepts ever developed. This game focuses primarily on wasting your real life time performing tasks in game that you could perform faster in real life. Once you've wasted a sufficient amount of time you will start being killed by other players for no apparent reason and with no given explanation even if you do not actually possess any materials or have completed any tasks. Whether this is the developers' implicit intentions or not it actually serves as a perfect equivalent for the Milgram experiment. The assailant rarely has a motive beyond ""b but I was supposed to do it because that's what I was told to do"". The procedurally generated landscapes are extremely poorly crafted with thousands of collision errors every square meter extraordinarily lazy methods of clarifying territorial distinction and numerous other nigh terminal extremely blatant flaws. The fauna that inhabit the procedurally generated landscapes possess essentially deific powers to defy the game's internal physics systems and the temporal nature of reality as it stands often bounding hundreds of meters up a mountain in a single step or moving backwards whilst their models' actions imply they are moving forward.The central aim of the game appears to be to gain power by ruining other players' experiences in the game. Anyone who legitimately takes a vested interest in playing this game is most likely sociopathic and would be much better off working in a biological studies lab tricking rats into traps to ascertain data on behavioral traits or working as an abusive (yet not reprimanded) low security prison officer (with of course an ulterior motive of being able to feel superior to their victim in both scenarios).",Rust

2013-12-11,0,0,916,True,Recommended,Summary Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you. http //www.metacritic.com/game/pc/rust.,Rust

2018-01-07,1,5,848,True,Recommended,"The game itself is solid however the community is about as appealing as a Tuna sandwich that's been sitting in the hot sun for a month that's just been wizzed on by some dirty hobo. What the game is about The game has four main pillars. Survival looting player interaction and progression.All of these pillars vary greatly so I'll talk about the one you'll be getting most of. Player interaction is something that can happen either three ways. Most commonly you'll be a naked with little to no loot and someone will blow your brains out with a bow crossbow or some sort of gun. Once you learn PvP a little you might be able to fight back but chances are you'll scrap the idea of talking entirely and feed into the cancer. Second most common is that some other naked is going to run up and bash and/or stab you. Most likely for your animal fat. Third most common occurence is you DON'T get shot smacked over the head or stabbed and someone says hello or maybe even wants to team.So with that out of the way I'll be analyzing each tier of player interaction.Being shot as a naked is all too common. Hence why I said ""Most common"" and ""The community is as appealing as a month old tuna sandwich."" that's besides the point. If you want to survive your best bet is to stick to hills and toward the shore as a fresh spawn and beat up the rocks and trees for resources. Chances are you will be shot while walking around or be shot because a group of kids decided to sit outside of your freshly made wood base with a key lock door. It's frustrating. Sometimes you'll decide it's best to take a two day break. But you'll most likely come back for the solid mechanics or because you might as well make the most out of the game you can't refund anymore.2 The survival. You sure as hell won't be doing a lot of this. Not even high skilled players go for more than a few days (IRL) without getting their brains blown out. Food and water isn't the problem as you can drink from any river so long as you're actually able to find that sweet spot that the game decides is the ONLY place in the river you can drink from for about 20 meters. If your health is low you can abuse this to full health if you spam E quick enough. Animals are only a threat so long as you don't have a ranged weapon particularly the pigs and bears as deer chickens and horses either run away after getting one swipe or go down in one or two hits. 3 Looting/Farming. This can be anywhere from finding rocks to looting barrels and military crates at rad towns. I'll start with farming and attempt to make a mini guide to help the newbies. Most people understand the concept of hitting wooden objects such as drift wood trees and fallen trees for wood with their rock to get more wood. Not many people understand that unlike trees there are a finite amount of stone/sulfur/metal that can spawn in an area and that the giant cliffs cannot be hit for stone. You have to hit three little circular boulders that all have the same shape but are different color for those. Stone is the bright grey ""node"" or boulder The bright colored orange and red node is metal. When you break them you get metal ore. and when you finish them off high quality metal ore which won't be useful until the late game stages. The grey stone with yellow stripes is sulfur this is also not as useful compared to stone and metal at low levels with stone taking ab solute presidence.Then there's the barrel/crate looting. Barrels are simple you hit them and you get 1 scrap metal along with a variety of items such as shop fronts for stores if you want to own one blueprints for basic and generally decorative items spinning wheels for little games you can crate by painting the wheel. And some other items that range from useful to decorative. What you do with the items you do not want such as sewing kits spare gears and metal blades spare springs you take these into a rad town useually a low radiation rad town such as water treatment. The looting system at early stages is nice. You take a small risk getting things to take into a high risk area. It's actually quite entertaining but demoralizing if you end up dying with the 100+ scrap you lost. For higher tier looting there are monuments such as The Dome and Launch Site. The Dome has zero radiation but has military crates. which are where most people get their first guns during a wipe if they haven't researched them already. It is a HiGH PvP zone building near it is not advised nor is going there without at least a pipe revolver. Progression was directly fed into by Looting and player interacion.Other players can easily hinder or even completely halt your progression possibly even resetting if they're lucky enough.(Or if they have the raiding supplies). Looting is also luck based as RNG decides what you'll get where you get it and how much you get. There is also a slight cheating issue. I personally have only had two encounters w ith one guy wiping out an entire two squads of five in 6 seconds with an M459 and getting banned by the games anti cheat minutes later.The second was an encounter where some guy went through two locked keypads and many turrets without setting any turrets off or putting in any of the codes and taking over my base. He had done it to other people in the area. The cheating problem isn't rampant but it is something to take into considerationOverall I do enjoy this game. The game is fun with friends and punishing but gives you a chance even if that chance is small as with a group of 3 with AK's shooting at a man with nothing but a wooden bow. I would give this game about a 7/10 doesn't give enough incentive to NOT shoot everyone you see.",Rust

Horses and other animals teleport out of existence or fly up straight vertical walls to survive. Impressive but... 0/10 Would kill self again.2. Spears magically disappear and don't hit the animal or enemy so if you somehow manage to catch it (for shame you flying wizard / hacker) it don't matter one thang gurl. ( out of D.3. Every person on this game wants to kill you or take advantage of you. But if you are a strong independant woman (which at the moment you can't be) who don't need no man this shouldnt phase you. Dat comunity dou. &gt (4. A surprising amount of floats high in the air. Anything from trees to bear traps to animals can be spotted in the sky soaring far from reach. Not a big deal but it does ruin the vibe and is very ugly.5. Animals are IMPOSSIBLE to find probably due to too many people killing too many animals (up the spawn rate maybe?). If this was a simulator of today's declining fish population situation then 10/10 m8.6. This may just be a personal peeve but the ratios for crafting stuff is WAY off. 300 wood to make a spear (is literally a long sharp stick in game) 200 wood and 50 cloth for a bow (the bow you make from 200 wood and 50 cloth is a long stick with a string on it mind you). Like how hard would it be to dial it down a bit honestly. I just find it stupid and it really bugs me.Basically lots of bugs many of which are large enough to lower enjoyment of the game (And YES I understand it's an early access and blah blah but still). Not to mention the tiring repetitive cycle of man spawns in man dies several times due to man or elements (mostly other players) and then MAYBE gets to enjoy his creations for a little before being ""raided"" as the cool kids say and having to start over again. The cold and vicious cycle of Rust ladies and gentlemen.NOW FOR THE POSITIVE 1. Blurred out dong everywhere. Yum.2. Dem graephics dou.3. Trolls everywhere (Might be a negative for some) and lots of lulz to be had.4. It's not finished and while it does have lots of both good and bad the bad can still be corrected. Here's hoping.Overall I'd say Justin 'Rust' Trudeau is just not ready (hence the early access label).

2015-08-26,0,0,888,True,Not Recommended,A good game. However the developers have been rather slow to improve the game and when updates have been released they are poorly optimised resulting in frequent lag spikes. Another pathetic problem is that some official servers like London 2 Facepunch can often crash and not come back online.... Which can be infuriating... I have over 381hours so I am rather experienced in the game and I do truly love the game play however refinement is desperately required and more work needs to be put into the game. I would personally conclude though this is my own opinion that Rust is not ready to be played (if your argument is that it is an alpha its been an alpha for nearly 2 3years so please reconsider any justification for the lack of game developement) and thus I do not recommend playing Rust at this moment in time.

FPS issues (granted playing on a 4k 72 inch display might be taxing but still with a 2 way SLI it should be managable....). The people just aren't nice I go around get murdered and repeat. Its unplayable until the infamous ""wipe day"" at which point you CAN eventually get a base going. After you do this though what is there to do aside from getting more loot... and shooting naked people wooo.... best game! Look at me! I can WASTE these nakeds with my m249! I got extremely bored after a while. I raided a clan base sure that was good... but... I didn't have anything to do other than shoot the naked people or go after another clan.It is one of these games that will be in ""EARLY ACCESS"" perpetually so that the developers have an excuse when it crashes or the anti cheat doesn't function as well as it should. All of this is why RUST recieves a 5.2/10 from me. I wouldn't recommend it unless its on sale for 5 7$",Rust
2016-09-05,2,3,348,True,Recommended,Do you have anger management issues? Do you often feel you are being treated unfairly? If so I recommend Rust. You'll have a chance for growth to achieve a stoic zen like state where you are able to endure any frustration or setback any video game can throw at you. On the other hand there's also a good possibility you'll achieve a total meltdown and a ride to a mental asylum where you are given a 2x2 room of your own with padded walls floor and ceiling. But hey at least it's unraidable.For an Early Access game I think this one is surpringly mature and playable with quite interesting gathering hunting crafting and building mechanics and character progression. It's the so called community that makes the game unbearable for many. I say so called community because outside co operating groups a.k.a. clans there really is very little community. Well that's not entirely fair as there are always players that will help you in in game chat if you have questions about anything related to the game.However there is next to no community to be found in a sense that you would be likely to run into friendly neighbours and start working together. 90% of the time you'll be shot or swinged at on sight. Even of those 10% presenting themselves as friendly 90% will eventually stab you in the back. People will not hesitate to shoot you dead with their firearms when all you have is your bare a rock and a torch. Just because they can. For some reason this game seems to bring out the worst out of people and make most of them turn into virtual bullies always ready to prey on the weaker. Then there are the clans I mentioned earlier that can be even 50+ players strong. In fact lone players and small groups are such underdogs to them no matter what they do that I wouldn't be surprised to see this game go somewhere in a direction of certain number of tribes on a server amongst which the players joining would be distributed evenly.However if you're able to keep in mind it's only a game there's still plenty of fun to be had. Just remember anything you manage to gather craft or build is only temporarily yours. It will be raided and pillaged it's just a matter of when. As a game Rust is good if not excellent especially given it's Early Access state. As an MP experience depends on not only your server choice but also a lot on your own ability to tolerate losing everything over and over again with you being able to do little or nothing about it.,Rust

Even with both Anti cheats systems in place lots of people still hack in this game which makes the game unplayable and unenjoyable.A typical run in Rust begins with you running for 2 minutes then being head shotted or instantly killed by a fellow player. This is what happens 90% per cent of the time to players who don't hack while the cheats can do as they please because they are armed to the teeth. The community in this game is a joke (more like a community of trolls and angry children) which most people just kill you for the hell of it. There is no team work or friendly people to build alliances with in this game and it in the end becomes a battle between you and the hackers/ hacker groups which you don't stand a chance.

2018-06-21,1,4,34,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. 509.8 hrs on recordPOSTED 26 MAYSo I've owned rust for maybe 3 years played on and off and for the most part enjoyed it.Don't get me wrong rust in itself is a good game. The BP systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need but it works. Harvesting building a base exploring and having the occasional firefight is also fun (talking about when i started 3 years ago)The game looks good runs well and have very frequent updates 3 years on. The one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far the worst community i've had the misfortune of experiencing ALTHOUGH I have met a handful of decent players.When I started out 3 years ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable.You used to be able to mill about collect reasources build a base and get going without too much of an issue. The people you would come across would more often than not be friendly and leave you to your own devices. Of coure you would get the occasional hostile but it generally wasn't that bad.Unfortunately now it is a much different story. 99/100 people will kill you on sight even if it is within seconds of respawning... they will also often flame you out over the mic. I've heard every insult racial slur and homophobic insult many times every play session.The trend at the moment is to greet you tell you about how they are friendly wait for you to let your guard down and then kill you. Many players will scream about being friendly and then kill you straight after. For the record I am one of the few friendly players in the game but it gets very wearing after a while when everyone just wants to pretend to be friendly kill you and then insult you over the mic.Yes I expect to get killed raided etc in rust but dont expect it every 2 minutes. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how new players will even begin to get to grips with rust you simple do not have enough time from spawning to learn. I've seen quite a few get completely disheartened and quite on their first server.Rust is not a ""pure pvp csgo cod shooter"" yet so many players seem to treat it like it is.I like to play games to have fun and rust was... once upon a time. Just not anymore. There is no penalty for running around and being an anti social toxic idiot. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around insulting trolling and greifing as much as you like along with forgetting how to interact with another humans in a normal way and nothing will ever happen. Rack up millions of kos kills nothing happens.Just because I play a game like rust doesn't mean I have lose all sense of decency when I interact with people. Yet 99% of players do and it is incredibly sad.There is a reason the community on rust is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as rust is a good game...without 99% of the other players.People who read this review can tell me to 'get gud' as much as the like or whatever insults you have stored up your sleeves but at the end of the day there comes a point where the toxicity becomes too much and it's just not fun... Welcome to Rust.It's a shame I cannot recommend rust as it is up there with being one of my favourites. The community has just sucked out the last bit of fun for me.Edit Im not against the idea of rust (included raiding fighting etc etc etc). Im solely talking about the players and how they interact with you. It's really killing the game.",Rust

If you like that sort of thing buy this game but let me warn you for the alpha build i'm currently the game is optimized very poorly so it runs like You might find yourself having 10fps at all times so if you PC isn't very good wait.

Start's to starve try's to kill deer deer run's encounter wolf during night die's. Next day i meet a naked dude he helps me we forage for supplies and we survive.We hunt chop smash and bash.We build a house gather an abundance of resources and make weapons.Next night dead. Survivours raid our house in our sleep and kill us.Respawn and repeat process.But with a twist. I have learnt i have mastered and i am ready now i survive day and night and kill the wrecthed dieseased naked men that come after me i have made gun's and clothes. I WILL SURVIVE! All in all this game is fanatstic at first it takes around 15 30 minutes to gather enough supplies to build a safe house and weapons. The worlds are huge and vast very dynamic and the widelife is awesome aswell. I bought rust on the 8th/12/14 and now its the ninth and i have nearly a day of gameplay because it is amazing you will forge alliances kill and raid enemy survivors or just chill on your own you can do anything.Rust has amazing graphics and runs smoothy it offers a good choice of graphic selections for all pc's and doesn't leave you bored. 9.3/10,Rust

2014-01-17,0,0,191,True,Recommended,Once I started playing this game I didn't want to stop. It is amazing.So you are placed in a world with just a rock a torch and a few bandages.Your aim is to survive but to do so you must gather wood craft build a house and be careful of who you trust.You can raid peoples houses or just attack them on sight. You can be hidden in the mountains or be out in the open field.Whatever you do and how you survive is up to you. This game may take a while to get used to but it depends on how fast you learn. You want to know and understand the map as soon as you can to avoid getting lost. Trust me... getting lost is horrible.Yes this game has had its bad moments such as the server DDosers but this game is great and the developers have done a great job with this game. I am very excited for how much better this game will get.So I highly recommend playing this game.,Rust

2017-05-20,0,0,1641,True,Not Recommended,I have owned this game for 6 months now and have wasted weeks on end playing it but really it isn't worth it. Anything and everthing you do in this game is going to be erased but that isn't what is wrong with this game. The problem with this game is cheaters they cheat and it makes no sense cause there is nothing to gain from it. Most people have never even heard of rust let alone give a if your good at it. This game could be alot of fun but being the way it is just makes it a ing troll fest which I guess can be fun to fight off harassing noobs till they have nothing left but like I said the problem is cheaters. So you start off you get a good start finding everything you need to make a base and get started well thats good I hope that was fun because the rest of the game 70% of the time when you come across someone they are going to instantly kill you before you can even react. So man people toggle aim hacks in this game it's ridiculous. The game isn't easy and on a level playing field it's a good game but there is no way of stopping the rampit hackers. You have to spend hours farming mats and making gear just to lose it before you get a shot off. There is just no point it literally takes hours to get gear and you lose it in .5 seconds it's the most unrewarding thing ever made. It would be one thing if you went out to fight and lost it but really that isnt what is going to happen. Your doing to get some basic gear and a gun and as soon as you hear someone outside your base you will slow and silently cheap over to one of your many windows and peak out of the corner of it just got enough to get instantly shot in the head 3 times and you only saw the person that shot you for less than a second if even that. I have played this game over 900 hours tons of time in weapons training I can shoot and pvp very well but none of that matters because there are hackers everywhere that will instantly kill you I'm not saying there is a gun fight and this dude just keeps hitting you I mean this dude sees you for a tenth of a second and he spins around and get 3 shots off in your face before you can even move or twitch or finger. It's so abnormally fast it cannot be a real person's reaction time and accounting for recoil within a second. Only mahcines can do like that so I don't reconmend buying this game it will do nothing to waste your time and make you upset. There is literally a company that makes hacks for this game you pay and then you win. It's just grossly unfair.,Rust
2017-11-17,0,0,29,True,Not Recommended,Game was alright and fun if you find the right server or play with friends but then THEY decide your gender for you in the game. Stats are not different so I was not mad about that however I do not enjoy playing games as a female simply because I am not female. This may or may not bother you and if it does not bother you then sure play the game its fun! Just know if you do not play games as a female and do not plan to your account will more than likely be selected to be a female and no you cant change. EVER.,Rust

2016-04-10,2,2,56,True,Not Recommended,"I don't write reviews mostly as I feel I can never get my point or feeling across properly that and I'm too lazy. However I felt the need to write one for Rust which I must say is quite the accomplishment. If I could justify recomending it for getting me off my proverbial rear end I would. Sadly though this is not the case. I will start off by saying I know I don't have much in the way of shown hours logged blame me for doing things like downloading patches to client based steam and non steam games when I do play rust. I bought rust back in 2013 I think might have been '14 little fuzzy on that detail. I enjoyed the game quite a bit minus offline... I wouldn't call them raids more like vandalism. When it came time for the game to be split into legacy and whatever we call the current build I was happy for some of the changes coming. Frankly I was tired of staring at and running about the same map. I welcomed most of the changes that happened after that one though most of all I despised. That was when I found our character appearence would be locked to our steam id's. I didn't complain at all about it as I figured later on we would get to create our characters eventually. Over time that hope was well frankly stomped on and finally buried with this latest update. I know Garry runs this game like a little social expieriment seeing what happens when you tweak certain elements. I was okay with that for a while as long as it seemed like it was going to continue to be a game. After all I paid for a game something to enjoy maybe have a bit of an escape from reality. If I'm going to be participating in an expierment I expect to be compensated for it not to pay into it. No I'm not saying pay me jsut simply I'm not going to thro money at someone's research that I really have no interest it especially when I'm one fo the ""labrats"". I feel as though I can get into a game more if I make the character I want or if the character has a fairly fleshed out story if I am going to be playing a preditermined character. Rust however takes that away I am who my steamID makes me. I don't get to choose who or what I am I am simply thrown into random PC body #4 376 890. I can not connect with that character I feel unmotived to play him it just all around saps my enjoyment from the game when I can't play whom I want to. I simply can not play Rust anymore. As an addtion the responses to requests to add character creation gender change or something along those lines by Garry had led me to a conclusion... He's a prat.",Rust

Once you finally get in the game your game will lag freeze and stutter every five steps unless you stand still for a good ten minutes and let everything around you load in then you're good for about 100 feet.

2017-01-18,0,0,14,True,Not Recommended,"Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring.Unbalanced.In alpha forever.Playing alone is a really experience. Only ""fun"" to play on populated servers where you get endlessly killed as new spawn by clans that dominate servers. PvP is pointless. There's nothing of particular value for you to get when raiding especially when you reach a point when you're able to raid. Almost everytime you'd be wasting more than you'd get from raiding a base and even if you did get something good or destroy a well established clan in a server it all gets wiped anyway so nothing is really gained. I know this is somewhat good and bad at the same time as wipes are needed to keep the game from feeling a bit one sided but doing that also nullifies the point of playing the game for veteran players. Resource farming. ResidentSleeper.There's no PvE in the game. It's falsely advertised as a survival game but the survival part of it is easy af. The only reason to play at all is for PvP unless you want to kill bears and endlessly farm for guns you never need to use. The only 3 things in the game that can kill you besides other players are animals helicopters and AFK level stupidity. In order to die from the first two you have to be pretty dumb too as they're both incredibly easyBuggy as all hellAnimals clip through walls.Toxic KOS PvP community. Guns cost too much and endgame is reached in as little as 2 hours and is nothing but a resource grind because the PvP is crap in a PvP oriented game. Crap game. It's super boring and it's one of those games that's never coming out of alpha and what baffles me probably the most is...

2018-12-08,0,0,327,False,Not Recommended,Got pulled into this game by a friend who really LOVES it. Me not so much. This is a PvP platform if you like PvP then you may like this game. If you don't the appeal is limited.First off for my modest system the load time is EPIC. Really 10 or more minutes. When you finally get in it is hard to see what took so long the graphics are not particularly awe inspiring. Also the game has at tendency to crash my system which of course requires a reboot and reload. Since the latest update the game is also prone to drops. As far as a PvE survival expiereince it is ok. Even more so than most survival games Rust tries hard to kill you early but once you get that phase it is pretty easy. The environmental puzzles and NPC encounters are fairly thin the most difficult challenge being finishing them before the NPC's start to respawn. None of this is surprising since the environment and NPC are just window dressing for the PvP action the game is designed around.So one of the few PvP encounters I have had in the game went like this My friend and I started a raid against a solo they knew my friend and knew it was coming and were cool with it. We start up and the solo has recruited a friend so it's now 2v2 which is cool. This new player is REAL good so things go bad quick. I get killed respawn at a bag that is nearby get the 'press any key to move' message but as often happens in this game this does not work. (Fyi the simple work around i know now is to esc to the main menu and go back in.) While i am trying to figure out how to actually get up so i can get knocked down again I get killed again. Respawning across the map i have just long enough to notice how far i would have to go to get back to the fight and my system crashes efectively taking me out of the fight. Even if i were into PvP i doubt i would have enjoyed that.So the upshot If you like PvP and have a decent system you may well like this game. If you don't or have a mid range system you might do better looking at something else.,Rust

I have come to believe that the rise of ""Alpha release gaming"" has become nothing more than a way for low rent developers to bleed the community dry on on promises that never materialize.Rust is just such a game. It doesn't know what it wants to be and so the entire community is left in the loop of one step forward five steps back.DON'T BUY THIS GAME. IT'S A GUT WRENCHING WASTE OF TIME THAT OFFERS NOTHING BUT STRESS. EVERYTHING YOU WORK TO ACHIEVE( AND TRUST ME YOU'LL GRIND) IS EITHER TAKEN VIA EXPLOIT CHEATERS RANDOM WIPES FORCED WIPES AND EVERY OTHER WAY YOU CAN IMAGINE LOSING WHAT YOU WORKED TO GAIN.

There will always be someone with more gear than you that will blow up your house and steal your stuff even though they're completely decked out and have no use for it.The game is a buggy mess considering it's been in alpha for 3 years now. Animals effortlessly walk up cliffs making bears and wolves impossible to escape from. If one starts chasing you you're just dead.Animals like horses will give you raw chicken breast instead of plain meat?It's just terrible.

2015-01-08,0,0,202,True,Not Recommended,I got this game back the the old times. Back when there were zombies back when Rust Legacy was simply rust and there was no experimental crap. Then things changed yes changed. The game was great just needed bug fixes and content and then the devopers decided to make rust experimental the official Rust. The lack of content hurt a bit. As did the aweful frame rate no matter what settings I used. It is almost impossible ot find your friend on the map. And to this day my hunger levels haven't changed. This my friends is why Rust legacy is the true rust and if the developers take the gamer further down the road it is on they will have ruined a masterpiece of the gaming industry. WE MUST PROTEST THESE CHANGES. Facepunch must listen to what the people want they want the real rust not the new bullcrap. There is a reason for all the recent downvotes. It felt like they took a fully finished game and sent it back to pre alpha stages. Please force facepunch to listen to us. Do not get this game until they are forced to change it back to the glorious work it once was.,Rust

2014-12-14,0,0,956,False,Recommended,Rust is a quasi survival game where you start out with nothing but a rock to bash away at things to get the materials you need to make better things.then you can use those things you make to kill people who have not made those things.kind of like a rock paper sissors game until everyone has the best stuff then its luck and who shoots first.its fun and addictive but in its current state it needs a LOT of work to truely be a great gameEdit Here we are just over 2 years later and this game has come so far its mind blowing. This game has went from fun for a few hours to a full blown addiction waiting to happen.if you havent tried this game yet what the hell are you waiting for? pick it up! the developers are always tweaking and adding more the game is about to release next year and it is now so refined that it could honostly release right now and be a full game.easily well worth the cost at full price and at a sale its a steal!Edit 2 4 years since my first review and 2 since my update... here we are again... and the game continues to change and be amazing! if you STILL havent bought it yet im not sure what else i can say to you to get you on board.

2017-11-02,0,0,615,True,Not Recommended,"This game has so much potental the mechanics are awesome the game play is superb the only problem is the players. The Rust community as a whole is TOXIC racial slurs over chat or painted on in game bilboards. The Devs do nothing about it at all. The majority of the player base will kill you repeatedly upon your starting because they build their bases near spawn points so they can just kill anyone they see spawn. So like I said the game has SO MUCH potental and could be AMAZING but the player base needs to be culled and some resemblance of rules need to be enforced rather than a guy making a 50x50 billboard in game that says "" DEATH TO ALL NI*GERS"" or ""ALL NI*GERS HAVE AIDS"" or similar things.",Rust
2017-07-06,1,2,11,True,Not Recommended,1/10 because even after years of early access this game is the purest of Dull and incomplex gameplay with a handful of different resources to combine and no goal to go after. It's a sandbox with extremely dirty and disgusting sand in it. PvE doesnt exist unless you call the most simple base building and fighting off wolves PvE.PvP is the worst I've ever seen in an online game. Insane base lag and hitboxes that are on average three meters off the target. Guns vs spears makes absolutely no sense and shows the simplicity of the developers minds. No interesting team fights or anything that would motivate the player to continue playing after a few hours of getting to know the game. The community is cancer mostly 10 14 year olds who either dont speak english or have the thickest accent one could imagine. Rage and anti teamplay is the only thing there is to find unless you join en empty server and invite your friends on it. So try it out and refund it that is the only solution. The only reason I see for Rusts existence is the community Minecraft has created over the years before. The kids who reached puberty now want to try out something different and find Rust as the successor.,Rust

2017-04-23,0,0,1927,True,Recommended,a game that requires skill to be good but can still be fun with the large amount of weapons and small group of attachments you can really see whats best for you and while severs do wipe and you have to start over you can get back to where you were in about a hour or 2 with a group then spend the rest of the month doing whatever or until you get offline raided if your alone you can play on one of many modded severs which offer multipliers so you can do it in the same amount of time and solo severs limit big groups fighting you theres a sever for allmost anything if your willing to help build the player base so whether you dueling it out in combat tag going on a murder rampage in battlefield building raiding farming or pvp theres something for everyone while i have a lot of hours that dosent stop me from having a great time with a few friends for the night the right place to be is good enough so you can hold your own while still being able to enjoy the game and not feeling like a job (cough)(50 man zerg)(cough) and many things are still being changed and added as well as tweaked by facepunch many of which are bugs that the people say they do listen so if theres a problem just start asking the community all in all its a great game for only 20 its not the best and not the worst just get some friends which i met in game and have fun,Rust

2015-10-09,3,13,351,True,Not Recommended,"Don't buy this game unless you have a state of the art machine and A LOT of spare time on your hands. Seriously unless you're rocking some 980s in SLI with a top tier i7 and naturally a SSD you will be spending half your time (at least) looking for workarounds to miserable framerates dealing with mysterious game crashes and suffering through endless loading screens.And what's even more alarming With every update and patch they roll out the game seems to run worse. I was able to play the game just 'fine' (which in Rust terms means it runs like sh*t but at least it runs) 6 updates ago but the situation deteriorated to the point where I am not able to play at all anymore. Literally the game will not start anymore. They have acknowledged the issue but there is no fix in sight.Although this steaming pile of bugs and bad code is years from completion they are dedicating more than half of their resources on the development of new skins game features and items/monuments/events just adding more errors to the already existing ones. Seriously I don't understand why they will not prioritize fixing gamebreaking issues first.""..but it's Early Access it's just an Alpha bro! Give them time!!"" Well I understand that it's just an Alpha but honestly it's been in Alpha for more than two years now and they have been cashing in ever since. Early Access has become an excuse allowing developers to publish unfinished games and then slacking off all the way to the bank.Remember Minecraft? Remember how smoothly it ran in Alpha? Mojang managed to create a whole new game genre adding awesome features over time without making the game gradually unplayable. That's an Early Access game I was able to recommend.Not this one though. My prediction is that Facepunch will never finish developing this game. I don't believe they lack the intention to do so though they simply are not capable of it. And at some point another studio will come along and publish a working version of a Rust like game leading to this one being forgotten.In conclusion don't waste your money on this 'game' it's basically a crash report and loading screen simulator. If Facepunch should actually finish the game at some point I will give it another shot and might edit this review. Until then my rating stands at 0/10.",Rust

2017-11-13,1,1,14,True,Not Recommended,"To begin with you can't customise your character. I know that this was intentional by the developers but it's ridiculous. Since the allocation of who you play is random I'm stuck playing as an Asian dude (a huge target for racial abuse and KOS) making it virtually impossible for me to team with anyone. Also some what upsetting because I like spending hours in character creation.The community is abusive if that isn't already obvious and due to constant server wipes a lot of the stuff you spend weeks making ends up gone in less than a few seconds. If you make a base on a server don't expect anything to be intact when you get back or you to have any stuff in your chests.The aim is to survive however there is little to no incentive to do so but that just might be because I'm done with the game 15 minutes in. Mainly because every time I come across someone they yell ""oh it's an Asian man I don't like Asian men. Die Chinese man."" Or some Kim Jong Un racial slur.

2013-12-11,0,0,77,True,Recommended,"This game is about survival but it is not your average DayZ or Minecraft type of game. The world is a post apocalptic wasteland with pockets of radiation zones scattered about. You are a survivor who must collect items and build your self a home where you can rest easy. There are other players who will be out to hunt you down and loot your stuff while there will be some who might be more friendly than others. Try and meet up with friendlies to help your odds of making it out there. The beginning of the game might seem like a pain to understand at first but once you get a feel of the crafting and resource gathering you will become a natural at it. This game is not the most fun to play alone so please bring friends with you. All ""noobs"" and legitmate players should take advantage of the offical servers to avoid admin abuse and hacking. Finally this is an Alpha game so don't expect it to be flawless. Now get out there and go kill some piggies and gather some wood for your home! Good luck out there!Summary for those who don't like long reviews Great game so far for an Alpha release. Get it now for $20 guys and come survive with me!

2015-01-20,1,1,75,True,Not Recommended,It was fun at the beginning but after a few times of getting robbed by the hackers I gave up. I don't think this game is at all playable until there is an effective way of finding out and banning hackers.,Rust
2015-01-22,1,1,92,True,Not Recommended,Nope.I've been following this game for a LONG time now.And as it was fun at first like mmo's have this effect on you and only later you find out the POISON in the game itself. Now ofc this isn't an mmo but it works the same ing way. Dont waste your time and energy on this game and I will tell you why.My first experience. Here we go.This was almost a year ago and the game was still the old Rust.We picked a server and went on with our own merry thing we had a bunch of fun and i played with 2 other friends. And the 3 of us just build this massive fort and with massive. I mean really massive. It got the attention from a few players (that were apparently buddies with the owner of the server) they were chatting with us and quite fast it became obvious they didnt want us on this server and of how unwelcome we were. We shrugged it off even the silly threat that he would contact the owner of the server etc. We figured he was just bluffing.And when we went offline. (seriously the second after or so) and our buddy (who lives in America) when we left went online after us to do some guard duty. The owner used a cheat or hack or whatever to break through our (THICK SECURED) fort and steal all our *slow clap* this guy deserves the jerk of the day award. IT's save to say i didnt touch Rust for a REALLY long time because that really me off.That was a 3 days worth of no sleep building that fort. I had fun sure. But after seeing it breached the coward way i had no interest of trying again. Only to get your process destroyed the minute after. Its like showing a damn cookie to someone and then having to watch someone else eat it. Yesterday after almost a year i finally returned with the idea fine lets some up too then. Because honestly i didnt feel like building and have the same thing happen again. Also the anti cheat etc makes it so that hacking/cheating is no longer a thing and it will perma ban users from Rust or Steam completely.FIRST OF ALL. My friend had to instal the whole thing again because he recently did an entire reinstall of his entire computer. Oh well nothing new right he instals it. And the game doesnt even show many servers for him now this was... REmotely annoying but fine it was fixable by just stepping back in time so to say to disgard an update or go back to previous build etc. Because the game continues to get updated so much. Now he finally did that went back into the game only to have his character spawn in the air the entire time and to fall to his death. SWEET!He had to leave the game again reinstall the whole damn thing and try again.NOW IT WORKED. YES WE CAN FINALLY PLAY.We found a decent server that had little players so we could do our thing make a fort hunt gather recources etc. We had our good ole' nostalgiac fun. And the server promised it wouldnt wipe or anything. We started building etc etc.. And the whole time we were the only ones there. Fine i guess we wanted a small population so we would be left to ourselves.We logged off later that night in our awesomely build (still small) Fort. But it was secure enough so we wouldn get killed in our sleep when we logged off.Today we tried returning to the server.And with try i mean you cant even ing search for the server. Its not in your history. Oh you get the option to save servers to favorites meanwhile there is no tab for that. At all.The search function doesnt even work.So we had to skim through 60 pages worth of servers twice (to make sure) to realize that the server we build on. WAS GONE. *rubs temples furiously*I'm sorry no. But this game is NOT worth your 20 bucks right now.Please spend it on the Resident Evil remake or so and i will promise you will get worth your money spend.I really do hope this game develops and adresses all of these issues because honestly its a fun game WHEN YOU CAN PLAY IT. And this server thing needs to be fixed because im OFFICIALLY done and scared to go onto a new server and start all over again. No. It's just not worth it. Considdering the dedication i put into building etc this takes hours. And a lot of effort on our end to gather resources which are sometimes hard to find. I hope by the time its finally out of beta its worth to check out and worth the actual 20 it asks of you. Also on graphical note.It tends to be kinda laggy and the game doesnt even run on full graphic settings on my end.The fps is just low and this sometimes can be hell if you're hunting because it makes you an easier victim/target.But i will leave it at this. Normally graphical errors me off but the amounts of other stuff wrong with this game completely overpowers this one downside.Not recommended.,Rust

2015-04-15,0,0,1860,True,Recommended,This is a game i do enjoy but for the life of me cannot figure out why i can get wolf meat from a bear...and a deer ....and a boar and even the occaisonal chicken i come across getting wolf meat from a wolf makes sence...to me! Anyway you start with a rock you grind away on trees and rocks to get ur resource you must build your house strong and quick or you will find other players killing you and looting all those resources you so tediously gathered over time and you will find some real pices of s#*t too! just to give an example after a hard time getting started i was lucky enough to have an airdrop right in front of me i go to collect and whilst retreving the goodies from the drop create im suddenly attacked from behind with my screen flashing red with every blow he delivered with his rock i turn to look as backing away and he delivers the fatal blow which leaves me wonded on the ground as i lay there he then kneels over me and and finishes me by crushing my head with his rock which took several blows! this upset me so i then took the liberty of verbly abusing him saying such things as ur mummas so fat everytime she turns around it s her birthday! this did not work. but i eventualy got him back by blowind down his front door with some c4 i found then blowing his f# ck#n brains out with my shotgun!(whom i named canoemaker!) i then waited over his sleeping bag for him to respawn then blew his brains out again then i destroyed his sleeping bag so he d respawn elsewhere THEN i took my time looting his stuff! then the verbal abuse started from him. i had tears from laughing so hard. and i guess this is what makes this game so fun (sometimes) so you ll have to expect that it will go both ways! I ll give this game 7.5/10,Rust

2016-06-22,0,0,857,True,Not Recommended,Rust absouletly sucks and i will tell you why.1) It takes far too long of hours to actually get a decent base or to find anywhere suitable to build one2) alot of multiple spawn points and base's allowed? well that means even if you think you are away from the enemy you may have just killed or they have killed you ... they can spawn in a different area and get you just as easy the next time. they should limit it so that you are allowed to build 1 base and one sleeping bag per person.3) you cannot enjoy this game solo you need to be with quite a few friends that meaning 3+ to be able to be even decent in defending or anything.4) Your hunger goes down to quick5) Well i suppose i point from before but you will always be at the mercy of a big group which absolutely sucks!The only good things about this game really is that graphicly it looks great. oh and it's fun to muck about naked at people's shacks/houses. That is pretty much it.,Rust
2016-06-23,0,0,12,True,Recommended,"Ok so played for almost 2 hours. The game is a beautiful virtual world but there is little to do. I jumped on an empty server for about 10 mins and looked around then went to an official server where I was gunned down by a group of three players in full swat gear with machine guns while I was naked and had a rock. I didn't overly care about dieing as I can just respawn but then I played for over and hour collecting sulpher and rocks and wood only to get killed by another person who I saw in chat. I laughed if off and he said ""Sorry but I wanted your stuff"". Hmmmm. In chat I listened to a few people say they were bored and looking for what to do in this game. I went exploring and found stuff but no way to keep it without dieing or logging off. I guess there is crafing (A way to build a shanty home) but if the world is beautiful the housing is hideous! The homes are shantys of corragated sheets of rusted metal and bland stone walls that surround you but aren't suited to intereact with. There were no benches chairs tables etc. Just rusted out metal and stone shanty walls in a square pattern on everyones home. The doors had space age digial locks on them to boot. Then I found way to a place where two reactors were crumbled and burned out and ahhhhhh I put it together that this is a fallout world. A world after things go to pot and are being rebuilt. The game is fun if you have friends or find a public server where you don't mind getting killed and have some fun tossing rocks at fully armed men but other than that there isn't much to do yet. The only truly negative thing I can say is that I am a black man in game when I am very much the opposite out of. I wish there was a way to fix this. Over all I like the game and keeping in mind it's early access I have to give it a thumbs up for it has HUGE promise. Just watch the timeline to make sure the dev's don't leave it like it is for too long or abandon the project. Would be nice to know a major fix and update is on the horizon that makes the game look more pro and less indy.",Rust

Guess it's my time aswell to give you guys a little Review here i apologize in advance for my english but i guess in the end you all understand what i'm trying to say here pRemember that Rust is still in it's alpha as the dev's say ""things will change""In my opinion the Official Servers are nothing for new players because you simply dont get the chance to enjoy the game in every single way. These servers are allways at full cap (up to 300 players) and you wont survive any longer than 5 minutes. I started on one of those but cant recommend them yet. So the alternative is either a Community Server or a Modded Server. A Community Server is a retail version of Rust simply hosted by other players just like you. Admins on those servers can change specific parts wich ""converts"" them to Modded Servers.I won't tell you much about the ingame environment i would like you to explore it yourself.But here are some Basics You spawn alone random and totally disoriented on the Night/Day cycle'd map with nothing but a Rock a Torch and 2 Bandages. How are you going to survive? You need to Eat! How to get Food? you Hunt! You need a place to live? Build it!

I may have skipped it.)...BEARSClans can easily take over and rule a server. IF you don't know that a clan is dominant over a server and you enter. Well...GG get rekt I guess.Alright. Let me tell you how this game plays out.You wake up. Naked. Nothing but a rock and a torch to your name. You don't know where you are. All you know is that you must survive. So with your rock you begin bashing at a tree and collecting wood when suddenly...BANG! Someone has shot you for no reason. You have died. Respawn. You start again still eager to get into the game. You bash a tree bash a rock and make a stone hatchet. With that hatchet you can get wood faster and faster. Soon you have enough for a building plan and begin working on your base. SInce you are new you don't want to build too big so you build a small base. 2x2 or 2x1. Yay now you have a place to live. By now you're starving so you go hunting. What's that over there? A pig! Mmmm...bacon...you run to the pig waving your rock or hatchet violently. You want that bacon. You need it. However the pig runs which is to be expected. The pig approaches a rock and you think you have it cornered when it just...shoots up over the rock. Gone. So you settle for some nearby corn or mushrooms. Now night approaches it's getting darker by the second. You hear the howl of a wolf and the screech of a...something. ""Time to go back inside."" you say to yourself. You make your way back to your base and enter your place of living. Now the game tells you that you're cold...so you make a campfire and set it in your house. The fire brings light and warmth. But wait. What's this? You hear rustling? What could it be? A bear a wolf? WRONG. Your fire has attracted another player. They shoot through your base and kill you. Respawn. *sigh* Now let's say that you finally have gotten a pretty good base. You've found some items and have everthing fortified. Cool beans! Now you log off to go do something else. You come back the next day and you're dead. Someone raided you when you were offline. Wash rinse and repeat. That's the game.Regardless of that I still love it. You can find a server with only five people on it and stay there. That way you don't have to worry about asshats taking your stuff.

2015-10-28,0,0,42,True,Not Recommended,This is a game for a very specific group of people. If you like trolling and being on a power trip this game is for you. However the crafting adventure and building tags should be removed from this game as they are extremely misleading. I knew pvp was part of the game however the degree of punishment other players can dish out on you is unfathomable. The combat system is stale and the second best weapon under the assault rifle is the bow which is the first damn weapon you get. Sure you can form alliances you can make friends but none of that matters when you need to go out and collect resources solo or do literally anything else. This game is great for what it is but it's really important to do your research and understand what it's not.,Rust
2015-12-30,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,I had wanted this gane for a long time so I purchased it during the Winter Sale. Unfortunatly this game did not live up to my expectations. If I had of purchased it when it first came out I think I would have enjoyed it and still be playing it. Just buying it a few days ago I joined a server and started out wearing nothing holding a rock and a toarch. When I joined the world it was barren almost. Very little treesm rocks or minerals existed and as far as I could look there was massive buildings eveywhere built by other players. Some of the other players would relentlessly hunt me down and kill me even though I was no threat to them. I would get killed over and over with advanced weapons while I had a spear in each new game and they rook my rock and toarch. I had felt here was no realy was I could advance my character and in the game with everyone else around me so advanced killing me every chance they seen me. It was a cool game but I would not reccommend it to somebody just jumping in to it. Minus the severe disadvantage you have starting the game fresh its a great game witha lot of potential.TLDR Great game but with everyone else so advanced and resources so limited its going to be a very hard road to get your character up to spec to compete withe the more advanced players on the server.,Rust

2015-01-17,0,0,13,True,Recommended,So I've been playing Rust since its Legacy days and I've seen all the negative hype and bad press after so many changes. I just need to write this review because of the game in its current and up coming status. Previously Rust Legacy was a lot of fun. It had lag problems and some programming issues and other bugs that were bothersome... but overall the game was a lot of fun. I had a blast playing it. Then the devs started making changes. At one point the game became basically unplayable. That sucked and I was forced to take a long break from the game. I was disappointed in the devs and I took Rust off my Favorites list.Now with the more recent developer communication and with the more recent changes to the game Rust is back on my Favorites! I'm very very impressed with the devs now. I'm happy with the direction the game is going and I'm extremely excited about the future. It's been fun being a part of the development process and seeing all of the changes as well because I am interested in becoming a game developer and watching the process of development for this game has been intriguing. I expected to play a fun game when I bought Rust in early development and I did. I didn't expect the roller coaster ride but it's all working out OK. Lastly let me make a comparison I'm sure 80% of the people reading this review will understand. World of Warcraft is one of the most well known MMORPGs of all time. In some ways it paved the way for the current MMO hype. It brought a lot of gamers together and it brought a lot of people who weren't gamers into the gaming community. That being said WoW has at times a lot of gamers off. The devs at Blizzard made a lot of decisions that cost them players and gained them back. With WoW and with D3 Blizz has taken their fans on a roller coaster ride just like the devs for Rust. If you're a gamer and you're at buying Rust as an early access game and you're dealing with the disappointment and you're concerned about the game's future... be patient. Good things come to those who wait.Facepunch isn't the biggest wealthiest best staffed world wide phenomenon that Blizzard is... and yet Blizzard took their gamers on some serious roller coasters just the same. As a Gamer you learn to deal with disappointment. There will never be a game that meets every single one of your criteria unless you make it yourself.,Rust

Do you like working for hours and hours and hours and hours scraping together stone lumber ore hemp and apparently the only organic food on the planet known as mushrooms (they SAY there are pumpkins and corn but good luck finding them)?? Well wait there's even more for you to enjoy! Starvation running aimlessly across barren terrain being chased by NPC's in blue suits dogs bears and the occasional guy who is somehow fully armored carrying a shotgun crossbow and long knife before you even have a chance to figure out wooden spears!! It's so much fun when two people gang up on you and then laugh as they steal your hard earned items you just worked HOURS and HOURS for! Then they call you a NOOB and laugh!! What joy!!!! Toxicity abounds without end no worries about ever running out of that! That said as a survival game straight up on a server that doesn't have any PVP players waiting to gank you while you are fighting a bear and a guy in a blue suit at the same time (no joke) it could be fun. Be prepared to have to urinate into soda bottles under your desk though because this game bleeds your time like a stuck pig (those are in the game too!) and doesn't really cater to being AFK. That's especially true with PVP'ers around since you will most definately be dead with all your loot gone after you ""wake up"" the next day to start playing again guaranteed.

Until the developers learn how to write code without huge memory leaks and performance problems do not spend your money on this game. Myself being someone who's used to getting at least 100 FPS on high/max settings in most games with no lag or stuttering this game is absolutely unplayable. Especially since the entire game becomes a PVP gunfight having constant lag spikes while trying to shoot at a guy gets you killed pretty quick.Avoid this game unless you have a very very good PC. Gameplay The game is pretty fun if you can get past the bad performance that I mention. And it can be pretty addicting too. The game however is very boring when you're playing solo without a group of people since you just get killed by clans with 20 players online in the serverThe game is a survival game as many other will tell you and it's not an easy one at that. It's a hardcore survival game no other way to explain it. It's really fun sometimes and it's really boring and tedious at times. That's what you get.One thing I'm not a fan of in this game is the gunplay. It's basically just 1. Download a norecoil script/cheat 2. on everyone. And the main reason is because all of the guns have insane recoil and it's pretty uncontrollable most of the time too. So unless you're using a norecoil cheat like everybody else you're almost guaranteed to loose every gunfight. If they changed the way gunfights worked then there wouldn't be much left to complain about.Community The community is super toxic. It's more toxic than CS GO League or any other games with a well known toxic community. The community is very unfriendly towards new players in general and most of the people who actually succeed in this game have huge clans with tons of players in a group. There's even clans with like 50 people who just run around and use their numbers to take down everyone on any server they can establish themselves on. There are the odd few people who are actually really friendly in this game and sometimes you find people who don't KOS and it's usually a celebrated moment when that happens.The meta in this game is ""More numbers Bigger chance of victory"" so there are many many clans with a bunch of toxic kids in them who just go on servers and use their 10 players to gather as many resources as they can and because they have so many people in their team they can just raid grief and destroy any base as they please. And how is a small group of 2 4 people supposed to fight them? The answer is They don't. They run.So the verdict is Do you have a insanely good PC?Do you like hardcore survival games?Do you have a large group of players to play with?Are you fine with using a norecoil cheat to actually gunfight?If you answered yes to all or most of these questions then Rust may be for you.But my opinion is I can't reccomend it right now. When the game gets it's performance problems fixed then it would be a decent buy.Right now though it's by no means a ""BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW"" but it's not a ""Buying this game is a waste of money"". It's more around the ""If you're really interested buy it other than that don't.""",Rust

So I lost all those materials because a wolf spawned in a rock killed me I used my sleeping bag only to die to the same wolf that you CANNOT outrun OR kill and i couldnt spawn for 300 seconds so I lost all my materials FOR NO REASON.

2014-06-09,0,0,51,True,Not Recommended,Rust is an highly addictive game to play with friends your aim is to survive build a fire to keep yourself warm make shelters make towns and epic bases do whatever it takes to survive but i dont recommend the game as much as when you just spawn you either get killed by armed players or animals i really do hope Rust will add the zombies back in again. 'Why did they remove it in the first place anyways'The game itself has became pretty unenjoyable due to the removal of zombies addition of RPGs.Graphics 5/10 ( Graphics are not as realistic and the first person perspective of the sprinting animation is not as good )Realism 4/10 ( Kill a dear &gt &gt &gt Gets Chicken meat )Gameplay 7/10 ( PVP gameplay feels fast and solid )My Opinion to make the game better &lt &gt Add zombies into the game again&lt &gt Remove RPGs( grenades are enough ) ( Or maybe add RPGs and remove grenades)&lt &gt Add a water bar ( For the player to need to drink and eat)&lt &gt Add a third person perspectiveThe game itself will get boring after a while so i suggest the developers to kinda add in a map like survival mode where you have to survive as long as you can from waves and waves of zombies.&lt Remember this game is in Early Access&gt &lt This does not represent the final product!&gt From Allied Gaming Infinity.,Rust

2014-01-02,0,0,122,True,Recommended,A mix of Minecraft Dayz fallout. Get resources build structures and defences raid and steal from enemies make allies kill zombies and get loot survive and kill or be killed. A great game and it's only in alpha with little issues. At the moment you get infrequent lag spikes random rubberbanding and server crashing. But it's very infrequent these bugs don't happen that often at all and it doesn't remove anything from your experience. The game is only in alpha which means the game isn't completed the bugs will be fixed over time. If you don't like the idea of having bugs in game you should wait until the game is fully released. However the is a good thing about alpha more cotent will be added over time and therefore there will be more things for you to do in the game and more fun to be had.If you like the sound of this game you should probably pick it up now the game will most likely be more expensive when the game is fully released and also the game is really amazing and fun now so you don't have to wait for the game to come out and you can have great fun right now.,Rust

Freedom of worship in the country has been guaranteed by the Constitution. The Constitution has not enforced an official faith for the country but it gives Catholicism a different status. The government also mostly funds the Roman Catholic Church and besides the religious freedom in place there are certain remaining traditions and customs that make it hard for a person who is not Catholic to become president.About 76.5% of the total population in the country are Catholic 11.3% Atheists and Agnostics 9% Evangelical Protestants 1.2% Jehovah s Witness and 0.9% Mormons. 1.2% of the population follow other religious beliefs such as Buddhism Judaism and Islam.

I was literally chased around while some jerkoff screamed into the mic that all N*****s must die. Racism and bigotry of every kind is so concentrated in this game that you can't play for ten minutes without it completely ruining the experience. To put it simple the worst of gaming has for whatever reason culminated here. Reminscent of the CoD twelve year olds screaming obscentities into the mic for no other reason than to be annoying except aged and ripened to adulthood transforming children who's parents didn't pay enough attention to them into fully grown adults. Adults who have grown so used to throwing around homophobia and racism as if it were a badge of pride that they've actually grown to believe the t nonsense they screeched into the mic as kids. Gameplay was great though. If you're able to put up with the stupidity then you will probably enjoy the game. You could always play on your own server but the work invovled in doing that is a little much for a game that feels just a little hollow when played singleplayer.

And on top of all that the game is now just about impossible to get started in.

2014-03-05,1,1,1513,True,Recommended,3/5/14enormously addictive and annoyingly fun. Even in early alpha this is a game you need to have.4/6/16TL DR Rust is great filled with fussy 12 y/o's. Create a clan. Make friends. Improve yourself as a player constantly and you'll win. Leave the server once you have and find something where you're no longer just a big fish in a small pond.It's now been two years and change that I've been playing Rust. From it's original launch to now I've played and watched it evolve. The base building meta of legacy was abandoned for the superior system that Experimental now houses Raiding has shifted and evolved making larger groups all the more potent. Gathering has changed to be much more about roaming instead of a daily farm in the same area. Gunplay and hit detection has evolved for the better and armor mechanics now actually mean something.To this day I stand by my original review This game is crystal meth. It will be hard to put down hard to go to sleep and hard to stop thinking about the game. The community experience rivals that of Minecraft Younger folks playing badly and screaming that you're hacking in chat.If you pick the game up keep up to date with Rustified. Watch the dev servers. Read the devlogs and always try to learn more about what you're doing. If there's downtime on your server improve your aim on one of the Battle Royale or Battlefield servers that exist. If you've got the ability test base designs on a private server. Play around in Fortify troll about for base designs and improve on them. Pull people from different servers that impress you and take them with you to the next Don't stop growing your friends list and the people that you play with.You will see a lot of negative reviews about larger clans destroying all of their hard work Avoid being one of those people. Join or form a larger clan and encourage your people to continue bettering themselves. Compete on a higher level and don't just fall over at the first clan that prods your base. Rebuild when you get raided don't just ragequit and this game can easily become a part of your daily routine regardless of what kind of a schedule your life revolves around.At the end of the day Rust is a survival experience a social experiment and a potential way to better or sour yourself as a person. It is filled with frustration and anger and anxiety but it the moments of joy and satisfaction that exist are absolutely worthwhile regardless of whether or not the dev team will ever put out ing cars and electricity.,Rust

2015-01-19,0,0,8,True,Not Recommended,"&lt &lt This review was based on gameplay on a PvP server your PvE experience may be more enjoyable&gt &gt Rust. Interesting concept with some well implemented ideas but stay away until the game is more complete and the hackers have been brought under control.I only have 8 hours played and have uninstalled the game until a much later date. The current build has ""Broken"" animals that spawn into the world dead. You can't build a structure to protect yourself from the other inhabitants unless you are lucky enough to find a blueprint for walls. This game is NOT for a solo player so if you hoped to log in and struggle to build a structure someplace forget it unless you are extremely lucky and an Airdop lands on your head at night when noone can see it otherwise you are in for an impossible fight with hordes of naked men with rocks and spears to get the blueprints to build a structure.The short and sweet of it is that Rust in its current state is like Darks Souls without the fun and twice the frustration. If running around in a game world naked and chasing other naked people with a rock sounds fun then jump on the flopping Dong bandwagon (they don't flop no physics for that yet...) but for now I don't recommend Rust.Steam needs to implement a NO rating option instead of forcing a yes/no option for a review as I don't think its fair to developers that the community can up or down vote an Early Access or Pre release game. Be smart and READ reviews before you buy a game",Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,50,True,Not Recommended,(Edit Yes I wasted 50 hours on this God awful game.)Rust brings out the worst in people. People tend to gank you completely unprovoked. People from my own clan who I thought were on my side regarded me with paranoia and killed me when I was and other members were completely peaceful. They had no sympathy and they delighted in griefing.This created a split in the rust players within our community. Two groups formed and the members of each avoided each other (i.e. they used different teamspeak channels). Where I got along well with some members I don't think things will be the same again.It will take you half an hour (if you are fast and lucky enough not to get ganked in that time) just to gather the resources for and craft a basic weapon (a pistol) so that you can have a fighting chance against other players (if they don't get you before you do so).While it takes a long time to progress (i.e. stockpile weapons armour and build a fortifications) you can lose pretty much everything in an instant. You are constantly at risk of being suddenly slain by a random player. Often while you are minding your business and being completely peaceful or even if you are being friendly.When you are killed all your inventory is dropped including your resources and equipment. If you don't have backup gear stashed somewhere then you are back to square one hours days and weeks of progress gone just like that.And after death if you didn't place a sleeping bag you will spawn randomly on the huge map where everything looks the same. It takes a long time to learn your way around and you have to travel everywhere slowly by foot.When you log off you are not safe. You avatar remain on the server fallen into unconsciousness. You will just be lying there. The average rust player will not hesitate to kill you in your sleep and take your stuff.Even if you build a secure house it will never be safe. It's just a matter of when it will be raided. Every single item you and your group owned will be gone if any of your stuff isn't valuable raiders will probably turf it onto the group so that it despawns just to grief you.I decided that building a big house to secure your stuff was like making a big sign that said 'RAID ME'. So on a few occasions I tried to stash my stuff where they were well hidden. Unfortuntely certain containers (including pretty much all the ones I used in this case) will despawn after a relatively short time (i.e. overnight) and take all your hard earned stuff with them.Most of the land is covered by grass. It makes it harder to see dropped loot bags unconcious (disconnected players) and more importantly your hidden stashes. Unfortunately most players have no qualms about turning off the grass which you can do easily from the console.Likewise you can potentially turn up your brightness so that you can see at night time when it is supposed to be pitch black. It's dissapointing that a lot of players will do these sorts of things to ruin intended game mechanics and give themselves an unfair advantage.So yeah you can't win.Additional Rust is an ugly game and after four months nothing seems to have changed.I didn't mention this previously but the guns didn't even shoot where you aimed them. I'm pretty sure they are just Half Life 2 weapons with alternate skins. I cannot understand for the life of me why people raved about the gunplay.A game that I would recommend as a superior alternative is 7 Days To Die. It is also in development but it is much much further ahead than Rust.It has a much richer world than Rust i.e. it doesn't just feature a huge homogenous ugly brown landscape and your building options are a lot more than ugly wooden shack big ugly wooden shack and huge ugly wooden shack.It has lot more interesting locations. There are currently at least 5 or so terrain/biome types. There is a lot more variety in the buildings located around the map.There is twice as many weapon available. This includes a chainsaw!New features and content are added to 7dtd on at least a monthly basis. The terrain has been smoothed so that it no longer looks like minecraft. Motion capture animations for the Zombies will be implemented in like the next patch. It now has in game voice communication.New methods of building have been implemented so that you can easily arrange and upgrade your structures. The game now allows you to use grief protection for your structures secure storage and lockable doors.You can basically do anything in 7d2d that you can do in Rust better and more. The main issue that I have experienced with 7d2d isn't the game itself. It was the lack of dedicated local Australian servers for long ping gameplay running an up to date build.If you experience the same problem in your region fortunately there is a single player mode which still allows your friends or other people to join you. Hopefully a permanent server is estabilished in Australia. I'll do it myself if I have to!,Rust

2018-01-13,0,0,355,True,Not Recommended,In my Rust experiance I've had a blast. In the summer time of 2017 was in its prime no recoil patterens (which were added late summer) no blue prints and no workbench. Now that all of these features are in the game it just makes the game so boring. Getting a base started up was already hard enough and when you did you could make water pipe shotguns and maybe even a semi rifle. Now its just sh** basically cause with the trial and error of actually getting a base up and running you now need to get blue prints for certain items and bullets. Which is pretty anti climatic considering FacePunch was trying to make it easier to raid people then just adding things to just make it harder to do so. So right now Rust is a pretty sh**ty game fun at time but if you really want to succeed it going to take a lot more effort than before.,Rust

2016-01-08,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when they summed up this game as ""Call of Duty naked""...but Call of Duty actually has depth that this game doesn't even touch.For a 2 year old game that was such a big seller and is presently still high ranking on the Steam Stats I really surprised at how absolutely devoid of substance this game is. It is fairly straightforward what you're supposed to do once you figure out the controls progress through the linear ""tech tree"" building better bases and acquiring better weapons until you're the one killing random players instead of being the random player killed.Ah yes be prepared for much epic flailing of the default ""rock"" multitool you spawn with as another naked character (with blurred out genetalia... teehee?) flails a slightly more deadly weapon at you!If you go unnoticed long enough you'll then gather materials from rocks and trees (but ONLY the special boulders that spawn and trees that grow forget about that driftwood or stone outcroppings)... and we've seen this game how many times now?As for the other players that you'll meet... in my limited experience the Stanford Prison Experiment was called to mind if everyone were a guard. The players generally revel in their inability to play cooperatively and how unwelcoming the game is.The result is a predictable landscape that resembles a sad dystopia of a game sandbox populated by naked avatars looking to murder each other while long time players at the top of the tech tree (really it's a stick) pick everyone else off with their long range weapons from nearly impenetrable forces.Not really a gamer's game.",Rust

There has been a lot of additions to the game but i still miss the old way of raiding peoples houses. Back then we took down the buildings we raided and the buildings which just stood empty. Today we have a giant map which is full of empty houses where people have been raided and they just are in the way or just sad to see.I am both happy and unhappy with that the developers ditched the recipe technique. As they added the recycling part and insane rates of loot have given the game a new concept. 5 min and armed to the teeth. Armours Guns Ammo and more are no longer rare or hard to retrieve. It's super easy.Rust has improved the last year BUT IT IS STILL NOT GOOD in my opinion.INITIAL REVIEW PART This is more of an review. It's a message to you to everyone! Dont hesitate to read this if you feel like buying this game!I just can't accept this anymore having the so called FacePunch Studios Ripping people off with this so called game. When i got to hear about ""Rust"" i was excited since ""Garry's mod"" had been such a success. The game sounded intresting with it's 2013 charm. ""Survive hunt animals players and zombies for loot. Airdrops and more!"" It sounded great at first but hey. By now It's all t!""Rust"" was released on 2013 on the 11 december on steam as an Early Access Game... And STILL is an early alpha game. It was good looking It had great gameplay &amp performance it had a fair amount of elements &amp items and it was quite good for an early access game (Most early access games has tons of buggs and lack lots of playable elements).The buggs that existed was quickly fixed by Facepunch in the first days. You could play on almost any server without any problems well except Cheaters Abusive Admins and Locked servers. The gameplay was simple Start by cutting trees and stones Advance in tools and weapons Attack zombies &amp fellow survivers to gain loot Build a fortress unlike none other). It was good Really! And it had zombies! (The zombies were later transformed into Zombie animals like Zombie wolfs and Zombie bears)But this is where Facepunch executed their evil plan instead of keep working on the game they had made they decided to create a new fresh game version of rust. So they scraped the entire game and the only real update Rust got was an ""Lockpick"" with the desciption ""Coming soon"" (It didn't work and it never have). So they started reworking rust again and made it look better. New models (Looking like the original) New Weapons (Same as Rust) New concept(Same concept) and a newer world system (A random generating map).In late 2014 this new version was called as ""Experiminetal Rust"" and was released to all people who had purchased the game. The Rust game as we knew it was named ""Rust Legacy"". In january Facepunch seems to have awoken and started to update rust again. In the earlier January ""Experimental Rust"" was renamed to ""Rust"" and the legacy version was renamed to ""Old Version"". The new rust was also cool but it lacked all the elements that the legacy version had. No Zombies No Radtowns and no need to find the recipes to create guns (You had them already).Since Rust Legacy and New Rust are so different from eachother i will list what made each game good and bad.Rust Legacy GOOD SIDE It worked Perfect from start. It had a big map lots of cool elements as weapons with attachments crafting and building. It had good gameplay not to buggy. BAD SIDE It was ignored to much by the developers FacePunch Studios . When you wanted to raid another house the only way in was by blasting the door or walls with c4. Certain loot was only obtainable by Airdrops. The devs added a few things that just ruined some elements (Changing zombies to animals and adding items which couldnt be used.New Rust GOOD SIDE Raiding was now fun since wall now instead of being inpenetrable they had hitpoints with regen. More ways to build your house and more safety features to building the houses (Permissions). Fancier look (Doesn't improve the game) BAD SIDE The Raiding was removed in the latest updates. (They increased the hitpoint regen so much that they dont even budge anymore. not even for 4000 bullets which could in the earlier version remove 5 or 6 doors for an example. Earlier you had to make your building fresh by hitting with a hammer. Recipes that were added such as example clothes can be worn as the item the recipe is. You can wear a template of a shirt as a shirt. When new items are added to the games. Guess where they come from? Rust Legacy!So to summarize this review. Dont purchase this game. What you'll get in the upcoming year have been created in a previous game version. The game is constantly changing making it either playable or unplayable. Latest updates? Unplayable. And my opinion on Facepunch Studios ""You guys really need to start focusing on the game you are releaseing and stick to the plan. As i am educateing myself in programming I can see that you are not sticking to the plan. You are constantly changing it. If you sold a product Stick with it. Dont change it! And sorry for these words but Get your ing together and work on the product you have sold and profited on You are Literaly SCAMMING PEOPLE!""This is my review and my thoughts on this game. Dont buy this game!PEACE! And no I dont recommend this game!// UPDATE 1 MARCHSO the developers dislikes that people raid other people houses so much that the remove 50% of all raiding posibilitys. This is bad since they keep adding items to make houses impenetrable. At first we had the normal wood wall and stone wall. Stonewall was basically impenetrable but we could get thru it after endless time and effort. Wood on the other hand wasnt completely fool proof and was easy to get thru.Recently they added twig walls. First and lowest point of defence when building houses but it was a starter for it. breaking it down would take about 5 seconds with a proper hatchet. Then they added metal walls. Which can take up to (Their chart) 11 hours with a stone hatchet and it doesnt even move when struck by other items either. And now when almost every house is impenetrable they remove the ablitiy to demolish houses. I STILL DONT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!Developers! Get a hold of yourself! Stop changing things that aren't broken! Stupids!",Rust
2014-08-24,0,0,114,True,Recommended,The most loveable hive of scum and villainy on this side of Steam.Experience what it's like to be born into a post apocalyptic nudist colony where everyone's best friend is a rock in RUST. This action/survival game is perfect to see humanity degenerated into various packs of incredibly adept shackmakers and riflemen where the #1 source of entertainment comes from religious cults dedicated to Miley Cyrus The Oompa Loompas and their character's genitals.The game prides itself on social interactions. As you climb up the Bear Grylls social tree you'll get to meet a diverse array of people that look exactly like each other before they kill you and/or become your 2nd best friend! Craft equipment and raid others to become top dog or finally fulfill that dream of becoming the hippie in the mountains playing tunes on your invisible acoustic guitar to passerbys.By finding schematics along towns and in the wilderness you'll be able to magically craft high quality grenades and remotely triggered explosives from RAW materials. Get your hands dirty and receive the full package by making a Kevlar suit disguised as a really ugly set of punk rocker clothes from decades yonder past and become an expert at creating Heckler and Koch weaponry in a snap!Getting a little bored of chasing people around rocks with rocks? Well then have no fear! Crafting and killing/getting killed is merely the SURFACE of what you can find in this title. Dig a little bit deeper and discover how YOU can make a difference as an individual. Become a greedy tax collector a bounty hunter/hitman or even a plantation owner who works off of nude slave labor. Explore your twisted dream as you see fit. But seriously go buy it. You'll love it.,Rust

2016-01-15,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I honestly tried really hard to like this game. I just couldnt. Im sure its a great game it just runs like I turn all of the performance options all the way down and it still runs at 5 fps. I would probably be okay with that. But the biggest issue I have is the loading times. As you can see I have 16 minutes of this game. At most one minute of that is gameplay. The remaining 15 minutes is just loading times. I am 100% serious here. One minute of actually playing the game 15 waiting for it to load. It just isnt worth it.,Rust

2016-12-26,0,0,202,True,Recommended,I logged in. I spawned with nothing but a rock a bow and a few trusted arrows. My inventory was meager but I did not let this diminish my ambition. As I looked over the horizon I saw a man. He was medium built and naked down to the boot. The only thing identifiable about this man was the look of hatred in his eyes when he turned towards me from over 200 meters away. Although we locked eyes for only a moment we both had a silent understanding. We knew that only one of us could walk away alive. The next thing I know I am sprinting towards this man with all the energy I could muster. The only thing on my mind was spilling this man's blood. As we approached eachother I pulled out my bow and nocked one of my few trusted arrows. I aimed the arrow high above his head and gently lessened the grip of the arrow until it jettisoned from my bow into his skull. In almost the blink of an instant my advisary was on the ground and screaming like a wounded deer. I knew I had to put my prey out of its misery. As I gradually approached the injured man I recognized I had to dissociate this man as another person. I had to rationalize them as an animal in order to sever any doubts in my mind to finish the job. I then raised my rock high above my head and slammed it into his skull. A man no more. What was once a man is now an empty cadavar a desolate shell. As I gleefully looted my prey and took his items I heard a warcry from behind me. As I turn around I see a naked man about 100 meters away from me jumping in sheer jubilee. The last thing I see is his wooden spear flying through the air directly towards my head. I did not move. I stared blankly into my computer monitor wondering what I had become. Credits to the owner*,Rust

I spent the rest of my morning expertely weaving clothing out of hemp while walking along the coast. Come early afternoon I found some guy taking a nap. He was tasty and came with a free machine gun. Here we are 2 days later. I write this as I lounge in my super fortress crafting C4 and taking pot shots at the naked people popping into existance on the beach.As the owner of 2 servers and the admin of 3 others who has spent nearly 900 hours ingame (as of the posting of this review) I highly recommend Rust to my fellow players. Below I've listed the best features of the game as well as things which need to be worked on and improved by the devs.Best things about Rust Extremely active devs who release updates every week and interact with their fan base. The game gets better every week as the devs release new content. Well balanced brutal fight for survival against your fellow players. Bears are s. 2 great events in vanilla the air drop and the heli which encourage both cooperation and pvp. Amazing modding community with thousands of amazing servers for those who want a little extra out of their game. Beautiful landscapes. Well designed building system. Improvements need to be made but in it's current state players can still spend hours designing new and improved bases. Dat BoltieThings which need to be improved Animals can walk through monument walls. Animals can run up sheer cliffs at amazing speeds. Lots of glitches which need to be patched. This is to be expected in Alpha games and everything game breaking has fixes but we shouldn't need to be spending time fixing right after buying the game. Performance enhancements which don't completely nerf graphics would be nice. Devs should consider hiring a couple more people to help accelerate development. Just a personal opinion. Quarries are currently useless. Their output needs to be at least 5 10x current to be worth the fuel used. Body assignment is cool but it would be nice if bodies randomly changed every couple of weeks of something. Switch things up a bit. Bicycles boats hint hint. Can we please get more options for building. Current system is great but could be improved. Prone position would be cool.I'm going to stop because there are tons of things the devs could add which would be nice but would not majorly impact the quality of the game. So far the game is amazing and I know we'll see lots of great things from the devs in the future. As of this time I would rate rust 9.5/10.,Rust

2016-03-20,0,0,237,True,Recommended,Okay so even after 180 hours in this game I still don't know everything about it. I literally just learned that because of the poor AI (this is the Unity's fault) you can set up a foundation and if you stand on it bears or whatever animals can't get to you. Now the concept of the game is rather simple you spawn with nothing but a rock and a torch and really there is no concrete goal except to survive. You can choose to play through different playstyles if you want to go gather all your materials yourself and build yourself a little house you can do that. If you want to craft a bow or spear and start killing people for their supplies you can do that as well. It's up to you what you do who you become allies with and if you play solo or as a team with friends.I have to say that in my short time playing this game over the last 3 months I've met many rather interesting people in this game. I've definitely made lots of friends the people you find I believe is what gives this game life. There's other games like this such as Stranded Deep where it's just a long grind of swimming from island to island building a shelter and surviving. Also DayZ which I've played briefly at a friends house and it seems just like running non stop and both of these games have a sense of isolation and you just kinda hope you run into people. Back to Rust generally you'll find that in a lot of servers people can be found everywhere not only that but people often team up in groups and sometimes full clans are made with monsterous bases that tower over everything else. Allies are made and so are enemies which makes the game so much fun. ****Side Note****This game is alpha still and of course it isn't perfect yet. The game runs poorly on most people's systems due to the fact it's not quite optimised just yet. Optimisation is rumored to start closer to the final release of this game which may be another year or two. It's just not something thats a top priority right now and there's other things to work on too. So just be aware of that if you want to purchase it now. Just as an idea of what I use to run the game I have an i7 4790k GTX 970 and 16gb of RAM and I run at about 80 90 frames on some servers with maxed out settings and other servers I get drops down to as low as 15 20. To add to that large gun fights usually bring things down as well you can be running at a solid 60fps and drop down to 10 if you get in the middle of a gunfight. Another thing a microphone although it isn't required to play it I would highly recommend one. Communication plays a big part in this game it can mean the difference between life and death sometimes. If you can make yourself seem friendly then there's a good chance not everyone will shoot on sight. But if you're quiet nobody can really tell what your intentions are. Of course there is a chat box to type in but if you're being chased you won't want to stop to type.,Rust

This EAC cancer install files directly into Windows's System folder which is totally unacceptable since the Windows NT line was started.

2016-09-12,0,0,268,True,Recommended,"Rust. This game is different. Its been sitting in testing for ages and keep changing overtime however the biggest update that they dropped has to be the retexturing and polishing of everything. When rust first came out it was quite boring and friends made it so much better and even now they still do. Nothing beats a group of people running around without any clothing on them while they hold a rock or a touch.So this new update its made this previous gen looking game and taken it up to next gen looking and it seriously looks good from where it started. The things that keep changing is the gameplay though. The people keep moaning about how the XP and unlocking everything is so bad. I think its fine and i quite enjoy not getting raided by ""everyone holding a gun up to my face because they started with the blueprints to make one"" or whatever the hell people want like that. This game is meant to be similar to reality right? well its not even realistic at all so all those people S*** talking the devs saying ""its not realistic enough"" and ""remove the XP system"" STFU no game is meant to be realistic gaming is getting away from life not living it so stop complaining because you can and just enjoy the game for what its worth. Give CONSTRUCTIVE feedback not winge and annoying the devs. The devs are dedicated and its not like they are going anywhere because they are well known and have a high reputation so ridding of a half done game would ruin that.

2015-12-29,0,0,6,True,Not Recommended,"Rust Rust Rust. I have many a word to say about this...thing. So Rust started out with a bang it immediately caught my attention with its great graphics smooth gameplay and extremely large gameworld. I had a great time going around and harvesting building crafting hunting and exploring and for a while it seemed like nothing could possibly go wrong. I of course was sorely mistaken.You see Rust is a beautiful game and I'm sure that by the time it's actually released will be pretty darn fun to play but Rust has a sickness. A sickness that drains it of all fun and enjoyment. That sickness is called ""Other players"". This sickness plagued the game the entire time I played it. 'What's wrong with other players?' you may ask. To that my answer is this...dickery. In Rust there is no saving no progression system and no sort of protection whatsoever. While some will say that this is the point of the game to be difficult. I would have to promptly frown and shake my head because if that truly is what the game is about then it is what we call a ""steaming pile of quot .I do not write this review out of anger because I was killed multiple times upon spawning I do not say this because I spent an hour and a half building crafting harvesting etc. only to be killed by two kids that had absolutely no reason to kill me whatsoever. I write this review because I truly believe that Rust has the potential to be the best survival game I have ever played but it needs a single player feature. It needs a singleplayer feature because without it this game has absolutely no rewarding gameplay. I gather wood stone bone fragments animal fat cloth. I build a house with walls windows a roof and a door that locks. I build a sleeping bag and a chest to store all my stuff in. I create a secret stash that I bury near my house under a rock with copies of my keys in case someone kills me. I do all this for what? Nothing because it was all taken from me in less than five minutes by two kids with crossbows just roaming around killing everyone because they could. I don't care what anyone says this game is in no way whatsoever rewarding.One last thing I'm not saying I hate this game and yes I do realize that there are PvE servers that you can join I get that. All I'm saying is this if you are going to buy/play this game just to enjoy some rewarding survival gameplay in which you can step back 300 hours into it and see everything you've spent your time on then this isn't the game for you because chances are you've been killed just 2 hours into it for no ing reason.TL DR Just don't.",Rust

2016-02-13,0,0,20,True,Not Recommended,I have to say this game has potential. However the balance in the game is pretty damn bad right now. Animals kill too quick and are too dangerous even late game. Gathering materials takes a hell of a lot of time and most things that you have to craft require a lot of materials too. That makes this game pretty slow paced. However get a few explosives and you can completely destroy an opponents house even a fully upgraded one.If the balance improves I'll rewrite this review. However right now even for early access it's not a good game.,Rust

2015-02-28,1,1,517,True,Recommended,Rust might be a game about surviving and killing other players for loot but it's more than that for me. Rust is a game that connects people together (and even deters). In the many hours I have played this game I have made and lost many friendships. I have had the chance to engage in deep conversations all while raiding and doing other random The best part about this game is being in your base at night and conversating about the most absurd things.Now it's hard for me to play Rust as a solo player.

I'm not even joking I would rather play DayZ standalone than to go back to this pile of garbage again.The gameplay of the game is good for about 6 hours then you realise that you litteraly CANT play on official servers cause the community is worse than any community out there.The loading screens HAVE ING LOADING SCREENS. THE GAME CAN TAKE UP TO 20 MINUTES TO LOAD ON AN SSD. THAT IS SOME ING T!The community makes undertales community look like god's gift.The gunplay (calling it that is an overstatement) is ING awful and shooting a gun causes the gun to go half a mile into the air seriously the accuracy makes a ing water fountain seem like a sniper rifle. Certain guns seemingly do jack when you use them. Theres pretty much no damage drop off on guns allowing you to one shot kill players from across the map.The exploration suffers because of the community having no control over themselves and kosing constantly.Ive started to KOS anybody who has a bow or higher because of the ing garbage community.If you are looking to buy this game DONT. Wait until they do something about the awful ing community and then wait for a sale. If you still do you WILL be FORCED to play on community servers or you will be instantly raided as SOON as you go offline.,Rust

So far the crafting system seams easy and simple to use and the only problems I would say exist so far are A shoot on sight mentality Americans seem especially good at this and B none of my friends have this game at the time of typing this and group play is essential for long term survival.After failing around for a couple of hours I eventually found how to get on the right path to survive in the long term got my camping bed crafting table and even a furnace to melt my ores into useable metals ofcourse all that was spoiled by a knock at my door some poor american bloke needed some food I opened the door and he machine gunned me down stole 5 hours worth of progression and destroyed my bed so I could not respawn I logged.

2016-06-03,0,0,220,True,Not Recommended,Product received for free. I only recomend this game to people with high powered gaming computers to run at highest graphics and an extremely good internet connection. This game ran so slow that it was running at 12 frames per second on lowest graphics qualitity. It was so difficult for me and my friends to play and i wasted 10$ on it. If u want the full experience buy a good computer. It may be that i have a gaming computer that is not good enough for this game but it is a laptop with 10 GB of RAM. I was expecting to be able to play it easily.,Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,1493,True,Recommended,I had bought this game a year ago. I had seen it on youtube and thought it looked awesome. When i got into the game i had no idea what i was doing. When i built a shack on the beach and crafted a waterpipe i thought i had reached end game how i was wrong! That was all the way back at blueprint system and i have constantly played this game till this day. The devs work on weekly updates and for me the game keeps improving. there are some dips and things that i may not agree with but i think that's part of this game. Rust is very fun you can do several things whether it is a pvp server or vanilla or a modded server there is something for everyone in this game. PRO almost everything CON community people KOS and are toxic on this game but for the most part people are not like this. It is just those few groups that ruin it for everyone.,Rust

2017-07-01,0,0,3,True,Not Recommended,It'll start downloading workshop content just when you start to play it and your ping will skyrocket. Instead of introducing confirmed workshop content through a patch like CSGO the devs of Rust makes us download EVERYTHING from the workshop even tho most of it is not even accepted into the game.

2016-04-05,1,1,122,True,Recommended,People are giving this game so much There are alot of pros to this game and a small amount of cons. First of all people are saying this game is to hard and they complain constantly about their base getting ed by a group of hooligans with c4 and rockets but this is why it's fun. You will have to reasearch on how to make a good base design and how to get started off but after that you are set. The gun play is fun guns feel like guns. There is a countless amount of base designs for you to choose and use. You will need a group for this game but thats not too much to ask surely. There are alot of servers to choose some are bad some are good theres modded and vanilla and both are a solid choice. Raiding and defending is a huge part to this game and is enjoyable even though its a pain in the when it happens to you. Overall I enjoy this game for its frequent updates and its cancerous community but i cant stop playing it 11.8 hours in two weeks. Time has never been used more correctly than that.,Rust
2016-08-18,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,"Catering to who I like to call the Graphics Bois Rust is an unoptimized infuriating game not just because of its ""hardcore"" pvp gameplay but for the fact that it has spent so much of its time trying to make a game that looks realistic rather than a game that's fun. If the developers had left the legacy version open I would play this game a lot more it may have been less developed and lack as many features as the ""Full"" game but at least it worked for the grand majority of people. Nowadays rust is just another reminder of the money I've wasted on my steam library and it sickens me to say that. I love Garry and the games he makes but this is a that's put no effort into making a game that's actually enjoyable.

2017-06-01,0,0,3295,True,Recommended,This game is very grindy and you pretty much have to have people to play with you if you are a solo player it is just way to much farming only to get raided by an 8 man zerg and have no chance at defending. Other than that it is a very fun game especially once you get past that level of grinding and the raiding and roaming begins.,Rust
2017-03-20,0,0,1789,True,Recommended,"This is a really good game with kinda ""odd"" devs. the game itself mechanics wise crafting farming pvp all perfect (kind of). the real problem arises when you see that they've sold enough copies of the game ot make a million US dollars or so and have micro tranactions yet the reccomended ram 16GB and you should have a gtx 980 to play (belive me thy're not lying you do ) . even when games like dying light and ARK have the same if not better graphics and more complex animations and landscape yet run WAY BETTER than this game. you would think this would be adressed right away but they seem to look over players who have less powerful computers and add even more content that makes the game laggy such as overgroth more detailed textures better harder to run animations etc. if you want the game and you have good tech get it its really fun if not then get a diffrent game.

2015-08-14,0,0,614,True,Recommended,My first experience was great the people in the server helped me by guiding me and telling me how to start this may very from servers as you do get a lot of bags who just kill you for the purpose of killing you but if you overlook that part its a good game.Solo players can have fun on Rust aswell as groups a lot of people will team up with you just to make their life simpler and to take out other player easier. If you have friends to play with thats even better as you know you can trust them not to shoot you in the back.Building is very simplistic you gather basic materials and go from there hammer is for rotating and upgrading. Finding blueprints can be tiresome as RNG can be a . Combat is stable and once you get used to it you experience combat in a whole different way.Raiding. Being raided is intense especially when theres a lot of people after you but the accomplistment of getting rid of them is very satisfying driving them back to their raid huts and taking their resources from them is fun. Raiding someone else is fun aswell be strategic about how you place your C4 and Shoot your rockets is fun.I recommend this game to any player out there as you can experience the game either way.,Rust

Iv'e tried for the past several days to (in game) ask for a team or some kind of help and the end result is me getting killed.

You have to survive find supplies and killing other players AND you have to build your own house. House is needed as storage and protection against other players.Even if i love so much this game i think he is not perfect. I found 2 bad way in this game. 1st one is server life time if you come when people have already full stuff and explosif (c4) you cannot survive alone they will harass you and kill you many times. Impossible or really hard to build your house in this conditions except in no mans land. 2nd one is the power of group. If you are more than your enemy group you have 80% chance to win the fight. You cannot (maybe you can with hard skill) win fight alone against group because you cannot be sneaky one shoot and all of them will find you (and your shoot will not kill your taget).Otherway this game is really good. Build house is fun (expect you cannot remove fail wall or pillar etc...so you have to take your time). In some servers you could see city players are making awesome building sometimes. Map is big enought and need some experience to be learn completly ).tl dr &gt if you like survival game with craftable house and pvp buy it it's worth !(sry if my english is bad s),Rust

2016-07-16,0,0,949,True,Not Recommended,"THIS DUMB XP SYSTEM KILLED THIS GAME What I liked about rust was the fact that there was something for everyone. You could be that russian neckbeard who would play 10 hours a day with his 20 players guild and have fun. You could be that lone wolf who would just build a 1x1 house then only pvp and have fun. You could be that random casual who would build his house next to a bp spawn and drop a weapon bp after 5 6 hours of sweat tears and blood. You could be that guy who would play for a full weekend with 2 or 3 friends and have of fun. Rust is now world of warcraft with disgusting small flopping around. You need 60 ing hours of grind to get that end game weapon. Where is the fun in that ? Who seriously have the time to ing cut wood 8 hours a day for a week ? Is this game ""obese neckbeards only"" from now on ? I PLAYED 8 HOURS STRAIGHT YESTERDAY AND I DID NOT DIE FOR 6 ING HOURS. WTH. WHAT HAPPEND TO RUST ? WHERE IS THE FUN ?

I see him following me or 'suddenly' popping up in my face.When I try swimming from one side of the river to the other side he just walks / hovers over the water and fishes me up from the water with his stupid When I go outside my base he's standing right in front of my door bloody stalker.When I go and try shoot him with arrows while standing on a rock (which in turn is surrounded by high fences) he just gets angry and outrightly walks through the fence and climbs the 90 degrees steep rock as if it's a piece of ing cake.ProsMy friend's eyes popped out of his head and permanently rotated to the left the poor guy will never live a normal life..Verdict10/10 No such thing as bugs just bears scary raping stalker bears.,Rust

2014-04-23,0,0,44,True,Recommended,Before i got Rust i was sceptical of whether it would have enough content to last me alot of play time (since the game is in early access) and should i wait until the game is done to get it. I got it and i will say it is GREAT! Even though the game is still in early access there is so much to do. I will say the game may be very challenging to some without friends playing with them or people helping them and modded servers make the game alot easier but Overall even if you are surviving alone on a Official server the game is so much fun.

I started playing on EU 3 since August. August wipe went fine nothing special. But after wipe in September this server and most others started to lagg as hell.Also there's like at least 20% of the players with hacks. Ppl killing you with bows at 0.0m distance and nowhere to be found ( all headshots ) ppl spraying u with AK from 200.0m with 8 headshots in the row wallhacks etc.This is pure garbage the game is ing unplayable.Not to mention the fact that I have huge FPS drops near RTs or big bases while playing on minimum settings with potato graphics on my MSI GeForce GTX 1080 ti. you Facepunch fix ur ing game and ban cheaters faster.,Rust

2018-01-20,0,0,378,True,Not Recommended,Rust was more fun in the past before all these new systems came out but the real reason the game isn't very good isn't because of gameplay it's actualy the problems the dev's still have not fixed for example if you have a computer with just a slightly lower gpu than the game your computer won't run the game very well and tend's to crash multiple times. If you have a good computer with an expensive gpu unit then by all means play the game but if you don't have perfect gpu then don't even try playing the game rust will continue to freeze and crash until you give up on it. Like it has done to be and there is no current fix to this problem except buy a gpu upgrade. (gpu upgrades for rust cost around 200 dollars if you want one that can run it) (the game cost's 20 usd) don't waste your money on a new gpu upgrade.,Rust

2017-01-04,0,0,3217,True,Recommended,I bought this game last January (and have 2 290 hours) so I have to say it's a pretty good game but I feel there are some conditions that have to be met prior to buying the game for maximum enjoyment. If you plan on playing alone you're most likely not going to enjoy this game you'll find yourself being trampled on by huge 4+ person clans with no sympathy or being ripped apart while farming for materials. Progression alone is nearly impossible unless you're experienced or lucky. There are a few PvE and roleplay servers but they aren't highly populated and a majority are private. My personal experience has been great but I play with a group of 5 8. Just know that this game takes a few friends and will take time to be successful as it takes more than a few hours to get to end game. In terms of development facepunch is making wonderful progress and is actually listenening to the community's desires (maybe even a little too much ( ing dumb rhinocrunch and his toxic followers)). In short great game but be prepared to get your penetrated if you play alone.,Rust

2018-01-30,0,0,575,True,Not Recommended,I played some hundreds of hours on this game .. I enjoyed playing games very much I would recommend this game is a bit more powerful computer etc .. The game I enjoyed it is such a refinement and also very addictive .. But what makes this game very disappointed ... I bought this game very good as I wrote but after some quiet hours I came to the VAC ban account ??? .. Yes I got a ban illegally and I can not understand why this can not be solved? It just has been introduced so that we just give the ban and let it enjoy any explanation or proofs. Well I do not recommend this game about those unreasonable bans. Otherwise quite fun,Rust
2017-08-12,0,0,320,True,Not Recommended,This game is really good but the optimization ing sucks. You will have more hours trying to fix fps than playing the actual game. They update the game every week add new stuff and they even say they optimize it here and there but it got worse and worse they dont optimize its a huge lie. Its really sad that this game is actually unplayable for me because i really like it. I have gtx 970M 8gb ram and i7 4710MQ. I usually have 40 fps on lowest if im lucky and i get fps drops every 30 meter i run. It drops harder than a ing meteor it goes from 40 to an extraordinary 5. Its not viable for pvp to have low fps in this game which pvp is this games core gameplay.Also dont buy this game to have a peacefull survival experience 70% of people in rust will kill you on sight.Fix your game its garbage.,Rust

2016-08-22,0,0,571,False,Recommended,great game 8 out of 10. Developers are still doing a lot to improve the game. There's an update almost every week. Facepunch is doing a great job.Tip get some friends to play it with because it's a lot harder if you're playing solo. Also don't buy if you can't handle to lose all your stuff overnight especially in the beginning. This is something you just got to be able to accept in this game though I don't really mind it too much. Raiding and getting raided is part of the game. You can ofcourse play it smart and/or build a strong base to prevent such things from happening. It's just really enjoyable. Do note that this game is quite time consuming you can't just play it for a few hours forget it for a couple of days and expect everything is still there. Especially with the new upkeep system. There are ofcourse the modded servers for those who wish for a faster progression. But most of all don't trust anybody!,Rust
2017-04-27,0,0,2363,True,Recommended,Brilliant! Best game on steam.. I literally cannot stop playing it and for the price.. Well... Worth every single penny. OPbviously it has it's negatives like all games do however the positives are greater and therefore you are literally guaranteed to have a good experience. I would suggest playing with friends as playing solo can be frustrating to say the least. With weekly updates and improvments this game makes for a great buy. Do it you won't regert it!,Rust

Rust Reviewso after my experiences with playing rust this is what i've come up with.Pros Fun with friends Lots of content so you won't get bored It's not P2W Raiding is fun Meeting nice randoms that won't KOS Large variety of items Sleeping bag systemCons EXTREMLY TOXIC PEOPLE limit on authorization takes a long time to smelt takes long to get stacked with good loot extremly graphic heavy and not optimal for most pc's long loading times for people with bad hard drives food is very scarce if you don't live next to roads or supermarket/gas station scrap farming takes a while attack helicopters have too much health and you should be able to shoot the driver or gunner isn't beginner friendly fresh water is hard to get when starting doorcampersSummary Even though there are lots of cons i have put on this list rust is a good game overall. you may studder alot (if you have a bad hard drive) but the gameplay makes up for it. Rust has really good art/animation and the character hitboxes aren't t like some other games. If they decide to optimize rust it would bring in alot of new players to the game. Rust is on my top list of games to play with friends and games to play when bored. Just the fact that rust has endless possibilites just makes the games alot longer lasting. The build system is the main thing i love about rust. The variety of items you can use to build just makes the game so much better because of the fact that you arent limited to one way of building a base. When to buy Usually you want to buy rust on sale but if you think that you can't wait i wouldn't say don't buy it when its not on sale but it is alot more worth if its on sale.

2018-03-30,2,1,31,False,Not Recommended,One of the worst games on steam. The community is toxic. The game is utter fps stutter garbage that looks like after someone stepped in it. The devs deserve the electric stool for making this piece of game. Everyone who likes playing rust is either mentally ill or H.P Lovecraft. you Facepunch Studios and you Valve for not having a quality check on games that can be sold on Steam. (凸 ʖ )凸Edit 1 Nvm just remembered they made Garrys Mod. sry Facepunch studios.The game mechanics and looks are pretty good its just that the community has changed and thats not such a bad thing. New people get to play the game and it is a hardcore survival sim. So yeah back in the day it was Sims with real people. But now its just Kill or get killed. If you dont have teammates its gonna be even harder. If you like raging and putting alot of effort into nothing then yes this is a good game but otherwise no.Edit 2 This game makes you want to take a knife and drive to the guys house that killed you then tie him to a chair and slowly cut his arms and legs open until blood is flowing down his body. Then unskin him and push a hook through his jaw and hang him from the ceiling. After that It makes you want to shoot nails into his body with a nailgun until he dies but before that it makes you want to cut open his eyeballs and smear into his eyesockets.

They decided it was a good idea to do a full game release without making patches. Through the release cheaters took over the entire game and the last result was to start banning players hardware.

The ak 47 is much harder to learn than the thompson I highly recomend the thompson to be your starter gun. Waterpipe and 2 3 crossbows is a very good combo with the right knowledge you can kill a full geard guy. And get the easy loot. Start bow raid early in the game and make larger raids when you have the rescouses. When you have found a base to raid. Do it qick in and out. Tou don't want to get counter raided that sucks. Always take a look on the base that you are raiding before you bring the explosives. Always make a raid base to respawn in if you die and stash loot.,Rust

The game itself takes around 5 10 mins to launch on lowest graphics and when I do manage to ge to the main screen the game stops responding. After a solid 15 mins of me playing on my phone the game decides to respond again and I try to join an offical server only to have my entire computer freeze up and all my applications stop responding. I don't recommend this game to anyone who can't run a game on low settings. 1/10 Rating,Rust
2016-01-05,0,0,1642,True,Not Recommended,Great idea for a game. Sadly the community ruins it. And the Devs like it that way. Ive tried writing a couple negative reviews before but they are obviously controlled for this game because they never actually posted. First raiding is way too easy in this game. Ive played alot and i can say i raid people within minutes of starting a fresh server. Unfortunately the youtube videos you see of raiding makes it look so cool but the truth is the only raiding done on this game is done while your offline. type f1 and status and boom you can see whos logged in or logged off. Theres no way to make friends seeing as everyone KOS's in this game. And then thinks theyre a boss cuz they killed a naked with a bolt action and a group of friends. lol people these days ) There are noob friendly servers but they are all just cheap tricks to get noobs in and steal their with more ease than on a regular server.,Rust

2016-07-21,1,1,12,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. Now I'm going to be 100% honest with this sort of review. Are you ready?I've never played a game that made me so angry I could cannibalize my own hands and eat them. Being a new player the new XP system is rather helpful although on the reset I spent 3 4 hours building a house with a random Swede that I met in game. We joked and laughed about how people would have C4 soon and probably come blow up out below average house and steal all our spears.10 minutes later we hear a knock at the door ""who is that?"" I ask politely to which I hear back "" ING OPEN THE DOOR MEN OR WE'LL IN' BLOW YOUR WALLS UP"". Me and the Swede laughing to ourselves thinking ""Ha.. It's just reset no one has C4"". BOOOOOM!The ing wall comes down and in come two s full armoured to the teeth only an hour or two after reset (Offical servers might I add). Killed us and our half naked bodies to get a few spears and some wood/stone. I lay there dying on the floor only to see one of them remove their armour and furiously teabag what I can only presume was my face since I could see some female snatch slamming down on the screen.Lovely.On the upper hand the XP system and exploration is fun. 95% of the community are toxic little turds but you run into the odd gem who just wants to be friends and build together and hopefully not die. It doesn't matter what you have you'll both die. You'll die. It doesn't matter whether it's 60 seconds in 60 minutes or 60 hours in.. You'll die like the es you are.The crafting and building system is beautiful some of the player made structures look amazing and you would think they where generated on the map when you first look at them. This review is going to be positive just because the game is some what fun regardless of how much you die.Here watch my first time playing and judge for yourself First Experiences Playing Rust ProsGreat XP / Leveling system (still a little buggy)In game crafting and building is excellentman made structures look awesome in fact the full game looks beautifulYou can't run away from bearsEveryone starts equalConsDeath is comingNaked people gang up on you with rocksBears run faster that a fighter jet and you cannot escape their fury.95% of the people that play this game are br&gt Confusing crafting menu for new playersDon't lose your rock because getting another is a pain in the (maybe not now with the new system)",Rust

2017-06-27,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,"NOTE This review is for casuals gamers who may play after work for a few hours maybe once or twice a week. Some updates might have occurred since I last played the game so take my comments with a grain of salt.Now to be fair I downloaded/purchased the game without doing any prior research or reading into the community or game mechanics. So my suggestion if you are on the fence do some reading and gauge the community and game for yourself. The community can be ruthless. I couldn't survive long enough to make myself a map before a squad of kids came trolling over the horizon with their assault rifles shooting everything in sight. Now as I previously stated I am a casual gamer. Because of Rust's game dynamics that essentially makes it nearly impossible for players like me to succeed in this game. For example I spent a few hours playing one night and once my friends and I were finally were able to create a seemingly secure house in a remote portion of the map we logged off for the night. Well not a day later we log on and someone had already killed all of us while we were gone and took over our structure. So hours of work were for nothing. Because of the inability to save progress play PvE or ensure all of your progress isn't ruined overnight it really makes this game unenjoyable for someone like myself who may be looking to just goof around with a few friends. I could bore you with an even longer review but instead I'll finish up with my Pros &amp Cons List. I hope this helps someone to make a conscientious decision on whether or not to purchase this game or not. Pros +Gameplay mechanics are pretty simple+Controls and combat mechanics are intuitive+If you have a lot of friends to play with you can have a lot of fun+Graphics are very goodCons Customization. Your character's gender &amp features are auto generated. Community can be frustrating for casual gamers. If you don't login frequently you will likely be raided and lose most if not all progress No PvE capabilities If you aren't playing with a group most of the time you will be treated as prey and will be hunted down by groups of people No ""Noob"" servers to help newer players get acclimated to the game.In short the game has a ton of potential. But unless are a hardcore gamer and/or plan on spending countless hours each week grinding in the game it might not be for you as it wasn't for me.",Rust
2017-06-08,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,This Game started out good and if it werent poor decisions and updates by the developer I would recommend The main issue being that they limit your gaming experiance by forcing you to play as a characyter you are set as with no way of changing it yep its stuck with your steam id. But to be honest this wouldnt be much of a problem if it werent for the fact that when the community spoke out against this the developers pretty much said they dont care and you could deal with it if you don't like it because guess what you they already have your money. on top of that the gun play is poor as are most of the other game mechanics.

So we swap servers because we didn't want to deal with hackers only for me to take 31 minutes total to load in and they swapped to seige because they died. I eventually got to a point where i was collecting wood and sulfur to create a base and a hazmat suit wearing random runs up to me screaming the n word after killing me/t bagging. Keep in mind the servers i joined i made sure they had atleast 5x the loot and no griefing/toxic behaviors that was kept together by mods. This game is t toxic as hell unplayable when trying to just start off fresh (EVEN AFTER A SERVER WIPE) and it was a complete waiste of the 17 bucks i got it for when it was on sale.

Trolls and s are everywhere and good hearted people are few and far between and constantly mocked trolled bullied and killed by everyone else. Griefing is basically allowed maybe even encouraged and players can destroy your house if they want. If you exit a server your character stays on the server and ""sleeps"" meaning that while you are gone players can easily break into your home kill you and take all your hard earned stuff. No one treats it as a survival game they treat it as a first person shooter and WILL kill you without warning or reason. Also with the ""decay"" game mechanic after not very long your house will fall apart by itself too unless you are constantly maintaining and repairing it which costs a lot to do.

2016-02-16,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,I tried to have fun in this game for a while with a friend but we kept getting killed by anyone we passed by. The official servers are filled with large clans that dominate all the other players and even the community servers have their far share of 12 year olds running around with ak47s.Dont buy this game its great only if you have a large number of friends who are willing to play this game often. Even then it seems like you have to start building a base when the servers have their monthly or biweekly resets in order to have a chance at being successful. Otherwise huge castles and giant towers dominate every inch of the map making it impossible to build a house for yourself. It took me and my friend about 30 minutes into our two house building projects to get found by squads of people with ak47s who killed us and looted everything.This game is extremely not friendly towards new players so i would advise anyone looking to buy a game to look elsewhere. While you will be trying to harvest small amounts of resources the richest players can often be seen trading some of the rarest materials in the game in chat as if they were nothing.In short either you have already been playing this game for a while and have a clan that spends its time shooting people for fun or you shouldnt bother playing.

2015-03-27,1,1,813,True,Recommended,"Leaving a review for both parts of the game.TLDR two games for the price of one hell yeah! (Quit complaining oldies. Sincerely a fellow oldie.)Rust Legacy review Perfect for nostalgia not so perfect for actual playing. The servers are far too unpopulated for my liking but if that's your thing than it could still be a great game. The gunplay and fighting in general is definitely more intense in the Old Rust however since hackers flooded into the game it's hard for people (myself included) to not call hacks at times. This game is honestly amazing IMHO. 10/10 would reccomend Naked Man Rock Smash Bros. to anyone. I could an entire game on this day and still have a great time.New(Current) Rust If you played Legacy Rust back in the day the transfer over to this version can be hard and almost intolerable. Don't give up though. It gets really fun once you adjust to the differences and accept the fact that it's a different game. The graphics are obviously vastly greater than Legacy graphics and the Official servers are actually moderated (HALLELUAH). The gunplay is slightly less intense but it's honestly more realistic. You can't get shot 3 times in real life and just run behind a rock and use a green box to heal yourself back to Superman Mode. No in New Rust every shot matters.If you get sprayed chances are you're dead if not then you're hobbling off with next to no health hoping that they took pity on your poor poor soul. The building on this version is far more customizable and complex which is a double edged sword to the community. Honestly I enjoy it though it brings so many more tactical options into the game. A HUGE and yes I mean huge difference in the game is that food is actually important in this one. ""Hold up wait food can be important?"" Yes and it is. In old Rust you would find yourself with hundreds of ""chicken"" breasts and the occasional cat food can. On this version you will find yourself actually having to hunt for animals instead of seeing a crowd of them out in the field. The maps on this version are procedural as opposed to the same map. This can make finding your buddies harder and getting lost easier. But that's awesome. It truly ups the survival aspect by a lot. All in all this game is just as great as old Rust as long as you weren't an old Newman or if you bear through the beginning critiques that you will have. 10/10 would reccomend New Naked Man Rock Smash Bros. to anyone.",Rust

2018-06-24,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"While I do like some of the core mechanics I am not a fan of the graphics of this game. They aren't bad and I do appreciate it when devs attempt to make things look realistic however this looks both realistic and unappealing. I also really don't like the build system very much. It is pretty limited and too modular based. Ironically I didn't run into that many spawn campers that I see people complain about all the time perhaps that's because I didn't get super salty and cry when I got killed... instead I just said ""gg"" and moved on so they left me alone.But either way I can't recommend this game for its full price. I'd put it at about a $15 worth.One thing I will say in this game's defense is that I have a mid range PC and it runs fine. I think the issue a lot of people have is not enough RAM people trying to play new games with less than 16GB of ram and stuff. If you are trying to game with less than 16GB of ram then you deserve for games like this to not run properly. By this day and age it is very easy to get up to that amount of RAM and I simply don't understand people trying to play these games with only 4 or 8GB of ram. It doesn't make sense. 16GB has been standard for a few years now. Also you must have a half decent connection of at least 50 MB/sec which is still way below par these days but it will get you through.",Rust

2019-01-15,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,This game is a huge piece of and a complete waste of time. You can get started or even last longer than a hour until you get raided and killed repeatedly by people who started earlier. Wherever you go you are attacked and raided by the same ing people that have access to guns and explosives. After hours of waiting and collecting resources you reach a point where you craft metal and armored walls but it doesn't do because they just destroy in a couple minutes. The crafting is horrid and not thought out. Half the you build you can't be moved unless you join a modded server or destroy it and most of those servers are filled with s that hunt people down. I played on five different servers and the same happens. You find some resources and build a small room to keep your items. You build wood doors and locks to keep things protected until someone comes along and destroys it and loots you. So you decide to start again and reach metal doors and locks and the same happens. Rinse and repeat people with better gear and more people destroy your *This game is a waste of time and the payoff doesn't amount to When you finally reach a large base and full equipment what now? Nothing you become the s that kill noobs and raid because this game offers nothing else. The people that appreciate the game or love are the ones that constantly raid and hunt because at that point you are unstoppable. So this game and its community.+ I love survival games and rarely complain about games like this but at this point the game turned into a pvp deathmatch with noobs getting caught in the middle of all the trash that game attracts.,Rust

This may be me but i'm willing to bet it's not.I have wired connection. and get 100 ping which is still pretty high but i can deal with it.But then the game will spike to like 800 ping.Also the community is pretty toxic in my opinion However that's not the developers fault it's just people.

2013-12-18,0,0,6,True,Recommended,NEEDS MORE OPTIONS TO CHANGE THE GRAPIHCS DOWN. Personally i don't have a great gaming setup but i can run most games i thought this wasn't going to be a very big game so it wouldn't lag much but it gives out a maximum fps of 10 on the lowest resolution. i know this is just because of my crappy setup but if there we options to turn graphics down it would definitely help people with setups like meh. also a single player would be useful i know it's basically a multiplayer game but some sort of single player where you can have options to spawn stuff in or change things in the game and get used to it would be a great add on. on a positive note the graphics look amazing the actual gameplay is great the whole survival aspect and the way you have to get all the resources is one of the best survival things i've seen in a while. Definitely buy this game if you have a great pc and can run it but even if you can't you should still get it ),Rust

2014-01-19,0,0,66,True,Recommended,I was logged on to the server just as it got wiped. Everything reset. A fresh start for everyone. It was my chance to shine without getting cut to bits by high tech level bandits and raiders.As I was working I had heard repeatedly over voice comms about a player who had gotten the first airdrop of the game which contained a military shotgun and M4 rifle. The highest tier weapons available.During one of my runs to the radioactive military zones I happened to run straight past the player who had found the weapons. He fired first and we exchanged shots. Luckily he wasn't carrying his big guns or I would have died instantly. Also lucky while my health dropped dangerously low I didn't bleed so I was able to make it out okay.I watched him for a while as he moved back to his encampment making a mental note of the part of the road he had set up beside for future use.Much later in the game and without a single player vs player shot fired since that point I had managed to deck myself out in full leather armor (One less than top tier) but still had only the basic cobbled together firearms. I really needed a weapon. I used two C4 to break into the guy's house. It was only logical. The weak are preyed upon by the strong and he had fired first all those hours ago. Breaking into houses is the whole point of C4. The wooden wall fell and stole two top tier weapons the M4 and Shotgun. As I ran gunshots pinged at my feet but I kept moving. I continually checked to ensure that I was not followed. Half an hour later my friend was chopping wood out in a field when he started taking fire. He ducked behind a tree but he didn't have any weapons on him aside from a pathetic bow. I yelled at him to stay alive and keep them distracted and I was able to nearly take down one guy before my friend died. I had taken two hits with a bow which nearly killed me but I got onto the other side of the cover the bowman was firing from. I took out my stolen shotgun and was very lucky to kill him in the first shot.I fired another shot at the other guy then pulled out the M4 but got killed before I managed to take him down. Luckily this was right beside my house and I respawned inside grabbed an MP5 from a crate and ran outside again. The surviving attacker was looting a corpse and I took him down. My friend helped me gather up all the loot from our two bodies and the bodies of the attackers and everything from inside the house and move it up into a stash in the mountains.When I logged back on three hours later to check on things I spawned in a field and I knew that while I was offline my character had died. I ran north to check. My house had a hole in the side of it which I was fully expecting. That's why I moved everything out everything. The mountain stash had gotten its door blown off and every last item had disappeared. Just as I was checking the last crate for any scraps I heard footsteps and I was incredibly conscious of the fact that one of our attackers had respawned and watched us take the stuff into the mountain. I had nothing to defend myself with. A man in black armor entered the shelter and blew me away with a shotgun.They started a war over a wooden wall and two weapons they replaced in a heartbeat.It is a war they won by good intelligence but also by attacking a defenceless sleeper.They have made an enemy they will live to regret.The Axe has tasted blood.,Rust

2017-01-02,1,1,7,True,Recommended,"PROS Good PVP game teaches you about lawlessness. Had our starter crap house raided xD. Also nice graphics.CONS Very stip learning curve no tutorials at all very unforgiving for newbies especially trying to figure things out without a BLOODY ""TRAINING OR TUTORIAL GUIDE WTF"" BUGS.... BUGS EVERYWHERE LIKE LITERALLY No clip bears Deers running at 0.1 second in a 90 degree angle to a stip rock _ map is kinda small... depending on the server I found most villages to be too crowded could use more optimization for better performance especially loading the terrain. game stutters like hell there should be less resources all you do is go out and loot some... garbage. Literally people have tons of C4 now wtf needs more ""ARMA"" like combat maneuvers and features.How long has this game been in development? People told me 3 years and it still is in Alpha. Dafuq? Right now I'll give it a 7/10 at best. Devs needs to work better for this game. Has a lot of potential. It's just a free for all right now with no sense of direction. Yes base building role playing and raiding is there but it could have been executed better than just spawning you randomly on a beach surronded by tall fortresses and you get gunned down by auto weapons xD.",Rust
2018-02-07,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,Crashed my Game 4 times Now i am not sure if my PC is just bad or something but until then im giving this game a thumbs down.So first of all i didn't even get to play this game because it took a while for the game to even load but once i found myself in a map my game would instantly shut down tried again the 2nd time and had the same result then the next 2 times it crashed my entire computer. So im just gonna get a refund i think the problem is not the game but my PC might not be able to run it. So if i ever get my hands on a decent computer i might pick this up again and then actually play the game.,Rust

2016-04-30,0,0,86,True,Not Recommended,2 months ago I decided to buy rust with a friend because we seem funny. We played the first 4 days almost 10 hours a day then slowly I started to get bored with this game because we were robbed every day had to change servers daily and practicly has started to dislike increasingly more until he reached the point of sitting in the library. In the game i had just over 30 fps with the graphics on low although my computer has minimum requirements and basically i didn't understand anything from the game and i don't even want to talk about the lag spikes. So as a conclusion a great concept but it's bad because of the community very poorly optimized and if you are not in the gang of at least 5 or more people is not funny at allIf you want to buy this game and you are not sure i hope that this review helped you in making the decision.5/10,Rust

2017-04-15,0,0,1114,False,Recommended,Rust it's a good game however like everygame it has its ups and downs. The game allows you to express your creativity and show off your pvp skills. However there is a downside to this as people tend to become extrememly toxic with the pvp in some servers you will come across extremely sweaty players who kill anything that moves even fresh spawns. Rust is a great game and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to play a survival game but they just have to be ready to be murdered and make mistakes while learning the game.,Rust

2018-10-28,0,0,49,False,Not Recommended,This game is tedious and unrewarding.It literally promotes clan and very large groups only making it impossible for solo/duo (but even trio) playing.The only palpable goal is to obtain a full leather vest with a wolf head and a bow and you inevitably always end up against people with rifles and bazookas and c4 explosives. There's too much difference and it doesn't matter whatever point you choose to settle and give yourself a minimum time to at least aim to have some fire weapon. We struggled for hours and hours being a duo I can't even imagine doing stuff if you're alone.It's literally unplayable.EXTRA a non largely significant feature I also didn't appreciate one bit is the lack of choice (even at least once per account) for your character's gender. There are a bunch of players who really don't care but there's aswell a large part that doesn't even open the game because of this.

It's so horribly optimized that it crashes or stops responding during the initial load screen. I sat in the load screen 15 minutes only to have it crash. Multiple tries. It's not worth trying further... doubt it's that good anyway. Playing on a i7 6700k 9gb RAM and 1080 gtx with a Evo SSD. No reason for such performance issues.,Rust

Uncheck the 'windowed' box and 3440x1440 shows up in the list of available resolutions. Cool! Now I can actually give this game a try. I'm sad to see there is no single player mode though. I'm not really into multiplayer only games. I dig the music though!EDIT 2 This game can be very addicting. I chose to play in one of the very few PvE servers (no killing of other players) so that I could spend my time building. And then I learned that while this game is still in Alpha the servers are being wiped every 3 months. So I guess I'll have my fun until the next server wipe and then unfortunately I'm done until the wipes stop happening which will probably be once this game is officially released (could be a few years). It's a great game and I can't give it a negative review just because of the 3 month time wipe. It's in Alpha so that is par for the course.,Rust

Most of us knew the XP system was goign to change the game and would need to be tweaked and now it's being tweaked to combine both XP unlocks and temporary research unlocks to try and please both crowds.My review is half as a player and half as someone who appreciates a good game engine. I also suck at PVP horribly suck so keep that in mind as well.I really like Rust I really like the game engine and how flexible it can be with supported mods. Rust can be anything from a brutal PVP game to a full PVE RPG depending on the settings and mods (thinking of Oxide here) used. The worst thing about Rust is the playerbase so they say but I've found some community servers with a solid bunch of people who make playing this game fun. When you run rust and the server list pops up get away from the official servers as fast as you can click on community or modded and try a few out.For my money this is one of my best early access purchases.,Rust

2016-10-01,0,0,44,True,Not Recommended,This is a PVP game. If you are hoping to roleplay a peaceful life not going to happen.I joined a medieval RP No kill on sight server and helped a friend build up a great community.We grew quite big and as a part of our trust system we forbid locks on all houses that arent shops.Somebody didnt care went into my house and took everything. So I went gathering and after aquiring around 5000 wood and the same amount of stone some clan showed up and took it all from me again. This is frustrating and there is nothing you can do about it because roleplaying as a bandit justifies you to take everything and kill everyone.The community is ing toxic whenever you join a server someone is arguing making racist comments or just insulting people without a reason.You can get raided or killed without a reason at any time by dozens of people that are in a clan undoing everything you did for the last 20 hours. Building up is fun but it always ends the same way. Killed by a bigger clan. A lone wolf or simply a nice person can't survive not even on roleplay server.Creating a single server and playing it as a survival game is also not possible right now.This clan hierachy is anchored deep inside the roots of Rust and can never be removed. I myself do not want to be in a clan at all time robbing begineers and breaking houses while offline ergo this game is not for me.2/10 works well but community and not a game for someone like me who would rather play a good singleplayer game because you can not be killed on sight.,Rust

2016-04-11,0,0,108,True,Recommended,Even though this game is still in Alpha or Beta it is still a great game to play on your free time. If you love the building and survival aspect in Minecraft then you'll love this game if you love the survival / hunting / PvP aspect of DayZ then I think you'll like this game. Also it's made by the same people who made Garry's Mod and many other great games. I do recommend you purchase this game espicially if you have lots of friends who own this game.

2014-06-20,0,0,43,True,Not Recommended,This game was fun at first until you played it for 10 minutes. You're going to die a lot of times in this game within 5 minutes. You might think hey! Dying isn't that bad right you noob! Well that's just the core but dig deeper. The npcs in this game are never really a problem unless it's like 2 wolves on you. But it's the player. As soon as they get in range of you they are going to kill you for no reason which is annoying because it's ever single player on every server. The blueprint idea is stupid you need to find blueprints by killing infected wolves and bears which are usually in packs and when you do kill one it's rare you even find blueprints to get high tech weapons. Everyone on this server has like pistols and m4s while you have a rock and stone hatchet if you're lucky if you didn't die within the first 5 minutes. The 2nd problem is griefers. You need a place to keep storage the only place is in your house which can be easily destroyed in 10 minutes with a stone and 30 seconds with c4 and all your progess on the game is gone. They should only be able to destroy your house when you're online that would make more sense. And if you go on vacation your house will be destroyed when you come back so hey be ready to play this game everyday if you want to keep your progress it's awfully flawed. I'd give it a 4/10 just because it has potenital and it's fun at times and if you play with your friends you will have a blast. There should be newbie towns where new players can gather resources without being killed by wannabe squeaker bandits. There's also a lot of hackers that usually never get banned they have aimbots and esp while you have a stone. And one more thing when you place your base down you better haev a good memory where it is because if you forget it only way to get back there is to die and lose all your resources. Heres my solutions Be able to toggle between PVE and PVP modes once you toggle PVP mode you can't untoggle it for 3 hours. You can't destroy houses at all unless the house is inactive. Get rid of blueprints or make them easier to find. Make a map system. Add a buddy system and a teleport system so players can easily find each other instead of walking 30 minutes to find each other which is unlikely since you will die within walking 2 minutes. Create small towns where players can live and which are safezones. Make a better anti hacking system Get rid of night It makes the game unplayable When a player is known as a bandit which is when he kills a lot of players within a small timelimit his name should be visible in a long range so players will know to avoid them like 100 meters his name will pop up in red.,Rust

2016-01-15,0,0,2163,False,Recommended,I've seen a lot happen in rust. Met many great people now friends thanks to this game but also a lot of bad people too the game is 50/50 with me on people that play it that you meet. It's hard solo but can be fun thanks to so many changes in the game to help solo players. Might be hard to find a server with a community on it of somewhat friendly people that won't kill you on sight but other than that the game is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed for many hours and time sometimes can pass by quickly. Overall I do love rust and I hope it continues to be amazing in its own way I'm so happy to see it out of Early Access and its been one wild ride in this game. This may not seem like a review its more like my expression of how I love and see the game I don't recommend this game for the faint of heart but I DO recommend this game for those that want how to put this an interesting challenge in their life. That's the best way I can put it I hope the many future players of Rust from here on out like the game for what it is and the good side of it I hope they meet the good people and not see the bad side of rust hardly at all if hopefully not at all though it will happen eventually.

You can build make friends defend your homemade base or village rob people run around naked beat things with rocks. This game is hard to dissapoint where does it fall short at the moment? Customization.) Graphics 8.5/10(The graphics look good the issue is the way they move people stutter as they walk animals do the same. The way your character interacts with the enviroment is a little finnecky but then again this is still in alpha the weapons look nice on the players screen however on other's screens all the weapons look like an m4 this is a nuisiunce since an shotgun is more dangerous up close than an m4 we should be able to tell the difference. The graphics do look amazing though you'll need a good computer to run this baby.) Customization 5/10(You can not customize your character at all. This is a big issue for me I hate to see everyone running around as the same person you can however ""Though limited"" can add scopes lasers and what not to weapons and you can also customize the building you're creating by placing items where you like them.) Servers 7/10 (This is a big one the servers hold up most of the time however they are always being attacked by people using DDOS for servers that don't have the protection on them and there are thousands of servers many are different but there is no way to search the servers and like I said before if you off a kid that knows how to DDOS prepare for your whole server to be unable to play for an hour.) Replayability 10/10 You can't get bored of playing this game everytime you log in it's something different since people can build where they want and do what they want then it' leaves the world open to endless possibilites.EXAMPLE We decided to let two people into our base to research C4 for 1000 metal fragments. Well they researched it then they stuck the c4 to the side of our base and blew a hole in. One was shot with a shotgun the other accidently ran into spikes. But it was new and interesting.) Sound Quality 7/10(The sounds match what they should be in this game however they are not high end sounds. Atleast when you hit a wall with a an axe in this game it sounds like you're hitting wood rather than bullets being shot at you ""DayZ"".)My Specs MOBO Asus crosshair V formula ZCPU FX 9590 4.7ghz 8 coreGPU Sapphire Radeon 7970 (3GB &amp 356bit)RAM G.Skill ripjaw 8gb 1300mhzDISPLAY 60 inch LG plasma tv 1080P What the game lacks It needs a party system.it needs more ways to gather food... farming/fishingIt needs more items to help survival not just guns.

No character customization whatsoever. Your gender is picked at random. You may scream all you want developers won't listen. It's intentional. Sure I won't mind spawning as a black guy but randomizing your gender... I mean whoever is developing this probably agrees that having a man's voice coming from a black/asian woman's body is ugly... Your algorithm must be pretty HORRIBLE in randomizing people's in game character based on Steam ID... Requires large time sinking for it to be rewarding. You also need a BIG group of ACTIVE friends. Needs re balancing. Resource gathering and crafting needs a huge overhaul.

I would recommend if you have too much time spent on the computer and want a forced break. 10 My family have finally accepted me back out of 10.,Rust
2014-09-10,0,0,111,True,Not Recommended,This game is full of hackers. Everywhere. There hasnt been any game development since they released the early access. The Developers got their cash grab and completely abandoned the game. While it IS fun when you have a private server you rent it becomes a 24/7 babysitting job to keep all the kids Russians and 3rd world hackers from destroying everything while you are not on the server..... It has the most hackers of any game I have ever seen and the Devs do not seem to care.,Rust

2016-04-19,14,22,8,True,Not Recommended,The game is incredibly boring especially at the beginning where you expect me to whack trees with a stone and expect to be having the time of my life. And then once I have sufficiently whacked trees with a stone (top notch entertainment that is) some little terd comes along and murders me with a stick and then cackles like a bloody maniac for 15 minutes (yes high hopes for the next generation indeed). If you do happen to get off the ground get some armor a weapon and a few of your friends (preferably the ones that are jerks their type seems to be addicted to this game) then you're all set for some fun murderous antics right? Well murderous antics or not fun is not part of the equation. You'll walk up with an M4 and shoot some dude walking around with nothing but a medium sized rock and a pair of tattered trousers to their name and kill them. You'll have your little dance of glee (the d bag dance as I call it) and move on. And then some other sods who have more gear than you or simply happen to flank you kill you and do THEIR variant on the dance of glee. Then you cuss...... and cuss...... oh yeah and cuss a little more. And then you lose your s**t once you find out you lost all your hard earned gear. Then you disconnect from the game unplug your computer and throw it haphazardly and hit your puppy. Then what have you got? A shattered PC and a puppy with internal bleeding and a broken rib cage. 20/100,Rust
2016-02-14,0,0,103,True,Recommended,fun af alright anyway theres a lot of servers to choose from and see what fits you whether you like getting there slowly and be rewarded or whatevs or just wanna get thousands of wood from 1 chop at a treethe community could be better. literally everyone will attack you so if you get the game just attack everyone back trust no oneno complains about the building at all i love it. sure people raid your stuff all the time since everything is raidable but that makes it more fun as you try to make a house that gives everyone a hard timewhat i hate about the inventory system is the fact you can't shift click to quickly move items and you just have to drag everything around (as far as i know i might just be stupid wouldn't be the first time)as far as i understand the procedural maps are generated randomly and the map are insanely big and it'll take you a long time to get from one point to the other which is a plus in my book. it's also not all empty theres deserts snow biomes forests normal plains and a lot of monuments with loot scattered all over the place9/10 go get it and bring friends cuz you wont find any here everyones an,Rust

2018-06-25,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,"I played this game for two and a half hours after buying it on sale for $8 and resorted to issuing for a refund. It's not worth your money whether it's at full price or on sale. I bought the game on a whim due to the sale I hadn't expected and I am genuinely glad I did not buy it like I had planned to when it was at full price.That being said It's impossible to play this game by yourself. Unless you're getting a group of three people or more don't plan on having a good time. I was excited to play this game and I gave it the benefit of the doubt despite my friend's warning but the PVP aspect of it turned out to be exactly how you'd expect. You can't create your own server for free that I'm aware of and trust me I looked after my first hour within the game. It's not that I would want to play solo because that's not fun but I would like to play with people who are cooperative and make the gameplay enjoyable. I don't enjoy playing games where my progress is thrown away because someone thinks it's funny to be toxic and kill you off without reason. Yes survival is the goal but it's BS when literally EVERYTHING is working against you.It's a shame because the game is beautiful and there's a lot to explore. However within the two hours that I played I died multiple times at the hands of other players even when I hadn't been approaching them. When I asked why and if it was even necessary they responded with and I quote ""it's Rust and you'll soon learn that everyone is an a**hole."" That was all I needed in order to make my final decision regarding the game. Because... seriously what's the point? Not to mention I asked for tips and was met with silence. I'm not asking for friendship or a marriage here.Other than the misery that comes along with the PVP aspect the loading time for the game itself is outrageous. While the main menu spends very little time opening accessing a server is a struggle in itself. I spent 15 20 minutes loading into two different servers both of which had a different number of active players and max players allowed within the server. It IS a loading issue I know this due to the fact that I had no issue once I was within the server and playing the game.For those of you wondering your player starts off completely naked (warning you do not get to choose your character's gender or appearance) yet there are hundreds of other players around who are better equipped than you that have been playing since the game's release. The game and even some reviews warns you about other newbies and their desire to kill you with your (and their) starting weapon a rock but the real threat is advanced players who are ... wait for it ... BORED. If they see that you're new they're quick to shoot you down for no reason. You'll get taunted you'll be offered no help and you'll end up annoyed after spending an hour or so gathering resources that you can't even retrieve after you die.A final note I do not recommend this game unless you have a large group of friends an immense amount of patience and money to throw away. If I wanted to play a game where I get intentionally killed for enjoyment and competition I'd buy PUBG.",Rust

2014-02-17,0,0,13,True,Not Recommended,I understand this is early access but this is just... Wow...I do not understand why the Unity engine was used for this game. The game looks horrible plays horrible and for now is horrible. The game itself isn't so good but the fact that the player fanbase is the way it is just makes this game even worse. There is no teamwork. No cooperation. There is no incentive to NOT kill another player on sight. There are no robbing people and holdups like there are in other games (DayZ). You're very unlikely to meet a random person and team up with them. Bashing with a rock seems to be the most effective way of communication with most players. Many times I've spawned in and immediately been shot dead. The sleeping aspect is neat I'll give this game that. You may have some fun if you have a firearm but that fun won't last long. The guns are a pain to look at they're hideous. You cannot hit anything past a few dozen yards. Clipping through players and animals when trying to fight them is a pain. This game is unfinished to the point that it isn't currently worth playing.Maybe with future updates it will be better but as of now I do not recommend purchasing this game.,Rust

I hate this game but find myself drawn back to it. This game can be peaceful at times and keyboard snapping infuriating at others. You will lose hours worth of progress to the worst of the player base who will talk in your ear the entire time you desperately attempt to stop them all while blowing up your and or your friends hard work. You ll find yourself blowing up the phones of any teammate you re playing with to come home and defend the base because you re on the verge of losing it.After all that I still have some amazing experiences in Rust. The PVP is phenomenal. It takes true skill to play this game against others at times and then you might get killed by a naked with a rock while you re fully geared. This is one of the rare few games that drama is almost guaranteed in.There is more drama betrayal trolling death destruction and more than your average daytime soap opera. So if you ask me if I can recommend this game to friends the answer is yes. An unapologetic yes. Misery loves company and there s nothing quite like the misery of Rust. There is no better way to play this game with friends! Just be careful making friends because there s nothing like putting trust into someone in this game and getting shot in the back!

But unless you're playing on a ghost town server you won't stand a chance of surviving long enough to craft more than a club or a spear. I've played plenty of open world games with PvP elements that possessed relatively amenable communities. It's not ""normal"" for people with assault rifles and body armor to blast naked dudes with nothing but rocks and an empty stomach. That just isn't a thing. But it is in Rust. I don't know if the game simply appeals to the hidden psychopaths among us or if it's just boredom but either way... it's not much fun. The game gives people an awesome opportunity to develop economies factions etc. but instead of recruiting new players every server I joined simply killed them for sport. It's not like you get anything for killing players that don't have diddly squat in their inventory either.At the end of the day I'm sure the game will appeal to some people. If you plan on playing with two or three friends for example Rust might not be too bad. But the game is a strange dimented thing I definitely can't see myself returning to it anytime soon.",Rust
2017-11-26,0,0,308,False,Recommended,"In my opinion this is the game above all games. Maybe not even a game but an experience.The thing that divides rust from other games is that you have something to lose. Now don't tell me about the battle royale games where you have something to ""lose"". Here you can lose almost everything you worked days / a fortnight on. Maybe even when you get something out in the open and are trying to get it back home you can still LOSE SOMETHING that you know matters. The developers are just amazing. Constantly listening to feedback from the community. Updates are extremley frequent.The only negative side is it's problematic learning curve. I sadly had to learn alone which i reccomend to avoid. Don't play alone at all. Especially on the official servers.",Rust

2017-11-28,0,0,794,True,Recommended,I've never got around to reviewing this game but i feel i need to.It really is fantastic. Definitely has some of the most caring developers of anything ive played. They truly listen to the community and experiment wisely without breaking the foundation of what Rust is at heart. Solid Updates WEEKLY. Check out their reddit if you're curious.Its a hard core pvp survival not for the faint of heart. You will get murked. Rust is merciless. But if you persevere through the t it will be totally worth the challenge.They say you can't play solo but I do quite often successfully. You just need to play on a solo or solo/duo/trio community server. Speaking of the community as a whole IS quite toxic but that doesnt mean everyone is. I've met plenty of good people in game. The game's depth comes with the experiences you encounter with other players as well as the building aspect. Building is definitely my favorite part and theyre starting to add more cosmetic items like carpets and chairs ect.Farm&gt Build&gt Loot&gt Upgrade&gt Roam. Not really in that order specifically but this is what you do in Rust. Sounds basic but it always tend to keep people interested week after week. You dont necessarilyTBC but is that all needed to understand this is real. good game. buy buy.,Rust

You will always lose from better geared players. You can be killed and all your gear looted when you are logged out without being able to protect it.

I have played many gruesome horror games and none of them had ever made me feel sick from horror. It is weird that rust induced that type of feeling in me. Rust is a game in which you look for resorces to build your house and hunt to survive. Doing this by yourself or with friends. One thing that you have to watch out for are other players. It's is easier to get resorces from others instead of collecting them yourself so most players will trick you into coming out of your home so they can steal your stuff. They might even break down your door... No online game has ever made me question human moral such as this one. Strip away rules and people/players can be ruthless... Unleashing your evil side in rust is easy and that is what makes this game so great.,Rust

2014-10-24,0,0,256,True,Recommended,Time to update my review for the new rust I liked the old rust (aka legacy) a bit better because of how buildings more secure (requiring C4) which make you feel more safe. I really don't like the idea of players being able to raid a base just by hitting a wall for 10 mins. I liked the idea of having c4 to break a wall in the old rust. Now in this new version building is alot more flexible. I LOVE IT. I can make my mansion that I always dreamed about and defend it. I also like the way that animals just plop on the ground when you kill them it's funny and kind of realistic. The only thing that kind of gets on my nerves is the random maps it's very impossible to find your friends. There could be a main map like in the new unturned and 7 days to die where there's a main map and the server owner could chose what map to host A random Gen or for example the main map of rust is called Rust Island. Now admins in the old rust finally are doing something about hackers unlike facepunch studios that still not doing anything about it. Like come on facepunch just doing something like everytime you launch the game make it where the launcher replaces all files except the config file to make hackers have a hard time to mod the game. Overall i love both versions and this game deserves more but STUPID HACKERS RUIN IT! I pretty sure hacking is a felony correct me if I'm wrong. I give this game a 9/10UPDATE 8/10/15A map was made to be official one and unique stuff has been added. Sadly the game specs caught up to me and I can no longer run this game still great game though. Rating stays.,Rust
2014-10-21,0,0,11,True,Recommended,Rust.... to say something about Rust. In short Rust is a fun survival. You can choose to play with your friends as a team or go solo and bout by yourself.

The updates are from hell and so bad that the latest one crashed Steam and glitched out Windows. I spent hours in an update loop that would crash Steam every time. About 30 reboots later I finally managed to uninstall this fiasco.I logged well over 400 hours on Rust (what's now called Legacy) which was a great game aside from the cheaters and 12 year olds screaming at you on the mic. Had they stuck with the original game design and just kept adding to that I'd still be playing and wouldn't be changing my review.This review is fair warning to anyone wanting to try this game out.

Frankly I don't understand why. maybe my computer is not good enough. It's a decent one not a high end one. But still I'll give this game more time untill my final reveiw on it. so far 3/10The building simulation is pretty intersting and fairly easy to using for anyone getting the materials however is lame unless its the server im on. I figured that if its a boulder then it should give stone right? well I spent almost 30 mins tring to find out thats not the case. At least the trees give you wood. More than likely its the server that made it that way. Building is very virsatil so far so thats a plus. So I will try another server as well. Till the next review guys...,Rust

2014-01-23,0,0,251,True,Recommended,"(Read edit below My issues have been resolved.) This game has so much potential. Sadly too much is missing for me to recomend this game yet. Once it's out of ""Early Access"" I believe this game will be the game of gods but it just needs so much work. My main complaint is that there is no Favorite Servers system. The history tab doesn't work half the time and the server list is a hassle to work with. Also I can't find my friends. Ever. I konw this is supposed to be a survival game and stuff but games like this are always more fun with friends. But I can never find them. There are no landmarks and everything looks the same making it impossible to find the people you wish to play with.

2016-05-20,0,0,21,True,Recommended,This is a short review after 16 hours. Honestly you dont need 100 hours to get a good idea and feel for the game. So I myself do not like getting killed looted and losing everything. You spend time gathering smithing crafting and it can all be gone in and instant. BUTThat is why you take a good look at available servers. They have PvE servers PvP servers and PvE with PvP zone servers. Take a good look around. My only beef with the game is that gets annoying is the server wipes they do. So if you spend time unlocking a bunch of stuff and building a fancy house it will all get wiped within a month or less.,Rust

2018-08-06,0,0,113,False,Not Recommended,Solo speaking here.Rust is fun enjoyable and an easy to sink many hours into game without getting bored. Optimisation is not perfect but neither is it bad. I am not really allowed to complain about it since my specs are not that great either(RX 460 2 GB Ryzen 3 1200 8 GB DDR4 3066 MHz). It's toxic comunity is like no other being awkwardly funny at times and giving you a rage at others. Being crossbowed to the face as a naked and yelling for mercy but only recieveing a lifeless shut the f*ck up can give you a good laugh. If you however dont get crossbowed to the face immediately and make some progress losing all that you achieved will get you real salty.The developers listen to the commuity. The changes they made show their attention to the subreddit the forums etc.The reason for this review being negative is because the game keeps ing crashing beyond acception. Not while playing those are only 20 seconds freezzes wich may get you killed. When does the game crah then? Let me tell you.Wanna use the exit game button? No. It will crash.Wanna cancel the loading screen using the dedicated cancel button? No. It will crash 90%.Wanna click anywhere on the screen while the game is loading? No. It will crash 100% of the time.Wanna change the f*ucking audio option from stereo to headphones? No. It will crash 100%.Wanna change graphics settings while in game? Please no. It will crash 50% of the time.Wanna click anywhere on the screen while graphics settings are being loaded? No. It will crash 100%.It's not that easy to just wait and not click because loading times are very very big and you allways feel like having to check if it crashed.I am sorry but the way this games loads it's stuff is bad.

Just spent most of my time waking up on the beach and attempting to find some resources before someone decided that they didn't like the fact that I existed and killed me. I musta missed the single player option either way. got a refund. I don't play dayz anymore because of that. Didn't realize that this was just as bad.

Speicifically there is one update that killed this game for me and many others. The blueprint update makes it hard for solo / duo players (especially if new to the game) to make advancments in there base. If they wanted to save this game they must make it more noob frienly and revert the Blueprints update.,Rust

Graphics looking amazing.Fps were just rubish for me even with this version before installing the game in my ssd just wanted to see the difference and while in some games there is non in this one the difference is huge. Fps go around 85/100 but I lock them at 80 for more smooth gameplay.Game feels a bit clunky now and then but mostly ok.Servers are not the best even official ones.I have had to verify the game files 2 times and reinstalled 1 also can t use msi afterburner or Rust wont launch but other games will work with no problems.Shooting in this game is still very bad compared to your regular fps but rust is not an fpsYes the community is toxic af but that makes it even more rewarding when you find that cool neighbour you can invite to your house or even trade with or share loot so he can research it and learn how to do it. He takes care of my home when I am offline and I do the same for him. Etc etc 08 12 2015 update.No until they change the VOIP system. Using steam voip is not cool IMO and it doesn t work fine for me. Will change this to a Yes if they change it again. Really good potential came back after a while of not playing it I think it needs more work and that is also obvious since the game is not finished. Still it is a good game and I believe that it is possible to have a lot of fun in its current state of ALPHA.This review is very old.,Rust

I don't get mad about it because i got used to starting from scratch over and over again. But i got better with every death. I found a new addiction with this game because i love the fact as soon as you stop playing the game your character is sleeping and vulnerable to everyone on the server. There are plenty of servers to join that will accomadate your play style. definitely worth the $20. I went from playing console to strictly this game just to see if i wake up in my house alive each time with my pookie bear by my side.

2018-01-05,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,I played this game for a few hours (5.5 h) and can say some positive and a lot of negative things Most of the players will kill you on first sight (especially the ones with good gear even if you just started and have nothing good collected or crafted). I mean it's no fun if you got killed repeatedly just after some minutes. Where is the fun when someone kills you with a riffle 20m away from you when you only have a stone to defend yourself? The world /map is huge but also empty and you ll spend a lot of time running around and there s nothing to collect or do. That s probably my taste but I don t like the menus. They are clumsy to handle and not very intuitive and confusing. You can t change into 3th person which is a great pity because some players prefer 3th person over first person. You can t create your character. Your appearance is determined by the game itself and depends on your steamaccount (probably name and other data from it?)+ I think the graphics are quite beautiful.+ If you want to play on a more peaceful server you can google one (PvE) and join it instead of the unfriendly mainstream servers.+ If you don t get killed by other players you can progress fast and build your own house / base and craft cool stuff.So all in all I don t continue to play this game. Maybe I ll check back later but for now the experience with it was more frustrating then anything else.,Rust

2018-01-16,0,0,175,True,Not Recommended,Great concept of a game absolutely terrible community. The game is nearly impossible to have fun with. Shoot on sight has ruined any sense of interaction this game wanted you to have. Now it's just s with rifles stalking beaches and shooting naked people as they spawn. Don't even try to ask anyone in the servers for help. One person will say they are coming to help and 8 will show up to try to kill everyone.Arguably this game could really be great. PvP is destroying the core player base and alienating any casual players since you can't play this game in 20 minute iuncrements. And you won't want to play more than that after you get killed repeatedly as you try to find your way in the game.Do not recommend.,Rust

I guess that's where most of the fun comes from in this game.But the real gameplay in my opinion is clunky.And personally I strongly dislike the graphics. No graphics aren't everything but they are a huge part of any survival game and in my opinion they're just nasty.That's all.,Rust

You guys can build forts and bases and gather resources to make a great realm in which you can use as a place to bring all the loot you have from exploring the maps. Unfortunately people who have lost control of their own (real) lives often play this game so they can feel good about themselves. You'll be attacked relentlessly especially at night and if your fort is not in a good spot (thats away from common travel routes YOU WILL GET RAIDED.

I didn't think such a high amount of suffering was possible in a video game until now. I had a more enjoyable time playing through Dark Souls without any online aid than I did playing rust.Since my original review I've returned to the game to find it has had massive improvements. The world looks a lot better and the scavenging is much less frustrating now that blueprints are no longer an issue. Although I would suggest clearer descriptions for armor pieces or maybe a guide for people on how to use the armor effectively.,Rust

2016-02-09,0,0,5621,True,Recommended,Where to even begin... Rust is that kind of game you can come home after a horrible day and beat your wife sort of thing. The plus part of the situation is you get away with it and it's quite alright! With the huge toxic community you can blow your fuse on anyone!Beginning with a rock and torch the world f***ing hates you. You run around naked and cold getting your butt beat by the terrain and these screeching kids who chase you across the map forever. Once you actually get started you're able to polish those guns and make the people around your area pay. Do you enjoy power? Do you enjoy the cries of others begging for mercy? Get Rust you can literally f*** anyone in the booty just for the fun of it. Highly recommended.,Rust

2016-11-08,0,0,619,True,Recommended,Best survival game I've ever played. Many survival games are either too hard and feel unfair or become too easy once you've figured out the mechanics. With rust you're never safe and that's what gives it that exciting edge every time you log on. You never know if you were raided last night or if you're safe for another day. It's not perfect the animal AI is buggy as hell there's mediocre anti cheat protection that requires admins to pick up the slack and large clans have a significant advantage over small groups and solos players. However the developers are passionate about their game and regularly listen to community feedback. They're not afraid to admit their mistakes and start from scratch on something new if it's what the community wants.If you want to start playing this game I reccomend you look at a few youtube videos on topics like how to survive and mistakes that new players make. Avoid joining servers with inactive admins (usually the facepunch official servers) and instead opt for a vanilla community server. Be friendly but cautious to other players and avoid making enimies early on. Be friendly with your first neighbors and if you're lucky you may find some people to start a group with you. And most of all don't get discouraged if you get raided die or lose all your stuff. Experienced people will trick you outsmart you and exploit you. Keep your head on square learn from your mistakes and try again.,Rust

2016-07-14,0,0,48,True,Recommended,"Rust is a game you will read about quite often. It's community is crazy the servers are bezerk and the gameplay is utterly hilarious. To those frustrated with being raided over and over again thus leaving this game a bad review try playing on an unpopulated server. Look into the game with a more open eye and understand that larger serves can't be played alone. It's not unfair... It's just how the game has evolved... In an eveolutionary stance the statement ""Survival of the Fittest"" could not be more ture.It is because of this that I highly reccommend this game. I feel as though if you're looking to get into survival games then this one is a great first choice. To those who are vets to that of ARK and simimlar this game is a nice simple and slower chnage to the older much more dynamic survival games. All in all if you don't like the game Steam always offers a refund.With that I leave you with this... Never ever trust anyone especially a NAKED!",Rust

2014-05-26,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,"At the moment (26.05.2014 17.07.2014) the game gets boring pretty quick. Some servers are mighty frustrating in general cheats crazy kids bloodthirsty nerds that don't get laid at all it seems. All of this plus the ability to get some serious firearms 5 minutes after a server is wiped and a small map make it hardly enjoyable for more than a week or so. The building and gathering process are both fine the combat needs a lot of work and the game balance is just missing (see M4 with kevlar full armor against a rock and no underwear on the same spot). Flora and fauna are not so rich and the only meat you get is chicken (KFC says hi apparently). Some weapons like hand cannon are obsolete by default. The destruction system should make a little more sense as in you can break everything but the pillars and foundation. What? It gets exploited all over the place and sneaky bastards will lock you up and block you as they please. Or you will lock youself away which in either case is an exploit and doesn't improve the experience.Experimental build (aka restart) still has nothing to offer. Why devs added it for player use while there's nothing in it is beyond me.So devs should keep up the good work and fix minor bugs asap. As of now I do not feel like playing it at all until a major patch gets out and I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state.It's as true as it says in the early access description ""very early development"".So I recommend you wait until it shapes up.",Rust

2018-01-12,0,0,186,True,Not Recommended,Game and world is not so bad done. But actually enjoy playing is impossible unless you entered months ago or doing that as your job. You spawn and start your game naked with no tools or resources and hundreds of times you are killed before you can gather anything that let you save your game or your resources. Most of players that reached a good level equipped with firearms and armour go around raiding new players for fun or to avoid to waste time to gather basic resources (they stole from your body). Absolutely no way to avoid that. Never experienced in 15 years of online gaming a game with such hard entering experience and such unmanaged community.

So you keep spawning and magicaly you actually get somewhere you find an old base and set up shop its looking good oh nevermind heres a full gear clan to ruin your day looks like they needed some extra rocks to play with or maybe an extra torch well good for them. So the other problem. The devs. ugh dont get me started. You might say there trying there hardest to get this game playable but it shouldnt take 2 years let alone more because the game is still broke more power to the clans they say also there is core mechanics that still arn't fixed bears are just silly and they still havnt found a suitable crafting system yet no the componet system was not the answer.

The dev's try very hard to keep their playerbase happy with new content and it will bring you hours of fun.Me? I'm following Garry's advice when he told the players with thousands of hours that they can move on. I'm moving on.

2016-03-13,0,0,4191,True,Recommended,"Product received for free. This game is the type of game that you can really lose yourself in you can play dozens of hours a day and still have fun!This was in the good old days of Rust. I recieved this game as a gift from a friend for christmas (2015). Back then you connected to people and you ""Roleplayed"" and truly interacted with all of the players on a server. On these servers you got to know most people and you knew them as a community and interacted with them more than just in any other game. Before I played as much Rust as i did back then I played a fair bit of CS GO and Unturned one of which is a round based First Person Shooter and the other one a Zombie survival game with graphics all based on square models. Even though I came from these games that are considered very different from Rust I still fell in love with the game and lost yself in it. Now i nearly have 2500 hours in the game and i have completely lost the spark to play it.Updates and development was shifted from what the games core was (Blueprint system) and was tergetting bigger audience by putting out quick not well thought out updates many of which (In my opinion) ruined the game and the way it was played. Nowadays the game doesn'thave a goal for the week the 'wipe' used to consist of you and your friends farming and getting those recourses needed to get that one base or that one outpost after that you spent the wipe interacting PVP ing and gathering for Blueprints this knowledge that followed you till the next wipe where you could build better things from the start and it gave you an insentive to stay on the server for more than the timeit took you to die the first time.Nowadays Rust is completely changed everything that the developers do in terms of progress is being hidden away the old branches barely have anyt population because not a lot of people know about them the new resource system only involves farming and if you die or get raided you lose all the progress that you had made to that point nothing was gained from the hundreds of hours you put in that wipe just to have to reset and do the exact same thing again next wipe and so on. The playerbase got more and more agressive due to the increased rarity of items people now have to work extra hard jut to get a stone wall up. Now KOS is one of the most reoccuring themes in the Rust chatroom.For me the devs have to drastically change the way the game is played so that it better matches the playerbase no need to farm for the entire wipe and invest that much time just so that you can lose it immediatey to a clan of 20 or more players. (Obviously one can try to avoid this but what is the point in selective playing due to that) What the developers desperately has to do is to give the players something to hold onto on a server for the next wipe knowledge on item crafts specific components something just so that when a player joins a server he has something to hold on to something to bring with him to prove that his efforts was worth the while.I loved this game now I am sad to see what it has become I still have hopes for it but I think it has a long way to go still.I would give this game a 2/10 due to the reason that I have so much nostalgia from it however changes need to be made drastically.13/10 The game is Improved A LOT Facepunch studios re added a version of Blueprints to the game which made it viable to continuously play on a server. This is something that I really approve of. The game still has things to work with. Review of game based on score (8/10)",Rust

2018-04-02,0,0,737,False,Recommended,The game is an absolute piece got it way back in legacy and have taken breaks over the course of its development. The charm I find in it is the games visuals as well as community. Is the community good? NO but there is something about this game that just makes people act like a bandit from borderlands if anything I'd say rust is Borderland Bandit simulator and I love it. The community does have its good sides though but it exists outside of the game. You have people making modded and custom server to appeal to most players prefered playstyle or game mode. Also despite the fact that I'd agree 99% of the community is hostile I've made upwards of like 30 friends on this game and any players who have been hostile towards me have mostly been comedic about it so I've just never been able to stay mad at them. Rust is a weird one it brings out dark side in the majority of people who play it but its like a dark humor if anything it what I image a real apocalypse would look and play out like.,Rust

2015-07-31,0,0,2826,True,Recommended,After over 2 000 hours I can comfortably say that it was worth every penny but that being said I hate this game. The concept for this game is really great and I've had soo many enjoyable moments but overall it's just a grindfest. You spend the first few days of the wipe grinding your off until finally you get some decent gear and then you go out and die with it. Also this game has been in development for what like 3 years now? Very minimal progress has been made considering how long they have been working on it which is very dissapointing. The developers please the community with little trivial items to keep them coming back but in reality rust right now is practically the same as rust two years ago. Overall excellent game but don't do what I did and sink over 2 000 hours into it lol. 7/10,Rust

2017-12-08,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,"There are many things about rust I didn't like I'll keep most difficulty complaints out of my review because I expected it to be very difficult. (I still found the community less than desirable aswell especially after reading comments on some other reviews that were along the lines of ""Git gud"")Now after playing 12 hours of Rust I must say it's kinda... boring... the maps can be really large however they don't look very good and some areas are just locked off by tempurature or radiation. I've accessed all of these and it's the same story. The best parts of the map are the landmarks and while they were kinda neat a couple of times they got old and samey quick and the ""Loot"" was mostly scrap metal and other garbage noone wants (Though I did find a large mace once it was cool but it wasn't better than a spear).After awhile provided you weren't killed on spawn (It happens alot) and noone downs you and just leaves you you may be fairly strong then all there is is farming and combat. And combat doesn't feel very good. Most weapons accessable to new players are difficult to use and guns are just overpowered and are really easy by comparison. Most armor offers hardly any protection and unless you have friends with you you will be outnumbered alot. There's no real depth to the gameplay beyond that which is rather dissapointing for a survival game and especially one that's been in development for so much longer than some of it's peers.",Rust

2016-02-11,0,0,15,True,Recommended,This game is awesome super fun to play with a friend or on your own. However a lot of the other people on the servers can make the game a lot less fun. When there are a bunch of other people on the server the game consists of a cycle of waiting 10 minutes to spawn instantly being killed by someone then waiting another 10 minutes just to be killed again. I like to stick to myself then it is perfect. If there was a way to play this game just by myself or multiplayer with a friend without a public server it would by far be my favorite game! Sometimes when I re enter a server I find that I have to start completely over and have lost all my progress that is very disappointing and a little frustrating. Also the new update earlier today has caused my Rust to become so slow and buggy it is unplayable / Hopefully they will fix it soon though!,Rust

2018-09-17,0,0,320,False,Not Recommended,Unbelievably toxic. It does not matter if you play on pvp servers or the small minority of pve servers.And even if you should happen upon a server that seems nice at first you will be extremely frustrated before you managed to play the game for a month. I have never seen a community that is this illiterate unwilling to check up on the smallest details and that expects everyone else to give them stuff for free while giving back nothing but insults and degredation.The game itself is like an alpha version of what it should be. Decent computers still do not manage stable fps rates and if you have managed to finally find graphic setting that make the game almost run properly bad luck another update is just around the corner and it screws everything up. The servers are pure lagfests and while the game looks like its from the 2000s even then servers I used to play on where better than this.DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS,Rust

If you are the solo player type of gamer avoid if you want an easy casual survival game unless you are going to play on your own server.Frequent updates and frequent fixes means world/character whipes happen given the nature of the game that is okay tho for else maps go stale.Kids love it on private server as well.,Rust

2016-08-16,0,0,80,True,Not Recommended,Compared to other reviews my play time is incredibly short. I have learned in that short time that this game absolutely hates small groups/solo players which I fall under. This game suffers from the Survival genre's tropes of people killing you on sight. People with guns killing people without guns for no reason even if you insist that you mean no harm. fresh spawns often mindlessly kill one another just to get a tiny leg up just to get brained themselves a minute later.I wish the dev team would implement a system that penalize late game players for murdering a fresh spawn. Someone without a base that has a cabinate and a sleeping bag within or a wanderer with a bow or adequate ranged weapon to defend themselves with. If you see a person with a gun advancing towards you the likely result will be death even if they say they're friendly they often want you to stay still so they can use less ammo to slaughter you.The EXP system is a terrible idea for a server based game. All progression does not transfer from server to server even on official ones. Not to mention that admins will restart the entire server making everyone's progression start from square 1. This advantages people with big groups due to the EXP system sharing amoungst friends/allies in close proximity to one another or shared tools.The aggressive wild life are real kickers as well. Bears often appear out of no where and have almost no sound when chasing after you. You need the situational awareness of Widow Maker 24/7 if you don't want to be blindsided by a bear or wolf. Both bears and wolves will outpace you so running is never the option and standing your ground against a bear or wolf solo is certain death for fresh spawns. Edit (playing beyond 17 hours)I continued my playtime beyond 17 hours. I had decent fun talking to people while I collected resourses for a small house which too approximately 7 hours stright. Most of that time was spent dying to fellow players the ones that would never speak to you and looking for a location for said house. I logged back in 20 hours later to find I have no sleeping bag and the kill message saying I was murdered by a weapon I stored away for an emergecy. I get this game is still in EA.

Do you like new updates that make the game not open again until a new patch so you can't play it? Awesome! How about a game you can hardly play on extremely low video settings because the devs don't know how to develop a game? I'm sure all 25 people who work at Facepunch Studios are doing working really hard at drinking coffee and sleeping because they obviously aren't fixing the game....What a bunch of worthless developers.

2015-05-24,0,0,1498,False,Not Recommended,"Listen this game is great. Great concept great gameplay etc. But... Theres so many ing problems with this damn game i cant even fathom. These kinds of problems would be understandable in a EA game but now this game has been in full release for what 2 months now? The game continues to have crashing errors for almost everyone i play with. I shouldnt have to go into my system settings and change how much dedicated ram i should have for a set game. I have 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. I should not crash over RAM errors whatsoever. If your game itself is taking up more than 8 GB of RAM you're doing something wrong. This is not a AAA title. Another issue i encounter constantly is slow loading textures. I have the hardware to run this game at 90 FPS on medium graphics with a max render distance. You're telling me that something 20 feet in front of me shouldnt be loaded by the time i get to it? Absolutely ridiculous. Not only does this game have an astounding amount of internal issues its community is also the most toxic i've seen. After a 1000 hours of gameplay I've met maybe 30 people in the probably thousands ive played with that are relatively friendly. And Facepunch goes on to support this toxic behavoir by trying to ""Fix it"" by adding new landmarks like the ""Outpost"" where players continue to camp outside of and hunt down freshspawns. New players are constantly being turned away from this game after expierencing the massive waves of toxic people that play. Raiding should also not be the primary objective in this game. I've had so many people raid me or someone else and when the person responds negatively the raider often and usually responds with ""Its Rust lol get over it Raiding is like the entire game"" or something relatively similiar. Rust has now become a slow paced FPS game where the larger clans and such exploit the fact that guns and C4 are part of the game as an excuse to be toxic and people. Its completely ruined the experience. I can't say that i havent been one of those people because I have and it feels kind of . At this point in Rusts developement as I continue to play it regardless of its state hoping to find a diamond in the rough that makes the game magically better I cannot recommend playing this game whatsoever. Other than ""having its moments"" 90% of rust is a constant grind where you're rewarded with someone blowing into your walls or murdering you and calling you a .

2018-04-28,0,0,572,False,Not Recommended,well i've played this game for 60 hours in total combined with my other account and thing is i started on legacy that is when i bought the game and i spent 50 hours on it in the first week and then i stopped not because i got bored simply because my computer broke down and i was going to school so i could not afford a new computer straight a way so now i got a pretty powerful computer or atleast powerful enough to play rust comftarbly and you see thing is i went in game i expected to find the same good old game that ill be able to play for so long now right ? well yeah let's just say i spent the next 10 hours trying to build myself a base which i failed over and over again i did it once yet it got raded when i logged off and you're probably thinking oh this retard can't build a base ahahahahah'' well before releasing your toxicity colected from rust onto me hear me out you see don't get me wrong i do like fps games i play a lot of counter strike and i play a lot of titan fall but thing is i like survival games too and rust used to be one of my favorite ones up until i tried the lates version of the game that they made i mean the community is simply garbage the first game i entered i tried to ask some guy with a AK on how the game works now a days guess what i got shot. i was like well okay every game has some toxic players or maybe he just did not speak english '' so i've met a naked guy also fresh spawn i didn't get enough time to even say hello he just pushed towards and tried to kill me so i've killed him and asked him why did he try to kill me like he knew i had nothing on me the answer i got was YOU '' so to be honest from my perspective survival genre in the gaming community is dead and no not because of the devs but because of the players the way they are i mean instead of just gathering recourses and building stronger bases they prefer to get a bow run around die and do the same all over again honestly i am done with this game and you see the game itself is nice it's better than ever i loved the graphics the mechanics and everything else it's just that the community is such a BIG flaw in the game that it does not even compensate for the game being good itself and that is why i think rust is dead and it will never be good again unless people change but we both know they don't. this was my review Game 9/10 overallGraphics 8/10mechanics 10/10community 0/10In conclussion if you like playing alone on empty servers this is the game for you and if you expect to meet friends and build a base and live ever after don't even try don't waste your energy on this game.

2018-01-15,0,0,21,True,Not Recommended,Cons If you decide to buy the game avoid playing more than 2hours becasue if you are a noob or new (like me) and start playing. Pro players will not be nice unless you have a mic to convince them. Players who have played this game when it came out will use you to get ur stuff. One player in a server kept killing me even though i begged for mercy and other players in opther servers would do the same. If you are able to live then I feel happy for you. Lastly sometimes the servers would start getting very laggy and not allow you to build or you start glitching and being unable to move. Also if yo dont build a house by the time you stop playing SOMEBODY WILL kill you and loot you and you will respawnPros My computer was able to play on high settings and it looked very nice my graphics card did suffer a little ( i have a RX 580) If you are a good survival fps gamer then this is certainly a good game for you. Also some new players or pro who happen to join a new server with you might team up with you if you meet up. If it werent for the annoying players this game would have been very good for me even if there were some hackers. Additionally there are servers that may help you getting used to the games guns and other weapons handling. I would not reccomend this game tho,Rust

Best to join a server of about 10 to 60 maybe 70 people. Less than 10 would be too lonely but you could just build I suppose never been on an empty server. Above 60 or 70 and survival gets too hard and competitive and you won't be able to start up properly.To join bigger servers you pretty much have to make friends and be in a clan to survive.Cheaper than DayZ when I got it just before it's ""full release"" on a sale at 7.

2014-01-28,0,0,41,True,Not Recommended,"In a word... sleeper. This means that when you log off you don't ""log off""... your character simply stands where he was and closes his eyes. Until you log back in. Yes this means you can and will be found and murdered for your dozen stones and your stone hatchet. So essentially you get to start over daily. ""But you can build a shelter!"" you might think. This is true. However they can be brought down your character killed and your one measley box completely looted. Then they destroy your sleeping bag so you can't even find your barren house.There are also a wide variety of server issues that plague this game. Official servers only hold 128 simultaneous players aside from the stress servers and East Coast 1. This means when you want to get back onto a server you were on you get to try to reconnect over and over and over. Stability! The first two times I played Rust the servers crashed. The very first time it was literally within 10 minutes. And about 3 of that was spent rubberbanding all over the place. When the servers are stable the game plays well enough... but inevitably you'll face lag and eventually a server crash.And speaking of servers if you want to refresh the list of 11 official servers you also get to sit through the list of the 300odd privately run mod servers to refresh. ""No big deal the official ones should refresh first "" you're saying to yourself. Of course! That makes sense in an ideal world. But if you couldn't tell yet this is anything but.This game has SO much potential and I would love it if they actually implemented common sense in addition to the server stability (the latter of which I know will come with time).Oh! Not to mention the devs HATE feedback if your opinion differs from theirs at all.",Rust

Gives him full access to the house and authorized him to build on / in the house.. He then asks for the pin code to the doors and I give it to him.. I tell him ""whats mine is yours now"" and he thanks me.. All is good! I got a new friend on a clean server and the best base ever! ...... Or do I ??My so called friend then started to wonder around the base doing... things.. I didn't even notice it but he is actually changing the pin code and finally removing my authentication to the base! Result?

To be fully honest with you the past 3 months with the components system has sucked complete I know by year 4 this game SHOULD be polished and fun but it isnt. If you are willing to put your trust into the Devs then play this game expect the game to change from when you buy it. Having said this this is what you should buy rust for.Clans. If you have a large group of people 5 20 then this is the game for you. You will dominate all the servers with tyranny and complete control. The people of the server will hate you however and have no respect what so ever.Roleplay. This is what you should play if your solo or if you have a small group of 2 4. Build a shop build a hospital do whatever you want! But be wary people will raid kill and hunt you down without remorse just for being a roleplayer. This is the most fun way to play the game at the moment. Build a town. This is what Rust was meant to be like build a town make neighbors surround it with a wall. This is the dream of most solo players out there this is the most fun way to play the game. People how ever are s so choose your community wisely or you will be backstabbed by some 12 year old.The three types of players in Rust.KOS basically s some people arent s but most are. This is the easiest way to play rust but the worst in terms of fun.Eye for an eye. You dont shoot me i dont shoot you. The fair and most fun way to play the game this is how it was meant to be played. ( expect to be killed because of aimcone )What most people call roleplayers but i call ""too friendly"". They will not kill you even if you are killing them. They are the Liberals of rust believing in a world that will never happen and in turn get too salty every time they get killed. The of rust in terms of fun you will feel like a Mormon looking for followers.What to take away from this review To have the most fun build a pretty looking base ( expect to be raided even if you build a big base you will still be raided so just have fun with it. ) dont kill someone unless they shoot first ( expect to be double headshot and killed because of aimcone ) make a lot of friends and make a town of nakeds you found on the beach roleplay and make a community hospital or a casino or a strip club etc. Remember if you play this game religiously or in any means tryhard you will hate it.

2016-12-06,0,0,125,True,Recommended,So i havent played this game in a long time BUT im writing this review because i see a lot of players complaining about the playerbase being toxic. This game is not for the faint of heart. You will die many times with no gear from people who have everything. My tip for this game is that when you do finally get a lot of gear use that gear to kill people that have nothing. If you are a nice guy you will eventually lose it all and complain that you didnt get to kill anyone. btw muff boi,Rust

2016-08-25,0,0,315,True,Not Recommended,this game needs optimization... im getting such FPS drops even on low graphic settings.this game at this state will not appeal to those with medium/low graphic rig...Even the game's minimum requirement doesn't even know what graphics can even support it at the lowest of the low.Rust should have an option to sell/rent off servers.should small/normal/large/epic map sizes.even at standard size it's making all AMD cpu users unplayable.Rust needs official servers where they tend to restart the world preventing new players to be instantly killed by people that built their fortress since the beginning. There needs to be a limit for how many people can be together in the same vicinity... When I join a server i get killed by 80 people.. that isn't fun at all.Computer specs AMD fx 6300gtx 950 ssc acx 2.016GB ram...still getting around 30 40 fps.itll dip below 12fps during over 50 users... yet on planetside2 i can fight with 800 other users.,Rust

2018-02-23,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game is bloody awfull. It is a sandbox pvp game which means if you're joining a server now there will be players around your spawnpoint which gun you for fun. There is no option to play PvE or solo or start your own server. The tutorial is given on the way of your progression which can be tedious if you're surrounded outnumbered and outmatched. It really is trial and error and a lot of time investment just to be able to craft something like a house.

But then you learn new builds with random blueprints found in loot boxes! I like the idea of all Multiplayer game servers. Rust is a good survival game. That is all.

2016-07-04,0,0,245,True,Recommended,"For all those doubting how good early access games can be I am here to put your mind at rest. Unlike DayZ or H1Z1 which recieve updates maybe bi monthly( if you're lucky) which gives Steam Early Access a bad name Rust devs update the game weekly with a major overhaul coming on 7/7. The game runs very smoothly and throughout my 30+ hours of gameplay I never expierenced any crashes or game breaking bugs. Overall it is much like Kerbal Space Program ( the only other early access game i have invested money into) in the fact the game could be classified as a complete game but the devs want to maximize the game before they release into beta or beyond. As for gameplay.... my initial thoughts were that the game would basically be a ""good graphic"" minecraft but that couldn't be further from the truth. Instead the game has very realistic survival elements and hefty bullet drop/sprays which to some might be a negative. To me however these realistic elements give the game shape and form allowing the player to feel more enticed to play and get better with practice. I feel it is very important to distingush playing solo and with friends... When playing solo you will die and you will die ALOT but that comes with the territory. Although they can be boring after countless hours I highly recommend playing on lower pop servers in order to help make the game more enjoyable as you learn the basic mechanics. However even on these low pop servers the game is still highly enjoyable and you don't have to worry as much about Clans one of my biggest cons that I will get to later. As for playing with friends the game is A BLAST and there is no telling how much fun stuff can happen as you all work together to make a badass base and go looting for better equipment.The biggest pro imo is raiding. Raiding allows those who have invested quite alot of time and resources on a server to go and raid other players bases. There are two types of raids in the game Online raids and offline raids. Online raids are rarer and much more difficult to accomplish because online raiding literally means raiding someone's base why they are online but are much more rewarding and enjoyable if successful. Offline raids are the type 95% of players will expierence and occurs when someone raids your base while you are offline. These offline raids are the reason it is so imperative you make as strong of a base as possible before you log out and why playing with friends is much more enjoyable and encouraged.The biggest con goes hand in hand with raiding and is Clans. Clans are basically a group of people who form a huge base somewhere on the map and in order to protect their base and ensure server dominance basically give their members ""jobs"" in which it's X members duty to log in from 7am noon and watch the southeast side of the base for possible raiders or farm resources. hunt etc. These clans can be quite an annoyance and of the 4 servers I have played on 3 were ruthless doing anything and everything they could to insure dominance. If this sounds like something you cant handle I wouldn't recommend buying the game because nearly every server has a clan already in place.Overall the game is a refreshing survival game providing thrilling expierences as you go scavenging for resources raiding or just through exploring the map as you try your best to try and gain prominance in the server. For anyone interested in fps survival pvp or exploration I highly recommend this game as it masterfully combines all these games into a PC must own.Final Verdict 8/10 a great game well worth the $20 price tag and even more so if you can get it cheaper. However with the upcoming xp system about to be introduced and everything else the devs have in store I am certain this game can easily bump up to a 9 or a 10 and will update this post with more incite as the game evolves!",Rust

2014-06-20,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,"Rust at its very core is so bad that the only thing I can see this leading to is another project altogether. Now that they see that there's a market for this I imagine they will do a better version and repackage it to sell it to us again. I'm not buying it though and I regret buying this it's the worst game in my library.The graphics are terrbile and lags constantly. The AI of the animals you're required to hunt is laughably awful. The actions that you can take don't make sense from a survival perspective all the developer would need to do is watch an episode of the Survivorman show for better inspiration in what elements to add. The landscape is covered with shantyhouse skyscrapers built by players that ruins any immersion you might want to get out of a survival game. It's best during the night cycle when the screen is entirely black and you can use your imagination to fill in the massive failure in game design.The only innovation I witnessed is that you may come across people who are using voicechat and you are able to hear them talking as if you walked into their conversation or just walking past their campsite and the volume changes to the appropriate level in relation to your distance from the voice.The gameplay is driven along by the absolute ugliest qualities in online gaming. Greed cruelty towards fellow players bragging to name a few. It then rewards the behavior and through the conditioning I honestly believe makes you worse of a person after playing it. I've never considered stating that about any other game and hope I'm never compelled to again.It's like an online class ""How to be a jackass 101"". I think everyone already knows how to be a jackass online this game has nothing to offer IN MY OPINION. Thank you.",Rust

2016-09-13,0,0,483,True,Recommended,Great game. First of all I must admit that yes there are a lot of people on this game who want to kill and steal from. This is the basis of the game that no one is your friend unless you really do manage to get to trust them. However there are many different servers with different people on for example I started off properly playing Rust on a modded server which is part of a gaming network I play on (Vexatio Gaming) which I am player admin on so I knew everyone and people were friendly towards one another if one turned against another the rest of the server would team up with the victim and retaliate in defense of the victim. Basically what I'm trying to say is there are many different servers on it may take time to find good servers but once you do it is well worth it.There are many different types of server e.g Super Modded Servers with ridiculous gather rates like 1000x or even one I played on which was 1 000 000x (One that was extremely fun and I still play on regularly) though you can hardly expect to survive long you get resources quickly and OP gear within 20 minutes if you're even just a bit hasty. Though on this type of server EVERYONE is your enemy and will shoot on sight. You may be shot as a fresh spawn but eventually after a little while you will manage to get some high quality gear and rule (until you come offline and you WILL get raided). These are super fun but I would recommend playing with a friend(s) however you must also have a decent amount of experience to play as most are ATLEAST that good and will decimate you if you're not good enough.Legit Modded These servers are basically legit except there are additional commands like /tp /home and gather rates of 2X 3X This is the type of server I most recommend for new players to play on small community servers so they can get a feel for the game learn the bullet drop and how to use weapons effectively. Basically just OP but still legit servers so you still need to work for your gear servers with friendly players are a lot easier to play on while you gather your bearings aswell. Vanilla The most legit type of server I haven't played these much/at all though what I do know is gear is very precious and difficult to get as it takes a lot of time to get good stuff and be able to stand a change against the server regulars that have been playing regularly for the past month. Recommended for regulars with a decent amount of experience to dedicated professionals.I recommend this game to people with friends who will play with them (online friends or real friends it doesn't matter so long as there is a game trustworthy as in they won't just backstab you for your loot you will work as a team) who preferably have Skype or some other way to speak to them online. This game I think is extremely good for players with a friend to play with as you can cooperate to to gain power and gear.This game WILL take a certain level of dedication to gain experience and get good on. Though I enjoyed the learning process in which I started playing on a community server which I knew everyone on and gained power on there then started playing with my friend.My personal rating 10/10 as my favourite and most played game.,Rust
2016-09-12,0,0,162,True,Recommended,"Okay.As a fan of survival games like DayZ (including mods Epoch OverPoch etc..) I bought this game. I've owned the game for a while but after the Xp update I decided to give this game a try and here is what I think.Having the xp system in game has caused many different opinions and even some player loss but in my opinion it's better than it used to be sure it does have some bad sides on it like it might take a while for a player to be able to create it's favorite weapon clothing building parts etc.About the game grafting tools weapons and clothes all together with building that kind of survival ""home"" you like are the best parts of this game.Rust is still pretty buggy but hey it's in early acces by bugs I mean bears can attack through walls sometimes and both wolves and bears can glitch in to rocks etc.About building there is a numerous ways to build your own survival ""home"" aka. base if you want you can build a huge military style armored base or if you want you can have a house build of wood or rocks how ever you like.Building system is very simple but the amount of supplies needed to build a proper base is a challenge.From a naked survivor with rock and a torch to well equipped long living survivor is a road of challenges and a lots of fun.THIS REVIEW IS PRETTY MESSY BUT IM NOT THE BEST IN ENGLISH AND THIS IS MY OPIONION ONLY. IF YOU AGREE GO AHEAD AND BUY THE GAME. LonelyFinn",Rust

The only thing that allows me to see that they are moving forward is the amount of potential this game has. I have been getting on nonstop for about two weeks now and keep noticing things that can be improved on and things that are becoming perfected to the fullest. I agree that the game has it's repetitiveness and it's griefers/raiders but think about it Your stranded on an island with no food no clothes a rock and your wits. If you were on an island and saw a huge house wouldn't you raid that and take everything he had. It's hard seeing so many people with bad reviews on this game because last i checked it's still ""ALPHA"". If you are looking for a nice game with no problems or glitches or updates then Steam has an excelent selection to choose from.. But if you are looking for a game that is being constantly developed (but has a few issues that will be fixed through each update) and a wonderful gameplay experience then this is the game for you.

2015-10-23,0,0,347,True,Recommended,Ill be the first to say I hated Rust legacy. I don't know if I just didn't give it enough of a chance or what. But New Rust is fantastic Using a brand new engine is exactly what Rust needed and has allowed Garry to add some amazing features to the game that could have only been dreamed of in Legacy.I few warnings If you are looking for a nice community building Minecraft game then this is not the game for you. Other players will stop and nothing to try to destroy your base and steal everything you worked to get then kill you cook and eat you.Rust Is a lot more fun when you play with friends you can split the work in making a secure base and with more people protecting said base raiders will have a harder time screwing you over. During your time in rust you will find and learn Blueprints for everything you can craft in the game you never lose the knowledge of these blueprints while playing on a server so even if they do destroy your base and you wake up on the coast with nothing you still are farther ahead then you started you just need to find the resorces over again. Rust is constanty getting updated and Garry has no fear about making game changing updates only annoying thing about that is that the map ends of getting wiped every month or 2 making you start from scratch but that is kind of a good thing because you can get to powerful making a base that is practically impossible to raid which can get boring.10/10,Rust

2018-03-22,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,"Overall the game is probably a lot of fun if you have a group to play with or a large amount of time to play. As it stands however if you are planning on playing solo or have other commitments such as work family or school you are never going to progress very far in the world of Rust.The skill ceiling in Rust is very low. The gunplay is passable but not excellent and fights seem to mostly boil down to whoever gets off the first shot or brings the most friends wins. Players die extremely quickly particularly with high end weapons. This leaves very little room for strategy beyond just ambush and zerg tactics and there aren't really any ""sick plays"" to be had beyond pulling off lucky headshots when the game's coding allows it.Due to all of this the only factor that Rust really rewards is time invested in playing the game grinding out resources. If you have job family or school obligations that pull you away from the game or even if you just like playing a variety of games you simply will not be able to keep up with all of the people who are willing to spend 10 16 hours daily grinding resources. This fact coupled with the low skill ceiling means that 2 players will always beat one so if you are outnumbered you WILL lose and have everything on your body looted and players that have 10+ hours a day to play will always have tons of extra resources to build more guns no matter how much they die means that if you don't have the time to invest the game will punish you for it. Time served is all that matters in Rust. Skill is irrelevant.Solo play is further crippled by the nature of the crafting system. Crafting anything but the most basic items in Rust requires that you have learned the item's blueprint. In order to get the blueprint you have to first find the item through random chance in ruins or along roads or kill a player who is carrying it and take it off them. You then need to farm scrap an item available from junk piles until you have enough to build a research table. Then you need to farm more scrap to research the item ranging from a couple dozen units to several hundred depending on how good the item is. Researching the item destroys the original copy you found but now you can build more. In order to do that though you need to farm hundreds of more scrap to build a workbench so you can build items. Then you need to farm certain components to build certain items.The solo experience looks like this find a location farm resources build a base farm 625 scrap for a lvl 2 workbench and research table then farm hundreds more scrap for a handful of maybe useful blueprints (if you managed to find the items) all the while getting killed by groups and losing everything you were carrying at the time. Then you get raided by a clan and lose everything other than your learned blueprints. Hope you learned some good ones.The community is probably the worst I have ever experienced in my time playing multiplayer games. All in all if you are a hardcore gamer type or you have a bunch of people to play with Rust may be the game for you",Rust

There is no point in the game other than hit trees and rocks with stuff and make pointless stuff. Even if you do manage to make a huge house it's just going to be destroyed later by some clan.

There's no point there's no fun and there's no way you will survive through the dangers of pointless PVP combat glitched animals and HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS EVERYWHERE.

I understand its a pvp kind of game and thats fine however spending nearly a half hour with a not responding screen on and off just to load the game... not even close to saying this was worth getting.

Though there are too many hackers playing rust at the moment and they are allowed to get away with it. The reporting system sucks and you literally stand no chance against people when they can see through walls. I wouldnt even mind if they were cheating and playing fairly but theyre clearly not and make it really obvious and do it for a reaction. The servers are unstable and keep crashing because of the hackers too which is also incredibly annoying. I know its hard to fix cheating but something needs to be done about it.,Rust

2018-02-10,0,0,271,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be fun. It was grindy you did meet s through out your journey but you met nice people and raided people and you were even able to make it solo for the most part. You were still able to raid solo and do other things that clans and groups would do. Now it has released and honestly it sucks. The graphics are pretty but now they have the horrible blueprint system made it harder to find stone and pretty much the game is completly one sided. Solo is very hard to do now and so are duos and trios. The game is sided to zergs clans and large groups. The game also has it's famously terrible community with some of the most toxic people in all of gaming. It's also fun to get spawn camped by turrents and geared people. Also when anbody sees you whether it's a clan or a solo person and your naked they will come to kill you on the spot.,Rust

The cost doubled update now every week sometimes 2 updates the same day. The introduction of workbenches slows game play and spend most of the time collecting scrap and the BP system really sucks I do think leaving early access was more of a ploy to get more money in and not to improve game play was a big con.

2014-07-30,0,0,484,True,Recommended,This curious (and often depressing) experiment in human nature is a tricky one to review.It can be played two ways either run around the endless countryside naked but for a rock screaming at people and bashing open their skulls if you can get near them. Or gather resources build a home close to precious materials but hidden from prying eyes and ravenous bandits hope to be able to survive long enough to fortify and stock up on weaponry to carve some kind of name and reputation for yourself and fight back against anyone who tries to take what is yours.Either way you will die. Frequently. Either by your own stupidity (that raw chicken looks tasty I'm sure jumping off this cliff face will be okay it doesn't look TOO high...) or most likely at the hand of a ruthless fellow survivor who liked the look of your leather boots. Death isn't to be taken lightly all the items you were carrying are at the mercy of your killer and anything he decides not to take might just be scavenged by another passer by before you can get back to the spot you were slain having respawned in a random location often quite literally miles away.Going solo is fun and challenging for a while but inevitably you WILL lose. Your camp WILL be raided by a group of far better equipped rivals and you WILL lose everything you spent literally hours painstakingly gathering and crafting.The ONLY way to survive this harsh reality is to team up with others and hope your combined efforts outperform your enemies'. Finding others who will trust you and permit you to join them can be tricky but once you've managed it the game really comes into its own and the real fun starts. A lot of fun can be had working together to gather craft and then (hopefully) conquer. Night time raids on rivals' forts to steal their supplies and kill off the competition really can be enjoyable and exciting and Rust does have a lot of strategy and thinking involved. Clan battles on servers are frequent and exchanging threats and taunts before descending on another group's camp en masse is all part of the fun.However again it's only a matter of time before all your best efforts and hard work is ruined. The time will come and you and your friends will be defeated and everything you worked for will be stolen your fortress smashed and demolished. Sadly in a lot of cases it won't even be a fair fight hacking is still a big problem in Rust with whole clans using an assortment of hacks and exploits to stay on top or simply just troll. I've played on many servers where admin abuse is not only obvious it's seen as some kind of God given right. Once all is lost (for the tenth time) this is where the appeal of Rust quickly starts to wane for me at least. Do you really want to start again from nothing spending hours smashing trees with rocks to build basic shelters and chase deer across the map to stay fed and alive? Unless you possess an iron will chances are the extreme nature of Rust will eventually get the better of you and you'll want to move on to seek more casual relaxed ways of having fun without having to sink whole days into chopping wood to craft into planks to craft into building parts to build a modest home that you'll log back in to find has been blown apart and raided while you were offline.But while it lasts this game can be tremendous (but very frustrating) fun and provide plenty of situations to mix tactics teamwork and good old violence to survive another night and maybe even grab a shiny new kevlar vest in the process.Even still in Alpha I'd recommend it.,Rust

2014-09-25,0,0,196,True,Not Recommended,"I gave this game a ""NO"" for many reasons. It is possible to have fun on this game but the more likely scenario is that you will get ed over 100 times until you are so you will uninstall it. First off as far as anyone can tell the developers have given up on it so it isnt really a beta its a dead end. People make up for the lack of game content by hosting good servers with user built plugins that add more to the game the problem is it's next to impossible to find a good server to play on and once you do find one you have no guarantee it will stay open. Your progress doesn't transfer from server to server so if your server closes down you lose everything and servers close down often. That is all a hypothetical since you probably wont even find a good server. I have a lot of hours in the game because one of my friends hosted a server for my group of friends for awhile but the price became too much for him and he had to shut it down iirc its about 40 dollars a month to run a non laggy server.",Rust

2018-07-13,0,0,146,False,Not Recommended,Probably the worst game I have ever played in my entire life the game Getting Over It definetly has a less tilt factor than this game. I cannot fathom a game that can possibly go from being in Alpha or Beta (whatever its called) to full access in which it becomes absolute trash where you see your frames go down but the price of the game goes up to 40$. Beautifully done by the creators of this game if you have a semi decent or mid range computer don't even bother trying this game out as you might as well tell your friends you're a slideshow gamer because the maximum fps you will get after 2+ hours of playing is 30 while running no matter how many fps you had an hour before (for me it was 80 90) you will surely drop to 30 while running through a field of grass. All in all if you buy a game worth 40$ like this BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF WORK you can expect to run the game on the lowest graphic settings to experience a smidge of playability from this game. Enjoy your time and save your 40$ and go spend it on some prostitutes or do something better than buying this game.,Rust

2015-01-05,0,0,156,True,Recommended,Rust is an Outstanding game probably one of the best survival horror games very realistic. theres only one big problem and thats Rust experimental because you are easily raided because all it takes is a pickaxe or hatchet to destroy walls foundations and many other buildable objects but appart from that it is an amazing game and very intense at times because you cant trust so many people.,Rust
2015-01-05,0,0,56,True,Recommended,"most people will kill you on sight but some people because of that are extremely friendly and helpful. texas server is scary. needs a map and more anImals. more materials fancy clothing perhaps dye from an ""herbs"" resource with all those bushes. needs women blacks asians hispanics. needs a trident but a pitchfork will suffice. Following people is just a tad gay even if you are trying to stab them in the back. the clearest graphics in the game are men's asses. would benefit from crafted drugs and alcohol (haven't gotten a furnace yet so i'm not sure how it would fit in) even if they inhibit gameplay rather than help. posted after one day of playing...??.?/10",Rust

I got myself up to lvl 5 gathered basic materials for a wood spear and some gathering tools over and over and over and Ohh... a play nevermind I'm dead. Whats that sound? Sounds like Ohh Im dead again... ahh a bear. Right. Grind..... grind.... Yay stone tools! *grumble* Starved to death.. again. Ohh look mushrooms! something to eat at least! Killed a pig! Yay!

2018-07-13,0,0,357,False,Recommended,Rust is a game where you can have so much fun regardless of the amount of time you have to spend playing it. If grinding is your kind of thing then go onto an official server the more of your friends you have will minimalise the amount of time needed to setup/ start rading etc. If you find yourself in a position where you dont have all that much spare time a modded server will have the necessary changes to ensure you can jump straight in and enjoy the action! The only thing id advise to a new player is to make sure you dont get dissuaded when you spawn and get killed by people who have been on the server a little bit longer than yourself. Dig deep and get that 2x1 setup so you can start progressing!,Rust

2016-09-05,0,0,437,True,Recommended,My advice as a non hardcore player of this game. Play on the modded servers which give you faster XP and 5x resources when farming. Also gives you some options for some starting items like basic tools.This subverts most of the issues people have which are slow farming at the start and not being able to compete with the speed at which large clans can level up and farm. Yes they still dominate the server but you can have an absolute amazing time solo or paired with a small group because you can build a credible base very quickly.Overall I love this game. But I did not play the original version.,Rust

2016-12-11,0,0,532,True,Recommended,This game is incredible in no way shape or form will you be disappointed with this game. An amazing life simulator that represents 5000 BC 2000 AD all in one map. You start out as a caveman naked alone with a rock in your possesion. After countless hours of crafting and mining resources you build your homestead. You learn how to PVP and kill everyone in sight without a thought. The world is cruel so don't travel alone. At times the game can seem like a horror simulator other players and clans will sneak attack from the bushes. Typically they have guns and you don't. But eventually after you respawn enough times you will have your first gun and go on a killing spree. Like a mass murderer. You get a flame thrower burn down a wooden door and loot the dead bodies of your victims. Take a second to admire the world around you go home assemble an auto turret invite people inside only to be shot into pieces.

2016-05-14,0,0,1640,True,Recommended,Excellent game and a massive drain of time if one is not careful!However this game certainly is not every person's cup of tea. It is a demanding game that requires a great deal of effort to be put in. It also requires persistence and perseverance you will likely be killed at some point and lose everything you have been working so hard for. But if you can find the strength to retaliate and play on you will find it extremely rewarding (nothing beats sweet sweet revenge).I recommend this game to anyone looking for an adrenaline rush like no other. You will never be the same when outside alone.This review was written during the alpha stage of development. Although it is not technically in its final release stage there are only minor bugs and very few to boot even less than many AAA titles of late.,Rust

The EXP update has ruined the whole game rust was all about surviving and pvp now with the levels it is hard for pvp players to play when they cant even craft a weapon unless they gather for hours which is not the way they play the game. Also they have ruined trading.. In every server everyone traded for Bps and now its gone.

2017-10-31,0,0,492,True,Recommended,"Just bought the game during the haloween sale and got to say it is worth the money. Thought I would hate it considering the ""toxic"" community I kept hearing about but I think people miss the point. Rust is rust. You will get killed over and over again by squeakers telling you how much they wrecked you with their AK when you are naked. Your base will get blown to bits almost all the time. If you can accept that and like games where every moment is dangerous then you will like rust. The building system progression and pvp is fun. I have a lot of hours in ARK and like the idea of weeklk bi weekly etc wipes. In ark when you get raided you might lose all tribe members combined thousands of hours of gameplay. In rust you can farm up the same amount of stuff pretty quickly after you get raided or just server hop to somewhere else.

2016-08-02,0,0,880,True,Recommended,I would recommend this game of you are gonna play with a group of friends nothing more funnier than shooting you mates in the face with a bolt or a water pipe as they rant at you . Priceless but overall game seems Grindy with the new xp system but i think it's good now you have to work for your gear not just spawn at rads and break barrels till you get c4 ak ect in the first day now you can enjoy early mid and late game as the server grows. Pro about the xp system when you get raid and trust me you will you get xp from the raiders us ring your gear. Con from the xp system it will take a while to get the gear you need to raid but it's more of a pro/con. Takes time to get the xp for the gear but atleast by the time you grinder to get that gear you have the rss needed to make it and would of set up a decent base. My overall rating is 7/10,Rust

Personal things i believe should be added or fixed Go back to the ak before this this ones ing annoying you add dumber sprays people cant learn so they dont wanna learn it and script. solos vs. large groups. yes weve all seen ing Hjune alright what a god he fights a 12 man zerg he has 7500 hours and specializes in solo cool. not everyone is a ing dad like him grind for scrap. for real here. to simply make an ak you need 2550 ING SCRAP! disgusting thats not including armor ammo and meds personally i like the whole workbench thing gives it a grind cant craft an ak on the go like component system which i like but miss tbh. invalid shots. alright this has been the death to me. the amount of time i shoot a man in the head 2 times and theyre invalid is quite stupid. is it because im lagging? the other players lagging? anti cheat? either way its dumb. performence. i have a 1060 i7 6500 8gb alright not bad better than most. i play at potato with max draw draw distance. i installed panjos fps increaser for rust did nothing. its not fps that it mostly annoying if i play between 55 120 i cant tell the difference. its the fact that my game stutters. i have done all these console commands that kinda work but it still does it. i have a good computer and ik thats not the problem.sadly i would recommend this game to nobody new to gaming solo or survival. this is not a survival game. this is just another toxic fps styled game meant to waste your time to get offlined by a ""pro"" clan. i think personally that my main problem is the COMMUNITY. horrible toxic disgusting. i like to be cool when i kill or get killed but i just get called a n*gger and get told to my self. i think overall this game could be fun again where people enjoyed it for a survival game and had fun with eachother.",Rust

2016-08-03,0,0,1103,True,Recommended,Rust Start with nothing finish with nothing.I bought Rust back in the day's of Legacy Rust is a great game for making new friends because if you dont make friends you wont last long..The game is PVP dont expect to last long on a popular server. Unfortunately for me I do not handle well in PVP fights and usually end up second best. It is difficult to survive when the larger groups basically hunt you down and have the resources to raid your base in a minute or 2 while you just cower in the corner of your base waiting for it to end.Mining and underground home's with hidden trap doors would be nice ) I dont survive well above ground lolHonestly I would probably still pay $20 today for what it has become.P.S. I have to agree with other reviewers the xp system makes it near impossible to overthrow the dedicated few that spend every living hour ingame. Start a game towards the end of the week spend hours on hours making your base safe and gathering resources and next thing you know the servers going to wipe despite the name of server saying its fresh wiped.Killing &amp Raiding fellow players is the game.,Rust

2016-08-16,0,0,47,True,Recommended,Surprised by the negative reviews this game has been getting so think it's worth writing a review.I got Rust in the Humble Bundle in August2016. Around the time No Man Sky came out between the two I'd prefer Rust anytime but I understand it's not for anyone.Issue The survival part is tedious bears are too strong.It is a survival game so yes it's difficult but then is this specifically a problem with the game or the fact that maybe survival genres just aren't your thing.Issue Can't change race/gender of the character.Admittedly a controversial feature but I think it's quite fun to make do with what you have has put my partner from playing the game though so again not that he is a racist/sexist unlike some reviewers!Issue Clans dominating serversI've been playing on a low population server and have not seen or heard about all the problems people are facing with clans if being around a big group doesn't work for you then find another server. Chances are you'll get to explore a new map and that's part of the excitement for me. I m not sure how I feel about the server wipes (all construction removed and players reset to lvl1) I think it s one of the options in making sure the servers don t become too full of eyesore inducing landmarks .Overall I d definitely recommend Rust if you want a decent survival game the social/MP aspect of the game is super fun.,Rust

Rust also takes a lot of time to get started and if you want to have mad weapons and the end game stuff you have to grind your off for it Or make friends with the server admins and get everything handed to you like most people do cause they dont want to spend 10+ hours grinding for high walls or a quarry.

2016-06-29,0,0,584,True,Recommended,"Rust. A game about survival against fellow players instead of nature. Well I take that back.. bears are a . Perhaps one of the most important aspects of this game is the persistence of you and your stuff in the online world. When you log off your body remains. Hopefully you secured it and your loot in a house with metal doors or else your will log on to find that a man named ""Dank Hill"" killed you in your sleep and took your loot. Beyond this Rust will probably end up surprising you at how savage other people are. Don't expect help from anyone. Do however expect to be shot on sight even if you just respawned. Player interaction of which is the key feature the Devs like to mess with. Facepunch always works on and improves opportunities that encourage players to come in contact with one another. Whether its a race for an airdrop or siply foraging for supplies you're going to have to meet players whether you like it or not. The only flaw with these systems however is that the game does not suit a casual player too well. The game requires hours a day of your time in order to be productive. Working with a group can help this tremendously though. PVP is a ongoing development but is pretty solid. Certain balance changes can make it frustrating at times. Though rust pvp does require a skill to succeed. Rifles have more recoil that has to be dealt with pistols/ smg's do less damage and really require head shots to do the most damage and even bows/ crossbows are deadly but have no good reticle to shoot from and have travel time. Building iss my personal niche in the game which offers a large amount of creativity and beauty. However most buildings are utilitarian. Built for defense and function. While id love to make a log beach house I guarantee you it would be raided in a day or two. Against flame throwers and explosives you simply have to make buildings ugly in order to keep the loot safe. Overall Rust is a wonderfully balanced ""early access"" game. New content comes out bi weekly on average and the devs do a good job at showing progress.",Rust

And my reaction right after was ""Holy s h i t mom get the camera!"" And shortly after they released it out of early access. And I wee'd myself.And now it turned into a fast action game of run around for 10 minutes kill a few autistic children (while getting called racial slurs that they dont even know the deffinition of) use their stuff to make a huge spralling base only to get bested by a person who's more of an a s s hole than you and then you restart.

2017-03-06,0,0,309,True,Recommended,Rust Pros Rust is an extremely original survival sandbox game. The building system in game is amazing resulting in large amounts of variety with player bases. Several tactics are always used in building such as airlocks or roof camps but these become a common part of the game after you become better at the game. The combat in Rust is truly unique. Early primitive gameplay is very challenging because it comes down to bow and arrows and spears while further into the wipe there is more players with guns and high grade armor. Lots of servers offer a customizable experience such as PvP modded and much more. Player interaction is the back bone of the entire experience. Cons Servers vary but many reset weekly. After 200hr of playing it gets to the point where it feels that it is unnecessary to play. The further into the week the worse the game is. There are plenty of hackers and cheaters on the game. Clans and large groups can ruin the game at times. Side Notes I bought Rust 50% off around $9.99. I feel that the $10 price tag AND the $20 price tag are worth it. I saw myself buying skins very often wanting to support the devs more. I have 285 hours played at the time of writing this review. Rust is an early access game that is changing every week so this review might not hold up in a large amount of time. Summary Rust is a PVP survival game that is truly amazing. The building system allows for many strategies for counter raiding and customization. Combat is truly amazing leaving you with melee early on in the week in a primitive style fight to the death and with high tech guns and weaponry at the end of the week. If you get tired of busting your tail on survival you can head on over to an Embankment server and battle it out to the death with no risks of losing everything youve worked for. The people you meet and trust on Rust with leave you with many friendships over the time of playing. There are power in numbers with Rust so the game is more fun with friends. This goes for the other way too and the game can be very unfun when there is a group of 10 people outside your hard earned base. After several resets and successful base builds it gets to the point where it feels like the game is pointless. Maybe Facepunch can solve this one day. The Verdict Rust is great. I rate it a 7/10.,Rust
2015-07-25,0,0,48,True,Recommended,"I am going to refrain from having the typical ""Garry Newman screwed this up"" review. So when I got the game before the new version was available the game was fun. It took a little to get used to before I really started to enjoy it. One of the things that makes it very enjoyable is playing with friends. I cannot stress enough that you NEED to play with friends. It can get really boring playing by yourself per my opinion. Since the newer version of Rust came out I had to uninstall the game because my laptop can no longer handle it sadly. TL DR If you are a loner this game sucks.",Rust

2018-04-23,0,0,6,False,Not Recommended,A completly unstable game with zero tutortial and buggy servers. i've lost all my stuff several times when i open the server. I log off in my house but when i log back in i'm never in my house and i don't have my stuff. Whenever i make progress it resets it. And the content in the game is way to low.

2018-04-23,0,0,23,False,Not Recommended,Grinds game to make it to the top once there then there is nothing else to do... you just raid and kill people that's why the community is toxic becuase there is nothing else to do than to do that. When playing with friends it can be fun for the first few hours but like I said before then what? Where is the ending? Or the quests side missions for what are we living? to face other player? is that is?? When a game doesn't have any of the things I just said then trust me you might have fun for the first few days but then you just start thinking so what now? do we just continue climbing to the top and killing people? This is a game that leads to nothing not worth the 35$ bucks.,Rust

2017-10-07,0,0,1207,True,Not Recommended,Since the update on October 5th I find that Rust has just turned into a grind an extremely annoying grind at that. Workbench implementation would be great as it would cause some form of progression yet this blueprint madness is just... It rediculous. You have to research 95% of all the ing objects in the game just to be able to build anything. They had blueprints before and you'd figure after previous failures they wouldnt of brought it back but I guess the devs do what the wish. Good job Facepunch.,Rust

2017-10-07,0,0,452,True,Not Recommended,I recommend this game ONLY if you have a lot of friends and or a group. Now tho and I am talking for the majority of the players. I can not recommend it. Since they changed the progression system. It is now a nightmare to do anything if you are a solo player. I would advise FacePunch Studios to go back to either the componet system or the XP system. The better system would be the XP in my opinion it requires work to get up to speed with your life and it is not dictated by some stupid 2500 Scrap. The people who like or even say the Blueprint system (New and current system) Is good are clans or groups. This game needs a better progression system and the componet and XP were the best we had.If the game would not be such a and actually care about the majority of the players. It would go back to the XP or componet system. Fix this.,Rust

The main problem with this game is all the hackers. There are so many but Ill list the to three. Aim Hackers Jump Hackers and Mine Hackers. Alot of them don't mess with you unless you run into them in the wild or have alot of gear/supplies. I bought this game on sale for 10$ and feel that the 20 would be worth it. this game doesn't take much time to learn I'd say about a week but there is allways new stuff with weekly updates and bug fixes. If you really want to play this get ready to put atleast 2 hours in a day and many late nights on weekends having fun. If you want to know the trick to getting around hackers then play one week wipe servers in community these almost allways have plenty of people and admins to stop the hackers.

With the XP system you didn't have fresh spawns running around with AK 47s and now we do. Thanks.,Rust

This is not a game that can easily jump into you will die alot and lose alot of stuff in the proccess. An average 1000+ hour person is what you would call a decent person in this game although there are some player close to that limit that are decent. Alot of people gain fear from bigger groups since they have a major advantage.In order to play this game you have to always be positive mind set because if you dont you will rage alot in this game.Although the weapons physics are horrible at least they made inprovements on the damage which is why it's difficult to master to pvp in the game. The community is like if almost everybody was in a wasteland or stranded island farming and killing others on sight to survive. The only problem I have with this game is how luck to outbeat skill like in a lot of games. Although it happens a most fps game is more common to see it in this game.

2015-06-16,0,0,16,True,Not Recommended,"This game has potential to be really amazing and there are a lot of aspects that I find appealing about it. However the way the game is designed currently I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think this game breeds the type of community it has (notoriously ). As a new player you won't have much room to breathe and experience the game mechanics without being attacked and killed often enough to make that initial ""oohhhh I smash the rock with my rock to get stuff to get a hatchet!"" stage enjoyable which I think is sad. You can always join a PvE server or an empty server to give yourself room to learn but to what end? Staying on a PvE server would get incredibly dull unless simply building a large base satisfies you. Once you grasp the crafting blueprint hunting and base building systems what other reason do you have to keep playing? Heading to a PvP server means dealing with everything you've worked for being constantly in danger because you aren't online 24/7. You could log in any time to find that you have to start from scratch again which is incredibly frustrating. And when you are online every single player you see is a potential threat and they will view you as such. Being someone who wants to say hi and not murder every new person you meet puts you at a serious disadvantage. If you choose not to be an you WILL lose your progress more often than otherwise. Not only does being a jerk keep you from losing your gear as much you will GAIN their gear. Thus S BECOME STRONGER S.I think thats where the ""breeds toxicity"" idea comes from and it makes the game unenjoyable to me. Part of the appeal of this game is the true ""survival"" and permanence of your character and stuff even when logged out but it isn't satisfying when everyone seems to want to destroy and kill everything because what the else would they do with their AK and C4.",Rust

2015-04-04,0,0,363,False,Not Recommended,"This is one of the hardest things I have ever had to write. Not to be dramatic but it is almost like a euology at dead friends funeral. You remember all of the best parts of the friendship the bad moments and the definitive end. I want to state this clearly to be sure every single person who reads this is aware I no doubt had fun with this game. BUT. I had fun with old rust honestly the best moments I have ever had were in old rust and very little in old rust. I will admit to something I believe gives me a good amount of credibility in my review I am not one of those sissies who are ""hero"" players and all that t. The people who only help people in this game are absolutely foolish their cause is pointless and will never achieve anything. I have played since the old old rust whenever everyone ed about bears and wolves and when you didnt get a good blueprint from the rad town animals. In old rust I played in a clan I played solo and I have even (regrettably) played as a hacker. Not one of the KOS ones just one who gave people free stuff. In new rust I've been in vanilla clans modded clans I've played vanilla solo modded solo and even RP solo on a medieval server. I've been ""part of the problem"" as a KOS killer I've given new players tip and resources and I've snuck through the whole world avoiding all contact with other players.The only thing that connects old rust and new rust is the developer. Old rust players who have mostly moved on from the game (unless they were like me and were young when it first came out) and the group of people that have taken their place are why this game gets negative reviews. I've met people from old rust and I can certainly promise you none of they are openly hostile without at the very least talking to you and trying to fix something be that a tax or an offering. In old rust I was in a hostage situation I had to descalate a gunfight over resources I was raided by dubstep blasting swedes and Ive built some of the largest bases in hacker valley (I did that legit not through hacks tho). This was when people in rust had to talk to one another the common player had to talk his way out of getting his head blown off and his taken. In new rust there is so often no talking. The new community of this game seem to be all of the KOS players from DayZ leaving a dead game to join a thriving game to continue the absolute savagery of killing noobs. Honestly being someone who has done it often it is so funny until they actually die. Once that player with nothing died you check their inventory and in your mind go ""what was the actual point of that?"" as you see only a torch and rock. But you just can't stop doing it. All of this game is getting bullied and bullying others back. Once someone kills you the need for vengence is instant and it doesnt seem to matter who it is. The next person you see had to die to right the wrong you faced. Anyone who denies this just hasn't looked at this game objectively and their actions likewise. This game's players will not often spare you they will blow in the wall of your house and kill you while you're at work and they have a day off school. I remember getting excited whenever I had a day off school and it wasn't a holiday that meant people from other states were offline and their bases vunerable. Oh and I almost forgot in all of my hours in this game I'd wager I've been raided around 100ish times and I truthfully only remember around 15/20 active raids (raids where I am online and able to actively defend) of my base. The rest of the time you will definitely get your walls blown open by a middleschooler with the day off. Anyway back to the main topic of this paragraph. The community in this game has taken a ""shoot first taunt over voice chat later"" theme and I just personally get behind it.This game's mechanics are fantastic the optimization is eh (it's being worked on tho facepunch is a great dev) the gunplay is intense and quick but the community will ruin any humanity you have going in to this game. You will kill out of fear and you will kill players out of greed for loot. You will enjoy this game if you played Dayz and would kill without remorse or asking questions. You will dislike this game greatly if you want a community that is sometimes hostile and would talk to you and wouldn't shoot you in the face without seeing if you'd offer resources for your life. If human contact doesn't bother you buy this game and do whatever you want the only people to punish you are those you have wronged and the best clans in the server.My last warning is to all the people who buy this game and think they can be a ""hero"" and save the population of this game from everyone who murders them. You will quickly fall into the rythm of kill or be killed there is no way around it. Being nice in this game is actually so rare people use it as clickbait titles to attract viewers. Idk about you but to me that's pretty ed up.",Rust

2013-12-23,0,0,2,True,Not Recommended,As of 12/23/13 I would not recommend this game. It's utterly lacking key pieces to an exciting game. In the short time that I played the game I met people on the rediculously over populated servers that generally killed me for my stones but that's not why I don't recommend this game I can live with a bad communitiy. Being in this early alpha the game is lacking any real point or objective rather than just kill all the freshspawns that you can.,Rust
2015-03-05,0,0,1059,True,Recommended,"First of all I want to point out that I'm still playing this game a lot. It's hard for me to decide if I should write a positive or negative review. This game has potential for sure. Without all the old and new bugs it would be a great game. But I read ingame that they wanted us to tell them they suck at their jobs and well here I am.They shouldn't be doing weekly updates. This is my first point. Why? They are putting pressure on themselves and releasing semi stable to completely unplayable content.They should spend at least one hour with testing their update if its finished. Devs themselves with their different PCs and specs should check it out before releasing the hell on everybody like people who can't see some building parts and cheat unwilligly because they can just walk through loot boxes killing people game crashes galore after retrying 1 2 sec on the server it happens again and so on. But when I saw people fly away with airdrops I wondered if Facepunch is doing night shifts with lots of alcohol or what the hell is wrong with those coders.I understand the definition of alpha but they should try to fix at least the major bugs before releasing. They shouldnt do weekly updates and they also shouldnt even announce when they update comes because right now I am waiting and waiting and waiting and I am so bored that I even write a review. When the update launches I can guarantee there will be some major bugs once again.""3 26pm EST Last minute fix for locks on armored doors just pushed... This update should hit any time now...""""4 08pm EST Devblog 50 just dropped the update should hit shortly...""Facepalm developers were probably hammering some junk code into the gamein the last 40 minutes because they want to finish the promised content. In this kind of stress situations I am not surprised that such fatal bugs occur.After all its still alpha. I liked the last update except the bugs. Don't leave all the bug testing to the community do some of it yourself.EDIT This review was 6 months old. They didn't have any major bugs and I like the new content.Thus I changed it into a positive review now.",Rust

2018-01-22,0,0,641,True,Recommended,You find yourself butt naked on a sandy beach with a beautiful sight.A rock a torch and the dream of being the best survivalist fills you with joy and happiness until a group of 5 cames up and crushes your dreams. Again. and again and again. Worst community you can find in any game with the exception of a few good peopleMost servers last no more than a day unless it is a wipe day where you wait long queue timesHowever The devs are doing a great job listening to the demands of the community and overall you will find yourself enjoying the thrill of the survival and building especially if you think you got what it takes a solo player.This game is worth it is price . Buy it play it ragequit and comeback again. 8/10,Rust
2018-04-16,0,0,1528,False,Not Recommended,"So where to start on this game. The devs arent that great at listening to players. Each month that ive noticed they keep adding certain things to help eliminate something people complain too much about even though it would be bound to happen. Ghosting can no longer be a thing now that the new team system is in (Dont mistake me for a ghoster). People who ghosted zergs succeeded because said zergs never set up traps such as shotgun traps or auto turrets that LITERALLY NEGATE GHOSTING. Instead facepunch adds a team system that allows you to be able to see who is where and if anybody is actually trying to ghost your team. So now they are INSTEAD of punishing ignorant zergs but helping them out. And that is another thing. YOU WILL GET ZERGED. Unless you play on solo/duo/trio servers (where you will still run into a bigger group than yours) you will get zerged. You cant escape them.On the topic of zergs good luck trying to play on any offiical server. A guy by the name of Neeko is what started this entire zerg how. Before when rust was actually good the only MAJOR zergs were CML and DMG. After DirtMcGirt disbanded DMG for IRL reasons Neeko made his own zerg to continue the ""zerg v zerg"" rivalry with a group i dont remember fully. But then after all of this he ended up making his own zerg and keeping it which then caused a bunch of other zergs to pop up in order to contest with a 25 year old man running 20 deep. So there is Rustafied Main in a nutshell. Now you got a guy named Jack Shepherd who makes a ""friendly"" leaderboard of every weekly wipe on the major zerg infested official servers (Rusty Moose Included). So not only do you have a game that heavily supports mass numbers but now you got the game turning itself into a ego fest becasue people want to be better than someone else. (Sure you will have that in games like this). But it isnt neccessary for groups to be rolling 30+ deep on a server with 400 pop. So unless you like playing on official where you can get zerged very easily or running on community dedicated servers that have braindead admins that will ban you for being good I would advise against getting this game. I have over 6k hours shared across multiple accounts and after playing it for almost 3 years it just isnt worth the stress that this game brings to you.",Rust

2017-05-20,0,0,1514,True,Recommended,Rust is the best survival pvp shooter on the market right now hands down. The developers are constantly updating the game and do a great job of responding to community suggestions for better or for worse. This game is HARD and you will be punished constantly for your mistakes by other players but boy is it fun once you start to get the hang of things. Playing solo will be hard but possible if your on a server that limits group size. In my opinion the best way to play is with a group of 2 5 friends. Some say the community is toxic but i dont think its any more toxic than any other competitive game. Lots of people are complaining about the twig update but they are just affraid of change. The devs are constantly testing new ways to improve the game this is early access after all and nothing game breaking ever stays to long. The dev team really know what they are doing here and really have a passion for trying to make the best game they can. That is their only goal and thats how a good developer should be.,Rust

You drop the object in your hand as well so you have to look for that in the grass.Rust is really fun to play with friends make a castle and raid others. You need lots of materials which might prove to be hard to get to make a small stone house.DangerRust has lots and lots of dangerous things like bears or that damn helicopter. The helicopter will appear from time to time shooting and bombing players with gear. The only way to kill it is to shoot it down and then the loot burns for what seems to be forever.Bears have lots of health and they can kill you with ease. One time about four friends and I attacked a bear it killed me and died after because of the twenty arrows in its face. There is also wolves but they not too dangerous.CreateIn Rust you can create castles houses towns clothing weapons and loads of other things. I personally like to build prisons for my slave friend Storm.Final thoughtsOverall it's a great game fun to play with friends and can make you rage with even a single death. It's hard but it's worth it. I recommend this game.,Rust

Out of all of them Rust's building mechanics are the best the guns feel the best (not saying much) and it not too grindy. There's only one issue with it the majority of the community is complete and utter aids. You will deal with the absolute bottom of the barrel when playing this game these kids are just the worst. Get used to using a bow and spear and you'll be fine but you'll always have to deal with the kids on the game. You have 3 kinds of people.1. ""Role Players"" is the title given to anyone who talks to anyone else. It doesn't mean the same thing in this game because of how ed the playerbase is. Have a chair somewhere in your house? Role Player. Have a carpet at your front door? Role Player. These kids can't even categorize properly. You're an RP'er if you don't KOS or use a mic.2. ""Raiders"" are just infants who wait until other players are offline to raid their base and steal their These kids don't have the mental capacity to realize that you don't always have to raid they go as far as to mock people who use mic or socialize int he slightest. It is fun to do raiding but these kids are more on the sadistic side where they don't socialize and play the game for personal benefit only. The server wipes and they come right back to do it again...it seems this play style has very little benefit of enjoyment.3. Everyone else just gets killed by raiders while looting or killed by raiders while talking to role players. That's this game.You will 90% of the time wake up somewhere random having been raided while sleeping. Enjoy.8/10",Rust

Ive played this game for over 1800 hours and still love it but cant play it anymore. The reason is the recent changes to it to fight massive clans. You have to re login every hour or so just to gind some resources to keep your base from decaying and if you forget your base and all your work is gone in just a day. Then on top of that its impossible to play by yourself. You NEED a group of at least three to do anything in this game and keep your stuff from other players for more than a day.

2016-04-15,0,0,1213,False,Not Recommended,"***********REVIEW AS OF 2 12 2018**********************As you can see I've changed my mind about Rust due to its recent return to a Blueprints system of which a vast minority wanted due to the simple fact that BPs break the core concept of Rust.I don't really need to explain this. BPs are only slightly marginally better than the leveling system was. Which was the worst place Rust has ever been due to the grind wall you had to climb to even be able to defend yourself with a basic bow. (Pretty sure bows and arrows were unlocked at level 6 or 7 so the were you supposed to do to defend yourself for the first 5 levels? Nothing. Die.)Now defensive weapons are behind a grind wall even worse. RNG BPs. The drop rate of which is abysmally low. During an hour of gameplay at a warehouse smashing barrels constantly I found only 3 blueprints all of which were decorative pieces for inside a base. No weapons. I found 12 pistol bodies 200 high quality ore thousands of frags from grinding all the useless components I was finding because I could not build anything. Then a double barrel shotgun guy ran up on me and killed me. That was where I uninstalled Rust... Again. The first time was during the leveling phase. Anyway don't expect to ever play Rust on an even field as anyone else ever again if they plan on keeping the BP system. Most of the components you find are completely useless to you even in grinding them down. You can literally do nothing with them. Carrying them just helps geared guys who kill you because they know you're carrying top tier loot because you can't do anything with it.Rust is in a terrible place right now. Certainly does not justify it's price hike. Buyer beware. Rust changes it's entire core concept every few months. This is another phase. When the devs are done jerking off over their hair models im sure they will redo everything again. Do not buy.Buyer beware.(This is all on top of the completely toxic 12 year old cancerous ""community"" who no lifes Rust to watch their virtual swing between their legs.)",Rust

2017-11-30,0,0,368,True,Not Recommended,absolute waste of 20 dollars ever since they updated it a couple months ago. this game has been ruined unless your playing with a group (5+) you probably wont even be able to play this game. instead of being able to make any item in the game as long as you had the crafting materials you now have to grind for hours just so you can get enough scrap to research how to make the simplest things like a sign or a pair of pants. 250 scrap to research a gun and breaking a barrel gives you 1 scrap. plus you cant research anything till you build a blueprint table another 500 scrap and a workbench which is another 500 scrap for a level 1 workbench 750 for level 2 workbench and 1500 for a level 3 workbench (you need at least level 2 to make guns) and you dont upgrade the workbench you have to build completely new workbenches as to build a level 2 workbench you have to already own a level 1 workbench. you also have to already have the item to research it and said item is destroyed once you research it. so as a solo player or even like i was with me and my brother. if your lucky enough like i was to get your hands on a gun you have to destroy it in order to make one yourself. just so i could make a gun i needed a total of 2000 scrap and then all the materials to make said gun. lets not forget bullets either as you need to research those as well. the way the game is now people in large groups have all the power and will kill you on sight so there is very slim odds that you will even be able to make a house. i played solo the day after the update and it took me about 4 hours just to build a house and in that time there was already groups of 10 or more people running around with guns and explosives raiding peoples bases. this game is absolute garbage now and i regret buying it. hopefully they fix the game and get rid of this stupid workbench update as it was so much fun before and now i dont even want to play it. dont buy this game it sucks now if you want to waste 20 dollars just flush it down the toilet and you will probably have more fun anyways,Rust

They keep on fixing and doing things that dont need to be added. They add new systems of getting loot every 4 months which make the game mostly unlearnable. There are groups to about 20+ that just terrorize every server that you play on. The only way to counter this is going on a trio duo and solo server which are dead and dont have active admins. Its playable when you have a good pc and friends. But not playable when you have a eh pc and barely any friends that play this game,Rust

2015-06-28,0,0,12,True,Not Recommended,I can't reccommend this game and the reason is very simple its very frustrating to play.The first thing is that it is based on a leveling system something that DOES NOT and WILL NEVER work in a survival game like this. Players starting out will be very frustrated by their inability to craft advanced weapons armor and gear and be forced to spend hours grinding to be able to craft but will be killed often by players who just want blood.The next thing is the experienced players don't want to help you. They want to keep you alive long enough to laugh at you and then dance around your dying corpse and maybe not even that long. Even if you have good gear you're going to lose it within 10 minutes to someone who has a better spot on the map than you even better gear and more people. When you walk outside your base with good loot on you're going to lose it. And if its not the first or second encounter it's gonna be the third or fourth.The fun part about survival games is rarely the PVP. PVP is like the icing on the cake the core of these games is meeting the funny and interesting people along the way meeting your enemies meeting friends and meeting that Bill Cosby impersonator fresh spawn who for some reason just will not leave you alone. And RUST just doesn't create that experience the only types of people you'll meet are the blood thirsty wolves that just wanna be s and show you how much of a bigger they have than you by picking on the little guys.RUST succeeds in its gun play beautiful enviornment base building mechanics and how smooth it feels or how clunky it doesn't feel. Even all of this and an excellent development team at Facepunch is still not enough to make up for just how truly bad the experience is.RUST fails in so many aspects to deliver a real survival game experience and I truly expected more from a talented development studio.2/10 death simulator,Rust

If you liked minecraft but have grown out of it i definitely suggest this. Im sure there have been a ton of improvements since ive played but im looking at it from how it was a year ago. It was challenging frustrating and tedious but thats what makes a good game good. I suggest you make friends on it because if you start out alone you most likely wont make it.,Rust

And as many people said prior to this review the devs don't seem to care about any of this. I seriously think this will never get a beta / launch date seriously. This game is being trampled by a lot of newer titles that already show (mind you with just a few weeks in on early access) themselves more promising than the final product (?if ever) RUST is gonna be.Don't waste your money or time on this look for other titles that are more compromised with developing/delivering a product that focus on you having fun than this one.,Rust

2016-03-02,0,0,797,True,Recommended,"Okay. So after about 800h and 2 years following the updates and changes i have some things to say. Not all bad and not all good.Sit down have a drink and listen to what this nobody from the internet has to say about this game.Firstly i would say that this game in its current state is meant almost a 100% for team players. Playing solo no matter how good you are will get you rekt and will leave you with a bleeding 9/10 times. Solo players live for that 1 time though where they wreck a clans day and leave them saltier than the Dead sea.As for the system goes..... I dont know really. It changed alot in the last year. I quit when they released the XP system and came back like a week ago. Nothing will ever be as good as the old BP system. If you are into base building then Rust is pretty much the best in that aspect. You can build pretty much whatever you want but in the end you will be offline raided by a clan with no problems at all. There are some smart people playing this game i will tell you that.If you are new to this than my advice and pretty much anyone elses who spent a couple hundred hours in this game is that DONT play on the official servers as they are full of hackers that are fine and ready to take your vaseline free and leave it sore and red. Community servers are a bit better regarding hackers altough if you dont play on Rustafied Rustopia or Rusty moose you will most likely suffer from a fatal disease called admin abuse which is spreading like a plague. If you do find a server that hasnt got any and can keep up high pop trough all of the wipe stick to it like on my toilet wall.This game is not for casual players. If you cant play for atleast 40 50 hours a week you will not get to experince the game whole and will only play what we call ""Early game"" and maybe ""mid game"". Low tier weapons and people trying to hunt down farmers. You wont be able to be there when high lvl loot raids go down and see the cryies of a thousand man clans of 12 year old who type or Turk amk in chat....what made me stick to this game in the first place was the community in the begging which was nice and helpful. later that changed into KOSing 12 year olds that can barely speak english trough their 1 microphones that they got in a 12 pack of dads beer. If you have a decent computer you will be able to run this game as it was meant and the game looks absolutely stuning on Fantastic. If you are like me than you will most likely choose the Potato setting for that extra 10 FPS. All in all i will say this game is worth buying for 20 . This game wasnt meant to be played 2 hrs a day every week or so. This game was meant to rack up hundreds of hours in a month or two. The only way you will enjoy playing it if you dont give up afer being killed 10 times on wipe day by a screaming kid with a spear.I'm out and God bless",Rust

One second you're aiming at the ground and the next you're aiming at the sun straight up. Overall. Great game especially the building mechanics. One of my favorite.,Rust

2017-07-06,0,0,752,True,Not Recommended,This game's development cycle has looped around for the worse.Not counting Legacy there has been BP which people liked. XP which people seemed to like but it wasnt well recieved apparently components which had no progression and made the game as a whole worse and now components with blueprintsNow scrap used to be used to make components but now it's just a diet bp frag with components having to be recycled to get them in any amount high enough to be even remotely useful and scraps just function as XP that can be lost and workbenches just function as levels that can be lost.The Dev's work hard to produce stuff every week but they half literally everything and anything and all the while only somewhat listen to the community. They're too stubborn to let the fan base decide what to do and when they actually do listen its to the bad ideas just making it a self fulfilling prophecy to them so they no longer trust the community and self justify it with their own lack of thought.I legitimately want to like this game but not only do they keep looping around with what they do they remove the good parts and half bake their replacements.,Rust

I reccomend this game to people. just put some time into the game and get semi decent and it might make your expeirence of the game alot easier.,Rust

2016-02-08,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,Bought Rust specifically yesterday on the 8th of February 2016 .Started game .Ended up spending 1 and a half hours trying to ''Wake up'' and still unsuccesful .No joke I am unable to play due to the developers who are lazy mindless and clearly dumb to see the problems.You can blur the of the player models of every angle but not fix something so simple ? The bug has been going on since 2014 and I would've expected it to be fix by then but cleary it isn't. I purchased the knowing it was an alpha game yes I know but considering it's an alpha game and not allowing me to even PLAY IT IS ING DAYLIGHT ROBBERY .I am extremely dissapointed in the game and probably the worst game I've bought close to Aliens Colonial Marines.Save your cash and save your troubles from buying this garbage of a game .,Rust

2018-04-17,0,0,3491,False,Not Recommended,Unplayable unless you either play with a bounch of people (which simply isnt fun unless you are terrible at the game because it ruins the challange of pve and pvp) or if your entire life is revolving around rust only.Did'nt use to be like this but after they made litteraly anything that is even remotly good completly unaffordable to solo/duo players it became dull as hell.Stylistically the game was at its best with the xp system actually giving solo players an even playing field with clans when it came to progression. These days you can pretty much forget ever reliably owning anything better than a semi pistol and wood armour if you're playing solo or duo.Facepunch has kept saying they are unable to find a proper solution to the unfairness between solo players and clans but its silly... since they had the solution in the XP system.The fact that they've also made everything which is somewhat decent exstremly expencive is yet another thing heavily favouring clans as they are the only ones able to obtain the high tier stuff giving them both numbers and gear advantages. This did'nt use to be a problem either when gear and guns were cheaper it gave solo/duo players even firepower at the very least allowing skilled individuals to actually put up a fight facepunch seems to have completly missunderstood how to make progression work making the guns expencive and hard as hell to craft is not the right way and the current system is just a mess.This would all be fixed if they just never went away from the xp system such a clean simple and functioning progress system the game could've been great with it now.,Rust
2018-02-12,0,0,546,False,Recommended,The game is super frustrating at times you constantly get killed and yelled at by salty people but I mean once you meet some new people and make good friends you succeed and get good and feel good. Then you get to go raid people and them over and kill all the people you see after you were killed. The nudity is kind of nasty and distgusting and even when censored the game can glitch and you still see the stinky and crooked (no homo) kind of which there was a DLC thats free and makes it so all charecters spawn with shorts if male. and shorts and bra for women. for those who dont want to see the disgusting nudity but other then that its a frustrating but rewarding game and defintly worth a buy if you already own many other good games but some games do come before rust. In my opinion. This is just a review and just my opinion. If you disagree with me that is totally alright we all have are own opinions!,Rust

2018-02-01,0,0,281,True,Not Recommended,Rust My summed up thoughts of the game and how this review should influence your decision to be the one of the many thousands who purchase a copy of Rust or one of many who don't own it.Rust a progressive game followed closely by community support (mostly depending on what server you play)in an official server you are handicapped greatly if you play alone the only way to have the upper hand in combat is by outnumbering your opponents or by relying on your experience and confidence in landing shots and dealing fast enough to escape death that is if your opponent isn't using some form of assistive aim don't get me wrong all games have some form of scripters to assist their combat in some way and gain an unfair advantage which isn't a problem for some people but however Rust is an and I stress greatly a very time consuming game you either have to be a youtuber who can be on rust and make money doing it or a near no life to have the time to maintain a base alone that is and even then there is still a possibility of a scripter destroying your time spent on a server within minutes.with rust getting a price mark up I have one thing to say for people looking to buy rust.1 unless you can afford to play nearly 24/7 you can't maintain a base easy this game will destroy your will to play or give you an brain stroke out of anger when you log in one day to find your base leveled2 (official) servers wipe all bases and characters every week which is a problem even for people who do play nearly 24/7you can avoid this by playing on community servers that wipe once every month or two weeks3 (official) servers extremely are toxic if the internet hasn't given you very thick skin by now your emotional stability may not be stable for long4 even if you refrain from playing on official servers some community servers may be as toxic or may have abusive or admins that cheat players out of their well earned loot and why would you want to take that risk when you can just play officialI fell for one of the many pre alpha rust videos and bought the game upon release and it has less scripters than what you may come across today but the time you have to put into this game just isn't worth it only to have it gone in a week (or month) that is... if you don't get raided beforehand,Rust

2018-08-15,0,0,3,False,Not Recommended,The game engine itself is impressively massive with all the detailed info to be honest. However as a game it is not something a normal person who has a life should play.First of all despite having a more than acceptable rendering engine with tons of effects the 3D models especially the players/characters are very ugly.Secondly the loading time is ridiculously long upto the point that there was once I started loading the game poured myself a cup of coffee had it finished (without haste) and the game was still loading.Thirdly the game system fosters a very unbalanced gameplay experience where people with more friends will dominate the servers. The way that players' hardwork cannot be secured the way that players can form groups to bully those without and the way that players cannot save their progress and can be killed having all the hardwork looted upon disconnection all these turn newcomers into prey and the bottom part of the game's foodchain.All in all I don't recommend this game to any sane people who have a real life and don't have hundreds of hours to spend just to kickstart. If you don't mind keep getting killed and have your hardwork looted so that you have to restart from nothing but a rock and a torch go for it.I have a lot of games since I was a kid with Nintendo gamewatch.

2017-12-13,0,0,981,True,Recommended,I can't really recommend to buy this game or not but I do have a few things to say first off if you are a really salty person it may be difficult to play this game. But other than skill and things we can't control there are things that annoy me first of all the recoil on the guns is crazy maybe tone it down a bit and then there's also the grindy part of it with the blueprints which I don't personally like very much. So if yo ucan handle grinding for hours then possibly dying and losing it all then this may be the game for you. I honestly think this game isn't horrible I enjoy it a lot though it is a lot easier/more fun when you have friends to tag along with you. Hope this helped,Rust

2017-12-20,0,0,1705,True,Recommended,I don't know what to say about this game so here is a recipe for pancakes Ingredients 1½ cups all purpose flour3½ tsps baking powder½ tsp salt¼ cup sugar1¼ cups milk1 egg3 tbsp butter meltedInstructions Melt the butter in microwave for 30 seconds set aside.In a medium bowl mix together flour sugar salt and baking powder.Stir milk and egg together.Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.Pour the butter and milk mixture into the well.Use a wire whisk to stir everything together until just combined. It will be slightly thick and lumpy but should be well incorporated.Allow the batter to rest while heating a lightly oiled skillet or griddle to medium high heat.Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake.Cook each side for 3 6 minutes until lightly golden brown.,Rust

2014-02-02,0,0,24,True,Not Recommended,This game suffers from a similar dilema as Dayz SA you can find everything in one location. What does that mean? Huge groups camping RAD zones and dominating servers. Much like its counter part Dayz which this is apparently a knock off of. Long story short its just another Alpha and the only thing that would make this purchasable is if you want to play with a large group of friends.,Rust

2017-11-14,0,0,837,True,Recommended,To me the game is awsum!!!!Rust is a great game it can be toxic as players can do a lot of different things. Basically you can be and will likely be killed on site by at least 90% of the other players. Starting this game and being solo can be quite difficult I recommend learning with a friend . Eventually make friends with other players whether they're neighbors or people from forums looking to team up. It is a survival game you have to survive and pvp is an element of that other people want the resources and weapons you have. It's great because when the world goes to this is exactly what would happen.So this is a must try!!!,Rust

2017-11-15,0,0,69,True,Recommended,Product received for free. There are three ways to play.1) Casually for a few hours but you'll have to restart every other night you log on if you don't have your things squared away nicely. (perfect for threatening your friends with your barrel prized shotgun) 2) Overbearingly serious where you and groups of people you hope to trust and their followers pull shifts and watches building guarding and grinding. (too much effort but plenty of loot)3) Live Die Repeat. Every time you spawn in your first concern is a bow and arrow and you make every attempt to kill as many as you can before you are killed bases and resources will mean nothing to you only blood.,Rust

If you like PVP this is also the game for you. But if you are teh type of person that get frustrated easily from losing your things youve grinded for this isnt your game as you can lose a couple weeks worth of work in an hour. This game requires patience stealth precision and skill to get good at.

2016-08-31,0,0,263,True,Recommended,I have over 60 hours in Rust so I decided to write a short review with my thoughts on the game so far.I play mostly as a solo player lonewolfing my way up in the brutal world of Rust just so you know my point of view in this review. As a note I haven't played Rust before the XP went live so I have no idea if it's better or worse now than it was in the past. All I know is that XP system works great for me I love that moment when I ding and new unlocked designs start poping up. That gives me the sense of adventure and progression I'm looking for in games.As for the graphics they really hit the spot for me the yellows the browns sunsets early mornings it's all beautiful. I have played other survival games like The Forest Ark 7 Days to Die and none of them was as good looking as Rust is from personal esthetic point of view. I have an old rig so I can't play on max settings but I'm amazed how well optimized this game is. I never had any crashes or bugs that would keep me from enjoying the game fully. Interface is clear menus are easy to navigate. Everything is very intuitive.Now for the community. Oh where to start. Let me tell you about my first adventure. I was butt naked and running around like a happy monkey just built my small base and put truly amazing lock on the door for protection. Oh boy was I proud and excited. While exploring I saw big metal dome and thought wow nice place I should visit there must be loot somewhere. On the spot I heard a loud bang that sounded like a shotgun. As I turned around I saw a naked guy running towards me and screaming Allahu Akbar! on the mic. Few seconds later I was dead. Quickly respawning on my bag I run down the stairs only to watch in horror that my murderer just opened my locked door and entered the house. Few seconds later I was laying on the floor wounded. He helped me up. The door was locked. I couldn't get out. I didn't know back then that you can lose your base when you lose the key. I knew I could kill myself with console command and respawn in random place but I didn't want to do it. I wanted to play the psychology game. My murderer started speaking with some creepy voice. He called me his princess (my character is female) and I think he was looking for a pet (or a sex slave). He took my rock so I couldn't do anything to him. I did the only thing that came to my mind I stood next to the locked door. He wounded me few times and helped me up while still speaking creepy stuff in his creepy voice but he couldn't get out of the house. I knew he didn't want to kill me he wanted to break me. I stood silently by the door blocking his way out. When I was wounded again he still couldn't get out. I really started to enjoy my time in Rust. After few minutes he got angry gave up and killed me I considered myself satisfied.Other things that happened to me in Rust include a guy wearing only pants chopping down trees next to my base while singing Rivers of Babylon to the mic cooking in the base while suddenly hearing that someone is at my door singing in high pitched voice opeeeen the dooooor getting killed on sight killing someone with a bow for the first time getting killed by a bear killing a glitched bear and many more.I wouldn't say the community in Rust is cancerous. For me such a community exists for example in DOTA a game that I have only played for few hours and never want to get back to again. Of course you will find trolls who will just kill you again and again and again just for laughs. There will be people who will want to ruin your game because they can. But there will also be people who will help you. People who will offline raid you but take only stuff they need and leave everything you need to survive another day. Rust brings out the best and worst in people it seems.If you want you can always find a mature server with active admins and rules about griefing and killing new players. But all in all if you can't find a way around in your mind about people who play Rust to ruin someones experience you might have problem with this game. But I love it because it's mostly full of creeps not trolls. This world is a mixture of Lord of the flies Mad Max and Arkham Asylum. If you can live with that and find yourself a place in it you will have an amazing time.Servers have a wipe from time to time your base will get raided. If you're not prepared to start from zero many times you might want to skip Rust. Or you can adapt. Make some stashes in the bushes hide your most valuable stuff. Strategicaly place sleeping bags in spots that can give you adavntage if your base gets raided. By no means I am a pro player and I don't intend to give any tips. I'm just trying to survive like the rest of players and having great amounts of fun while doing it. I'm making mistakes and try to learn from them. Build better bases and play Rust on my terms while accepting the consequences of my choices.For me Rust is a psychology game. One that will make you excited everytime you're going out of the base everytime you see a person on the horizon. Because you never know if it's a friendly player or an enemy posing as someone who needs help. People even play the sound of dying man to the mic to lure you out of the house that's amazing! Everytime I die I lose all of my stuff I get raided I want to improve and that feeling keeps me coming back to Rust.,Rust

2017-10-26,0,0,378,True,Recommended,Ever since Rust introduced the ranked matchmaking system there has been a large amount of strategy and planning beforehand required to even come close to the top tier competitive world. The only way to play the game is solo since the solo/duo queue was never meant for teamwork and choosing someone else to group with is a sure fire way of losing your edge. First things first You have to pick your runes and masteries. Normally cooldown reduction runes and perks that lead up to Thunderlord's will easily net you the seven killstreak required for the attack helicopter reward which will inevitably win you the game through sheer brutality and a higher score count. Just a quick reminder that you have to flame anyone in chat that uses the ACR since that gun is for nerds and weaboos. Pros always use the desert eagle as their primary weapon despite the fact that you cannot equip it in the primary weapon slot in your create a class menu you have to beat the game with legendary difficulty on at all times ever since you last left Helgen. If you manage to mine enough stone to make a pickaxe you can start mining for the next tier of tools which are iron tools.The rest of the guide can be seen on my Let's Play series recorded on the Nintendo Switch gaming console.,Rust

( i wouldnt play this solo if you dont want to)does the price match the game you get?20 bucks may be a bit overprized because of the amount of lag and bugs and it still being early access.you'll at least get something for it. and the pure farming pays off with a reward of being good.cons this game will make you go insanethis game is by far the best rage game ever created by human handsthis game lags bugs and servers with abusive admins and modsthis game has to many clans to even be called solo friendlyyou'll die by chopperyou'll die by spearyou'll die by stoneyou'll die by akyou'll die by bowyou'll die by wolfyou'll die by playersyou'll die by cold and hungeryou'll die from radsyou'll kill yourself ingame because the spawn made you spawn near clan bases that spawns kills youyou'll die by firethis game willmake you spend your sanity on survivaling in your 1x2 base with codelocked wooden door wondering when the door camper will leavethis game willmake you meet people who kills you even if you had a stonethis gamewill give you a gun and then make you die by a pigthis game is the perfect guide to roof campingthis game chat is by far the toxic chat and you wont get any help by anyone.this game prays on your soul and will offer you a little amount of self pride.and last of all.This game is still beautieful.the sunset over the sea. with a campfire and some water and the sunset going down and the stars coming up.and the night is by far the best thing.You can see ***** and you'll spend 6 mins trying to find your door in to your room with help from the red lamp on the codelock.,Rust

2017-07-21,0,0,52,True,Not Recommended,I think I can finally write a review for this after seeing more the the current direction of this game. After seeing the latest developments in addition to the fact that this game is STILL in pre release I can safely say that you should not buy this game (unless you are cool with a sandbox of perpetuating 'work in progress')I bought this game maybe years ago when it was in alpha. it had a decent amount of content. it was entertaining for a while as I played with friends. we quickly got bored though as we were not into this type of game. after all this time I came back to play a bit more. I played on some custom servers some empty servers some high pop servers so that I could see the breadth of this game. There is barely more content then when I got it however many years ago. that is sad. The conclusion is so simple that I really dont think I need to make this review all that big. The dev has absolutely no idea what he wants this game to be. He started with a concept and then broke down and let his (apparently) severe ADD take this game on a frickin roller coaster ride into nowhere special. Bugs galore fragmented purpose in the game. It does tons of different stuff and very little of it well. Half of what you do is meaningless in the grand scheme of even your own playing ofthe game. its a sad example of games that use pre release as an excuse to blow their lack of direction out of proportion and then claim they have some semblance of a good game. im being harsh because this game has been in pre release. . . . how many years now? and has barely more then when i started. Furthermore isnt going anywhere coherent.,Rust

2016-07-25,0,0,1274,True,Recommended,Where to start? (forgive my spelling)I have been playing this game ever since the old Rust and over the years I have watched it grow into something spectacular. Even threw it's MANY flaws I adore the hell out of this game. Rust hasnt just been a game I have come to love but a game where I can reminice over all the good and bad that has happend while playing. I built Rome in a day. I concurred bases with an army of nakeds. I waged war on the Cosbys. I fought along side Pumkin agenst Corn. I developped communities castels cities and I defended them all from raiders. I have met good friends and I have met others that make you go off in chat. I have laughed countless times over the random moments this game has to offer and I have never seen such dedication from this games players. Much love to every corner of this community. I look forward to seeing where Rust will end up when it's fully done.P.s If you see a boar make sure its not a bear. Chase,Rust

2016-07-26,0,0,1558,True,Recommended,I LOVED it. Once i started playing i couldnt stop i had to play the whole wipe. I'm family man and i cant spend all that time just playing. I bought this in summer or 2015 and man it was fun to learn all the things and to get to know the neighbours. Some of them were bloodsucking murderers and that caused me to get to know other ppl living nearby and doing teamwork to evict bad neighbours. And this game NEVER have i had a game that got me shaking this bad after i got some nice loot D Soooo many fun times.i played almost 80 90% time as solo i had the advantage of living in a timezone when i started my day in rust most ppl had gone to sleep and i could set up my base pretty peacfully on rustafied main. I had some teams at times but i couldn't stand ppl who joined everytime after the base was ready and set up with guns just to come and loose all the gear. And thats why i liked playing solo most of the time or maybe in a team of 2 3 at most. first iteration of bp's was pretty bad you couldnt get above 30% on research table. i got C4 blueprint maybe 2 3 times in whole year and i played almost 5 8hrs a day. OFC u could trade it but damn i found it hard to trust anyone on vanilla. On modded it was easier beacause ppl didnt care so much about the loot they just wanted to have good time. Many ppl took it way too serious thou. Once i had to research bolt on research table for 4 5 times and i had 3 bolts that was so many HQM that i couldnt make any guns after i got the BP. Sometimes i got AK on a first try. Afterwards they made BP system better you could add frags to get higher % and it was pretty fine. You had some way of controlling the % of the research.i played some time on pre release and the XP system was fun about 1 months before releasing it on the main game you could get XP's pretty fast and easily(but not too easily) after 2 weeks it was in the main game it turned into a grind but i didnt care that much. it was fine. I liked more about making friends and helping ppl. Im taking a break now until XP system stabilizes and its summertime here. I'v been playin way too much anyway. Its up to you if you make the game fun. different servers have different ppl and if your not having fun try other servers. battlefield servers are good way to learn to use the guns and teamwork with your team.. teamwork is really important on this game like REALLY important. try the modded servers community and vanilla and see which you like the best dont try to force yourself to have fun on a roofcamping server.,Rust

I would like to say that I am really disappointed though I did quite enjoy the old Rust game (Rust legacy) however this was removed completely which made me lose my interest in the game for a long time. I just started getting into the new game and I must say I really enjoy it. The people are still as salty as they were the roof campers are reunited and the nakeds even got a guitar for some epic street performances.

The only downside is that you really need time if you don't have any it's quite hard to succeed because the other people on the server will get better equip.

2018-08-28,0,0,1333,False,Recommended,SOOOOOOOO where do we START. First of all Yes It has a toxic community yes playing solo is very hard yes you need to invest a lot of time and yes its hard to understand the basis of the game at first. But rust is much more than this it is a wonderful game most of the time sometimes you will meet some players that would be nice some not. Once you really get into it there is no getting back because each months the devs releases new updates that makes it more interesting (such as gambling *btw really adictive). The feeling of accomplishment when you get something done on wipeday is like in no other game. Try to get allied with people around you (so they don't raid you) and go raiding with them to get that 20 man korean zerg out of the server. Go and make plays with your spears when you are just a naked. To conclude Rust is a beautiful game not only the graphics wise but also the experience you get through time you will learn when to trust people or not. There is no better word to describe this game than the word RUST.,Rust

2018-03-05,0,0,96,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rust is an amazing game the type that you'll find yourself playing for 17 hours straight without realizing it. The mechanics are amazing crafting system is great exploration never gets old since the maps are huge. It's extremely fun to play with friends but it does have one huge flaw you can't make your own private server for you and your friend. It's one of the game's only flaws but it is a major one since without a private server you always run the risk of being murdered forced to commit suicide (Report that when it happens) or raided. However it is up to you whether you play on a PVP server which allows behaviors such as raiding and killing on sight or play on a PVE server which bans such behavior. Now althoughPVE doesn't allow raiding killing or looting it is still recommended that you fortify your base since people will undoubtebly loot you if you make it easy (Dc'ing in the middle of nowhere with hella items.) The game's a strong 8.5/10 for me it's score lowered by the lack of private servers.,Rust

2014-02-09,0,0,78,True,Not Recommended,After several attemps at playing this game I've summed it's complete disaster of a game design down to one issue it is a social survival game that requires too much time. You are probablyasking why this is an issue for a survival game so let me explain.Rust is an Ayn Rand wet dream. Those who invest the most time will have an unimaginable advantage over others to the extent that the only way to contest this is to force server wipes to restore some sort of balance. And who are these people who gain complete control over the server anti social nobody's and kids. The exact type of person you would never get any power in real life because they lack all comprehension when evaluating the appropriate response for a social setting. Therefore the community of Rust is just childish and very unforgiving to anyone who wishes to play it even somewhat casually. First Impression You would think this would be an entertaining game but it is pretty pointless. EVERYONE kills on sight. And PvE is pointless because there is no reason to play an ultra easy survival game.Simply put people are dumb. Unless you have a IRL group of friends who will play this for you then you will not enjoy this.That said I will still probably play this from time to time. The game does need a way of easing the kill of sight t that make the game more about grinding for a monsterous amount of resources to hopefully incentivize the mindless mob to attack someone else's house..My suggestion DO NOT BUY THIS Dev Blog 121 Review Rust has had this problem since the beginning. I occasionally check back on updates when people like Faceless Zuckles or Rhino Crunch post videos on YouTube. Don't get me wrong the game is probably fun if you can spend 2 3 hours playing it every day without break. For that reason I basically haven't played rust in like a Year outside of like 5 hours scattered across a few patch tests.Rust consistently forces players to join clans and they offer no alternative play styles for people who would want to have a try at survival without dedicating hour every single day.Simply put Rust has (and probably will always have) bad game design because the developers will never address the very serious issue of unstoppable snowballing which nearly every AAA multiplayer game addresses effectively.People who join clans and play all day handicap skill with their time to the extent that casual players who might be clever builders/gathers and skillful shots will 8/10 get wiped. Adding to this has a severe shortage on mechanics which leads to these unstoppable groups steam rolling the quarter of half of the map where they have their bases.Basically this is ONLY for players willing to throw a solid 10 20 hours a week every week into this game alone. This game is essentially a part time job that you don't get paid to do.,Rust
2015-05-20,0,0,76,True,Recommended,"While a huge percentage of the community for this game is simply ""I see someone else lets up their day"" this game can be enjoyed by yourself or with friends. I highly recommend avoiding public servers at all cost unless you have an army of friends playing with you. Because building up a few hours of work and having it all torn down within seconds is not fun. Maybe for the attacker but in this case you are not the attacker. You are the guy that got 1 shot from a gun a few yards away. While many can argue by saying that Rust's community is welcome to players that simply isn't true. As it was said in the Escapist the only time you will not be attacked is if the other person is either less or equally as geared up as you. I give this game a positive review because a good experience can be had for a day or so on a single server. You will have one of those rare occasions where you will not be hunted down or killed on the spot. You may actually get to have fun with the other players on the server! Yes I know I say ""might"" a lot. That is just the sad truth though. This review is not meant to please anyone I'm just stating a simple opinion internet which I know is a dangerous idea. So enjoy the game if you have friends or if you wish to nomad around until death ""mysteriously"" falls upon you.",Rust

Rust is one of those games.Rust is the ONLY survival game on Steam that is barebones and won't treat you like a simpleton. The game has it's share of babies playing no different than any other MP game the difference in Rust is the devlopers won't bend the knee for their kind and ruin the game at the expense of the core gamer. Rust is as barebones/hardcore as you the gamer would want your survival exprience to be. When you die it's going to be 100% your fault 99% of the time. The game will not hold your hand. As a gamer you need to be self sufficient and mindful of your actions. Common sense goes a long way in surviving a game like Rust. There's no gimmicky progression systems or item based mechanics. You can do anything from the start so long as you can get the recources to make it. There's no ""progression wall"" in your way. Rust is as good as it gets for the survival genre. No one else comes close the rest that tried ended up pandering to alternative gamers.",Rust

2016-11-15,0,0,658,True,Recommended,"This is my experience playing Rust. There are plenty of good things but some bad things.Pros Such a fun game. Takes time dedication and persistence to actually go well which I like. Very rewarding in the end. Great game to play with friends. Raiding others and trying to defend your base is very fun. The developers have implemented the perfect items for raiding and defending. Great fun. The developers bring out good updates and aren't afraid to try new things (some may disagree with me) A game that you can play for hours and still have so much more to do. There is no real ""end"" or point that you are so overpowered there is nothing else to do. Great controls. Features such as ALT to move your head around without turning your body are VERY helpful. Facepunch always comes out with really good updates. I've never felt like they've released something too overpowered or glitchy it's always thouroughly worked on before released to the public so their updates are always fantastic (in my opinion). Facepunch always accepts community created skins which I think is awesome. It's great to know that the community can play a part in what the developers are creating. Pvp in Rust is just so fun. It gets your adrenaline going like mad and is so satisfying when you see the opponent go down. You don't just have to farm to get rich you can also pvp!Cons I don't exactly like the start menu (not the in game menu the start menu where u choose your settings resolution etc. This is my personal opinion and I dont think it is very detailed at all. It should all just be in game. This is not much of a problem though because it doesn't bother me. There is no exclusive full screen. It's either borderless windowed or windowed.Overall Rust is an amazing game. It requires persistence and patience and really gets your adrenaline going. I swear a game has never gotten my nerves racking this much! I rate this 9.5/10. Fantastic game but has it's flaws.",Rust

I had a server with friends where we would build massive bases and raid them to destruction. It was mindless make and break fun. Then the devs decided to get ""serious"" about the game and implemented a massive overhaul. Everything since has been a downward spiral.If you simply think you can hop onto any server and start playing you are sadly mistaken. You will be robbed griefed killed and laughed at. Even if you do manage to find a good server with good people you are still faced with some of the worst optimization issues I've ever seen in a game. Add to that the fact that this game will apparently be in ""early development"" until the end of time and you start to realize how pointless it becomes. Servers are wiped frequently new updates bring news bugs quantity is given preference over quality and the game remains utterly pointless.As much as I used to love Rust and as much as I want to love it now I simply cannot recommend this game as it is.",Rust

2017-01-24,0,0,293,True,Not Recommended,I'd say rust was a fun game because of all the challenge for survival such as Starvation Dehydration Coldness Bears and Wolves and fighting other players. Given that Rust IS a survival game and with that comes PVP sincec it has a combat system such as using pretty much anything you can get your hands on as weapons and wearing clothing and the like for armor for protection. I'd say PvP is really fun because that is where the thrill is. Aside from the occasional lag or server crashing nothing really seemed off with Rust. But then during the PvP fights I encountered players who seemed to be hackers because sometimes their bullets would go through walls and a number of times my friends and people I know are killed in less than a few sesconds after meeting them even when we were fully armored and covered. So right now I'd pretty much like to raise the issue of hackers in Rust since they pretty much ruin the whole gameplay experience. I hope Rust does something about the hackers since they have discouraged me from continuing to play Rust since my hard work is basically thrown away just because some players hacked their way to winning.,Rust
2016-08-12,0,0,85,True,Recommended,Ahhh a brand new world awaits me. I wake up with nothing but my trusty rock and a torch and venture forward into the vast unkown world. I wonder far and wide collecting many resources but no place yet to call home. After breaking a few barrels I manage to clothe myself and amongst the wreckage of barrels and discarded clothes I find it... My calling.. I pick it up and give it a mighty strum! I can feel the strings vibrate through the body and at that moment I knew.. My calling was to be a wondering bard! And thus I went serenading many a person with my unique talents. And as I traveled to and fro from land to land I find it. A suitable valley to call home. I set up a small wooden house make a small storage box and store any uneeded items and go forth to gather resources. After many hours I finally manage a stone house and have made myself more secure. I have a sheet metal door with a code lock and thus protect my greatest treasure safely hidden away. It has been 8 hours since I was born in this world and after 4 more I finally gather enough resources to upgrade over half of my house straight from rock to sheet metal. I could never have been happier all those hours I had been out gathering metal ore. I had never felt safer in my life! Long story short a guy waited around 30 minutes to an hour for me to come back so he could kill me and take all my stuff. 10/10 would play again.,Rust

There is no excuse for that kind of dickery. I find this game is best if you own a server and can play on it alone without other players building then when you're bored of that go play 5 minutes of PVP then realise why you were playing on your own private server. The whole arbitry gender thing irked me I don't like being assigned a character based off a number but I can live with that.

If you are looking for a fun easy but challenging game then rust is for you. A lot of people say that rust is ""dying"" because the sales gradually keep depleting. I set up a survey about why people stopped and almost 90% of people said it was because of hackers. The reason why people hack is because they are just trash at the game and cant play fair but what really hurts them is when they get banned Others said it was too hard because they died once and gave up. rust is all about dying and restarting but sometimes when people mess with you you just got to get back up and get revenge. Another complaint is that the developers are doing bad. I think the developers are doing amazing and doing as much as they can to make this game even better than it is.

2014-11-08,0,0,503,True,Recommended,"I love Rust.It was given to me by a friend as a gift and it was one of the best gifts I have received in a long time.It is a ton of fun navigating the map collecting resources building fighting raiding etc. You will get to lots of points where you rage and you will lose your stuff but you have to just pick yourself up and move on.The game is amazing but I have just over 90 hours and I am done. I have done everything in the game you can do. I am not sure if the game is really short or if I just play really fast. I look at people with 1000+ hours and I scratch my head and say ""how can anyone play this game that long?"". It is still the best 90 hours of my gaming life despite that.An integral part of the game are your friends. You need friends in Rust. Without friends you are a sitting duck because everyone else will be in a gang and nobody is recruiting unfortunately they will kill you and after they do that and take your stuff they will leave you for a day let you collect some resources and then come and take it all again. Without a few friends to watch your back you will be taken advantage of until you cannot play anymore and have to find another server.Rust is a fantastic game but you might spend most of the time in the dark hoping someone doesn't come and bash your door down but it gets really fun when you get weapons and become the hunter.We just won't talk about the hackers though. We are fortunate that there are a lot less now than there used to be.",Rust

PLAY OUR GAME EVERYDAY AND ALL DAY OR ELSE YOU LOSEYou start off with only a rock so you have to commit A LOT and usually you have to join right after server resets because that's when the best/most stuff are available. From what I've experienced people really love killing you this guy for example intentionally wore clothes around our base to attract helicopter fire against us. Yeah real nice community I can totally progress in this game.

2016-06-05,0,0,52,True,Recommended,This game is great and loads of fun. That is if you consider getting raped by some jackass with a crossbow and their hanging out every five seconds to be fun. The community is really hit or miss. Either the person you're talking to is really chill or they're a complete out to ruin your day and on your base. Eating and drinking are difficaulties. I would STRONGLY reccomend playing this with friends. I personally have no friends and I get by booty hole torn open on a regular basis. But I can't complain for a game still in alpha this game is really impressive. The house/base building is a lot of fun and pretty detailed and the combat is entertaining. I would reccomend this game but only if you don't mind getting destroyed for the first few hours you put in.,Rust
2016-11-21,0,0,55,True,Recommended,After a short time playing I'd say this game is flawed (technical and graphical issues) but it's alpha so expectations need not be through the roof. The learning curve is pretty steep and I can definitely see it discouraging new players....learning the game and learning the behaviors of the community. Soloing in the game can be done but it does feel like you're progressing at a snails pace. As satisfying as it is to escape the insanity of the opening moments of the game surrounded by naked people with rocks all mindlessly bashing each other over the head for petty resources and finally find a space to set up your staging base it's in equal parts dishearening to have all of that time and effort wiped clean when you log back in the following day. It's a harsh reality that despite your best efforts at the time if someone wants into your base they're getting in. With that said I enjoy the challenge and look forward to logging back in to see if my base is still standing. This of course is a short lived goal but the world of Rust provides a great deal of freedom to players. I spent an entire day going around a server placing chests containing nothing but a story I wrote about the person who killed me earlier in the game. Another time whenever anyone would try to give me items I would immediately run away from them. As they chased me yelling about being friendly (while peppering in warnings that they would kill me if I didn't take their stuff) I would head for the nearest body of water and drown myself in front of them. Was it a waste of time? Sure was but damn it if it didn't make me laugh at the time.In the future I'll probably slave myself out and get more integrated into working with groups. Right now I'm enjoying soloing and I'm sure working with/against others adds a tremendous amount to the game as well. I would say that the game has a lot of potential but I feel the true potential of the game is in what the players can do with it not the developers. I do wish there were a way to salvage materials from abandoned bases but I guess that would compromise their defensive capabilities in the process. All in all I like the game and definitely feel it's the one of if not the best in the sandbox survival genre.,Rust

2015-06-09,0,0,149,True,Not Recommended,This was a good game until they ruined the server system and statics when you have the best loot in the game you suddenly get disconected in most servers and other then that they ruined the game.Devolopers if you cannot do the damn thing right then dont do it even a 5 year old would do a better job in devoloping games.And I really dont reccomend this game its better to just burn the money rather then buy this game(if they dont do a really good job soon. i dont think so but),Rust
2014-01-26,0,0,62,True,Recommended,I will recommend this game to you since i have wasted many an hour in it myself. There are a few things to watch out for however. Firstly admin on any server are given too much privelege. They are allowed to spawn at will any item in the game and as many as they want. This means that a player savvy enough to suck up to admin could potentially become an OP a$$hole that ruins your experience on a regular basis. Admin also have that potential. One of the servers that i played regularily on had this scenario occur where the admin equipped a team with the best gear they could (some of which arent available to regular players) and created an unstoppable army of robbers. THIS CANNOT TAINT YOUR VIEW ON ALL SERVER OWNERS/ADMIN however there are a good many that are very nice people and very fair players. Secondly toons dont transfer from server to server so if you have a server that you regularly play you will have an avatar that is quite a bit more advanced than on other servers (this means they will be able to build more stuff due to more blueprints and likely will have more very usefull items in their inventory to ensure survival after a server reset) and that will lead to playing on only a couple servers. For some that may be no big deal but personally i would like to be able to switch servers if i find the climate in the one ive spent a good deal of time developing my toon in becomes unfavorable. Lastly this game is still in early development so there is a chance that in the future odd features that make no sense could be added or that some feature that we have come to know and love could be removed to alter gameplay in accordance with someones vision. This is always a possibility in early access games like these where players want their WoW experience in a game thats not WoW so they band together and through idle threat group rants demand these features be added or removed. 6/10 RATING WOULD BE HIGHER IF ADMIN WHERE TAKEN DOWN A NOTCH OR TWO!,Rust

2017-08-04,0,0,1671,True,Recommended,This game is as addictive as crack. It's a brutal yet brilliant game. It takes advantage of the human condition and accurately portrays how life would be in a no rules post apocalyptic world. From manipulation for ones own selfish needs to groups banding together to survive. You can die and lose everything you had worked hard for by simple compliancey. You can also become the reigning overlord of a server. You can decimate someone's will to live (stay on a server) by taking everything from them. If you are weak expect to be taken advantage of. If you are cocky expect everyone to take you out...you can coexisit with other players or be a hermit with a plan of world domination.No game has giving me such an adrenaline rush when a plan is properly executed...one the other hand no game has made my completely rage when everything falls apart...but vengeance is always an option10/10 would recommend not for casual players though,Rust

2017-08-18,0,0,3,True,Recommended,"After a couple of hours I feel like I can write a decent initial review.I really like the concept of this game. Starting naked with a rock and torch is a cool idea. I like the idea of having to find (or make) food and clothes gather resources hunt make fire and fight off other people. The progression seems intuitive and it doesn't take ages (most of the time) to get anything done. I still haven't figured out for sure if there are different settings in different servers but it seems like there are (i.e. amount of ""gatherable"" materials number of players allowed in the server maybe the size of the map). The graphics are very good and I haven't seen too many graphical anomalies. I do have some criticisms though. The game feels too focused on fighting other players for all of the other things one can do. It seems a bit unbalanced. I expected more crafting gathering surviving and exploring than i did fighting other players but it seems that player vs. player is the focus. If that is nor the intended focus then I think they have more work to do. If it is the intended focus then it is still unbalanced A player who just starts (naked with a rock) can immediately die if a person with a gun and armor decides to hunt them down. Granted the person with the gun and armor has been alive long enough to craft those items however it still feels quite unbalanced and at times not fun.Overall I like this game. Personally I feel that they should pull back slightly on the player vs. player. I understand this is part of the game and it's fine but it feels too forced considering everything else that can be done in the game.",Rust

2016-11-24,0,0,1106,True,Recommended,Anyone who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area will feel right at home in Watch Dogs 2. The important landmarks are there even odd intersections that may only stand out to residents. But I don't think you need to be familiar with the real Bay Area to appreciate how Watch Dogs 2's mix of nature and urban sprawl makes for a picturesque playful open world. Its people and places are colorful and over the top kind of like the real thing.And whether or not you understand the references that drive Watch Dogs 2's twisted take on Silicon Valley shouldn't matter either This outing errs on the side of irreverence and unapologetic fun trading in the original Watch Dogs' rain soaked trenchcoat and drab demeanor for a neon colored assault rifles and a pair of skinny jeans. The new attitude and setting are a great combination that allow you to experience the dream rather than the nightmare of living in the digital age.That doesn't mean the world of Watch Dogs 2 is all peace and love. Its gleeful exterior masks a troubled society in the throes of gang violence political corruption and rampant hacking. Our antihero Marcus is to an extent part of the problem but he's mostly on the side of good. With his hacking skills under your control you spend a lot of time thwarting nefarious jerks by tapping into their networks to hit them where it hurts whether that means dismantling their criminal enterprises or airing their dirty laundry in public. And when digital attacks fail Marcus knows how to handle a gun. He's a walking contradiction that hates corruption yet murders without flinching but his actions are so entertaining that you probably won't care for long if at all.,Rust

2016-11-18,0,0,1564,True,Recommended,I've played all of the open world survival games out there (Ark 7d2d The Forest H1Z1 etc) and no other game has come close to this one. The pvp in this game is simply on a different level. Gun fights feel more realistic than call of duty the new component system feels right and the interactions you can have with people are different than any other game. Not to mention the devs in this game are the most transparent and communicating group of people who play the game and listen to the community. They simply want to create the best game and they've done a great job so far.,Rust

No wrestling or adults in my fort poopfaces! and they got mad and destroyed your fort?Also remember how you couldn t for the life of you make a fort as good as the original and it didn t matter anyways because those dam naked men were always wrestling on your fort while lunatic children ran in circles screaming.

Once we are together and strong we act like a Group of savage 4 year olds.and that my friends is when things get very funthis game should have an 18+ rating solely due to the community. and with that in mind Expect to be killed for no reason and tolled it's because your mother $%$% #$%$% #$ $ %$#% his %* &amp yesterdayyou will lose every thing and every time you do you will become more RUST or you just wont make it if you want to be hard core you gotta play hard corethere is a wipe every week for frequent updates this usually happened on fridays but has been changed to monday. this small change has made playing on the weekends more laggy and generally just less playable. if you have a monday to friday job you will not be able to compete with any one who has the time to start building on monday after the wipe.i changed my review to no because the hackers have become to much of a problem to recommend this game,Rust

2016-02-15,0,0,49,True,Not Recommended,Can't reccomend survival games like these. There's no point in grouping up with people. You get a better pay off killing everyone who isn't your friend than you do cooperating with others. It's very much hole simulator the game. If you've got a big group of friends get it. I'm sure you'll have loads of fun. If you've got a small group of friends or want to play alone (don't) then don't buy it. Also make sure you get on new servers. Joining servers that have been around awhile and expecting to be able to build a base isn't going to work out in your favor.,Rust

2018-06-07,0,0,4896,False,Not Recommended,The game is making worse and worse updates 1 the forest. When somone walk in to the forest they just disappear 2 the gun fighting. The guns got so much aimcone/rng that even if u control the recoil some of the shoots just says off. i mean back in 2016 the recoil was much better because the bullets hits where u aimed at nowdays they dont. And thats making the game much worse 3 upkeep. The upkeep is so back in the days u could make a big base as a small group to protect urself from raiders and have a life at the same time because u didnt have to grind 24/7 and that ruins alot in my opinion 4bp/components. Ok to be honest i think 95% of the players are there for the pvp and now with the components and all the bps/scrap u need for the lvl3 bench research are just insane + you cant find bps in barrels anymore. What i think they should do is to revert to July 2016 when it was pvp the first day of the wipe because all u had to do is to find the bp in a barrel or something run back to ur base and grind mats so u could craft the gun,Rust

Don't even bother playing if you have any responsibilities whatsoever as the developers cater to no life teenage cowards who can afford to treat this game like a job and can log on at 3am to rob people who are logged off. Also though the server I played on was mostly populated by decent people the community at large is extremely toxic.

2016-12-04,0,0,71,True,Recommended,I don't know what to say about this game so here is a recipe for pancakes Ingredients 4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)1 large free range egg½ pint semi skimmed milk + water (about 300ml ¾ milk ¼ water)Pinch of saltButter for fryingHow to make pancakes Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk 100ml water) this makes a lovely light batter.Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit beating constantly to avoid lumps.Tip *If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!,Rust

The map was amazing the crafting and looting systems was just right and building bases was better. The ""new"" Rust is not good with its random maps (which are horrible as is the not randomly generated one) crafting system which have gotten worse over time weapon degradation maps littered with horrible bases and people killing you on sight and so on. You will die over and over trying to get materials for a base. And when you finally have yourself a good base either a hacker will come along and destroy it in a second or someone from the 50 neighbouring bases will raid you. If you wanna keep your stuff you either need to stay online 24/7 or spend 30 hours grinding metal to build a thick base that can withstand the absurd amounts of C4 raiders can amass.Bring back Rust Legacy!",Rust

But it's Rust and that's why I countless many times find myself looking at the loading screen.

You learn you create you rise and then fall again only to be more determined to do better the next wipe. It draws me in and I'm sure others can agree.People may complain and they may say that Legacy was better or that the community has gotten worse. It's not the developers' fault. ""What you do what you cause in this game is up to you. We gave you the tools it's up to you to see how you use them."" And that's what we did.

2018-08-04,0,0,2098,False,Not Recommended,I've spent over 2000 hours on rust and I've really enjoyed it. However it's really disappointing how the devs have chosen to progress this game. The game was in early access for many years and then they suddenly made the decision to take it out of early access they spent a month trying to optimise the game slightly then massively increased the price and reduced the updates from weekly to monthly. Since then the game has had very little if any work on optimisation each month the devs release more new content like the new bandit town which reduces how well the game runs even more. My game now sadly has a bug where it randomly crashes while in game I've seen multiple steam threads on it and this problem has been around for over a month and yet there's been no mention of this by the devs. This effectively makes the game unplayable for me. Overall I have got my money's worth however in its current state I cannot recommend it. It is terribly optimised so even the best PCs struggle to run it and the devs are out of touch with their player base.,Rust

It's alright nowadays but the game's lost its charm it's too ""busy"" in terms of things you have to do... It's really grindy. The graphics are better but many aspects have been simplified the map generation has been simplified in a really disappointing way and the color scheme is pretty ugly these days. Unfortunately the community has ruined this game for me above all.

2018-07-12,0,0,776,False,Recommended,rust is by far one of the most unique expeirences on pc the community can be toxic at times but that is not the majority of players. I met a fu ck ton of people on rust and have made a lot of friends the biulding is great the combat (even better) i can rember when i was a puney lil consol peasant and dremt about dis game and was in dis believe that i will be able to affoard a pc to run this maserpiece i would deffenetly reccomend dis game but it is a little bit over priced in its current state wait for a sale and pic up this game for $8.50 $10.00 but $40 nahthis game is hard to run the game is cpu and RAM intensive i would reccomed 16gb me personally i have 8gb and planign to upgrade but yea if you buy the game i would recomend alot of youtube and play on a modded server to test out the mechanics dont expect to hop into a vanilla server and expect to survive because you will get fuc ked in the by a more expiernced player or just a 8 12 member clan. Most of the negative reviews of this game were people that dont have friends to play with nor did they have the brain compacity to think that they will hop on a vinilla server solo and thrive with guns and a mssive base. another important part about rust is having friends rust is a somewhat team based game if you consider the situation they certanly make the game ALOT more enjoyable. rust is a hard game and dont expect to hop in a server and evreyone beacuse lets be real you will wake up on the beach with a rock gather recources buold a base attempt to pvp get annialted try agian get f u cked again log off for the day log on agian raided ) this game is a SANDBOX survival this is not minecraft nor is it ark survival this game is a replayable fun unique inavative expiernce and would buy agian,Rust

Along with Directx11 for 64bit systems Intricate base building system Hunting/Gathering Day/Night Cycle Weather System Moddable Frequent updates and Dev blogs Procedural generated world Gives you a sense of paranoia Generated Biomes (Desert Snow Grass)Game Cons Game tends to lag/rubber band if too many people are connected to the server Uses a lot of RAM KoS (Really depends on the person but what do you expect?) VoIP needs work (Causes a second or two of lag after letting go of the VoIP key) Framerate/Crashing issues on AMD cards (Mainly on the R9 290) Runs on the Unity engine (Making it not the best for optomization but the dev team is managing) Animals don't follow rules of physics. (They will run up walls if they feel like it)Controversial Features Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in game and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.Relateable Games H1Z1 The Forest DayZConclusionRust can be a very fun survivial game especially with friends. I put ""DayZ"" as a relateable game but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall if you have the money i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha so really look into it before purchasing.

I tried it with friends too which is typically way more fun. I didn't like it. It felt like a waste of time especially because it seemed like the only servers with population were filled with could be esports players. I got it for like $7 I think and it still wasn't worth it. Rust is an interesting idea. It's just so dumb. And there was this feature that required you to upkeep your base EVERY DAY irl and unless they removed it that should be an instant dealberaker.

2016-11-20,0,0,444,True,Recommended,The community is harsh and riddled with fowl mouth 10 year old s trying to sound hard. Trolling seems to be the foremost priority for many if not most and it s hard if not impossible to play solo. The game does have a very active community and is constantly updated and that s a plus. I come from Dayz stand alone and I still love the game but the developers basically took the money and ran. Rust on the other hand when played in a group is a great game that comes with its own set of challenges. If you can get around hate speech from the active chat in game (no genre is left alone) a hard start or dyeing/restarting frequently then your experience will be great. If the developers could just slow the wipe schedule a bit it would allow new users and fresh spawns to get a foundation and be awarded the means to defend their plot. The wipes happen you can t change that but the Grind is real and even if you make things more expensive developers don t solve any issue for the new comer or the freshly raided induvial(s) they only hamper the game play and build a foundation for those in large groups to rule and close down a server.

I have returned recently and the game has significantly improved. Yet so many downfalls!Pros Nice new maps. Improved graphics. Lots of choices when it comes to building clothes and weapons. Funny flavor items (guitars candlehats etc). Very involved community.Cons Variable FPS rates. The game will start to lag for no apparent reasons from time to time. Raiding is WAAAAY too easy. 3 metal doors will take 2 people with pickaxes and a repair table 5 min to break down so if you're planning to sleep or do not have the weaponry they've got bye bye base. Weapons are too easy to get. Today there was a wipe. 2h later half the players on the server were running around with automatic guns. No downside to being a Hurtworld's mechanics where you become infamous if you kill ppl and you only don't lose EVERYTHING when you die if you're not infamous made it so people think about it before KOSing. I've got no problem with being a PKer but let it have some downside if you want to give naked people with rocks a chance to start. The constant wipes. Every month or so prepare to have the map wiped out. In some ways it's not such a bad thing since the game gets sooo laggy when many buildings are constructed. Finally people bringing up ""it's only an alpha!"" when you point out any major flaws of the game.

2016-06-10,0,0,173,True,Recommended,I was looking for a game more challenging than Minecraft Less buggy than DayZ but still offered limitless creativity mixed with competitive strategy. This game checks all the boxes. With very consistent content updates every week the game never gets boring. The developers are very engaging with the community and are really trying to create the best experience for their fans. Many users complain about hackers and the difficulty to play solo. While this is partially true much of this can be resolved by finding an appropriate community server with active admins. I cannot recommend this game enough.,Rust

2018-10-25,0,0,2657,False,Recommended,This game is a very toxic one although it has good people it is a good game it has a mute button for people in the options. there is no way to mute people individually but it works. the actual game is good its a game about working your way up through the world by killing people or farming. At the time of me making this review they use scrap and components to make guns and other weaponry. The gunplay is fast paced but can vary. They have no lore in the game yet but they will be adding it speaking of that you should checkout the roadmap here https //rust.facepunch.com/roadmap/ so yeah. the armor in the game is slightly op but you can still kill people. About the server's so the servers are split into groups like official community and modded official are well official servers that are vanilla community are vanilla servers run by people who play the game modded are modded servers like 2x gathering or stuff like that like ark survival evolved the admins of these servers can do anything they want they can make it so you spawn with m249 if they wanted btw m249 is the most powerful gun. About the game (again) this time im gonna be talking about progression in the game from rock and torch to ak47 and bolty to get anywhere in the game hit things with other things and that usually gets you stuff. The guns in the game are pretty broken not in the buggy way but in the op way you can get killed by 5 guys with ak47's which kill you very quickly. You do have to use skill to win but if you're up again'st 4 ak guys you will most likely die if you have a revolver thats why i reccomend playing with friends segwaying us into our next section. Friends people who play this game should play with friends if you're not playing on a only server because groups with more people get more things becaseu more people are doing things at once if a guy with a ak is running around solo and 5 dudes with revolver's try to fight you they will most likely win. i have alot of time on the game and know alot of things about it so i hope this helped. btw i do reccomend this game it is good but its hard af and you will get mad at it when you lose gear js.,Rust

(Coz the game not intresting if you got raided every time a player sleeping i hope this feedback can be considered the guys from the FacepunchGREAT GAMES if you hear my feed back,Rust

2016-07-16,0,0,321,True,Recommended,A major goal in any game is to create the illusion of reality a fact that is especially true for first person shooters. The whole point of the genre is to put you literally in the role of the protagonist. In light of this it's surprising that so many games have stuck to a blueprint that breaks the illusion at every possible opportunity with text based mission briefings jarring level transitions and weapons and power ups scattered around like decorative furniture. But Valve Software has obviously spent a lot of time studying the mistakes of the past. The result is Half Life the closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken. Through a series of subtle and artistic design decisions Half Life creates a reality that is self contained believable and thoroughly engaging. And while it may be surprising that no game has utilized any of these ideas in the past it's clear that any future shooter will be remiss to overlook them.,Rust

2016-03-11,0,0,423,True,Recommended,If you like Open World / Survival / Crafting / PVP games you don't need to be reading reviews for this game just get it.Pros Every map is different.The graphics are next to nothing for the survival genre.The mechanics are seamless and work well together.The gun play is satisfying and some what realistic in terms of bullet drop.The community is helpful but not so helpful when they're trying to blow through your high external stone walls.Overall a well rounded survival game that isn't too heavy on things like hunger and thirst which is amazing.Why are you still reading this review buy it.Wipes are not to regular but are as frequent enough so the entire map doesn't spiral out of control so it keeps balance.The game is still in Alpha which means there are more updates and things to be added to the game.Cons You haven't bought the game yet.,Rust

There are many things you can do in Rust allong with the new version which has a randomly generated map and the old version which you can master the one map and rule the rust lands.

2018-08-16,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,Work very hard under terrible conditions around despicable co workers for zero pay and then get your wallet robbed after 2 weeks*. That's what Rust would be like if it was a job.It's alright but yeah... you need a few friends to enjoy this game and you'll be enjoying it because you're going up against people with less gear or manpower than you. Gunplay is dated and feels clunky and you'll often aim at a spot and miss despite reticle being on point. As for building it's alright however costs can seem incredibly high especially if you're playing alone or only with another player. You can play for around six hours just building a little base to keep your stuff safe while you sleep/go to work and then the next day it's all gone becuase a 6+ man clan got a couple bombs and blew off a wall. Later on (if you're dedicated) you can get pretty sturdy bases that are a pain to take down but then again no work is too tall of an order for a big clan. The zerg always wins and you can't do anything to stop it. I recommend getting a sizeable group of around 4 6 players or more if you want to actually enjoy the game.You also can't customize your character and the one you play as is randomly generated and bound to your Steam account for no reason other than the devs trying to force you to accept their SJW views of society. Funnily enough this is counter intuitive and means that many players with black characers are disadvantaged due to the meta of the game (I'm not joking for some reason the majority of players are legitimately racist and will shoot you on sight simply for having a black skin.) I got a white skin so I didn't have this problem but my friends do and it's kinda sad. Apparently the justification is that 'in real life you're born the way you are and can't change that and if we let players customize they'd all go white anyway.'So? Maybe that reflects the desires of people playing the game? We choose to get sucked into the digital world for a reason and it's not because we want to simulate our own lives. *2 weeks is the standard reset time for a server. Some go up to a month and there are probably a few that go higher.,Rust

2016-03-11,0,0,332,True,Recommended,"Now that I am better able to connect to servers I can post a new review.Is it a good game? Yes. Is it the ultimate survival game? No. Or atleast not what I'm looking for personally.In order to like this game you have to ask yourself are you more interested in PvP or PvE? I tend to go for the latter. The environmental threat in this game at this stage in development I'm writing this (11 Mar 16) consists of two entities the bear and the wolf. For the most part even these are pretty easy to dodge if you see them from a distance. And... that's about it for the environmental threat. Hunger thirst and cold are very easily satiated.The game is geared for PvP. Defending one's base and raiding other bases. For what it does I find it does pretty well. Base building mechanics are easy to learn but designing a safe base is not easy. My personal issue with the game from the personal experience of playing the game in solo or in a pair is that it's just a matter of time when your base will be raided. It could be as short as two days in real time from the time you've set up. It could be even less. I also find it's a bit of a chore to keep collecting resources upgrading your base creating maybe other bases for security etc. It's not what I'm looking for in a survival game I don't want to chop trees and mine ores I want to lead a more of a ""nomadic"" existence. But it's not the game's fault it's just not what I'm looking for. It can also feel very frustrating at times to get raided so also be aware of this. It's not an easy game in more ways than one.But if you're interested in the PvP aspect the game offers then it's a very recommended buy. If you're more like me who likes PvE better then maybe look elsewhere. I still do feel I got my money's worth out of the game.",Rust

2016-08-04,0,0,390,True,Not Recommended,I tried and hoped to like this game. Do NOT buy this game if you have less than 3 people in your group. You will not be able to survive very long. There are absolutely NO friendly players what so ever. I played about 20 total hours (on different accounts) and did not kill another player tried to be the most positive and non KOSable player out there... to no avail. The game isn't optimized particularly well but still runs fairly smooth. The combat is a little glitchy (range/hitbox can feel really dirty). Rust adds some very cool aspects to survival games. Very interesting building and crafting abilities... But the community and combat and Lack of PvE/non combat based gameplay is pretty lacking. If you want to suceed in Rust play with friends and ONLY use resources to build weapon/armor until you've killed a lot of players and taken their stuff to build a base.I wish I could recommend this game honestly but the community aspect just makes it simply no fun.

I was lucky enough to find a couple good servers and haven't been killed by another player yet and actually had a nice guy hook me up with a bunch of good gear. So far my time in the game has mostly been finding my way around. I haven't really built anything worth mentioning yet. Mostly I have just been sitting up a few stashes around the map and stocking up on stuff. Stability wise I haven't had a single crash nor noticed any major bugs. I have seen a few clipping issues here and there but nothing I haven't seen in plenty of other ""finished"" games. For an Early Access game I am very pleased with the performance and the game in general.Spec wise I am running a i7 4770 3.4Ghz 12GB Ram and a GTX 760 on a Windows 8.1 machine. I would highly recommend this game for anyone that likes crafting building and well just surviving. Like I said I have been lucky and haven't been grieved or anything.

2014-06-14,0,0,100,True,Recommended,Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain there was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world obscured as it was by great clouds.Here they played out their peaceful lives innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below.To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough.Then one day Strangefolk arrived in the town.They came in camouflage hidden behind dark glasses but no one noticed them they only saw shadows.You see without the Truth of the Eyes the Happyfolk were blind.In time Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable Sincerity and Beauty.By chance they stumbled upon the Place Where All Good Souls Come to Rest.The Strangefolk they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things and soon they began to mine the mountain its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world.Meanwhile down in the town the Happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls.Every day people would wake and stare at the mountain.Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain holes began to appear bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey.For the first time the Happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep.And then came a sound. Distant first it grew into castrophany so immense it could be heard far away in space.There were no screams. There was no time.The mountain called Monkey had spoken.There was only fire.And then nothing.,Rust

2016-07-11,0,0,118,True,Recommended,I have only played Rust for a couple hours and I found that even though it lags a bit in full screen mode I really like the game. This game is a lot of fun to me I don't know why but I just want to play it so much even right now as I am writing this review I want to play rust. The game just appeals to me probably because of the sense of freedom you have while playing (especially in a server by yourself).Even if Rust lags on your computer maybe consider buying it (especially if there is a sale) if you think you like the game. I found that when putting the settings to 'low' and running it in a window it runs pretty good at least 20 25 fps. I think Rust is a great game sometimes you will probably get murdered or raided. And sometimes you will be the murderer and raider which makes it fun (for some reason don't think of me as being crazy it's just fun).Anyways I don't know why I feel like I have to write what could possibly be a page on a book but all in all I think Rust is a great game watch others play it to make sure you want it before you buy it and if it doesn't run good just run in a window or wait until you get a better computer.,Rust

YES I GET THE POINT OF THE GAME. it's a trust nobody cut throat game What with the ""raids"" and what not but i mean and i mean this the community ruins this for eveyone even each other. call me butt hurt all you want but every server i've joined i simply broke into seeminly abandoned shacks made of wood or stone using nothing but what ive made in the dirt for the first 15 minutes of life but you don't know salt and sound of a very territoral 14 year old's battle cry of unyeilding pain and agony because i made off with some crap I'M not even sure does and get away with it. hell running this solo is seriously the single handedly least fun experience i've ever had playing any game ever. The game itself plays okay and i like the idea of people scared of other players or seeing everyone as potentialy hostile. dayZ had this down much better as in 15 minutes in dayZ i can find basic equipment i need to actually play the game solo and still enjoy myself.I cannot stress the absoloute need for a friend or hell bring in a group of friends. that bumps up the fun way more. Sure you still get attacked but it starts to feel more like a game when you aren't spening ten minutes at a time attempting to just gather supplies to garnish yourself make hunting tools THEN a base THEN better equipment only to be cut down by someone about 6 steps ahead of you with a pipe gun. rince and repeat. With friends you stand the chance to enjoy the game's full potential.conclusion I don't have any friends who play games like these so i try to run them solo only to end up mostly hating them.

2018-10-10,0,0,2508,False,Recommended,This is a very good game! 8/10I am going to talk about the +'s of this game firstThe gun play is very good and balanceds for the grade of weapon your are using for example a gun in the game called the p250 is a good early game weapon if you get one day one of wipe you can destroy anyone in wood armer close range having a low recoil makes this gun very useful in some situations. But a end game weapon like the ak47 is a high damaging AR which usually 2 headshots can kill someone wearing a helmet but having a high recoil but learnable pattern makes it a really dangerous weapon in the right hands. I would recomend before playing this game to join a battlefield server and try out the guns before you learn the bp or craft them. (will finnish another day),Rust

Despite lots of questionable changes (namely the Twig buildings bypassing the Tool Cupboard they just now rolled out) I'd still recommend this game as it is fun but is definitely not for the easy to upset players.I would not recommend playing on any Vanilla servers. Find a nice Modded server with the juicy plugins and features and just go. Some Modded servers even disabled Twig from bypassing the Tool Cupboard to make it feel more like before the update.Overall its addicting most of the times but frustrating to the max sometimes.

2017-11-17,0,0,492,False,Recommended,"It's very hard to review this game. I've had great times on this game and absoluetly terrible times. I met a friend after learning he was a he got unfriended. I met another guy found out he was an I bought this game with another friend and it was always fun jumping on the big 5k pvp server and pvping against other players. I love the new update but hate how if you play with 1 other person you just get absoluetly stomped on and destroyed. Now when I come on I become dissapointed with the amount of unfriendly people and just plain s. If you don't play with a big clan and have a huge base you're screwed. I was on the other day with 3 other people and we had a nice little 2x2 ended up getting doorcamped by 5 people with semi autos and AK's. Logged off for the day came on the day later to find my base raided. I don't like the game but I love the concept of this game and I see how it could be improved. THE COMMUNITYI'm dissapointed. There's always somebody better and if there isn't then you're a zerg with a huge base. There used to be balance but now the huge groups will always dominate unless you're some BCHILLZ god or if you get scripts and/or hacks and there's a ton of those people. Oh and by the way if you do ever find somebody that is actually nice BE NICE BACK. That goes without saying but if you help 10 different people I'd say at least 7/10 would turn on you if somebody points out a bad spot in your base reward them. If somebody wants some materials give them some.MY STANDI'm going to be honest I'm just a 14 year old who might be overthinking but I think half the people who play this game would say otherwise. I don't know which box to click Yes or No. It's really hard to recommend this game because in general it sucks. But I also think about all the fun times I've had on this game with my friends. From what I've played I love the blueprint system and I honestly found the ""freecraft"" system comeplete t it let you craft an AK within 10 minutes of playing on one server if you tried really hard. Now if you're new to the game or looking to buy it the blueprint is an old system that was put back into the game after some thought by Facepunch what it's all about is basicially there's 3 tiers and you need to research items and you obtain a ""blueprint"" after researching. Buuut if you don't have the certain workbench you can't craft it. Anyways my stand on this game is quite neutral but everytime Facepunch puts out a new big update I always play it to see if I enjoy it.I guess I'm going to reommend this game but mainly because of the concept not the community I just wish and hope that there will be more nicer people playing this game in the future.Dang you got this far?

2018-07-13,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,"Pros It truly is a survival game. Hunting for resources and food is enjoyable and the satisfaction of surviving building is pretty darn good. A player can get completely enthused with the first few survival objectives (but thats it!!)Cons 1. Probably the most toxic community of players I have ever experienced. Hey kids ..just born naked? here have a hail of bullets from us a group of radioactive shielded armored tanked up morons. This community does not allow a new player to grow and survive. There's probably 10% survival efforts from nature/environment and 90% from other players who have settled in way earlier than you. SO the simple way to beat this? enter a server that has just started with very few players.. yayy! I am sure most have experienced this as well "" hey man come here.. come here im not gonna hurt you..Boom!!"" was funny the first few times but after that made Rust extremely boring for teaming up effort.2. Collecting stone? Which one would you pick to start digging two huge boulders of stone on a cliff staring at you or a small stone that you have to look very closely to see a bloody golden shine. Secondly I have seen sulphur ore gazillion times more that stone.. I'd like to know where on earth can we see a place that has less stone than sulphur ore3. I can understand twig walls deteriorating fast but stone walls that need constant upkeep? you want people to be playing 24hrs a day. Probably the developers think players stay in their parents basement provided for everything. Hell no I got no time for that.4. NOW.. Lets talk about a favourite subject here Game Servers!! Its actually good that the game wipes servers to balance things for all players bringing them down to the same level. But i just spent the last 3 4 hours building a 4x4 stone cabin and staying a couple hrs to maintain it. So what after that? there are way more things that can be done right down to making a damn spaceship and flying it. If solo players can't enjoy that level there's no point in playing twice. By the time a single player feels they have hunkered down and survived its time for server wipes!! Have fun doing that all over again.All in all Rust is the least realistic survival game at best. Im not even getting into high dehydration of human meat the fact that you can increase health simply by wrapping cloth bandages crafting doors and walls with a click breaking doors and walls and not being able to recycle wood or stone from the effort. Boxes that require just wood to make but after its placed there are about 20 metal nails embedded into it (Where'd the metal fragments come from for that?) Hoping the developers actually make this enjoyable in future versions (if its in the works)",Rust

Stay away if you value the years of your life the stress of this game will take from you. I've played alone and I've played with friends and each are demonstrably disappointing in it's own way.I've been debating uninstalling for a while but i finally broke when a bear which for me makes next to no noise jumped me as i left my base. I tried to kill it but i couldn't react in time. So I die ok I go out with another weapon and kill the bear to get my stuff. My first shot isn't enough to kill the bear so it runs directly through a wall into my base so i can't kill it. I jump away to draw it out and luckily a headshot kills it. Little did I know that TWO PEOPLE are standing over my dead body while the bear circled right next to them! The two people kill me with my own gear.Do not play this game.

However what sets this game apart is the deamnd graphics and multiplayer.

However demanding it may be the graphics make up for that greatly Ranging from ""Potato"" to ""Fantistic"" the better the settings get the more beautiful and filled with life the game becomes. This life sometimes includes real people. As soon as you start the game you may notice some bases that have formed around you or hear gunshots off in the distance these sights and sounds are from actual people just like you playing and enjoying the game to its fullest extent.

I would say the only good game these guys have made is gmod. thanks for somhow reading this all the way and if you scrolled all the way down great job for looking at this reveiw that may make 90% of facepunch studio's fans really angery(also if I make and grammer mistakes I was half asleep and I make many errors in reviews so I don't care if you respond with a writen out ""fixed review"". and if you somhow like this junk good for you for supporting a terrible company that has only made one good game.

2016-08-14,0,0,66,True,Recommended,First things first most of these bad reviews are coming from people that are butthurt about changes that the game has made that they of course didn't like. Of course the game still being early access has a few bugs but nothing that bad. The worst bugs include some kind of odd seizure thing before you can wake up which you have to frantically press every button on the keyboard until something happens animals have no clip and can climb rocks like champs and most importantly sometimes items that are dropped magically disappear. Now the good part. This game is probably the most fun game I have in my library. If you're new and find a good small server chances are likely that you'll find extremely nice people that just want to help and not pvp. A lot of larger servers are filled with who will kill you then throw your key away so you wake up locked in your house forever. True story. Most large servers I've been on are just s who kill anyone on sight thats no fun. Being able to find a group who will help you survive and build a cool base from nowhere then go after the patrol helicopter now that's fun.To wrap it up great game many possibilities and lots of cool people to find. TLDR hops on big server and gets then finds small server where he learns the true meaning of Christmas. 11/10,Rust

Joining will mean you meet a couple of psychopaths in addition to a cornucopia of people who curse you in their native language . The name of the game is to build the best fortification and dominate the scrubs on the server. Good luck And beware of the scientists!!,Rust
2014-12-25,0,0,57,True,Recommended,"rust a beautiful looking game and by far one of the better survival games of this year ... *cough* standalone *cough*.my first experience wih this game ... smashing a boars head in with a rock only to find that it drops raw uncooked human meat ... good signs already 3after building a 2 story house and getting a crude but reasonably effective gun + a spear i realise there is a CRUD tonne of trees on the other side of the river ... i want them. swimming accross the river and nearly dying of hypothermia in the process i hear 2 very loud gunshots not sure if they were directed at me but they made me turn the otherway nonethless. on my way back i see a man lying on the floor ... dying. his last words to me are ""kill ... me end it all"" ... i humbly oblige by jamming my spear into his skull twice. his very unequipped friend thinks he can take me on ... he died on his friends corpse and his ... meat and two veg were slap bang on the other dudes face ... could not have asked for a better landing. night time came and it was time to sleep to reagain health but OH HO what is this ... you cannot regain health via sleep you must eat meat. so i attempt to cook my human flesh on the furnace does not work. then i try on the campfire ... ran out of wood ... at this point my field of view is near pitch black so i decide to light my fire stick (that's it's name from now on) ... this did absolutely nothing for lighting effect so i threw it away and waited it out.i left the server with the plan of returning later with my friends ... it did not save onto my recent servers list so i have no idea where to go or what to do.all in all this game is a 11/ 1343 ""would put other guys nut sack into others face again."" pronhub.",Rust
2016-06-18,0,0,30,True,Not Recommended,"Rust made huge improvements.......but unfortunatley the game isnt really worth playing at all.Pros + they actually improved a lot of the old mechanics and designs in the game+ the sound and overall SFX is superb. One of the best atmospheric sound you will hear in a game shots are muffled from far away and explosions can be heard miles away its fantastic+ graphics improved a lot and are quite beautiful+ the game runs smooth and I never had issues with lag on servers+ crafting system is really cool+ a lot to build with great varietyCons they removed PVE making this a Kill on Sight PVP shooter which I dont have a problem with but forcing the players to hunt down other players just so there is something to do is never a good idea in other games players could still team up to defeat a zombie horde or something but here almost anybody will be an enemy and the playerbase gets toxic. the playerbase and community is one of the worst I have ever witnessed. They kill total noobs with full automatic weapons if you ask something about the game in chat you wont get help as every person nowadays thinks they have to be funny and ""trolling"" all the time what is up with this days internet community? This games taggline is ""The only aim in Rust is to survive.""This is flat out lying as the actual survival is absolutely boring and easy. You will never struggle to get water or food. The only survival part is the entire server players being hostile as there is nothing to do then to shoot people. It goes as far as people building huge towers in the middle of the map that they sit all day in and shoot newly players with sniper rifles......not collecting their loot its just about killing them just for the sake of it. You dont get points for it or anything. long running teams and players have always the upper hand as they have way more powerful weapons than starters its very hard to upgrade your weapons if you are constantly killed by the already powerful players and lose everything to them dont even bother playing this game alone you will have almost no chance most servers are capped at 100 or even 200 players per map which is insane copmared to the map size and only leads to more spawn killing and troll griefing you cant choose your character.....I found this to be very disappointing as I was playing with a friend and he had to play as a bald women that was randomly chosen by the game. I wanted my male friends character to represent my male friend. It breaks immersion if you have a female character with a deep male voice in the voice chat......if I play a game for hours and hours I wanna look at a character that appeals to me not some design to spawn controversy or social experimenting as of now the game has been in Early Access for 2 5 years.....I really wanted to love the game and tried it multiple times in different development phases. But after 2 5 years of Early Access I think there are way better games on the market right now than Rust. (The Culling for example is a good KoS shooter) with a purpose to its gameplay) Rust is just not a fun experience and the community certainly doesnt help.",Rust

2017-12-07,0,0,2454,False,Recommended,Rust is the game that I started my gaming experience with and I am glad I did. Although sometimes the facepunch team makes changes that may not make the community happy at the time over time they always make the right decision. It has grown so much since I started and it isn't a game I plan to stop playing. The graphics quality is beautiful and the player models are being worked on but overall the graphics quality is great. The game mechanics are organized and are easy to learn. If you are not committed to the game you will not thrive in the harsh world of rust. The community is very toxic but that's what makes the game fun. If you are looking for a thrilling survival multiplayer game this is yours. And by the way when I first started playing the game I didn't know why there were weekly wipes which are basically where the servers wipe their game data and he map starts over but I understand why now. It's not like any other game out there and if you play for a wipe you will see massive Zerg bases emerge on the second day so if you don't want to just get raided every day forever then don't complain about the wipes.,Rust

Had my friend begging me to come back and play this game and that it has changed. Come back for 15 minutes just to have a guy attack us in a hazmat suit take how many arrow shots to the body and still kills us both. All this while dealing with the god forsaken rocks in this game preventing me from running and just being a buggy piece of sh*t. So I deleted this game again and will try it again in a year or two and hopefully f**king hopefully the game will finally be in a good state. But till then I don't want to hear or see anything that has to do with this game.

My experience with the game then was significantly better than what it is now ( ). Said newly introduced mechanics utterly favors groups of sweats that can grind out everything in a day and run around shooting fresh spawns (pretty much the endgame) props to them ( ). But for casual on and off players like me it is way too tedious to farm a sufficient amount of scraps just to start developing a decent arsenal to defend yourslef ( ). If you do end up acquiring some firearms theres no doubt that the game itself will bend you over and tear the lining of your uterus and or prostate apart. Glitches ಥ ಥ. I can not even make this up but I was progressing well for once on a server and decided to make a move on some people building near me I approach them shoot one of them twice with a revolver and conveniently become stuck in the ground. A heavy stream of feces exit my as I panic manage to down one but run out of ammo and his freind just walks up to me and kills me with a melee (ノÒ益Ó)ノ. Which brings me to this review.There was a time when you could come on and just get right to the point ( ). Everyone could craft whatever without having to go through step by step and slowly progress only for it to be wiped by the server and start all over again. I understand that this was intended to give the game a sense of progression but all it did for me was make me a very angry boy grrr ( o ).,Rust

Going with the bears they make a chirp while attacking and sounds like your being attacked by squrreils. Also Ive been killed twice inside my house from a bear somehow attacking through the floor.Also why at times does it sound like Im being followed by ghost chickens but none are to be found no matter how hard I track the noise.Bird sounds for ambient noise are one thing but if your gonna make chicken sounds let there be chickens we can hunt.I am very uch enjoying the game just wanted to add what Ive noticed so far that i think would help improve game play.One last tidbit.There should be a way i think for us to gather water using the water bottles or something.Though ive never died of thirst I rarely find water bottles and it makes no sense that im staying hydrated by eating steaks. Id definatly recomend the game to others and which I have.His only complaint was the rendering and the camera moving so much while harvesting.He was getting headaches from it.Id also like to see a options menu where I can adjust sound.I like to listen to my own music rather than game music.Thanks for the fun times so far.,Rust

2018-09-23,0,0,14,False,Not Recommended,I guess if there could be a neutral review this would be it but there isn't so it won't be Rust is technically a fine game it is a bit of a grind to get more advanced stuff but what game isn't. The problem isn't really the game it's how people interract with that game. The problem as far as I see it is that the world is too hospitable there is nothing to fear except other players and that is the same as any pvp shooter out there the only difference is that you have to grind to get the equipment it makes for a long boring game and even if you do go out killing to steal people's stuff it's only so you can hoard it and steal more stuff.I'm certain there are some doubting my critique but look to a game that's almost identical in style ARK it has the exact same grind the same progression yet it's endlessly fun and the way you play is dramatically different all because the environment poses a challenge so people are encouraged to work together to tackle it.I wish i could get a refund but i thought i'd give this game the benefit of the doubt.

2019-01-04,0,0,158,False,Recommended,The best survival game on the market.For me it is very addicting to chop the trees mine the ores or build a base and craft items. The crafting and farming mechanics feel satisfying to me.Unfortunately very often during your adventure you are being killed on sight by the others.When you play solo or duo it is not very easy to progress fast and you can be easy target for bigger groups of people.However it is an adventure to take a boat and farm barrels or to go to rad towns for some scrap or weapons.Or just take a bow and kill animals and then make a barbacue party at your base.It is more satisfying when you are able to bring all the loot back to your base. People in rust are cruel they will kill you door camp you betray you and will have no mercy with you. Do not trust them.I like the PVP in Rust even though I am really a bad at PVP because I am not even able to get any decent weapons and armor. I remember the first time I started to play Rust. Nobody was helping me they were just killing me even though I was naked. I took me some time to be able to have enough resources to build a base and be safe for some while. So you need to be patient. However sometimes you meet people who like roleplaying and the game turns extremely funny.The experience in Rust is created by people. People are who make the game. Sometimes you are frustrated because you loose your base or loot sometimes you laugh because people are roleplaying as police and they put you in their jail or you feel satisfied that you were able to get some valuable bluebrint.However it requires probably lots of time and be nearly constantly online in order to keep up with the rest of the population on the server.Since I am quite casual player I will never be able to make any big raids nevertheless I enjoy the game very much.The graphics are great sound is even better and from all of this the night time is just astonishing.,Rust

I wish I would have read the reviews first.This game is more like Fortnite in the sense that you pretty much just spawn battle and die. No time to build no place to hide. It's very hard to get into the game with cheaters/griefers everywhere. I've spawned and gotten killed before I could wake up multiple times. Sure ARK has their griefers too but at least you can hide.The longest I survived is when I teamed up with 4 other players which is extremely rare as everyone pretty much kills on site. We all met as fresh respawns yelling we were friendly built a base (after getting killed and trying to find each other several times) and then got wiped out by someone who was extremely accurate with an ak (don't worry he told us he doesn't cheat *sarcasm*Tried Official servers modded servers servers with low population ""noob friendly"" servers and everything in between.If your idea of survival is against Hackers and griefers this game is for you.Overall I don't recommend playing or buying this game.",Rust

Big mistake but I'm glad I got it discounted on If you don't have a few good friends with a similar schedule don't buy this Even if you play on 100x server it's just not worth the effort as a solo player or even a duo. You'll spend a few hours getting your together. Making stressfull runs for loot and often getting killed before you get home. What you do manage to get back will feel great for the time you play that day. Log on the next day and oh it's all gone. Almost every time. Some clan will raid you while you're gone even if your base only looks mildly interesting. Good luck finding a quiet place to set up away from s. What was today a quiet valley with maybe one friendly neighbor in it will be some clan's warzone tomorrow. New updates to the system only make it increasingly difficult to manage as a solo player. Unless you get lucky it takes ing forever to get good gear and when you know it will all be gone tomorrow what's the point? Solo players can almost never reach a point where they can reasonably compete with groups. You might say ""I'll just find a clan to join then!"". Nope nobody wants you unless you've got thousands of hours logged into the game and even then its difficult to get recruited. I'm guessing this game will continue to push away new players as more updates come out to make it more of a grind. In summation if you like getting frustrated with minimal payoff buy this game. If you have good friends to play with you buy this game. If you don't steer clear.",Rust

2018-05-13,0,0,66,False,Not Recommended,It's fun to play with friends for a little while but after you realize your work gets wiped away every month it's hard to get motivated to play anything but sandbox servers. You start playing and gathering resources...and then you realize it's all for nothing and it's instantly less fun. It sucks because the rest of the game the graphics the gameplay is amazing. It's just hard to get into a game that deletes your progress every month. I understand why wipes happen but there are plenty of similar games that update without wiping players' data away.,Rust
2018-06-07,0,0,3496,False,Not Recommended,Gameplay is ok but the main problem with this game r facepunch they dont care about the community.every month its the same theyre saying at 3pm is wipe and u and ur mate taking off from work just to have a good start for the month and they let u wait from 4 24 hours and they dont give a about it...rly sad i got more then 3k hours on this game and every month i get dissapointed but cant do about it...at least i can say for other ppl dont buy it u will get dissapointed.,Rust

2018-12-22,0,0,60,False,Not Recommended,"This game Is good as an idea but the playerbase/""community"" makes it not worth a damn no actual survival since bunch of ""players"" will either kill you on sight or grief you all the time (being ""raided"" is fine until youre killed every 5 10 min)Basically quoting someone who said it better ""It's a survival game that is trying to capture the essence of human interaction and collaboration. What these people do these naked m4 bandits are things not even done by barbarians of the most vicious of sort and that is kill your own species for sport and without hesitation regardless of what rewards or otherwise negative outcomes could arise. You say it is a survival game but you don't actually play it as a survival game you play it like an FPS. Human survival requires fellowship something this game lacks and will continue to until either the community improves (doubtful) or an actual hard system is implemented into the game to discourage people from thinking this is a deathmatch with hunger.""",Rust

2018-08-08,0,0,64,False,Recommended,After only 4 hours into this game Its far much different then any survive pvp game i've ever played and it is worth the $35 some of the cons are that when new players join they would be seem to get destroyed by people who have skill in this game also the FPS is one of the main problems I have when I play this game hopefully they would find some way to fix the fps Issuse in this game and It would be perfect,Rust

2018-11-12,0,0,177,False,Not Recommended,The current status of the game has ruined the experience for both old and new gamers to the series. The updates to the engine have rendered the game almost unplayable considering the amount of constant lag and ping spikes. This happens on even freshly wiped servers as I thought perhaps the amount of abandoned building might have been a contributor. It's not. Not to mention the overall toxicity of other players in the majority of servers both dedicated and community. You can spawn into the game at the shore (where the building cancer is most severe) be alive for a total of 2 minutes then get run down by a 3 man group whom are outfitted to the teeth just for the mongaloid pleasure of killing someone. This happens even if you have nothing on you making the game almost impossible to get a good feeling for. No one wants to spawn into a game and immediately die over and over and over again.,Rust
