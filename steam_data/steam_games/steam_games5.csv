									",English,,"Indie,Simulation"," About This Game  True Mining Simulator will teach you to mine. We’re not talking copper, iron or coal. We’re talking money. Real money, made straight out of nowh… out of electricity. You will like it. What do you even mean? Cryptocurrency . Cryptocurrency is the kind of currency that exists only in the digital realm, arousing controversies around it and is constantly on a drastic rise (or fall). You’ve heard all about it. Everybody’s heard about it, yet few know what’s what. Basically that’s the reason we are making this game. True Mining Simulator is a full fletched simulator of a miner. A miner is a person who mines cryptocurrency . Miners purchase video cards, assemble stands and use those to earn valuable coins, which they then sell. Or keep them, hoping to get a better exchange rate. This is what you are going to be doing. Buy hardware, farm coins, sell coins, buy more hardware. And that’s it? Doesn’t look too … Ain’t it too simple? Oh yeah? Think about this for a moment: hardware must at least pay off; it must not become outdated while being delivered; 8 graphics cards in one stand must not overheat; these stands must be assembled properly; you must choose you farming station correctly, and there are plenty to choose from; if you spend all your money on hardware, what are you going to eat? Basically, this is the reason we are making this game. Mining is like chess: simple on the outside, complicated on the inside. And we suggest you figure out all mining intricacies on your own, without having to buy 10 video cards, $500 each. Okay, what else do you have in the simulator? Everything you need for a full immersion: farms must be assembled with your own hands; day\night cycles, respective division of events; fatigue, hunger (must eat and rest); ability to get employed (trust us, you will need it); you can move to a more spacious place, if you wish to do so … and if you can afford it; you can be burglarized, your house can burn down (nice, right?); you have a unique chance to forget your wallet password and lose everything. Sounds interesting! When will the game be out? As soon as possible. The game is in its active development stage. You can facilitate the process by supporting us. Follow us, read, discuss and stay tuned for updates.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,2 core CPU,Memory:,2048 MB RAM,Graphics:,Integrated graphics,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Storage:,1 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,2 core CPU,Memory:,4096 MB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX // RADEON HD/RX,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,1 GB available space",,

									","English,German,Bulgarian,Portuguese - Brazil,Portuguese,Russian",,"Simulation,Strategy,Early Access"," About This Game  About the game Plutocracy is a 2D strategy that will immerse you into the era of the Gilded Age of the rise of big business and the first billionaires. Your path gets started by investing and capturing the most profitable companies. Achieve financial wealth by buying out companies, building monopolies which in turn help you to lobby laws and politicians, corrupt officials. You’ll be able to make political intrigues as well as play the game of big business by putting sticks in the wheels. In front of you will open tens of years of history with hundreds of significant events. You can influence the aftermath World Wars, make an economic crisis by using the earned money and influence. Build the most powerful financial empire and become a shadow ruler of the world!  A plutocracy is a form of society defined as being ruled or controlled by a function of wealth. The main idea of the game is to show the interaction of the economy with politics and how influential capitalists make an impact inside and outside politics using the money. In this game, a player can immerse himself in the real world of capitalists with all the vicissitudes and intrigues as well as feel how the player's decisions change the economies of countries where politicians become his puppets. Every law or official decree has an end customer! Achieve the game’s goals in many ways! Only you decide whether to compete openly or secretly. Whether to make a bet on the economic development of their companies or investment in them with the support of influential officials and politicians? To be the richest and influential person in the world and make peoples’ lives better by changing the political course of continents? Every way has its consequences! The responsibility of your choices will be going up with every level of the game. Scalability is what we’re seeking while designing our game. In the beginning, a little depends on you because you don’t start the game as a president or a billionaire. You build everything from the scratch. Gradually the workers of your companies, their families, industries, regions, and even countries and continents begin to depend on you. You will start feeling the growth of your responsibility for every decision you make. The game has a real dynamic mechanism of economic companies and the country. Having achieved the scale levels, you’ll be able to influence prices, GDP, unemployment and etc of the whole country and also of the whole world. We know how excessive micromanagement is tiresome so we’ve made both manual and automatic process management inside companies. You can hire directors and they’ll take care of all the routine processes! Make the most suitable strategy for the current realities of the market and delegate management tasks to the Board of Directors. In the game, you can modify the production plan for workers, increase or decrease working hours and wages. It’ll lead to a reduction of administrative expenses and a wage-fund but at that same time, it’ll instigate a strike and an increased level of an accident in a company.  All the staff will be in a rage,  trade unions will take up arms against you but your profitability will go up! A strike will influence the production volume, companies will start seeing losses. Will you meet the demands of the demonstrators or disperse the crowd of the dissatisfied people with help of corrupt cops? Will you bleed the workers dry or inspire the staff to upgrade their skills? Every way has its consequences!  It’s up to you to decide!  It’s entirely in your hands! Having issued stocks and bonds, you’ll be able to capitalize on your company and conduct IPO. Make monopolies and trusts, expand the areas of influence and capture market shares as well as take over smaller companies.  You have different ways of competing. Make a relationship with the companies' owners and collude with them, merging into cartels. Together, you can drop the prices of products on the market and squeeze out competitors and then make a monopoly by which you can raise the price of three folds! Organize strikes and sabotage at the companies of competitors, disrupt supplies and block logistics. The market is a living self-organizing matter in which the functioning of the industries is interrelated. For instance, you can buy out all transport companies in the region and increase the supply price for competitors several times as Rockefeller did it in the period of the seizure of the petroleum market. No one will want to work in the minus! As a result, competitors will be forced to sell their companies to you sooner or later.  Will you have enough resources for that? Or you’ll be acting through loyal politicians and destroy the competitors by laws? Choose any of the 14 industries and take over the market. Destroy competitors, be ruthless on the way to achieving your goals! You can develop and improve the infrastructure of your companies because new technologies increase income! Build new buildings, expand the plan and get higher dividends. The game will give you the right to choose to be able to become economically powerful! In the game,  the executive branch consists of officials of the federal and local levels. The governor is in charge of the state welfare, the treasurer of finance, the prosecutor and the police of law and order, the judges make decisions. During the game, you’ll see a simulation of the real processes of passing laws at the region and the entire country level. We tried thoroughly to simulate the political system of the United States. Politicians will be sorting out significant issues of financing, taxation, management, business, education, healthcare, migration, social programs and other. There is an opportunity to hire political lobbyists who will be able to find some arguments to promote your law or an unfavorable law against your competitors. On the one hand, you may sponsor the election campaigns of politicians and they’ll help you when you in need, you may collect dirt on them and use the mass media to your advantage to not leave a chance to those who refused to be your puppets. Necessary laws will open up new opportunities for you to increase your wealth. Become a manipulator in political circles, increase your status and make relationships with influential officials and politicians. The party of Republicans and Democrats have different ideologies. So if you adopt the policy of clan capitalism, the government will have less influence on the regulation of market relations, therefore you will be able to get the support of the Republicans. For instance, you can make a monopoly and lobby through a law that reduces corporate taxes. But be careful, it can make a federal budget deficit and the whole country will take up arms against you. Greed is not always good! You must be able to find a balance between all the parties and society levels so that your monopoly doesn’t collapse like a house of cards. However, if you need bills of the democratic part such as reducing unemployment, increasing wages and other stuff, then don’t miss the opportunity to lobby through the bill to sing and adopt it! Use politicians and officials for your own goals! Will, you improve the well-being of the population or will you only take care of your well-being? It’s up to you! Capture fields of strategically important resources in other countries and provoke military conflicts through the Senate of the US Congress or the White House.  Give a loan to the parties for the military conflict, break down the economies of countries, create the financial crisis and coup d'etat to buy cheap assets! You can become the beneficiary of the most significant historical events or just create your own alternative history without wars and economic crisis. In the game, you can get used to the role of secret leaders who was creating and influencing the history. Appoint politicians and heads of states so that they unquestioningly carry out your orders. Do you need to increase the supply of unprocessed oil to your refineries? Help an ambitious politician to become the minister of the country you need and make a deal with him to get oil for a song. Become a financial support and an international banker for countries asking for need. If you want to play hard and dirty, you should use the agents of influence who are your assistants in difficult situations.  There are more than 36 unique characters, divided into 12 categories, whose hands you can fight with competitors. Make political intrigues, hidden manipulative fraud and win competitors! You have a huge set of tools: you can use force methods such as arson and accidents, bank robberies and etc as well as you can use secret and cunning methods: organize strikes and block production to competitors, industrial espionage, influence the stock market, use the services of a journalist and the mass media and so on. But be careful, every illegal action is strictly punishable by the court of justice! Well, or make sure that the judge and the state attorney are on your side… The game has something around 15,000 characters including shareholders, officials, politicians who have their own interests, fears, ambitions and other stuff that you can use to influence them. Just imagine a game world in which all the characters interact with each other, buy shares, lobby their interests, try improving their lives. Organize routes (banquet hall) and make meaningful relationships among influential people as well as give gifts, help people realize their ambitions which in turn will help you get access to huge resources. Every character can conceal a threat or access to game resources down the line. Therefore, it is necessary for you to consciously make friends! Keep in mind that every “resident” is endowed with intellect and knows how to behave and calculates what to do one step ahead. In addition, he is also connected by the threads of friendship or enmity with other characters, forming his unique network of contacts. For example, if you improve your relationship with a businessman who has two influential friends in the Congress, then your relationship with those congressmen can become much easier which will open up new opportunities later. On the other hand, you will have the risk of starting a financial war with some ""oligarch"" and his friends, if you stop getting along well with each other. Increase your social status by winning luxuries at the auction. Earn money on horse races betting on horses. The price of rare coins or paintings will go up! Don’t forget to buy houses to get annual rent; cars, yachts and planes are a measure of your luxurious life. Any property is a tool for making relationships: if someone collects rare coins or paintings so as you, then it will be easier to make friends with them because of common interests. The game starts in 1870 and continues till date. There is an inheritance system where you can leave a bequest to your heirs to go on playing for them! If one of the heirs has analytical abilities and pragmatism, then you should give a financial monopoly to him.  If you think that someone is suitable for the position of Senator of the Congress, then you should take care of his election campaign in advance. Promote your relatives in official posts, divide spheres of influence and appoint them as managers of your companies. Build a clan network and capture all strategically important resources. Be ready to meet the opposition of other clans. The most powerful families in the game will be fighting for world influence.

Each match begins with a planning session, providing teams an opportunity to gear up, discuss strategy over voice-chat and formalize tactics by drawing directly onto the map - like a playbook. Once the round begins, combat is quick and energetic - with one team on offense and the rival team defending a structure with multiple entry points. Fresh Scenarios Each Match Due Process introduces an evolution of the FPS scenario. Maps are procedurally generated, then expertly curated by the development team for maximum fun - resulting in a novel situation within each match, whether the outcome is victory or defeat. Due Process balances the playing field by making it more about outsmarting your opponent than memorizing a map, eliminating the inherent unfairness of “map knowledge.” With visuals inspired by 90s arcade light gun games like Time Crisis, Due Process uniquely marries neon-retro aesthetics and modern gameplay innovations.

Forces of nature have reshaped the East coast of the side islet “Dune” over time. RWY 21 was previously blocked by a high sand dune that is now entirely gone. The southern end of the airport, however, is now a place where waves break around the tip of the runway. 10 years ago this has been surrounded by a large beach and construction teams are hard at work to prevent further loss of sediments. In the wake of “green energy” Helgoland is currently becoming an important maintenance hub for nearby offshore wind farms. The existing military SAR base has been extended by a offshore maintenance helipad with its own hangar. From here you can fly your chopper to transformer stations out in the sea. All of them have their own helipad and make for a thrilling experience when approaching when waves are high. For the wealthier visitors several airlines started to fly regular routes to Helgoland.

Regarding the recoverable data from the past, the mass Epiphany of the previously unknown civilization took place in 1963, and the humanity was almost completely wiped out in 1986. The myths and legends about the Catastrophe still excites the minds of the survivors, but the most popular one by far is a vague rumor about a powerful artifact lost somewhere in the long-abandoned City. None of the Seekers truly know what the artifact is, but it is rumored that the one who finds it will become the all-powerful lord of the world. Become one of the Seekers and defeat your enemies in the fight for the artifact and learn of the secrets of Dominance! STRATEGY AND TACTICS Whichever character you choose, take advantage of ricochets and reflections. Even if you’re being shot from a sniper gauss, activate your block or flip ability to save yourself from a potentially lethal situation. It’s not all about charging into battle either, sometimes the best tactic is to hide and wait for an unsuspecting player to approach you, then get out your hockey stick (your ever trusty melee weapon) and knock them out! Remember, always take time to familiarize yourself with the map and your surrounding, after-all a strong tactical player will always have the advantage in a battle!  WEAPONS Speaking of hockey sticks. Even a hockey stick can make your rival sick! ...if you know, when we mean. Dominance has rich weapon variety of wall penetrating energy weapons, ricochet sniper rifles, Kalashnikovs and many more, 15 different weapons in total await you! Weapons range from common everyday pistols and rifles to much more exotic weapons unique to Dominance. For example, the “Friend” razorjack is the only friend you can count on in the City! All weapons can be upgraded upgraded by finding a copy of the item that you want to upgrade. Bring out your inner engineer and turn anything, even an ordinary bow and arrow into a deadly weapon! THE CITY The City was the main center for the study of anomalies before the catastrophe. Now it is a daunting area that presents the Seekers with a great many surprises, some good and some bad. The “fog of war” hides not only you and some useful consumables or mutators, but also serves as an excellent cover opportunity for the enemies. Put your mind to the soundwaves and keep an eye out.

And on the other hand, those labeled “witches”, responsible for conducting a mysterious ceremony that contradicts the rules of the Church. Set forth with Sisters Semilla and Fran, missionaries in the Church’s service, on their journey to thwart the witches’ ceremony and protect the common-folk from heresy that endangers the status quo.

For the first time in many years, I started a game project set in a new universe. It felt like a breath of fresh air for me. With that said, Minoria does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora’s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight). I am proud of what we’ve been making for Minoria, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I’ve prepared this time around! Howdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It’s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of Minoria, knowing what an amazing game it’s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it’s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team’s development experience, just as previous titles have. This game is extraordinary. A must-play if you’ve got an appetite for action-platformers like I do.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,Intel Core 2 Duo E5200,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 9800GTX+ (1GB),DirectX:,Version 10,Storage:,9 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,Intel Core i5,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 560,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,9 GB available space",,

Two languages can be displayed simultaneously. ◆Story Things are looking grim for down-on-his-luck adult comics artist, Ichinari Tsuzurigi. He's struggling to even afford his meager rent, and is seriously considering giving up on his dream, until... His editor, Akira Higashibojo, who's always looking out for him, offers him a position as an assistant to one of the top dogs in the adult comics industry! Thinking of it as a last hurrah, Ichinari accepts. Lo and behold, said top dog turns out to be none other than Ichinari's childhood friend, Iori Shitaka, with whom he made a childhood promise to become manga artists together. Also working as an assistant is dojinshi artist of the moment Nodoka Amabane. Ichinari was her Senpai in manga club during high school, and taught her how to draw. Shocked but elated at this unexpected reunion, they discover that a certain god has taken an interest in their wishes and blessed them with interconnecting ""Fates"" that will forever change the course of their life. And so Ichinari finds himself working on sexy manga while living with a group of women whose burgeoning feelings can't be ignored... ◆Staff Planning/Production: Sayori Illustration: IshiKei SD Illustration: Sayori Plot: Yukihito Music: POPHOLIC ◆Characters Iori Shitaka CV：Momo Hayama ""A childhood friend that may look like the calm and collected type, but in reality she's easy to make blush."" Ultra-popular and one of the most famous adult manga artists in the industry. As childhood friends, she and Ichinari made a promise to pursue their dreams to become manga artists. She continued to work her hardest, with that promise and those feelings in the back of her mind, and before she knew it...she was drawing erotic manga?! Still, believing that if she continues drawing manga she'll one day be reunited with Ichinari, she pours her heart and soul into her porn. Sometimes she worries about the number of pairs of panties she gets through when she's working alone... Nodoka Amabane CV：Chacha Warabi ""A sweet yet sexy vixen on the outside, but inside she's pure, innocent (?) and hopelessly devoted to her Senpai."" A manga artist in one of the most popular dojinshi circles in the fan comics world. Ichinari was her Senpai and the only other member in their high school's manga club. He graduated before she could work up the courage to confess her feelings to him, but she's kept drawing manga to this day in the hope that she would meet him again. She was always a diamond in the rough, but she's now polished up nicely. Her path to drawing dojin was opened up to her by a scene in a magical girl anime where the heroine was tormented by the enemy, and behind her sweet outward appearance lies hidden - and kinky - depths! Akira Higashibojo CV：Mei Hanazono ""This powerful woman isn't to be trifled with, but as Ichinari's Onee-chan she tends to let him get away with almost anything."" Ichinari and Iori's editor. Being super into judo, she's never afraid to be blunt and get straight to the point. Ichinari was her first client, and she soon found herself falling for him.  She's got that big sister vibe to her and, although she can come down on him harshly, mostly she's putty in Ichinari's hands.

									","English,French,Italian,German,Spanish - Spain,Polish,Portuguese,Russian,Portuguese - Brazil",,"Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access"," About This Game  King under the Mountain is a simulation-based settlement-building strategy game set in a fantasy world. The game is based around these central pillars: A simulated world – The game world is built on a series of interlocking systems which combine together to simulate a living, breathing world. As night changes to day, trees and plants will grow (or not) based on sunlight and rainfall. The local environment and changing seasons have effects on the native flora and fauna. Your settlers and other characters have their own personal social and physical needs that you’ll have to fulfil to keep them happy (or at least stop them from breaking and going insane!) Procedural generation – Every map is randomly generated from an initial seed (a large number) so that no two maps will ever be the same – unless you choose to use the same seed! The art assets for the game have been created in such a way that they can be drawn by the game engine for near limitless variation in colour – so every tree, plant and character will have their own unique combination of colours and appearance. Peaceful expansion – It’s an important design goal that it’s possible to play the entire game without getting into armed conflict with other factions (if you choose to). Although weapons and combat can be significant parts of gameplay, we wanted to make sure you can peacefully build up a fully-functioning town to have the satisfaction of sitting back and watching your settlers go about their business in an “art farm” style of play. Multiple ways to play – As well as different ways to build and grow your settlement (do you focus on mining? farming? crafting? buying and selling goods?), in King under the Mountain you can play as several different races and factions each with their own unique gameplay elements. You could build a dwarven fortress dug deep into the side of a mountain, a town of humans at an important river crossing, or a tribe of orcs hunting and raiding others. More than just different races to play as, we want to introduce completely new play styles as unusual factions – perhaps a lone wizard building their secret lair with golems they have constructed, an evil necromancer raising an army of the dead, a dragon amassing a hoard of gold in a giant cave system, or even an invasion of demons attacking the material world. Player-driven content – Have you ever spent hours in a creative game building something, only for it to sit hidden away on your computer? In King under the Mountain, players can opt-in to automatically upload their settlements for other players to visit. This drives the basis of the adventure mode – you put together a party of champions from your settlement’s population, and go off on an adventure to explore another player’s creation. This mode will involve turn-based tactical combat as you explore and battle through another player’s fortress, claiming rare resources that may be difficult or impossible to acquire otherwise. It’s important to note that nothing will be lost by either player in this encounter – you don’t actually “attack” the other player, only a copy of their settlement, and there are benefits to be gained by both parties. Mod friendly engine – Another big design goal is that everything you see or read in the game (and the variables behind them) are fully open to modification. In fact, the base game is built as an engine with one base mod applied to it (which modders can look at to see how things work).

Experience intense tactical online multiplayer action and explore a deep plot and unique storyline built on both single-player and multiplayer missions. In the near future, Earth is hit by an unusual meteorite swarm: the remains of alien fleets decimated by an ancient galactic war. To avoid widespread panic, world governments hide the truth from the population by sending elite mercenary squads to crash sites – gaining access to the alien technology before anyone else can do the same. As a leader of one of these paramilitary organizations, you have to successfully scout, secure, and deliver the weapons and intel found in each alien crash site to paying governments indifferent to loss of life. In time – while performing extremely dangerous incursions for alien artifacts – you begin to lift the veil behind government conspiracies and state-sponsored attempts to use alien technology to control the world’s population. This is only the tip of the iceberg as far as “first contact” goes: Humanity faces a much more real serious threat that could lead to the total eradication of mankind. In physics, “ram pressure” is a pressure exerted on a body moving through a fluid medium, caused by relative bulk motion of the fluid rather than random thermal motion. It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body. . . . A meteoroid traveling supersonically through Earth's atmosphere produces a shock wave generated by the extremely rapid compression of air in front of the meteoroid. It is primarily this ram pressure (rather than friction) that heats the air that in turn heats the meteoroid as it flows around it. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_pressure  Engage in pitched battles against other units as well hostile intelligence services. The goal? Establish contact with any surviving alien beings and uncover the factors that led to the extinction of their civilization. To succeed, you will need to equip and customize your soldiers to make them a well oiled, effective fighting force … eventually gaining knowledge of secrets literally beyond imagination.

First of all, they need to learn to work together to have any hope of coping with the challenges ahead.

Some want to investigate what caused their crash, others wants to stay low and avoid detection by the enemy. There are even whispers of desertion. It is your task to be the unseeing hand that will guide this ragtag group of soldiers through their struggles.

									",English,,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access"," About This Game  The ultimate starship designer, powered by a deep game simulation... Cosmoteer is a starship design, simulation, and battle game. Design a fleet of ships by laying out individual rooms and corridors, including cannons, lasers, shields, and thrusters. Battle other starships to earn bounties and use that money to expand your own ship. A dynamic crew and combat simulation makes every design decision important and interesting. Best-In-Class Starship Designer Design the greatest starship ever made using an interface that is easy-to-learn yet incredibly flexible. Build your ship by placing individual modules onto a grid—weapons, shields, engines, reactors, crew's quarters, and more! Few restrictions and no pre-defined, creativity-limiting hull shapes mean you can create almost any ship you can imagine. The exterior of a ship is like an artist's canvas, but it requires no drawing ability to make your ship look great! Simply pick a color and texture to customize your ship's basic appearance, then optionally add decals such as shapes, symbols, and letters to give it extra visual flourish. Painting your ship is free and has no effect on gameplay. Intelligent Crew Simulation Every starship is operated by a crew numbering from half-a-dozen to hundreds—sometimes more than a thousand—of individually-simulated people. A ship's crew is its lifeblood. Crew not only operate its controls, but they also carry supplies such as ammunition and power batteries to weapons and systems. When a weapon wants to shoot, the crew go pick up ammo or batteries at an ammo factory or reactor and bring them to the weapon—all simulated in real-time. Crew are pretty smart and act mostly on their own, which is a good thing since there can be so many. Your crew are smart enough to figure out what controls need operating, what systems need ammo or power, and how best to get around your ship. They're even smart enough to avoid routes that are already jammed with other people. The crew simulation is what makes starship design so interesting , because how fast a cannon can shoot or how long a shield can stay charged depends directly on how quickly crew can deliver ammo or power to it . As a player, you'll have to think carefully about how you design your ship's layout so that it operates at peak efficiency without exposing its more vulnerable (and sometimes explosive!) modules. Physics-Driven Flight & Combat Every ship is part of a 2D physics simulation , and the position and orientation of its thrusters realistically affects its movement. Small ships with lots of thrusters are fast and nimble, while large ships with proportionally fewer thrusters are naturally slower and more difficult to maneuver. Weapons obey the laws of the physics simulation. Whether or not a cannon or laser hits an enemy depends not on a dice roll but upon the trajectory of the shot and the size and speed of the enemy. Damage is tracked module-by-module , and each module can be individually targeted & destroyed. Some modules can explode, causing collateral damage to the surrounding modules, so you'll have to think carefully about where you place your reactors and munitions. Too close to the edge and they'll be exposed to enemy fire; too far and your weapons won't fire fast enough. Ships can break apart into multiple pieces when their connecting modules are destroyed. Usually this will be a crippling blow, but any piece that has a control room, power, and thrusters can continue to operate independently, potentially remaining a threat to the enemy. Single-Player You are a bounty hunter , traveling from sector to sector, hunting down renegade enemies and destroying them. Earn money for every enemy vanquished . Use your income to repair and upgrade your own fleet, growing bigger and more powerful with every victory. Explore a galaxy in search of bigger and more powerful enemies. The galaxy will crumble before your almighty armada! Or play in a creative sandbox mode with unlimited credits if being a bounty hunter isn't your cup of Earl Grey—the only limit is your imagination! (And the power of your computer.) Multiplayer Battle your friends and enemies in real-time , pitting your designs against theirs. Compete to be the master ""Starship Architect & Commander"" against up to 7 other players in Team vs Team and Free For All battles. Configure a variety of game options by specifying number of ships, total funds, game speed, and other options. Play tiny skirmishes, massive fleet battles, or anywhere in between. Play online in public or private lobbies. Local Area Network and direct I.P. address connections are also supported. Important Note: Multiplayer is NOT SUPPORTED between 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems! And more! Everything you should expect from a PC game, including customizable controls, windowed and borderless display modes, support for high-resolution displays, no mandatory locked framerates, and dozens of other options to tailor the game to your own preferences. It's easy to share your ship designs with friends and other players. Ships are saved as simple PNG image files and can be easily shared on social media like Twitter, Discord, and the official forums—just drag-and-drop the image from your browser right into Cosmoteer and the ship will be instantly playable! A powerful modding framework lets mods change almost any part of the game data, opening up a universe of possibilities beyond the base game. A mods manager makes it easy to install and uninstall mods created by the Cosmoteer community. Unobtrusive tutorials that don't interrupt gameplay and are easy to dismiss or turn off altogether.

									",English,,"Adventure,Indie"," About This Game A country divided by The Wall. To cross it and reach your family, you must compete on - and win - a reality TV show broadcast by the Regime. Ministry of Broadcast is a narrative-driven single player cinematic platformer mixing Orwell’s 1984 with modern reality TV. Rife with dark humor, sarcastic quips, and a general absurdity of the system. Seemingly built overnight, The Wall has divided both a country in two and a man from his family. To see them again, our ginger-haired protagonist has decided to become a contestant on “The Wall Show”, a Regime-organized TV show allowing competitors the opportunity to escape to freedom on the other side. However, as he progresses through the camp, our contestant soon realizes exactly how the Regime and the show operate. The promise of freedom is not exactly what it seems. Inspired by games such as Prince of Persia (1989) and Oddworld: Abe’s Exoddus, Ministry of Broadcast revives the spirit of classic cinematic platformers where players need nimble run-and-jump reflexes as well as a healthy aversion to falling from precarious heights. To reach freedom and family, you must lead the protagonist through each of the Arenas while under the ever-watchful mechanical eye of the Regime. The variety of hazardous, dilapidated environments hold an array of obstacles for you to manage—leg-shattering drops (scared of heights?), flaming barrels of garbage (extra-smelly, extra-flamey), inconveniently-placed spike pits (of course), hanging steel beams (so much rust)—but none of this is to speak of the fates of those you meet along the way. FEATURES Cinematic platformer: Run, jump, crash, and climb your way through each Arena as the narrative unfolds around you. Much of the story is unveiled via smoothly integrated animation sequences, within the environment, or from NPCs muttering bits of dialogue as you dive and dodge around them. Environmental HUD: Rather than having a screen cluttered with overlaid indicators, HP bars, and minimaps, any information the player will need is incorporated into the environment. Hints and clues are meshed into the game’s art, subtle and specific, players will need a keen eye if they want to survive each Arena without breaking their legs. Puzzle-solving: Use your wits, and at times a dash of ruthlessness, to advance through the Arenas. You’ll have to interact with the environment itself to solve most of the puzzles: use the protagonist’s momentum to move platforms, flip the occasional lever, and sometimes you might have to sacrifice an NPC or two to cross a particularly spiky pit. Story and Personality: Featuring lots of impish humor, Grade A sarcasm, and comic mischief, all balanced perfectly with the dark, heavy themes presented in this dystopian world.

Tranquility Base Mining Colony: The Moon - Explorer Version , is the Early Access version to our Tranquility Base Mining Colony: The Moon - Achiever Version, which is due to be released in Summer, 2019. We've been working on the ACHIEVER version for two years now, and decided that since we've had so much fun running around the Moon for the last two years, that we'd share this experience with those fellow space-geeks who'd like to geek out, like us, and explore the Moon from this unique point of view that very few have ever experienced. This is an open-world game area that encompasses about 17,000 sq kilometers of lunar terrain around the Apollo 11 landing site. We've taken topographic data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Laser Altimeter (LOLA) which is mounted on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) to create this 3d map for you to explore. You and your character can view in first-person or third-person perspective as you explore: Begin at the the Starter Arena, along the southern rim of Moltke AC Crater as you learn the fundamentals of Jet-Packing in the Moon's low gravity environment. Explore Hypatia Rille and visit nearby Moltke A Crater and the highlands south of the Sea of Tranquility. Walk or Jet-pack down into the enormous Moltke Crater which is about 6 kilometers across. Head north to visit the Tranquility Base Lunar Reserve Visitor Center, gateway to the Apollo 11 landing site. Head further north to Collins Crater, or the east to see Armstrong Crater or to the far west to visit Aldrin Crater, all named after the Apollo 11 astronauts. There is so much more to see and explore. You'll see just how beautiful the Moon actually is up close and personal, from the vast Sea of Tranquility to the highlands and mountains in the south.

The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find booze and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wack fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by booze. The more he drinks, the more his blood alcohol level increases, which is sort of good for him. As a result there may be either negative or positive effects.

We pitch this as ""Goldeneye 007"" meets ""Metal Gear Solid"" in an immersive VR world.  The prototype presents players with 6 of the game's 200 Virtual Challenges and a Sandbox Environment to test out the core stealth mechanics.  With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium.  Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire with less than 10ms of latency. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This game contains some content that is not recommended for all audiences, including gun violence.

									","English,German",,"Action,Adventure,Indie"," About This Game  What if I told you, we've done this before? You've read this text, you've looked at these screenshots, and you've watched this trailer. Not once, but a hundred times. Maybe even more. And in five minutes, you won't remember any of it – and do it all over again. Escape the Loop is an episodic open-world adventure game about time and recollection. You're stuck in a time loop – after five minutes, the world goes back to its initial state. Everything resets. You keep nothing. Except your memory of past loops. Every loop will be exactly the same, unless you change it through your actions. Use your knowledge of previous loops to find out what causes the time disruptions and break free once and for all. An Open-world Episodic Game You don't really hear the terms open-world and episodic together that often. It may seem somewhat counter intuitive to combine both in a single game, but Escape the Loop does just that. This unique approach will allow you to spend as much time with one episode, as you want. Try figuring out how to beat it, or waste your days exploring town, annoying neighbors, learning to play an instrument, or do whatever else you can think of doing in a time loop. Each episode will not only be another chapter in Amelia's story, but also add a unique twist to the time loop mechanic, changing the town and its residents in new ways. This will make every episode as explorable as the previous one, with new things to do and more time to spend.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows Vista,Processor:,2.0 GHz Dual Core,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GT 460 or AMD Radeon HD 5550 w/ 1024 MB,Storage:,2 GB available space,Minimum:,OS:,OS X 10.8,Processor:,2.0 GHz Dual Core,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GT 460 or AMD Radeon HD 5550 w/ 1024 MB,Storage:,2 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 8.1,Processor:,2.4 GHz Intel i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 660 Ti or AMD Radeon HD 7870 w/ 1024 MB,Storage:,2 GB available space,Recommended:,OS:,OS X 10.11,Processor:,2.4 GHz Intel i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 660 Ti, or AMD Radeon HD 7870 w/ 1024 MB,Storage:,2 GB available space",,

									","English,German,Spanish - Spain,Japanese,Polish,Russian",,"Action,Free to Play,Indie"," About This Game  Become a War Builder – construct your perfect Machine out of basic components and enlist it in a multiplayer, strategic match. If you like constructing and appreciate tactical team play, this is a game for you! Electronic Warfare War Builder League, apart from traditional gameplay, has the mechanics of an electronic battle, i.e. taking control over an enemy, electronic defense of one’s allies, locking the target, radar jamming or control of one’s own visibility to hackers. Construction Build your own War Machine out of basic components – you can design it exactly the way you want. Attach caterpillar tracks to move about in a difficult terrain, design an optimal armor arrangement and configuration of the weapons of your choice. You may combine the elements the way you prefer – be creative and build unique Machines which will shine at the battlefield. Predict your unit’s behavior in combat and adjust the design to your chosen strategy. We have developed an intuitive, easy to learn building interface. In the hangar there are screens which display detailed statistics of individual components and the whole Machine. Mirror modes in three axes will allow you to build symmetrical units fast and undo/redo buttons will become indispensable should you change your mind. Combat skills of your Machine, and whether it will prove itself in a battlefield or not, will depend on the parts you have built it from and the way in which these parts are joined. Before you put your Machine into battle, check how it operates using the test ride, during which it will fight its own clone. Tactical Match You will win provided that your Machine is effective and your team support one another and fight strategically. Battles in War Builder League were designed to be both team-based and tactical. The match consists in taking over strategic points which provide the team with specific advantages (e.g. faster repair of damaged units). Planning, team playing and strategy are more important in a match than “skill” and eye-hand coordination. We have designed numerous systems and mechanics which ensure that the match will be truly tactical and exciting: - Hacking and fighting hackers – allows to take control over an enemy Machine. - Support systems such as healing or energy charging. - Cloaking (invisibility) – allows to hide completely from the enemy. - Fire booster – causes much greater damage during surprise attack. Sounds complicated? Players will be gradually introduced into the mechanics available in the game and surely won’t get lost in them. Even during the tests players were using all the mechanics and were cooperating with one another as they had noticed how much it helped them to win. Realistic and Predictable Physics We decided place emphasis on a realistic and intuitive simulation of physics as we believe that it is one of the crutial elements of “build and fight” game type. Accordingly, Machines’ behavior is predictable and they operate exactly the way the Builder foresaw it. The game calculates accurately which of your unit’s parts got hit and decides on this basis whether and to what extent the Machine’s elements should be damaged. It also adjusts the Machine’s parameters to the new situation. If your unit loses its radars you won’t know who’s your ally and who’s your enemy. A heavy element got shot off? The center of gravity will shift and the machine will move in a different way. It is a part of our physics to account for the units’ mass, which is a unique solution in this type of games. Your heavily armored unit crashes against a light Machine? The latter will bounce off you as if it hit a wall. All of this makes it possible for you to predict how the Machine is going to behave in a variety of conditions and plan your tactics accordingly. Before taking part in a battle, an experienced Builder spends a lot of time devising their tactics and designing their unit. They know what they want to achieve and have tools ready to do just that. The World Machine battles take place in the dark world of the future. The last of the people are dying out of old age, lonely on the distant planets light years away, surrounded by Machines and deserted factories. They still conduct wars – battles between Machines which allow them to gain resources, experience and fame. Battles distract them from thinking about their own fate and provide entertainment. Playing the game, you will become immersed in a rich, industrial world of the future to discover its mysteries.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7 64 Bit,Processor:,Intel i3,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Radeon R7 250,  GeForce GT 730,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space,Sound Card:,Integrated Sound","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7 64 Bit,Processor:,Intel i5,Memory:,12 GB RAM,Graphics:,Radeon RX 570, GeForce GTX 1050,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space,Sound Card:,Integrated Sound",,

									","English,German",,"Adventure,Indie,Simulation,Strategy"," About This Game  Through the Darkest of Times  Berlin, January 1933. “Adolf Hitler is chancellor!” We all know where that message will lead to, unspeakable horrors and suffering will come to the world. Too few are standing up against the monstrosity of the German Reich. Will you? Lead an underground resistance group Through the Darkest of Times. In this strategy game, based on historical events, you plan the actions of your fighters. But what can you do? Fight? A whole army, a whole nation against your group of five. So you have to act carefully and win the hearts and minds of the people, gather more followers, gain more support. And most important: stay alive. You are always in grave danger, if the Gestapo (Germany’s Secret Service Police during the Third Reich) finds out what you are doing, you might end up in prison or worse. Plan. Act. Survive. Through the Darkest of Times is a turn-based gaming-experience. You assign your comrades on important tasks: Produce leaflets or write messages on walls to inform the people what the Nazis are up to. Gather intel about Nazi-Operations and make them public. Sabotage. The bolder you are, the higher the risk – but you want to change something, right? Divided into 4 Chapters, Through the Darkest of Times follows the actual events of the Third Reich era, but your actions have a meaningful impact on your life, the life of your group’s members and many people around you. Your members are procedurally generated on each playthrough. They come with different personalities, abilities and views. That makes them more suitable for certain tasks but at the same time more vulnerable. Sebastian Schulz: 'Lets develop an artstyle that the Nazis would have banned' Experience history. Through the Darkest of Times creates a sombre mood. You’ll find out more and more about the cruelty, happening around your group. People disapear without a trace, taken by the official police, sometimes found dead shortly after. There are no good or bad decisions, often you’ll have to choose the lesser of two evils and take the consequences. You will always feel the pressure. Have you been watched during your last operation? Can you really trust that new member of your group? Did you do enough to help that family the other day? Dark times need people with the heads held high, no matter what comes. Features: World War II from a new angle: Resist without fighting Unique art style, inspired by Weimar Art Everyday heroes: Your team is made from plumbers, doctors, priests, secretaries or salesmen, not trained fighters Showing history as it was: As one of the first games ever (in Germany), Through the Darkest of Times received the permission to openly show the Swastika and other symbols of the Nazis to call the enemy by it’s name Alternative timeline mode: Could the reign of the Nazis have been ended before 1945?

									","English,Japanese",,"Action,Indie"," About This Game Brave Earth: Prologue is a challenging and engaging action platformer, made in the 8-bit style of the NES. While heavily inspired by classic games such as Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden, Brave Earth: Prologue strikes its own balance between methodical, high risk gameplay and aggressive, fast-paced action. Brave Earth: Prologue's beautiful, handcrafted levels are filled with meticulously placed challenges, aiming to engage players more than frustrate them. Play through a story that spans three characters with their own unique paths and playstyles. Naomi vos Cruz, the young, inexperienced knight who is sent on a simple courier mission that spirals out of control. She finds herself battling  monsters and mercenaries in a struggle to stop a cult's powerful, demonic ritual. While not particularly mobile, Naomi has several special attacks to help her deal with various situations. Sinlen Rothschild, a powerful and mobile mage and Naomi's best friend. Ambushed during the investigation of ancient ruins, Sinlen defends herself with a wide assortment of long range magic. Trevor vos Cruz, Naomi's older brother and Master Hunter for The Church. While Trevor is slow in attacking with his giant sword, Verbanner, he excels at quick, evasive maneuvers. Three playable characters with diverse abilities Unique paths for each character, including original stages and unique paths through intersecting stages Over a dozen richly detailed and lovingly crafted levels Intense, memorable boss fights Beautiful cutscene art by Neolucky A wonderfully composed VRC6 soundtrack by Necrophageon and with additional tracks by SK Ultra Tons of optional lore that does not distract from the core storyline or gameplay It feels like years since I first announced Brave Earth: Prologue. Mostly because it actually has been. The side project that was supposed to take a few months instead sprawled into a retail game that has taken several years to complete. Brave Earth wears its influences a bit... shamelessly on its sleeve. The game was originally conceived to be a freeware ""study"" game for me -- learning through emulation. But the product I'm releasing is more than just emulation. I've tried my best to both understand and then build upon one of my favorite eras in platformers to almost arrive at a uniquely different alternative reality. A more modern sensibility without playing like a modern take on a retro game. As George Lucas's Star Wars built upon and paid tribute Flash Gordon while establishing its own voice, I'm hoping Brave Earth can do the same. This is Dan Stern from Dangen Entertainment. I’m both pleased and proud to present Brave Earth: Prologue. I’ve said in other places how happy I am for pixel art to have made a come back with the independent development scene. The pixel art in BEP is excellent, but what I have found to stand out and amaze me in this game is the meticulous care that Kayin put into designing the encounters. It doesn’t come as any surprise to me considering his previous work, but in no time at all I got the feeling that he was in my own head in a sense. Kayin’s complete understanding of player psychology is as enviable as it is rare in game development. I Wanna Be the Guy was a game that was completely designed around it. Traps spring up and invisible blocks bar your path, leading to your frequent death. It was almost as much a commentary on game design in a meta sense as it was a clever arrangement of platforming puzzles. In Brave Earth: Prologue, by contrast, traps and obstacles are laid bare before you. This is not a game meant to trick you cleverly, but rather to masterfully utilize a comprehensive understanding of what makes for a satisfying challenge. It’s remarkable that the game also leads the player along a logical path through the game’s world, with three totally different playable characters, no less. While level-based rather than open world, BEP still gave me a powerful sense of progress, journey and adventure. To find that depth of setting in a game with so much attention paid to the gameplay balance is impressive to say the least. I couldn’t be more proud to work with a talented developer like Kayin. This game is a masterpiece of 8-bit era game design and it vastly raises the bar in my eyes as a gamer. I can’t wait for you all to experience it.",,,,,

									",English,,"Action,Indie"," About This Game Millennia ago, the ancient inhabitants of our tiny planet reached beyond Sol and to the stars only to lose this gift to an unforeseen cataclysm. An unlikely discovery in the 21st century re-introduced humankind to this lost technology, enabling the transmission of perception to both spacecraft and synthetic humanoids. As a result, unbounded colonial expansion followed. The Vibe Project Genesis is a competitive FPS and 3rd person space combat shooter where teams battle each other for prestige, tech, and dominion! Things happen quickly in Project Genesis. You might be launching a hail of missiles into a doomed craft before breaching and boarding a capital ship you’re intent on commandeering. One minute you're setting an attack ship on fire off the shoulder of Enceladus II, the next you're rattling through the void in a breech pod and tearing through an enemy bulkhead. Project Genesis aims to hit some of the most dramatic and iconic moments of space opera action in a visceral and evocative way. The Control Space flight is played in third-person; steer the ship and freely aim the camera and weapons at targets. The flight model is simple and designed to get you jumping into the fray quickly without complicated flight controls. Weapons are easy to use, targeting and HUD intuitive and clear. The First Person Shooter experience is follows the standard control scheme common in most FPS combat games. After acquiring a breach point, blast off in your assault pod, tear into the targeted vessel and prepare for the fight of your life in a thrilling first-person combat space. Avatar combat is close quarters, fluid and familiar The emphasis in Project Genesis is seamlessly merging these two modes without having to adjust to new control configurations and viewing perspectives. The System Across 3rd person space combat, and FPS modes, the controls use a common paradigm: - HP—Hull or Health, the primary damage resource - Energy (E)—the consumable resource for shields, weapons, and abilities - Two main weapons—a primary and a secondary - One passive and two active abilities Spacecraft and avatar designs set up familiar relationships—tank, support, dps, etc.—but synergies and solo viability are always in mind. Boost and sprint, shields, recharge and cell capacities, weapon loadouts, countermeasures, abilities, utilities/throwables create a lot of levers. The rest is dominating with weaponized support craft in space. The Match The current approach is best-of three-round matches, where later rounds depend on earlier outcomes. To win a round, complete your team objective before the clock runs out. Easy. On the way, take opportunities to gain advantage for your team, now or in the next round. If neither team gets the upper hand in the first two rounds, a final round is played, wrapping up the match in dramatic fashion. Our community has been crucial to every step as we develop our core play, and continues to be our focus as mode, mission and map designs progress. There's so much more fun to be had and we hope you’ll join in the process of getting there with us. The Season A season in *Project Genesis* is structured around a bundle of story, stuff and features, with a full competitive Circuit. Each season offers limited content to every player, and Battle Passes grant access to season-limited cosmetics and collectibles. In Season One, explore the Project Genesis universe where you'll battle as mercenaries and radicals and suck-up loyalists. Circuit play begins after the deployment and testing of a Season.

It is designed around the idea of ""being thrown into the world"". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world, you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself.  Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you.  GAMEPLAY FEATURES  -Cohesive “lived-in” world - Scorn takes place in an open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze-like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing world you’re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won’t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels. Everything has a reason and purpose - you just need to work out what it is.  -Full body awareness – Players will experience better immersion being aware of the character’s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls etc.  -Inventory and ammo management - is defined and limited.

We love that sheer easy-to-learn-hard-to-master attitude. The fun of playing with friends in a game where you need tactics, ammo clips, bravery and perhaps a bit of luck. Game Modes TO4: Tactical Operations brings the game modes that we all know. Team play on every map with bombing (and/or defusing) scenario’s, hostages rescue, the hacking of important assets and escaping with the whole team before the other team finds you. And most important, if you don’t succeed in one of those objectives, you always have the classic Team Deathmatch. Playing the game The game is a classic round based game. At the beginning of the (timed) round you can buy weapons, armour, and grenades with the money you have earned the round before. When you and your comrades are all geared up, you will find yourself in unique worlds where you will have an objective. Complete the objective, wipe out the entire other squad or let the round time run out. The choice is up to you. But it will reward you with stronger weapons, good map rankings and good long fights. Key elements The movement of TO4: Tactical Operations is something unique. The game is fast, an almost arcade-like feeling in a realistic world. carrying a knife, pistol or rifle, your movement speed will not differ.

You will find yourself switching between your 3 weapon inventory slots to win that 1 v 1 battle with an opposing player. Firefights take longer, you will not die instantly from only one shot.

Every golf course is a new surprising type of golf, some brilliant or hilarious, others so absurd they will make you go: WHAT THE GOLF? Golf is always the same: perfectly round balls, 18 holes, blue sky, neatly cut grass and fancy people in nice clothes. What's not to hate? – Hate no more! You must have a lot of questions about our vision for golf. Why is the golfer not part of the game? Driving range? Home in one? Can all ball games be reimagined as golf? What is a First Person Golfer? Are all Olympic Games just special case golf games? Could golf “steal” some ideas from other games? Can you hear people golf in space? How many balls does it take to fix golf? How would you like some FLIPPING golf? If you can imagine it, you can golf it... With advanced video game technology we can turn anything into a golf game. WHAT THE GOLF? is a silly reinvention of golf that doesn't care too much about rules, pars, eagles, or any of that. You get to hit things and they fly away with fun physics. It's a goofy game that borrowed the shooting mechanic from golf but uses it for moving houses, driving cars, and golfing people.

									","English,Russian",,"Indie,RPG,Strategy"," About This Game  Sin Slayers is an RPG with roguelike elements set in a dark fantasy world, where your choices determine how challenging the fights and enemies will be. Create, equip and lead a team of heroes. Each unit will have its own abilities and weaknesses, so plan your combat strategy accordingly. You’ll journey through stinking primeval forests, boneyards riddled with crypts and the graves of fallen warriors, and other places even the bravest adventurer would fear to tread. Battles, traps, and bizarre enemies... Everything and everyone wishes to take your life, but don't succumb to despair. Between fights your party can take their rest at a fountain, or while on the road in an old church which leaves its doors open to the weary and wounded. Travel every path and byway of the Valley, obtain new weapons on the field of battle or by fulfilling quests, gather ingredients for magical elixirs and resources to craft armor and amulets. If a certain item is beyond your crafting ability, ask the blacksmith in the Old Church for help. The best gear will allow you to challenge the deadliest monsters. The souls of many heroes were cursed upon death, leaving them to wander a dark and uncharted world, an afterlife reserved for sinners. Is this the end, or..? Gather your team. Equip them with weapons, armor, and amulets. Level up your abilities as you move forward. The Sin Lords must be slain. Sin Slayers features a classic turn-based combat system in the tradition of the best JRPGs, giving you free rein to pit your tactical skills against the wretched inhabitants of the Valley of Fallen Sinners. Steel yourself. Enemies are everywhere and you will need to make difficult decisions and face dire peril to prevail. Depending on your choices, the sinfulness of your team will go up or down. If it's high — expect tougher enemies. Whatever might be buried there, is it wise to desecrate those graves? Every decision you make matters, and on the road to the next Sin Lord you will have many opportunities to choose poorly. Every crusade against a Sin Lord will be unique as every location is randomly generated. Think you know everything there is to know about a fetid swamp? We promise there are new lessons to learn, though they may not be to your liking! Legends tell of a place betwixt worlds, a region outside time and space called the Valley of Fallen Sinners. A dense, preternatural fog lays like stinking breath over black woods. What cursed hordes await? Vicious beasts, damned warriors, the undead, and worse chthonian horrors, all with an unslakable craving for new souls to perpetuate their own unnatural life. This region is for the most contemptible cowards, those who died because of their sins and the darkness weighing down their souls. At one time, they lived as brave heroes across a multitude of worlds, and bards composed ballads to their noble deeds. Until the day darkness flooded their hearts and killed them. Now regret consumes them, but their souls will find no rest. They are doomed to wander the Valley endlessly, searching for rest, respite, an end to their torture. But they will know no peace until someone destroys the seven seals of the Portal of the Worlds. Only then will the gates open and the damned finally escape their prison... Truth be told, no one has attempted this before. https://store.steampowered.com/app/760080/Hazardous_Space/ https://store.steampowered.com/app/921800/Encased_A_SciFi_PostApocalyptic_RPG/ ",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows XP,Processor:,CPU 2100 MHz,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 210 or similar videocard,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Storage:,1 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,CPU 2400 MHz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 420 or similar videocard,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Storage:,1 GB available space",,

We fought with Horus at Terra and with Abaddon at Cadia. A handful of ancients even remember the pacification of Luna, fighting alongside the False Emperor as we crushed the gene-cultists. Yes, we have fought a long, long war. Yet, these ten thousand years, our Warband has been undivided in its faith, even though the Imperium still stands. When Cadia fell, we were there. We made our prayers to the Dark Gods for guidance and entered the Warp behind Abaddon’s fleet, and there we stayed, stuck like insects in some dead gods’ amber. We wandered dark corners, lost to the warp’s delights, until our craft found an entryway to… this dead planet. This pathetic world that stinks of the Corpse God’s Empire and more. Why have we been brought here? Something is here, something the Dark Gods need us to claim. We will find it and make it our own. Warhammer 40,000: Gladius is back with a new playable faction, the Chaos Space Marines . Fueled by their hatred for the Imperium, they will stop at nothing before they exact their revenge. Fielding hellish machines, wielding Warp powers and possessing the experience of a thousand wars, these ancient warriors are ready to conquer Gladius Prime, killing and enslaving all who oppose them. In the name of the Warmaster, and their Dark Gods. Champions who prove themselves in battle might find boons bestowed upon them by the Dark Gods, and even rise to the rank of Daemon Prince. But beware, for the Gods are fickle, and those who they do not consider worthy will be transformed into Chaos Spawns instead. Chaos Space Marines have fought a 10,000 years long war on the Imperium and its Corpse-Emperor. All servants of the Imperium are their arch-enemy: as thus all Chaos Space Marines units have experience in fighting against Space Marine units and gain increased morale and melee accuracy. Chaos cities are designed to glorify the Dark Gods and torture their inhabitants in the Gods’ name. Population is a resource that Chaos Space Marines can use for unholy rites, granting significant temporary boosts depending on the God which is being worshipped. Worship any of the four Chaos Gods, and spend influence to gain unique permanent buffs to individual units.

Four types of pickups allow players to open doors, mirror rooms, break bubbles that protect pickups, and destroying roots that block doors and walls.

Mysteriously, you have been exposed to a very familiar, but largely different world. What has happened to you? Are there other victims, or are you alone in your tiny plight? There are so many questions that need answering - but don't worry about that right now...that squirrel watching you, is looking pretty hungry.  With SMALLAND , the survival genre gets a tinier take that lets you appreciate the little things. Or flee in terror of the little things. The slightest breeze can sweep your items or even your house away from you. The simplest rainfall can form puddles the size of lakes in a matter of minutes.  There's an adventure out there waiting for you when you're small - a new world full of challenges to conquer and ecosystems to explore. Though take care, for this world is as dangerous, as it is amazing. You'll need to keep your wits about you and craft tools to keep yourself alive in this new world. With the help of your friends, you don't have to do it alone. Key Features If simply experiencing the world from a new perspective is what you want, you can admire a breathtaking sunset or experience the beauty of nature from an all-new perspective in peaceful mode. Being this small opens up brand new places you could never dream of going at your normal height. Protip: don't go into the sewer when it's raining. The world of nature is about the struggle of survival. At this size you are no longer above this struggle. Every animal in this ecosystem is trying to get from day to day, and it does not matter to them if you do anything or not. Ants take food for their colony, cats hunt mice, life goes on. A problem we've seen in a lot of survival games is that there isn't enough symbiotic interaction with the world. It could rain for days, and it doesn't affect much more than your mood. But at this miniscule size, involved interaction with the world around you is all but unavoidable. You can't ignore rain or snow anymore.

									",English,,Strategy," About This Game At dawn on June 18th, the torrential rain which had soaked the Belgium countryside the previous day began tapering off. Seventy thousand French troops, constituting the bulk of Napoleon’s Armee du Nord, which two days earlier had vanquished the Prussian Army of the Rhine at Ligney, now expected to exploit their initial victory by destroying the unsupported and inexperienced Anglo-Dutch forces which the Duke of Wellington had deployed across the Brussels-Charleroi highway a few miles south of the inconsequential hamlet called Waterloo. That morning at his headquarters in Le Caillou, Napoleon discussed the impending battle with his subordinates while awaiting the arrival of several French Corps which had bivouacked further south. Disagreeing with the French generals whom Wellington had consistently defeated in Spain, Napoleon insisted that his opponent was a poor commander and that the English troops were much inferior to the French. The battle which Napoleon envisioned would resemble ‘le petit dejeuner’, Wellington’s army would be devoured as easily as a light continental breakfast. Key Features Historically accurate game play. 7 battle maps including Quatre Bras Hougomont La Haye Sainte Plancenoit Waterloo Accurate Napoleonic Units. Five categories of unit quality.

Run, jump, hang, climb, roll, and shoot your way through mysterious alien ruins, a flying penitentiary, a high-tech megalopolis, and a majestic forest. As Earth became inhospitable, Noah, an AI whose sole purpose was to preserve humanity, was created. Noah chose the Moon as humanity's Ark - renamed Lunark - using it as a ship to evacuate a handful of chosen ones to the nearest superhabitable planet. Unfortunately, whether the planet was inhabited or not wasn't part of Noah’s programming. Centuries later, you play as Leo, an orphan rejected for being… different. You'll retrace your origins in the midst of a rebellion against the totalitarian regime of Lunark, and meet a wide cast of colorful characters, stuck on either side of the escalating conflict. I've designed Lunark as a homage to cinematic platformers while bringing modernity to a lot of the core aspects: The controls are responsive and intuitive and the progression system generous. The game is meant to feel fresh while being nostalgic. Lunark is also an adventure focused on delivering a thrilling narrative with explosive moments. THE GENRE You have no idea what a 2D cinematic platformer is? “Cinematic platformers are action-adventure platformers with a strong emphasis on realism, cinematic presentation, detailed character animations, [...] and a minimalistic approach to storytelling”.

Eliot SURVIVE THE BLACKOUT is a narrative survival game set in a dark post-apocalyptic world where a mysterious global power outage sends the civilization spiraling down into chaos. The player becomes the reluctant leader of a small group of survivors and try to get them to a safe haven. In their journey, every step is a choice to make, and none of them will be simple. Manage a small team of survivors Carefully make your choices as a branching narrative unfolds Scavenge for supplies and manage your resources Explore the world after the fall of civilization in multiple unique playthroughs Be the relentless leader the survivors need in the harsh reality of the civilization in ruins, make all the dramatic choices, and face their consequences. Experience the story unfolding differently each time you play. Find out, what are YOU willing to sacrifice to Survive the Blackout! The world of Survive the Blackout isn’t your average extravagantly stylized, farfetched post-apo setting. The game presents a plausible scenario of the fall of human civilization. A global power outage caused by factors unknown to general public is enough for the better part of the modern world to crumble and the society to collapse. The dire consequences of such an event are powerful enough, without the need to include any supernatural or fantastic motifs. How did the Blackout affect the world? The survivors will travers different regions, each with its own flavor, local storylines, unique risks and opportunities. Through their eyes the player will experience the familiar world reduced to ruin and filled with desperation. The apocalypse doesn’t make people more interesting, than they already are. But it tends to bring out the best, the worst, and the weirdest in people. The story of post-apocalypse is best told from many different personal perspectives. Anyone who ever played a game like Fallout or other genre RPG or adventure will remember how the world came alive with all the NPCs, telling their stories, adding their own colorful presence to the overall experience. Preppers. Looters. Orphans. Healers. Murderers. Psychos. Beggars. Loners. Heroes. Opportunists. Thieves. Each of Everyone you meet on the road is a person with their own story, motivation, and personality. Each encounter lets you experience the story of humanity’s fall a little deeper. With all the rules gone, without the safety that civilization provides, each decision you make becomes a matter of life and death. Survive the Blackout is a narrative game where you make choices reacting to the circumstances your group of survivors face. It is up to you if you want to base them on morals, desperate will to survive, or some other ideals. Whatever you decide, you will have to bear in mind not only the immediate, but also the long-term consequences of your actions. Managing supplies, issuing orders, moving forward, protecting the party, keeping the morale and giving everyone a sense of purpose is the daily labor of the leader. The party will offer you their take on the matters, but will you listen to them, or try to force your own ideas? It’s all up to you. Survive The Blackout is an open-ended, and non-linear experience, because we want it to mimic life as well as a small indie game can manage. But we also want it to be finite and satisfying. Playing the game from start to finish will always provide you with a whole story. A different story in every playthrough, based on your decisions and luck, but a complete story nonetheless. While we hope that the sales of our title provide us with means and motivation to develop its world and the story even further via future content expansions, our main focus is to keep true to how we think games should be developed and sold: as complete products, and not as a “service”. It would mean a lot to us, if you considered adding Survive the Blackout to your Steam Wishlist. Baby Bison Games is a small, Warsaw-based indie team aiming to deliver an ambitious survival adventure. We’re taking the (nowadays less-travelled) path of truly independent development, declining investors and publishers in favor of complete freedom to make and sell the game on our own terms. If you like what you see here you can show us your support by wishlisting Survive the Blackout!"," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  The world of Survive the Blackout is a vivid representation of society's downfall after an apocalypse-tier global disaster. It contains detailed written description and low-res pixel-art representation of disturbing scenes. Violence, brutality, harm and mutilation, self-harm, substance abuse, sexual violence, slavery, racism, and hate speech are all a part of the harsh post-apocalyptic reality.

It's still in early development, so everything about it might change!  Right now, combat is about finding clever ways to use your spells to smash your enemies into walls, knock them through windows, or trick them into shooting each other. They're mostly fighting back with guns and grenades, though as the game progresses you'll probably come up against enemy magic users too.  Between fights, we're planning on branching dialogue where you learn more about your team of unique characters and chat about their next objectives. We'd like to also give you some choice of equipment and skills, but no grand strategy layer or base building.  We're imagining it'll be a story driven campaign, maybe 8 hours ish, not a roguelike or permadeath game."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  The game has a stylised rather than realistic look, but people sure do get shot, stabbed, slammed into walls, smashed through windows, turned into crabs, etc.  There is blood, necromancy, drugs both real and magical, and one spell involves something like euthenasia?  Substance abuse may be a theme but the substance is mana potions - I don't know if that makes it better or worse.  ",,,,

									",English,,Adventure," About This Game You wake up to nothing. You are nowhere. The only thing that surrounds you is the whiteness. You don't know who or what you are. All you see is that when you walk you leave a trail in the white nothing. What does it mean? How do you get out of here? Is there anywhere for you to get out to?  FAQ : 1. What is this game? This is not a puzzle game. This is more like a treasure hunt or ARG. This game hides and obfuscates as much as it possibly can.  A puzzle game would give you mechanics and expect you to solve something. This game lies to you and gives you nothing to go by. Once you figure out what you have to do, the rest of the game is trivial.  A puzzle game is clever, fair and self-contained. This is obtuse and dumb. Once you figure out the subject matter, you have to an internet search to solve the rest of the game. You cannot solve the game without knowledge of certain things which are not presented in the game itself.  There is an A-HA moment though but I don't expect everyone to decipher it. Once the secret is revealed, there won't be a point in playing this game. So stay away from spoilers in the comments, if you want to try this yourself.",,,,,

The Survivors is an Arctic Western Battle Royale where you and 99 other gold hunters fight for a claim in the gold rush. Scavenge for equipment in the rough, unforgiving Silverspring County. The environment sets the pace; only storm eyes are safe from the raging storm, and bandits are out for your gold. Do you have what it takes, or will you be blinded by your greed? How do I sign up for the Closed Alpha? Fill in this form! You will be added to a list, from which we select testers in batches. Features Play on a huge map with up to 99 other players to stake your claim for the gold hidden in Silverspring County. Using four different weapons you'll be ready for any situation. With the scaling game systems, you can enjoy the match whether you're playing with 10 or 99 other players! Silverspring County contains a wide variety of environments. The boreal forest in the southwest provides cover and hides piles of loot, whereas in the northwest the bandits rule the land, and the remnants of frontier towns dot the landscape in the east. Over the course of the match, a snowstorm will develop with several storm eyes, which are your only havens from the impending rage of the storm. Beware, as you will not be the only one seeking safety. After the storm settles down, run freely across the map as you seek shelter within the next storm eye. Eventually, only one shrinking storm eye will remain as the storm engulfs all of Silverspring County. Bandits have claimed small settlements across the map. It is up to you to decide if it is more worthwhile to fight for the loot or to take a detour around the ruthless raiders. As you loot, you may be fortunate enough to stumble upon boxes of scrap. You can use these to easily craft weapon attachments, giving you an edge on the battlefield. What is Closed Alpha? Closed Alpha is a state very early in game development. Expect art and gameplay to be in an unfinished state and subject to change. Your feedback will shape the direction of this game in the times to come. How does Closed Alpha work?

Millions of calculations per second, complex algorythms coding - all that just to make human life easier. Any outside input required has been reduced to the bare minimum.

Now, let's talk about all the planned features that will be added as development continues. The following list is ordered by the date we plan to add the mentioned features. Additionally, we will add more content for existing features, e.g. more quests and planet types.  Dungeons and raids MMO-like dungeons and raids that are procedurally generated. Imagine a pyramid with labyrinthine corridors that ultimately lead to bosses that will hopefully drop your desired item. Mods and user-generated content Support for easy modding, including a terrain editor for custom terrains with custom quests. Most of the content is already defined in XML files, so we will only have to add some logic that loads user-generated XML files and some code for interaction between different mods. Additionally, a Lua API will be added to support more advanced mods. Mods will not only be easy to create, but also easy to install - if you connect to a modded server, you will not even have to manually install mods since this will be done automatically. Space stations Feeling lonely in space? No one can hear you scream? Well, then visit one of the space stations and meet with other folks! Trade your goods on the intergalactic market, buy upgrades for your spaceship and much more! Battles in space Fight other players and NPCs in epic battles in space.

									",English,9,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy"," About This Game  Summary You are a crew member of a cyborg space ship. A signal passes through the ship and hacks everyone's brains. The entire crew loses control and they all start killing each other. It becomes a huge battle royal. However, for some reason, you aren't affected like the others by the hack: you manage to keep partial control over your own actions. Despite your cerebral limitations you are still the only one left that can do something and save the ship. The situation of living the adventure with a hacked brain translates to an interesting game play in which you do not control yourself in real time. Instead you can only make specific decisions at specific moments when the hack in your brain lets you. During these moments time pauses leaving you all the time you want to make your decisions. When you finish taking your decisions you must unpause time and watch your mindless automated body act. During this time you can only hope to survive until the next time your hacked brain allows you to make a conscious choice. Content Campaign: The campaign is made out of 81 levels accompanied by a small story line that will immerse you into the depth of a dark mysterious future. Chaotic Universes Mode: In this mode levels are randomly generated. Every attempt to beat a 'Chaotic Universe' is a different experience. There is a total of 5 Chaotic Universes that get harder and harder. Each Chaotic Universe is made out of 26 levels. During an attempt to beat a chaotic universe you won't be able to save your progress, so if you lose all your lives you will have to restart the 26 levels from the beginning. This mode is extremely unforgiving and it's only recommended for more experienced players. It's not even sure that the final chaotic universe is beatable. Sandbox mode: In this mode you can create your own levels and save them. Creating levels is very simple, it's just a matter of dropping elements into the field. You can mix item compositions to create insane fight scenarios. In this mode you can also view the saved replays of your exploits. You can even retry to beat the levels from the replays.", Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  There is mainly fights with cyborgs shooting each other and stabbing each other.

Under the pretext of ensuring security and order, many civil rights of citizens are being violated and modern technology has become a tool of the authorities to manipulate people. People are being surveilled in every possible way - via social media, CCTV, their online payments, device tracking and many others. Liberated is also a story about authoritarianism: about how it appears in a democratic society, gradually develops and ultimately tears it down. STORY The story presented in Liberated focuses on the fate of a group of people which has decided to oppose the new social order by using various methods of resistance even resorting to violence. On the other side there are representatives of the police and government, for whom the priority is to ensure order by all means possible, sometimes even by violating human freedoms. By exploring the story from different perspectives and both sides of the conflict, player learns the history of a world and begins to understand the motivations of various characters. The player also learns that any action and any decision will bring consequences and story can change.

His journey to find his parents, or at least find out what has happened to them, will take him into his worst nightmares – the seat of learning has been transformed into a place of death and horror. As he makes his way through the madness, Marcus will have to fight to make it out alive and with his sanity intact. Starting with just a handful of items to help him navigate the dimly lit corridors, he has to summon all his strength to survive and continue the search for his parents. Even though it might already be too late, his hopes of finding them alive will not die – unlike everyone else on campus, who already seem to have met their own gory end. Explore and look for clues that will help you unravel the mystery of how a university has become a slaughterhouse. Keep your eyes open – your flashlight could die any minute and engulf you in darkness. Sneak along corridors, explore every room you come across, and backtrack to find more clues and access additional parts of the university’s campus.

									",English,,"Free to Play,Indie,Strategy,Early Access"," About This Game Spark is an exciting new Moba coming in 2019. We’re taking the lessons learned from playing Mobas over the past 15 years to put a new spin on the genre. With more focus on progression, a wider range of objectives and large variety in hero build options we’re creating a game that will let you shine in whatever way you want, even going as far as letting you fully change your playstyle mid match to adjust to the situation. We’re a grassroots team of developers. Many of us found our beginning in creating custom games and even our primary funding comes from a source with strong ties to the custom games community. This also means we’re able to act fully in what we think is in the best interest for our game and our community. Key Features Our map, Jaekka’s Court, is a living, breathing part of the experience. The court is loose and laneless, inhabited by strong bosses, remnants of the Mother and those that seek her blessing. Fight off those in your path and empower your allies on your way to claim the throne. Slay bosses to upgrade items and win duels against the enemy team as you close in on a dynamically adjusting score limit. The lore of Spark isn’t just an afterthought. It’s a fully integrated part of the game and the more you play the more mysteries and stories of the world you will find. Discover the secrets of the Court and the histories of your favorite characters and items. Your actions in the game change how what pieces of the lore are available to you, work together with the community to construct the full picture. Spark is built from the ground up as a fully integrated custom game platform. Tools we create to build our game will be available to the community to create their own game modes. We'll strive to provide lasting, long term support for custom game creators and the custom game community. Spark will be available on Windows as well as both Mac and Linux. Cross platform multiplayer will be supported as well. ",,,,,

Multiple corporate factions are fighting for control of a solar system in a war involving hundreds of players, potentially more than a thousand per-server ( without instancing ), that can last from hours to days. Coordinate with other players to destroy enemy infrastructure around strategic locations, referred to as Battlescape's , across a wide range of gorgeous environments including barren moons, gas giants, volcanic planets, asteroid rings, and more. Participate in space and planetary battles of massive proportions like those seen in movies such as Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Serenity. It's not unusual in Battlescape to hop from battle to battle, some of them involving hundreds of ships . Climb the competitive ladder, gain ranks, and complete side missions to support the war effort in your own way. Earn credits to upgrade and customize your ships , mount better weapons and equipment to give yourself an edge over your opponents. Team tactics and strategies Each faction owns a limited amount of infrastructure at each Battlescape, consisting of factories, land bases, large space stations, and small space stations. Large space stations can spawn all types of ship, making them critically important to defend, whereas small space stations and land bases are limited to smaller ships. Factories spawn AI-controlled haulers that transport resources to space stations. Those resources get converted into credits and redistributed on a regular basis to your team's players and AI commander. Players (or the AI) can then spend these credits on acquiring better ships and assembling a fleet to attack the enemy. Battles naturally emerge around the solar system at strategic locations. Every ship in Infinity: Battlescape has its own strengths and weaknesses, supporting a wide variety of play-styles that each feel unique. An interceptor is small and nimble, good for scouting and protecting capital ships from hard-hitting bombers. Corvettes can be configured defensively, to repair team-mates, or offensively as ""space tanks"". Carriers are mobile spawn points with limited weaponry whereas cruisers are both heavily armored and heavily armed - capable of quickly dealing punishing amounts of damage to enemy capital ships and infrastructure.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7, 64 bits,Processor:,Intel core i3/i5 @ 3.4 Ghz or above or AMD equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVidia GeForce 970 GTX or AMD equivalent ( 4 GB VRAM ),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,15 GB available space,Additional Notes:,30-60 fps in 1080p in Low/Medium","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10, 64 bits,Processor:,Intel core i7/i9 @ 3.8 Ghz or above or AMD equivalent,Memory:,16 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVidia GeForce 1070 GTX or AMD equivalent ( 8 GB VRAM ),DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,15 GB available space,Additional Notes:,60-120 fps in 1080p, 30-60 fps in WHD/UHD in High/Extreme",,

									",English,,"Action,Indie"," About This Game Zero Strain combines the strategy and tactics of MOBA combat with the speed and awareness of a shoot em' up. Gameplay Each ship in the game comes equipped with three unique weapons and a passive ability. These weapons offer the same creativity and depth of abilities found in the best MOBA games, but you will not find a single cooldown on any of them. Instead, all weapons in the game work on a charge system that builds off the damage you deal. Abilities charge fast, and playing well makes them charge even faster. But don't get too carried away. Zero Strain's shoot em' up DNA is in full effect. Enemies defend themselves and require a mix of strategies to take down. Bosses shrug off mindless spamming and demand careful observation and reaction. Bullets fill the screen and force well-timed dodges to avoid them or well-aimed shots to shoot them down. You'll need to balance offense and defense at all times. At first you'll struggle, but before long, you'll be slinging around enemies and unleashing perfectly timed weapon combos in a spectacular dance of destruction!

This storm is you, a mighty Necromancer, a sorcerer who denies death and leads the legions of the dead. Clerics and lords hope to hide behind high walls, but there’s no stronghold to cover them from your wrath. Smite hundreds of those standing in your way and turn them into your tools on a way to a greater purpose. The Unliving is a dynamic roleplay rogue-lite action with strategic elements. Raise the undead, use numerous spells and explore a mystical world, created in authentic pixel-art style. TURN ENEMIES INTO YOUR UNDEAD ARMY Each fallen foe can be resurrected and added to your army to create unlimited legions of the dead. Turned creatures have their own abilities. For example, a raised priest who was able to bless others, will curse your enemies. CRUSH EVERYONE IN YOUR WAY Only some of the living are helpless victims. The rest can retaliate against your forces. They hold the line, move in large groups and they have powerful abilities too. They will sell their lives dearly, so you’ll have to show all your undead lord’s talents to defeat them. CONQUER UNCHARTED LANDS The world is generated randomly for each walkthrough and it is created rich with creatures, artifacts, secret rooms and deadly traps. Each part of the world is populated with unique indigenous inhabitants - in villages you can find feeble peasants to easily reinforce your army, in swamps you can lose another one of your lives to pincers of giant clanchers. UNRAVEL THE MYSTERIES OF NECROMANCY Collect cryptic notes, force out of your enemies answers, study the writings on the ancient artifacts to gather the lost memories of the Necromancer piece by piece, reveal the true nature of his immortality, secrets of his phylactery companion and find out the grim truth about the supreme hierarchies of the Church. BATTLE THE EPIC BOSSES Face the strongest creatures of this world, challenge yourself to show off your skills. Each boss has a unique combat style and abilities and you’ll have to think through your actions to defeat them. DIE AND RISE AGAIN Ability to deny death itself is the greatest secret of the Necromancer. Another mortal strike is merely a setback for him.

Get creative with In Defense of Aliens and experience lush battlefields, unique worlds, and 4 character types each with their unique play style and progression systems. BACKGROUND Development of this game started more than 5 years ago as a way to teach my two sons and my daughter about programming. As a family, we were hooked on Dungeon Defenders and my son was obsessed with drawing alien creatures. We mashed them together with a father's desire to show his kids that they could not only play video games, but they could also learn to create them, and that was the original genesis of our game. Fast-forward to present day and my sons are at college (one studying Computer Science and the other Business with a CS minor) and this game has become a passion project for me and my daughter (still in high school). We've been fortunate to enlist the help of some great indie-friendly artists, animators, developers, sound engineers and an amazingly supportive community on our discord server. It's been an incredible family journey and we're excited to share our creation with the world! KEY FEATURES MULTIPLE CLASSES: 4 unique classes each with 3 abilities, 7 towers, and 4 weapons TACTICAL CONTROL: Keyboard+Mouse and FULL game controller support PLAY WITH YOUR PALS: Upto 4 of you and your most heroic buds can team up and play online or just you and your bestie can play on one machine in local coop split screen mode SHOW ‘EM WHO’S BEST!: Get creative with your kills and build up huge combos for points. Show off your skillz on the leaderboard to flaunt your success. PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: With numerous strategies to employ and weapon/ability/tower combinations to build, killing aliens never gets old. Designed for replayability as you strive to beat your best time with the ultimate meme build MULTIPLE WORLDS:  Coming soon ... 3 unique planets under siege plus the final episodes on Earth!

Explore the namegiving land of Nehrim with dense forests and deserts, delve into old crypts and caves, and experience an unusual, multi-layered storyline that takes place beyond known patterns of good and evil. How extensive is the world space and how has it been created? The land mass approximately equals the one of Oblivion. However, in Nehrim the landscape is entirely hand-built and thus has a lot more variety in it than those forests in Oblivion. How long will it take me to beat the game? As opposed to Oblivion, the Main Quest, including 35 single quests, is to the fore in Nehrim. Our Main Quest isn't just much more intense than Oblivion's, but also more extensive. You can beat Oblivion in about 10 hours. This most definitely will not be possible in Nehrim. Additionally, there will be about 30 side quests. What is the most profound difference to Oblivion? The skill system. In Nehrim, you level up by gaining experience points. You gain experience points by killing monsters and most of all for finishing quests. This is the best way to motivate the player to play them. At each level-up you get ""learning points"" you can trade for skill upgrades at a teacher - just as in the Gothic series.",,"Minimum:,OS:,Win 7, Win 8, Win 10,Processor:,Intel Core2Duo E7400 CPU,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 9800 GTX,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Storage:,8 GB available space","Recommended:,OS:,Win 7, Win 8, Win 10,Processor:,Quad-core Intel or AMD CPU,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 760,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Storage:,8 GB available space",,

The message confounded Orochi scientists. Their analysts broke it down and determined it was of intelligent origin. Orochi management immediately concluded that the discovery was too sensitive for public knowledge and moved to keep it hidden. In secret, the corporation began construction of Invictus, a state-of-the-art Mars research outpost designed to identify the true nature of the message. You are Shane Newehart, a technician stationed at the Invictus and your security clearance means you are completely unaware of the existence of the mysterious signal. Your job is simply to keep the lights on until the transport ship Cyrano arrives bringing with it a new team to take over your duties. Soon you discover strange and unusual setbacks. Crucial systems are malfunctioning, the greenhouse is filled with a strange mist and the rest of your team has yet to return from their EVA mission. Things are starting to fall apart. You begin seeing and hearing things that aren’t there. Visions, hallucinations – or is that even what it is? Is this real… or are you slowly descending into madness?

									","English,German,Polish",,"Casual,Simulation,Strategy"," About This Game WoodZone is a unique opportunity to become an entrepreneurial lumberjack. Imagine that you have a company that grows in front of your eyes or you go up the ladder in another corporation to eventually become the boss in it. The player has a lot of ""sandbox rakes and blades"" that open up new possibilities. Lighting in the sawmill can be built on the principle of ""put and work"", but a more demanding player can develop them using logic gates and cables. For example, it can be lit when entering the building, the place for wood is full or there are no raw materials. The game provides, among others, conveyors, computers, cameras, sensors, logic gates, cabling, vehicles, robots, construction parts and much, much more! This allows you to create excellent mechanisms that automate work: wood sorter, a machine that checks the quality of wood, production efficiency meter, automatic feeder and so on. Each player gets a designated piece of land that can be freely used. Multiplayer allows you to interact with players from other parts of the world who have access to raw materials found on specific biomes. It may turn out that the start-up location does not provide the goods required for the production of desirable constructions and inventions. Demand for limited materials dynamically shapes the game market and requires players to cooperate. This cooperation can be, among other things, by setting up your own or a joint company, employing players as employees, establishing partnership agreements with other corporations, as well as acting as a freelancer. The player can be employed as a lumberjack, driver, carpenter, builder, manager and many other professions. Each field is associated with other duties and permissions. The development of the economy changes dynamically depending on the behavior of the players. The price of wood is influenced by factors such as the type, size, and quality of wood, the level of processing or even production technology. An important factor in the demand for wood is also the season of the year. The player is able to set up his own company, which he can run alone or with friends. It opens up new challenges with which it must face. The task of the corporation's owner is to expand the fleet and infrastructure, increase revenues, employ more employees, create strategies, ensure the work of others and generally work in favor of the company's development. Wood has a long way to go before it is sold. The player can extract many different species of trees and decide on their further processing. Each type of wood has its own properties affecting the way of transport and processing. An important aspect is to take care of wood supplies, protect them from moisture and other damage. The player is forced to adhere to the basic rules regarding felling, whether or not to adhere to the rules regarding allowed sound pressure. The protagonist should also have permission for various activities and current vehicle insurance. Before going on a further journey, the player should adapt his equipment to the factors occurring in the target area, such as terrain, temperature, and local conditions. Vehicles differ in dimensions, load capacity, and capacity of the fuel tank. They may be damaged by inappropriate use or random failure. The protagonist can move on land, water, and air. Depending on preferences on purchased plots, the player can build his own objects for various purposes. The price of the plot depends on the area and location. Designing your own factory, sawmill, residential home, or any building is possible thanks to the modular construction system. The procedurally generated world allows you to explore different climate zones like a desert, tundra, rainforests, and others. The urban and industrial structures will be filled with activities developing trade and production of goods. In order to increase revenues, the player can visit hard to reach places that hide exceptionally unique tree species. Among other things, the player can find a collapsed cave which he will have to dig out.",,,,,

The ultimate goal of the Brotherhood will gradually unfold as the story develops. You realize that it’s not just about wealth and power. The Brotherhood seeks to reconstruct the whole world.  On this path you’ll confront a hostile secret organization. Their methods are similar to yours but the goals are very different, and you’ll have to find out what they’re after. You need to act slowly and cautiously so that the awareness of your influence doesn’t increase too much otherwise you’ll be exposed and at risk of losing your hard-earned level of infiltration in the country.  You will have more than 50 diplomatic, economic and military operations at your disposal. Keep monitoring the domestic politics of each country! If the ideology of the party in power is very different from the views of various social classes, if the taxes are too high and the level of public order is too low – expect a revolution. Although, maybe that’s exactly what you were trying to achieve?  Every country leader weighs up the risks and benefits of increasing taxes, starting wars, threats of revolution and so on. They strive to maintain the status quo and follow the rules of their epoch. All they care about is strengthening their power, preserving their territories, and the opportunity to advance both. You’ll need to find a way to destabilize the system and trigger the crisis, which will bring the desired changes.  However, you won’t be able to impose your will on the leaders – your influence in the game is indirect. You can’t just tell a monarch to declare war on the neighboring country, but what you can do is plant your agents in the countries you need, provoke the deterioration of relations and make one of the parties believe in a fast-approaching profitable victory.  We hope that you spend many enjoyable hours absorbed in exploring the mechanisms of the world with Secret Government. Support this campaign and join the Brotherhood!",,,,,

An empire is torn by civil war. Beyond its borders, new kingdoms rise. Gird on your sword, don your armour, summon your followers and ride forth to win glory on the battlefields of Calradia. Establish your hegemony and create a new world out of the ashes of the old. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is the eagerly awaited sequel to the acclaimed medieval combat simulator and role-playing game Mount & Blade: Warband. Set 200 years before, it expands both the detailed fighting system and the world of Calradia. Bombard mountain fastnesses with siege engines, establish secret criminal empires in the back alleys of cities, or charge into the thick of chaotic battles in your quest for power. SIEGE GAMEPLAY Construct, position and fire a range of heavy machinery in sieges that will test your wits and skill like never before. Experience epic, sprawling combat across ramparts and rubble as you desperately hold on to your castle or seek to seize one from the enemy. Historically authentic defensive structures offer the ultimate medieval warfare experience, as you batter a rival's gate with your ram or burn his siege tower to ashes. Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord lets you live every moment of a chaotic battle through the eyes of a single soldier. DIPLOMACY Engage in diplomacy, with meaningful consequences that impact the world. Strike historic peace deals that win land for your kingdom or free you to take on a new foe. An all-new barter system gives players flexibility in cementing deals, from marriage offers to treason pacts, offering all the options available to NPCs. Use a new influence system to direct your faction's energies or strangle the aspirations of a rival. SANDBOX ECONOMY See the availability of goods ebb and flow in a simulated feudal economy, where the price of everything from incense to warhorses fluctuates with supply and demand. Invest in farms and workshops, or turn anarchy to your advantage by being the first to bring grain to a starving town after a siege or reopening a bandit-plagued caravan route. CRAFTING Craft your own weapon, name it and carry it with you to the field of battle! A deep, physics-based system gives each weapon you create a unique set of attributes, strengths and weaknesses. Forge a finely-tuned killing machine to match your own prowess and complement your play-style, or take the sword of your enemy and brandish it as a trophy of war. MODDING The engine and tools used to develop Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord are being made available to the community, so that modders can re-interpret Calradia or create their own worlds! Players can now combine different mods, making it easier than ever to play the game of your dreams. ENGINE An all-new tailor-made game engine, developed in-house to fulfill the unique needs of the series, offers the perfect balance of performance and graphical fidelity, scalable with the power of your hardware.

									",English,16,"Casual,Indie"," About This Game  Grand Kokoro - Episode 1 Is a BxB tragic, drama, romance story told in the form of a Kinetic Visual Novel.  This story is about heartbreak, tragedy, acceptance, perseverance and mental health. Our main character Elijah has to learn to deal with severe clinical depression and suicidal thoughts all while trying to have a normal life. He wants to find someone who understands him, someone that loves him and that sees him as normal and not the unstable mess he’s convinced he is. Please have a look around, read our synopsis, watch our trailer and maybe even play our demo (which acts as our prologue) to get a better idea of what Grand Kokoro – Episode 1 is all about. The once bright and beautiful city of Crown Crest is still trying to recover from a tragedy that happened almost five years ago. This is when their most beloved symbol of unification, “The Colonnade,” collapsed. Once it fell it fractured the city of Crown Crest, devastating hundreds of thousands of lives and creating a new social class of people – The SURs, or Survivors of Colonnade. That’s what Elijah Grand is – a SUR. Your life is over once you’re labelled a SUR. You’re seen as untouchable, suicidal, diseased and infectious. You become the carrier of “SUR fever,” a disease that rots the mind and causes hallucinations and suicidal thoughts. At least that’s what the people of Crown Crest believe. Elijah has spent the last five years running from his past and concealing his true nature. At first, running away was easy, but as the days wore on, his memories of the day The Colonnade collapsed began to creep back into his life. Whenever he felt stressed, excited or scared, his memories came rushing back and there was nothing he could do. These “recalls” as his doctor calls them, are becoming more frequent, and they’re starting to disrupt his daily life. They’re making him question his sanity. Are these just recalls? Is it SUR Fever? Is SUR Fever real? Will anyone find out? Can I just be normal? These are the thoughts and questions that run through Elijah’s head as he tries to live a normal life, while navigating through a world he’s been absent from for over five years. Can he survive? With the help of his two best friends, Lucien and Sebastian, he most certainly can; however they too carry a troublesome secret, one that sees them put on a list of would-be victims. Sebastian has been able to keep Lucien and himself safe thanks to his family’s power and influence, but there’s only so much that money and political ties can hide until the truth finally reveals itself. Join Elijah, Lucien and Sebastian in “Grand Kokoro – Episode 1” as they unearth the secrets surrounding the collapse of The Colonnade building, the powerful families known as “The Legacy’s,” and a political movement known as “The Pure,” which can change everything. “Being a SUR isn’t what you think it is.” Gameplay: Roughly 4-5 hours. Original Soundtrack: 20+ songs. Kinetic Visual Novel w/limited choices - Choices do not affect the story. Unique game flow: Go from kinetic to standard visual novel and back to kinetic.

Create clans and fight for territory. Resources deplete fast, so take your sword and scavenge, pirate, and trade to stay alive.",,,"Sep 3, 2019",Donkey Crew,"Donkey Crew,Donkey Crew","Early Access,Massively Multiplayer,Indie,Early Access,Action,RPG,Violent,Open World,Survival,Economy","Multi-player,Online Multi-Player,MMO",English,,"Action,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG,Early Access"," About This Game  Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO . Earth has stopped rotating, and the last human survivors need to outrun the scorching Sun in a massive Open World . Walkers Traverse the world on wooden wind-powered, walking machines. Walkers can be adapted for travel, transportation, harvesting, combat, or used as mobile bases. A multitude of structures, attachments and upgrades allow players to personalize Walkers to their needs. The Scorching Sun The Sun burns the land in the west, turning it to dust. In order to stay ahead of the obliterating Sun, nomads must explore new territories that slowly emerge on the eastern horizon, from the side of the Earth that has long been frozen in impenetrable ice. The Lore After a cataclysmic event halted the Earth’s rotation, the planet was split into two extreme and deadly environments. Only a narrow band of space between the hot and cold halves of the planet has conditions that can support life. This band moves at the pace of the planet’s rotation around the Sun, and all life on Earth must migrate with it to survive. In order to keep moving, the remnants of humanity have built nomadic machines, and a walking city called Flotilla. Every day, Flotilla transports more nomads into the passing oases, where warring clans fight tooth and nail for control of territory and valuable resources. Some nomads have carved out lucrative positions for themselves and even gained status with Flotilla; however most nomads are locked in a daily struggle for survival, forced to battle both nature and those around them. There will never be rest for the men who built the walkers; they can only move forward. Survive and Thrive Find ways to survive. Gather resources. Craft equipment. Build your Walker. Improve your skills. Learn to exploit what remains of the world. Keep your Nomad alive for as long as you can, as you become stronger the longer you escape death. Trade in a Player Driven Economy Trade networks stretch between the known oases. The global player-driven economy is based on real supply and demand. Smart and quick traders can make huge profits, but running trade routes always comes with a risk. Other nomads may opt to produce or hunt down rare and highly localized resources. It’s always wise to consider potential competitors first though. Challenge another clan’s monopoly, and you may become their next target. Travel and Explore an MMO-sized World The world consists of many interconnected oases, forming a large open world. Potentially a thousand oases exist simultaneously - the number automatically adjusts to accommodate the size of the playerbase. Each Oasis is over 100 km2. Explore them to reveal new and unique biomes while plundering their limited resources. Some nomads may pitstop to refill their water. Others will settle for some time, but ultimately everyone will pick up and voyage east to escape the encroaching Sun. No-Man's-Land No-Man’s Land is the open desert that sits between the last livable oases on Earth. Use it to quickly travel between adjacent oases, provided you bring enough water on your Walker. You can safely log off here – the endless dunes allow you to hide your walker and mobile base if you want to go to sleep or just catch a breath. Melee and Walker Combat Dynamic skill-based directional melee combat. Pick your weapon from a range of one-handed or two-handed swords, maces, axes or quarterstaves. If you prefer to hammer your opponents from a distance, you can choose to fight with a wide range of onboard weapons like ballistas, scattershot guns, repeaters, or catapults. Specialize in one or become a more versatile fighter by trying to master them all. Building Bases Construct portable bases or more permanent fortifications. Protect yourself from hostile players and natural dangers of the world. Stone walls offer superior defense, while lighter wooden structures are able to be packed on large Walkers and relocated. Solo Experience Individuals and small groups of players are the backbone of Last Oasis. Trading, hunting and harvesting allows anyone to acquire better equipment or sell goods for profit. For those who prefer a more high-risk, high-reward lifestyle, piracy is always an option, but beware of payback. Clans and Warfare Become a political and economic power. Control a region and get rewarded with a supply of local resources gathered there by roaming Nomads. Grow your clan and make alliances to maximize and protect your income. Always be ready for conflict – hostile clans will challenge your control and come to take away everything you’ve built. Grappling Hook Master the vertical movement. Every Nomad owns a grappling hook – the most essential and iconic tool of those who drive walkers. Adapt it to your playstyle. It’s all about your skill: some struggle to climb the smallest rocks, while others swing through forests outspeeding even the fastest Walkers. Can you defy gravity?"," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  Blood effects, human death, violence  ","Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 (64bit versions only),Processor:,Intel Core i5 2400 @ 3.1 GHz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 770, AMD Radeon HD 7870,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,60 GB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system",,

Emissaries of Evil incorporates evil outsiders of every kind, from malevolent masterminds like night hagsto black-hearted hunters like yeth hounds. Some evil outsiders are subtle and stealthy stalkes, like the fearsome hellcator the mirror-master soulsliver. There are fiend-tainted footsoldiers like the urdefhan, and hideous misshapen monstrosities like the vargouilles, hideous flying heads seeking only to plant their tainted kiss and sprout more of their monstrous kin. Many of these independent evil outsiders prowl the Lower Planes acknowledging no master but themselves and wielding power through puppets by clever manipulation, like the serpent-shrouded dorvae, while others serve otherworldly overlords of other planes, as the awful ankouserve the mightiest rulers of the Fey Realms as punishers and assassins. Many evil creatures call upon the powers of darkness, like the shadow mastiff, but others indulge in the corrupted power of light to cloak their horrid hearts in the glow of heaven's light, like the shining child. There are evil outsiders that seem to mortals no more than twisted and strange animalistic beasts, like the stilt-legged achaierai, though their flightless ferocity belies their cruel cleverness. The ultimate emissary of evil, however, is the distilled immortal ichorof a dead god of deepest vileness, which may eternal lie until with strange eons even the death of a god may die. As if these were not enough, guest contributor Sean K Reynolds adds the brand-new maldonado, a body-jumping fiend of possession created from the warped and twisted soul of a fallen angel, now living a vampiric half-life riding the bodies of mortals until their souls are consumed. A dozen and one vile creatures of every description lie within, from CR 3 to 21, and if all these statistics were not sufficient to sate your appetite for evil, we bring you a chilling tale of corruption, captivity, and maternal malevolence to set the proper mood for using these Emissaries of Evil .

									",English,,"Action,Adventure,Indie"," About This Game  You are Sprocket , an adorable ferret who knocks things over and steals junk on a space station in the far future! Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff! Widget Satchel is a daunting adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles and tricky platforming, but don't worry: You may lose some Widgets (or your socks!) along the way, but Sprocket can’t get hurt and there is no “game over.” Of course, it will take all of your ferret-y determination if you hope to stash away every Widget, discover every Trinket, and try on every pair of Socks! Widgets: you want them! But beware, every widget you put in your satchel makes it heavier, making it a little bit harder to jump to the next platform or scramble past the station's maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if you don't collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill Sprocket’s satchel. You'll reach special Fabricator rooms in each level, where you can exchange your Widgets for power-ups called Doohickeys. Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself with The Wrench and show them what's what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef's Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure, and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its secrets) however you like. High scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you'll earn! What are mischief points? It's not important, but there are an awful lot of them! Original soundtrack (by Sara Ferret) that dynamically reacts to your progress. Replayable areas with ""metroidvania-lite"" pathing. Sock-exclusive inventory system. Trapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate. Human characters to mildly inconvenience! Piles and piles of junk! ...and more!

The switch to 3D also allows an increase in the level of detail (e.g. the specific types of ammunition used by each weapon are now modelled) with more realistic movement and projectile physics.

You will command your squads in a variety of close combat situations and will have to learn how best to combine the use of small arms, mortars, machine guns, armoured cars, tanks and anti-tank guns in order to achieve victory. You must learn the art of attack and defence in battles such as Hill 350 and Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, Gela and Troina in Sicily, and Caumont and Marigny in Normandy. As you fight your way into and then across Europe from November 1942 to August 1944 you must overcome a wide range of diverse tactical challenges, such as commanding inexperienced troops being attacked by veteran panzers in North Africa, having to capture the bitterly defended town of Troina in the Sicilian mountains and of course storming across the sands of Omaha and into the 'hedgerow hell' of Normandy The Settings Tunisia – 5 Operations with 14 battles covering Longstop Hill, Sbiba, Kasserine Pass, El Guettar, Mateur Sicily – 3 Operations with 11 battles covering Gela, Nicosia and Troina Normandy – 3 Operations with 11 battles covering Omaha Beach, The Bocage and Operation Cobra Features 1 Grand Campaign, 3 Theatre Campaigns (Tunisia, Sicily and Normandy), 11 Operations and 36 battles Completely revised 3D that brings a whole new look and feel to the classic Close Combat gameplay.

The ancient Han Dynasty was coming to an end, and the empire was in chaos. Bandits and rebels were overrunning the countryside, the Emperor was just a child, and control of the court had been seized by a vicious tyrant. Yet the time of chaos was also a time of opportunity, when men of courage and ambition could rise to power from outside the traditional aristocracy. A common soldier could become a warlord, a sandal maker could become an emperor, and a fugitive would come to be revered as a god. In this expansion you take the role of a warlord attempting to re-unite the land, and create a new dynasty. Three Kingdoms features Choose from any of 26 factions on a new campaign map that stretches from Vietnam to the northern borders of China. Play as one of the founders of the Three Kingdoms; the tyrant Dong Zhuo; one of many major or minor warlords, or exploit the chaos as a barbarian or bandit.

									",English,,Simulation," About This Game CLS: Signal Person is the premier training simulator for both aspiring signal persons and seasoned vets alike. Whether you’re learning the standard signals for the first time or going for a quick refresher, CLS: Signal Person will give you the practice needed to make the signals second-nature. Train in immersive, virtual environments filled with cranes you’ll see in the real world. Dive into hazardous situations without exposing yourself to any actual harm. Gain practical experience that you won’t get from any other course, and become a badass signaler with a skill set that’s in high demand. Become One With The Signals In CLS: Signal Person, you won’t be learning signals from a book or pamphlet. Instead, you’ll be working with your virtual mentor Sam, who will demo every signal for you and then provide immediate feedback and correction as you do the signals yourself. Through our lessons and drills, you get repetitive practice, and before you know it, giving the correct signal becomes automatic. Team Up With Your Operator When you give a signal, the crane operator responds. Throughout CLS: Signal Person’s different lessons, you and your operator will carry out all the steps of a pick, giving you a first-row seat to see how each signal impacts the end result. You’ll use every signal in the book and get to know what they all tell the operator do. Push Cranes To The Limit The cranes you’ll be working with behave just like cranes you’ll encounter on any job site. Work with capacity charts to keep cranes from performing lifts past a safe radius. Experience dynamic loading and unloading, side loading, drift, deflection, two-blocking, and more. Witness crane failures first-hand without racking up huge bills for your employer or adding to the death toll on your crew. On top of that, CLS: Signal Person’s hazardous scenarios force you to overcome all kinds of hazards, including working near powerlines, in congested spaces, and hoisting personnel. You’ll come away ready for anything the job site throws your way. Put Safety Regs Into Practice They say the best way to learn something is by doing it. You can learn a lot from a slideshow or a booklet, but CLS: Signal Person offers you even more. Getting hands-on experience in realistic virtual environments prepares you for the challenges you’ll face in the real world. Once you hit the job site, you won’t be wondering what you need to do because you’ll already have done it.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or greater,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater,DirectX:,Version 10,Storage:,5 GB available space,Additional Notes:,Oculus Rift","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i5-4590 / AMD Ryzen 5 1500X or greater,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater,DirectX:,Version 10,Storage:,5 GB available space,Additional Notes:,Oculus Rift",,

Imagine being 30 days away from promotion and breaking out of this God-forsaken hole. However, the closer you get to your dream end of service, the more you get the impression that the whole world is against you. The prison administration imposes every day incriminating duties that you have to fulfill before the end of each day, because otherwise you can fly out of here faster than you would like. But on the other side of the barricade we have prisoners with different sins on their conscience, which your devotion to work can be very unattractive. If you go too much to the imprint, it can end tragically for you!  How to live?!  Balance between tasks for the prison management, and small requests from convicts to maintain the relationship between the two sides on the most neutral level! Declaring only on one side will not pay you in any way!  The duties of the key  As a key you will have many tasks such as accepting new prisoners, searching a prison cell and prisoners in order to find contraband, confiscating convict objects, reviewing monitoring, maintaining order and security, pacifying problematic prison residents, executions, and much more.  Freedom of the simulator  Despite the tasks and limited time, Prison Simulator offers you complete freedom! You can do whatever you like, remembering that your loose actions and behaviors may also affect relations with prison employees as well as with convicts themselves ... especially when you pacify them very often and for no good reason.  Campaign or free play  You can both play in the campaign mode with divided time and responsibilities, as well as play in free play mode, where you are not limited by any time or task! Do whatever you like, search prison cells and confiscate illegal items in an unconventional way, interact with the whole environment, visit the farthest corners of the prison or just kick some butts and not necessarily the prisoners' butts."," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This Game may contain content not appropriate for all ages, or may not be appropriate for viewing at work: Frequent Violence or Gore, General Mature Content  ","Minimum:,OS:,32/64-bit Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4590/AMD FX 8350,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, AMD Radeon R9 290,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,10 GB available space,Additional Notes:,VR support is required (HMD + 2 hand controllers)","Recommended:,OS:,32/64-bit Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10,Processor:,Intel Core i5-4590/AMD FX 8350,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, AMD Radeon RX 480,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,10 GB available space,Additional Notes:,VR support is required (HMD + 2 hand controllers)",,

Navigate a randomly generated map, make tough choices based on text events, and take part in fiendishly difficult turn-based battles. A diverse team – a choice of 8 characters from a gunslinger monk to a breeder of terrifying desert beasts. You decide where to go — for example, do you want to dash to a shelter to regain your health, or risk everything to loot an abandoned station? Tactical battles — where you know your opponents' plans in advance. Use your team well and you can make your enemies' plans backfire. Text events — make difficult choices. Watch your characters evolve and see how their abilities lead to new developments in familiar situations. Characterization — all the team members are unique and have their own views. A decision which pleases one character might enrage another one. Team upgrades — learn new skills, arm yourself with artifacts from the Era of Miracles, and even get a robot assistant. Replayability — each run features new locations, events and opponents. One chance — every decision is final and the death of the team means game over.

His head is made of the concept of a chair. His ability is good at handling the Chair. Fadia Birthplace : Dubai She is a robot with free will after singularity.  fights for self-sacrifice for salvation. Her feature is two different battle modes. You can change these modes in battle. Kokuzo Birthplace : Japan She is a ninja aiming for the villain who killed his father. Her HP is small, but she has fast legs, high offensive sword and ""shuriken""(throwing star). With her EX ARTS, she can go behind the nearest enemy from the chair. So sometimes she can reverse the situation. Iwan Birthplace : Russia He is a clumsy, honest and powerful farmer. His hobby is wrestling. He has high endurance and long invincible time. His legs are so late that it is difficult for him to win once he leaves the chair. Meaw Birthplace : Thailand Ze is a lovely ladyboy. Ze zirself is non-violent, but a violent spirit ""Phi"" protects zir. You will operate two characters(Meaw and Phi) at the same time. Even if Meaw sits in the chair Phi can attack, so this character is very strong. I Pak-ssu Birthplace : Korea He is a Ponchak Star. He loves to dance and sing. Because he has skills that can cancel all actions, he can respond instantly to various situations. During EX ARTS invocation you will be able to attack the enemies that are falling, so you can hit great damage by hitting STRIKE. Dan Birthplace : Scotland He is a genius football juvenile. He was born as a nobleman, but he dislikes that his father is severe. Because his attack range is long, with this character you can control the game without getting close to the chair. However, it takes time to recover when under attack, sometimes he'll drop out without counterattack. Dafu Birthplace : Hong Kong He is a chubby trickster who are easily deceived. Master of Kung Fu. There are few circumstances that are difficult for him, and he is easy to use. You can decide the game at once with high risk - high return skill.

It is difficult to play as him because he will be knocks out as soon as you make a mistake. La Suicida Birthplace : Mexico She is a daredevil Lucha Dola. She will accept anyone's challenge. Tackle movement distance is characteristic of her. Because she is easy to use, if you are troubled with the character you use, I'd recommend using this character for the time being. Shanti Birthplace : Himalayan Range She is a yoga master. She meditates anyway. Because meditation (EX ARTS) improves ability, meditation is a way to win. She also has a full recovery skill, so you may take aggressive actions. Steven Birthplace : United States of America He is a spokesman for justice. He is a mayor who resolves anything by power. His feet are slow, but he has skills to move, so he will move around. Because his ability to take chairs is low, you basically have to defeat your opponent when using him.

We will keep the new game true to the classic experience, keeping all the things you loved while giving today's gamers the modern look and feel expected from a AAA title. Help fund this game! With the help of members of the original team, including the original Voice Actor of SHODAN, Terri Brosius, Citadel Station has never been more immersive or terrifying! “When you’re working on a game, you tend not to think about how people will feel about it 20 years later – or if people will even remember it! The announcement of the System Shock update from Nightdive (and the upcoming System Shock 3 I’m working on) it’s apparent that not only do people remember, they care very deeply about the game. Back when we were working on the original, we wanted to make a simulation-based game that would empower players to tell their own stories through their playstyle choices – an idea that’s still totally relevant today. I’ve long said that if you updated the graphics, sound and UI on System Shock you’d have something that competes directly with any game on the market today. Now the Nightdive folks are doing that update and I’m confident my prediction will be validated. SHODAN demands that you support this so we can all find out.” --Warren Spector, OtherSide Entertainment. Producer on the original System Shock. You're a renowned hacker, the most notorious cyberspace thief in the corporate world. Caught during a risky break-in, you become indentured to a greedy TriOptimum executive. After six months in a healing coma, you awaken to the twisted aftermath of a terrible disaster. Where are the surgeons? Why is the station in such disrepair? Slowly, the chilling realization that something is very wrong creeps over you. Once a prime corporate research facility, Citadel Station now teems with mindless cyborgs, robots and terribly mutated beings, all programmed to serve SHODAN, a ruthless A.I. There's scarcely time to think before it unleashes the first terror...  “The crew at Nightdive heroically brought the original versions of System Shock and System Shock 2 back into circulation. They have thrived as a new audience has rediscovered these classics.  Now Nightdive is remastering the original System Shock to bring it up to date on modern PC’s - with fully updated visuals, audio and a modern interface – making it dramatically more accessible to modern gamers.  It’s quite wonderful to see a franchise that Warren and I helped create get such loving care."" --Paul Neurath, Founder of OtherSide Entertainment. Co-founder of Looking Glass Studios.

Alternatively the game features a sandbox mode where players can explore the game alone or with selected friends in their own universe. Set in a universe of vast scale and detail, the fully-destructible environment and hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics enable simulations in the game at immense depth; minor collisions may break a few outer plates from your spaceship, while fast-speed crashes can rip the ship apart. Thruster propellant pipe leaks may cause spaceships to stall, but the corrosive, leaking propellant might also melt the superstructure of the ship and cause a catastrophic failure. Damaged ship controls in a spaceship do not necessarily mean the journey is over, as manual values for the flight can be applied directly to the generator and thrusters from the engine room. The scale and depth of the simulation in all aspects of the game gives players the ultimate freedom to exploit their innovativeness and creativity – the building blocks of success in Starbase. From constructing single spaceships with durable outer plating to creating massive automated factories and designing electricity and data networks, the players are free to do it their own way Destructible environment with voxel and fracture damage and in-depth simulation The environment in Starbase is fully destructible, meaning everything can be destroyed or disassembled with the right kind of tools and weaponry. The in-depth physics simulation enabled by hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics make fights, exploration and flying spaceships more creative and fun and the simulation of structural and elemental durability in the game adds its own twist and challenge to the efforts to conquer space; poorly designed superstructures combined with overpowered steering thrusters can snap the spaceships in half if cutting corners too much in a space race. Play and interact online with thousands of players, join factions, and more Start shaping the Starbase universe with fellow robots by joining and working for factions. Build,fight, chat and group up with other players to discover and settle the vast galaxy that is waiting for its first conquerors to make their mark. Mine asteroids by yourself, trade and haul cargo with your friends, or build a capital station with a huge company. Take part in the battle between the Empire and the Kingdom, or leisurely explore the galaxy while the insurance system has you covered should you accidentally wander into uncharted space. Success in Starbase is not measured in hours played or an endless grind, but in the ingenuity of each player and their ability to work together. Build and design your spaceship, stations and devices down to the tiniest detail The smallest building unit in Starbase is a single bolt, allowing you to build, repair and modify spaceships, stations, and devices as you wish. Even the smallest ships have thousands of parts, each with their own detailed damage model, making building and designing a truly creative process. Learning to use the in-game programming chips will take building and designing to a new level; innovation, automation of ships and creating clever ship layouts will make all the difference! Explore the infinite universe and gather resources Explore the vast universe to discover stations, social hubs and new raw materials. Arrange an exploration mission with friends and find out what the universe has to offer. Travel to an asteroid field to mine raw minerals and salvage different materials from broken ships, trade materials at trading stations or steal from others if that floats your (space)boat. About Starbase Starbase is developed with Frozenbyte’s internal game engine that is custom-built for conquering space, enabling the use of extremely challenging combination of voxel and vertex technologies in the game. The modern engine has been built specifically with Starbase in mind and the engine’s architecture is designed to handle all the quirks of simulation, damage, building, player amounts and the ever-growing universe to match the challenges the ambitious vision of the game can pose. Similarly, all features of the game have been developed with the infinite scale and the creative freedom of the players in mind. Starbase has been in secret development for five years without restraints and the development will continue until the game’s bold vision is achieved. In the ever-expanding space the scale can range from the unit of one bolt to massive space station structures, with exploration missions varying from journeys to nearby asteroid fields, to salvaging ship debris, and eventually to other galaxies. In Starbase players are given the freedom to build the kind of universe they want to, and a small group of players can eventually form large factions that challenge the powers that be. Being inventive will also help, as cleverness often triumphs over brute force in Starbase, and the only limitation is the creativity of the players. Early Access Starbase Early Access will introduce the players, the pioneers, to a new galaxy that they can begin to explore from a bunch of huge stations, the Mega Stations, located at the orbit of a single planet. As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet’s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems. The still unoccupied universe of Starbase offers players the chance to take part in the building of the galaxy and in discovering what will be the first steps in the twilight of space travel. Early Access allows the players to explore, buy and modify spaceships, form social connections and to earn money by gathering and selling resources. The players can start building their home stations at the Mega Station and begin the exploration and creation of the Starbase universe together with the developers. https://store.steampowered.com/app/454120/Starbase/ ",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Graphics:,NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Additional Notes:,We will revise the requirements closer to Early Access launch","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,(64-bit) Windows 10 / 7,Processor:,AMD Ryzen 7 / Intel i7-6700k,Memory:,16 GB RAM,Graphics:,Radeon RX Vega 8 GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11 GB,DirectX:,Version 11,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,15 GB available space,Additional Notes:,The game requires an Internet connection to play.

									",English,,"Indie,Racing,Simulation,Sports,Strategy"," About This Game Welcome to Real-Time Strategy Racing! (RTS-R) And what is RTS-Racing you ask? Designed with Esports at its core. This is future vehicle technologies capable of 1,000+km/h built upon simulated physics with track capture, resource collection, mid-race vehicle upgrades and track abilities. All played out on extreme full 360 degree track designs and an online racing tournament complete with prizes. DESIGN BACKGROUND Did you ever hear that an F1 car could theoretically drive upside down? https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/understanding-f1-racing/Aerodynamics.html Well, we tested it, and proved it. But it wasn't fun to drive, so we took it a few steps further and developed a fully adaptable vehicle setup ecu that could adjust; Aerodynamics, camber, toe, spring compression, tyre pressure, etc based on the vehicles velocity and orientation. Trust us, that little bit extra downforce when you're upside down comes in handy ;) Welcome also to 'Future Physics Racing'! TECHNOLOGY: We built our own proprietary engine ‘RevGen’ so that we could make this possible by giving you the high frame and physics rates needed for a silky smooth physics handling experience at these insanely high speeds. GAME MODDING: We also have plans to open 22RS up to game modding and community built assets. So if you have some ideas for future physics racing vehicles, you can make them, if you have some ideas for some fully 3d track designs that you'd like to try out, you can build them, or if you want to take our suite of physically based vehicles (did we mention we support bikes and maglev?) and unique strategy elements and make something unique of your own, then we want to help you make that happen. RELEASE: We’re currently preparing for closed beta, and aim to launch into early access around Q1-Q2 2020. Stay tuned for more info ...

It is about teamplay and cooperation between armies. Those who are familiar with our games know that they are rather difficult to attribute to any particular genre. It’s always a mix of strategy, tactics and action in the World War II entourage. This game is for those who feel the lack of action in RTS, and lack of immersion in tactical shooters. A unique series with more than ten years of history now receives a worthy multiplayer extension. Features: Direct control. ""Direct Control"" gives you the opportunity to play almost any unit in your army with the third (or first) person view. At any moment during the game, you can switch to DC and control the unit with WASD, more accurately choosing the trajectory of the shell (grenade) and choose which part of the enemy tank you want to hit. And most importantly - it's easier to feel yourself in the epicenter of the battle. Huge roster of units. In total, about 200 units for the three game factions which have been created as per the real characteristics of World War II units. Realism. Creating commanders and setting up units, we focused on their tasks in real combat, their strengths and weaknesses. Tanks need the infantry support, infantrymen need artillery fire to suppress the location before advancing, and artillery strongly needs help securing their positions. Diversity of gameplay. A large set of tactical capabilities for units. Exploration and sabotage. Capture, repair and hijacking vehicles. Creating protective structures, digging trenches. Setting hedgehogs, minefields. Destruction and neutralization of all of the above. Saving the wounded and destroying the guns. And much more. Total destructibility. During the battle, almost any object of the game space can be destroyed or burned. In addition, all objects, including shell-holes from explosions can be used as cover. Modular realistic damage system. Any vehicle, regardless of its type, consists of a set of components that can be broken or destroyed. When calculating the piercing chance and the damage to each component; the type of ammunition, the characteristics of the gun, the range of fire, the angle and thickness of armor plate and the threshold of its fatigue are taken into account. In addition, the chance of ammunition detonation, engine ignition, damage to wheels or tracks (which leads to immobilization of the unit) are calculated. Coop game. In addition to battles against other players, you can always compete with AI in cooperative gamemodes. Advanced AI. A good AI can create interesting game situations. In Soldiers: Arena, he can spawn paratroopers to the rear, smash artillery and infantry with tanks, use smoke screens, steal vehicles, and prepares many other surprises for the player.

Carrying out their orders are THE HORSEMEN, Nephilim (powerful beings spawned from the unnatural union of angels and demons) who have pledged themselves to the Council and been granted immense power.  However, this power came at a tragic cost: the Horsemen were ordered to use their newfound strength to wipe out the rest of their kind.  What followed was a bloody battle on Eden where the Horsemen, obeying the will of the Council, annihilated the Nephilim. Still reeling from the events on Eden, WAR and STRIFE have been given a new assignment -- LUCIFER, the enigmatic and deceptive demon king, has been plotting to upset the Balance by granting power to master demons throughout Hell.  War and Strife must hunt down these masters, gather information, and ultimately fight their way through a tangled, demonic conspiracy that threatens to forever upset the Balance and unravel all of creation.

Unfortunately, nothing is certain in this world... Left to a fate which could mean certain death, you will face challenges dictated by the cosmos. There are no helping hands in this universe, so you will quickly need to master the controls in the zero-G environment . Thanks to an advanced EVA Suit , you can explore your surroundings.

Thanks to years of warfare and greed, the human colonies in deep space are no more. The great factions have crumbled; the corrupt corporations have dissolved. Most people adhere to the last remaining code of humanity: no killing. But in the lonely expanse of space where resources are low, many are willing to bend the rules to survive. Detached isn't just a game; it’s an experience. To complete the game, you must master the controls of your EVA spacesuit and develop your ability to move in a realistic zero-G environment. VR players made their opinions clear: they wanted more intense gameplay from VR devices, allowing them to experience something that was previously considered to be impractical.

(easy enough, right) the two teams are separated by a force field down the middle of the arena which later on advances or or recedes according to the kills that will have been made.

									",English,,"Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG"," About This Game  Within the Cosmos is a single-player first-person sci-fi RPG. The year is 2278, and humanity is on the verge of extinction. You are one of 500 people who work for UESA (United Earth Space Agency) who were put in cryogenic sleep and sent to the planet 'Berith II'. You were sent there to preserve the human race, as they are fighting a war they will not win. Berith II is a planet that is tucked away in the Adallio star system, a system that is hidden, and far from the war. However, once you arrive, you and your crew come under attack by an unknown enemy, and it is up to you to figure out who is behind the attack, and why.  Create a character that suits your play style using the stat system. Want to solve things scientifically? Increase your intelligence! Want to make an agile, stealth oriented character? Increase your Agility! How about resolving potential issues through dialogue? Increase your Charisma!  Encounter factions with different ideals, beliefs, and morals. Join them, betray them, or fight them. It's all up to you!  Explore multiple hand-crafted planets in the Adallio star system. As you try to unwrap the mystery that has befallen you and your crew mates, you will make choices which will affect the way the story develops; along with how your companions and others perceive you, and end game scenarios.  There are always choices, and multiple approaches to complete objectives. Approach NPC's to try and extract information through dialogue, take the stealth approach and sneak behind them, or simply shoot through your enemies using a wide variety of weapons.  Weapons can be upgraded, and customised to your liking. With various skins and attachments, you can easily customise the weapons to suit your play style.  Modules will allow you to enhance your spacesuit in various ways; giving you multiple new abilities you can use in and out of battle. Obtain modules by completing missions, finding them in the world, or by gaining experience points.  Battle through objective-based waves of enemies in a completely separate game mode 'SWARM'.

He brought immense wealth and glory and was beloved by his people. With their help he made Poreskoro into a great city that went down in history of the Ravensgard continent. But the king was old and needed someone that would follow in his footsteps and make sure the city would keep it’s glory. He had two sons, Aarn and Aki to keep his legacy alive after his mortal life was to end. However, Aarn and Aki weren’t like their father. The younger Aki used his inherited wealth to travel the world and spread the word of his father’s and Poreskoro’s greatness. The older Aarn faced only hard work after his father died. He had to take care of his people and the city. However where his father carried calm and understanding, he carried fury and hatred towards his people for all the hard work he had to put forth in his father’s stead. Aarn sold his lands and people to foreign lords and built an arena in Poreskoro. In that arena he amassed the greatest warriors from all over Ravensgard. And so the city of beauty and knowledge became the city of blood and death. And with the city changed the people, awaiting blood and willing to pay in order to see the death of great warriors. King Aarn put forth an offer for anyone brave or stupid enough to enter the arena. Should a warrior dare the challenge and defeat all of the king’s champions, he would become the new king of Poreskoro. Many dared to face the challenge only to meet their death. It’s at this time that the gates of Poreskoro greet you.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows XP,Processor:,1,6GHz,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel HD Graphics,Storage:,5 GB available space,Additional Notes:,16:9 recommended","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,2GHz,Memory:,3 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel HD Graphics,Storage:,7 GB available space,Additional Notes:,16:9 recommended",,

This novel game draws the drama around the “Fog Wanderer”, a murderous apparition scaring a small village in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama.  A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying . Videogames such as Alone in the Dark 1 , The Last Door and the famous Lucas Arts games significantly influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe . The game’s innovative mix of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players and artists.  Synopsis When you awake, you find yourself trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult objects all over this place. You can’t remember what happened, but this place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which might lead to a room beyond this darkness. Outside the cave you find yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps through the fog for manhunt. Help the villagers to solve the mystery of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this place. Gameplay Simplified control of the game can be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing storyline. Technology & Style 2.5D Perspective: The game’s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. Pixel Style: Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation and stimulates players’ imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design leads to a fresh  contemporary graphic style. ",,,,$7.99,

Take a part in the epic struggle between moles, monkeys and other BATTLE SPECIES! Battle Species is a fast-paced game where animal characters are fighting against each other in a pirate theme. Playful game mechanics, destroyable terrain and clear graphics make the gaming experience interesting. Your job is to control a mole on a catapult and try to eliminate a bunch of pirate monkeys that have conquered your castles. Monkeys will use their cannons to make it as hard as possible for you as a player. Luckily you will constantly receive some help from above, in form of air drops containing special ammunition to be thrown at the monkeys. Air drops can also carry medikits and special kind of shields to protect you. The single player campaign includes ten different levels which can be played on three difficulty levels. Each level features a randomly generated terrain, which will be different every time you play. Levels do not have any time limits for completing them, but destructing terrain and slowly rising tide make the job harder as time passes. Default keyboard controls Arrows left / right : drive the catapult backwards and forwards Arrow up : the catapult jumps Arrow down + arrow left / right : see the ammo trajectory and adjust the catapult shooting force Enter : use the current special item you have collected Space : release the catapult arm == shoot! We also have preliminary gamepad support configured in. Feel free to experiment on that if you will (we have tested briefly with old Logitech pad). We know that the launcher provided input configuration is totally crappy, and we are sorry about that! The plan is to build proper configurability to the in-game options menu soon. ",,,,$3.99,

Captain Honamatros is so concerned that she offers her ship, her crew and even to pay for the journey if the PCs come along, as well as everything they find unless it is a keepsake.

The setting is a Japanese cafe in the suburbs of present-day America. Inside, there are two girls. One—Kiri Hattori—runs the store, while the other—Mary—is its poster girl. Their true identities, however, are that of a ninja descendant and a fire-hurling ghost. Together, they protect the town and hunt the Dark Beings that disturb its peace. On a certain stormy night, they offer shelter to a girl they find in front of Kiri's store. Appearing before them at the same time is the vengeful spectre—the Headless Horseman—whose story is inextricably linked with theirs. The two of them take in the mysterious girl, Lily, and continue on with their lives. As they handle the day-to-day affairs of the cafe, a friendship begins to bloom between the three girls. However, those days do not last long. Lily wishes for a battle with Kiri. In the midst of their fight, the Headless Horseman reappears. What is Lily's objective? What does their entangled fate with the Headless Horseman have in store? And finally, what awaits them at the end of the battle? Characters Kiri Hattori VA: Ikumi Hasegawa Kiri is a member of the Hattori, a clan of ninjas that traces back to ancient times. She has been receiving ninja training ever since she was a child, having their techniques drilled into her as part of her upbringing. Both her skills and her mental constitutional are exceptional. She is a peerless hunter of Dark Beings. Though she had been living in Japan, she has come to America with a certain goal in mind. She spends her days running a Japanese cafe in the suburbs while fighting to protect the town's peace from monsters. She enjoys a good binding—that is, with rope, and doing it to someone else—from time to time, which seems to suggest she has a slightly sadistic side. She also finds pleasure in teasing her partner, Mary. Whenever Mary makes a mistake, the whip-like crack of Kiri's rope sends a shiver down her spine. Mary VA: Sayaka Harada Three hundred years ago, Mary was wrongfully accused of being a witch and executed. As the sole bearer of her entire family's vengeful rage, she turned into a vicious ghost that terrorized all those around her until she was saved by Kiri. She has made Kiri the center of her existence ever since. She commands fire at will, and can send them lashing out at her enemies. Though the intensity of the flames is usually under her control, when her emotions run high, she can go berserk. For a berserk Mary, the line between medium and well-done can be particularly thin. When the sun is up, she works as a waitress in the Japanese cafe. During the night, in true ghost-like fashion, she lives in a mirror in Kiri's room. Her favorite food is cold pizza, and anyone who dares tease her about it will surely have a taste of her fiery temper. Lily VA: Natsumi Murakami One stormy night, Kiri finds her collapsed in front of her store. Different from Kiri’s, she uses wind-style ninjutsu. She has partial amnesia, having lostpart of her memories, and is now a live-in employee at Kiri’s café causing a bit of trouble. Eventually, she opens up to Kiri and Mary, who also learn to trust her. She has a certain goal: what could it be...? Headless Horseman VA: Ei Mochizuki A towering, powerful being of the darkness that can easily swing his two-meter long zweihänder, he has enough magical strength to easily regenerate any minor damage immediately. Lost his head hundreds of years ago from one of Kiri’s ancestors. His intense, deep-seated grudge keeps him alive as a being of the darkness. It seems that he also has some kind of connection with Mary...

									","English,Portuguese",,"Indie,Strategy"," About This Game  ""If you could start over, what would you change?"" Context of the world For more than a hundred years, the planet faced a succession of conflicts each even more devastating than the previous one. Mankind was one step away from its extinction and the planet was left with severe marks of radioactivity. Over time, the planet began to show some signs of regeneration and radioactivity became less and less a problem, however, in still active areas, a mysterious phenomenon began to emerge. Over the last twenty years, strange creatures similar to dragons have been seen with increasing frequency. These creatures have been given the name of Viburs. Conflict Now in the year 2091, the world has not been pacified, instead, it moves to its darkest point. It is at its height of social, economic and political unrest, where different ideals have been brought to their logical conclusion, giving rise to three divergent factions. Tensions intensify and everything becomes a pretext for a war in which the concept of morality begins to be challenged. The ideological divergence of each side, will only find rest when it completely suppresses others and establish itself as the true and definitive world order. Protagonist Psychologically scarred and haunted by a past he can never forget, with no other alternative he joins a military training academy for Abidis pilots. Here is where his journey begins, as he starts to be surrounded by a web of internal and external conflicts. Multiple factions and secret interests exert their influence in this war, where not everything is what it seems. However, this is his opportunity to rewrite his own story, and possibly the world’s. Thus begins a long journey, where it was all triggered by the strange and mysterious request of an enigmatic girl. Key Features: Experience the first episode of a dense saga, following the hero as he lives the day-to-day of an intense year in which some of his choices will inevitably affect his future and his team. Interact and get closer to team members. They are the key to getting a clearer picture of the world through their distinct perspectives. This proximity will also be useful in combat. Build a romantic connection with some of the girls. Despite the internal shadows that haunt the protagonist, it is possible to create the necessary change for him to able to consider someone in that perspective. Evolve and fight with a diverse selection of weapons of war. Each faction and certain countries have developed powerful new war instruments that are divided essentially into two large groups of humanoid robots, the Tragos and Abidis. These latter are the best tool that mankind has against the Viburs. Beat the enemies using a variety of strategies, exploring both terrain and character characteristics. All Abidis pilots have a combat style associated with a specific class, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Help managing the team. All fights matter. All the status and condition of the pilots and their units are persistent between missions. Repair, maintenance or upgrading are always difficult choices when human and material resources are limited. Explore this world dominated by the three great factions. Strife and conflict seem unavoidable in a reality where irreconcilable ideologies struggle to attain global hegemony. How will it be, to know different perspectives on the same reality? ",,,,,

The game's story is centered around real-life events that occurred July 2008 in Long Island, New York when the ""Montauk Monster"" washed ashore. Beachgoers stood there scared and confused. The monster looked like a strange mix of pig and dog.  Not far from the beach was Plum Island Animal Research Center which is known for its innovative animal experiments. Two years later another monster washed up on shore but this time it was a human with elongated body parts. Reports suggested that Plum Island started experimenting on humans not just animals. July 2018 the monsters of Plum Island escaped a secret lab in the NYC subway system.  One unlucky subway passenger is trapped on the subway...can you survive and escape?

You can choose to play a traditional game of Chess (choose landscape size ""Chess""), or enhanced Chess in one of nine million procedurally-generated landscapes. Koins can be collected, to purchase reinforcements, and bombs retrieved, to toss at the enemy! Cheese can be picked up to replenish pieces' energy levels. You can use one Rook to build board square paths across empty landscape, and two corner Rooks to enclose and fill rectangular areas, to claim territory and ""magically mine"", or ""pop-up"", goodies from Kingland. You can move your King inside a Rook to beat a hasty retreat. Knights can perform a double move (two of the standard moves in one). Etc.

First, both players (Steam friends) must be running Kingdom to start a game. There are two start game options listed first on the title screen, Landscape (procedurallly-generated map) and Kingland (as saved by the editor). Whomever is to be player One, and thus have the first move in the game, then does this: 1) press Start Landscape Game 2) choose a landscape number and type: click on a digit's top half to increase it, or bottom to decrease 2) select the pre-arranged opponent from your Steam friends list, and press PLAY to send the invitation or 1) press Start Kingland Game 2) choose from your list of editor-saved (or downloaded) Kinglands 2) select the pre-arranged opponent from your Steam friends list, and press PLAY to send the invitation Meanwhile, back at the player TWO ranch: 1) you will receive the invitation, thus press the TICK button to accept it Next, the selected Landscape will be terraformed, or the Kingland transferred. This will take a little while, but the result will be cached to hard-drive, for instant future playing (eg: when load a saved game). The game comes with ""000000"" Chess, Standard and Big landscapes pre-saved. The remaining options on the title screen are: load a previously saved game (either type), start the Kingland Konstruction Kit (editor), and Quit !-) There are four landscape sizes: 1) Chess (no enhanced game options are enabled - only flat terrain permitted) 2) Standard = 64 x 64 board squares 3) Big = 128 x 128 4) Massive = 256 x 256 There are three landscape terrains: Generally Flat Undulatingly Hilly Toweringly Mountainous There are one million initial seed numbers for the procedurally-generated landscapes. Thus this gives 9 million different landscape permutations (for playing King-Dom), and one million very similar Chess boards (for playing standard Chess). Simpy point at the center of the base of a piece, and LMB to select it, then point at a valid board square to perform a move (green cursor). You can press the RMB, and move the mouse, to rotate the camera, and the mouse wheel zooms in and out of your selected piece. Keys 'Z' and 'X' can be used to cycle through your pieces. The save game button at screen center right is available when it is your move, and obviously causes both player's machines to save the current state of play. At the screen lower right is a ""Draw"" button which causes the battle to be declared a draw if both players have pressed it. The screen lower center shows camera direction and angle buttons, when you are not in the shop. The rest of the details here pertain to (enhanced) King-Dom, not (traditional) Chess ... To build a straight line of board squares using your selected Rook, just point at where the final board square of your intended path would be, and press LMB to build it. Or you can use two Rooks, one on each opposite corner of an enclosed rectangle of board squares (maximum size 32x32), to fill the inner area with board squares, by pointing at where any of those squares would be. Rooks can build only once per move, and as the squares magically fall from the night sky, they might randomly ""pop-up"" goodies from out of Kingland. Building board will also mark your territory, with silver or gold squares. These cannot be used by your opponent's pieces, except in the case of a Knight performing a double move. If your selected piece has any bombs, point at an empty board square to toss it there (red cursor). Bombs can be tossed over more squares when tossing from a higher to a lower altitude. Press ""B"", or click on the bomb icon, to toggle your Bomb-O-Scope! Pieces caught in a bomb blast radius of 3 squares will have their energy reduced by 1/4. A small amount of energy is also lost by pieces (1/200) per moved square (knights move one or two squares per move). Energy is replenished by collecting cheese from the board, which will be consumed by pieces as required, giving a 1/4 energy boost. You can also drop a cheese on the start square of your next move, by clicking the cheese icon before moving a piece, to allow another piece to retrieve it. Your King can move to the same square as one of your Rooks to enter it, by pointing at the Rook's board square (instead of the base of the Rook). To exit, simply attempt to move the Rook one square diagonally. A Rook containing a King cannot build board squares. Knights can perform a double move (two of the standard moves in one). Purchased pawns can move one square in any direction, and can only take an opponent piece when moving diagonally. The board also contains Koins (Silver 500 and Gold 1000 K - Kurrency), and during your move, you can enter the shop using the trolley button at the left of the screen. In the shop, you can select your desired piece, if affordable, and then you should press on an empty board square next to your king, to purchase the reinforcement piece, and place it next to its leader. Z = select previous piece X = select next piece B = Bomb-O-Scope on/off (or LMB on bomb icon) F = Pawn-Faces on/off M = RMB-rotate fix-mouse on/off F1 = if Chess (not King-Dom) change view between selected piece and board center F2 = if Chess (not King-Dom) camera buttons on / off F3 = anti-aliasing on/off F4 = low visibility mode on/off (low runs faster) As you point at the landscape, a virtual board square is drawn, which can be added via LMB. An existing pointed-at board square is removed by LMB with SPACE pressed. You can join an added square to the last square you have previously added (yellow cursor) by pressing CTRL. This allows you to add (or remove) straight paths of board squares (new square in-line with previous), or entire rectangular areas. If there is already a board square there, then LMB will add the current editor object (as at screen lower-right) upon it, replacing any existing object, again with SPACE pressed to remove an object. However, if the current editor object is a tree or a rock, then no virtual square is drawn, and you would be adding or removing such objects from the landscape instead. You can LMB in the map at screen top-left to move the cursor to the corresponding landscape location. The controls at the bottom of the screen are divided into Landscape (lower-left) and Objects (lower-right). The first three Landscape buttons are Small / Medium / Big Random Hill, which will be applied at a random location in the map. Also pressing CTRL will apply a valley instead of a hill. The next three buttons are Hill Show / Apply / Undo. These are used to Show the result of pressing Apply to apply the current hill settings, centered upon the current editor cursor location. Next are three sliders: hill Height and Radius, and Water height. First two define the hill size as used by the Show and Apply buttons. Height ranges from - through zero to +, Radius is 1 upwards. Water, obvious. Next are two buttons (left & right) for choosing landscape texture/colours (keys Z/X). The Objects controls show the current editor object with (left & right) buttons (keys V/B and C), a size slider for trees and rocks, and three buttons: if current editor object is a tree or rock, will randomly place objects in a small / medium / big area, centered on the cursor location. To the right center of the screen, the three buttons are Load, Save, and Upload to the Steam Workshop. During Load and Save, a folder button exists at screen lower-left. This will open the Kinglands folder, and yes it is safe to rename your own "".kgl"" files, as long as you do not change the extension, of course. Downloaded Kinglands which you have subscribed to in the Steam Workshop should NOT be renamed. Upload is only permitted if the Kingland has valid pieces, ie: both players have the same numbers of pieces, and only one King each. CURSOR COLOURS: Green = the board square location which is the camera's target Yellow = the previous added board square which will be joined with a path or rectangle Also drawn, if the mouse is diagonally inline with previous board square, is a second yellow cursor. This makes it a much simpler task to add a square of board squares (rather than an accidental rectangle). Cursor Keys = move editor cursor (camera target) around landscape SPACE = turns Add into Remove CTRL = joins to previous Add/Remove board square Z = previous landscape texture/colours X = next landscape texture/colours C = invert piece editor object player V = previous editor object B = next editor object L = load a Kingland S = save current Kingland Your suggestions for the evolution of Kingland are craved - please see the email address below - and I have more I'll be adding in coming weeks.

Alternative history, socialism has not fallen , it is still prevailing in the former Eastern Bloc. The cities of the Eastern Bloc are developing at an incredible pace. The capitals of the Eastern empire are full of neon and bright colors. On the city’s neon-lit streets a new form of entertainment is born. Exclusive night races are becoming one of the biggest attractions. Large television stations, satellite broadcasting to other block countries, blaze of colors, the roar of engines, untamed power and adoration of crowds attract all, amateurs and professionals, workers and intellectuals. The races are held in nostalgic cars from the 80s of the last century, but only reminding the original by all appearances, armed with neon lights and powerful engines make them look unique on the background of everyday, boring electric vehicles. The powerful Moscow corporation, which is the organizer of the competition, has named the racing series of neon flashing relics as - ELECTRO RIDE. The player is one of the amateurs of this competition, who knows his local race track like the back of one’s hand. He is not a member of any great team, just trying to enter the world of fame and money, having his car and one well-known route. The first race begins, first qualification, then racing against the team to finally challenge the leader of the opponents. That's how the career starts. Then there are more tracks, cities, more opponents, new cars, new teams and more and more adrenaline. Each race is a little different with special nitro zones on the track, special prizes and skills to collect and of course records to beat at each route. And when almost all of them is completed, the biggest challenge will be to race a professional team sponsored by a powerful Russian corporation. If he wins on the Moscow streets he will become the best of the best. Gameplay modes: • Career - you start as an amateur, then a professional, to finally challenge a champ • Quick race - training and breaking records, available unlocked tracks and cars • Split screen – multiplayer mode for two player to race and beat the record The most important game features: • quick arcade races in a neon scenery • cars modeled on vehicles from the 80s • fighting against time, opponents or other player • a neon vision of the alternative future of Eastern Europe • best results statistics of each track • keyboard, pads or steering wheel control",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia GTX 550 or AMD equivalen,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX Compatible Soundcard,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,10.13 High Sierra,Processor:,Intel Core i3,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel HD Graphics 4000 or better,Storage:,4 GB available space,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or newer,Processor:,Intel Core i3 or AMD equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia GTX 550 or AMD equivalen,Storage:,4 GB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Microsoft Windows 7/8/10 64-bit,Processor:,Intel Core i5 or AMD equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia GTX 960 or AMD equivalent,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space,Sound Card:,DirectX Compatible Soundcard,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,10.13 High Sierra,Processor:,Intel Core i5,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 8000 Series or better,Storage:,8 GB available space,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Linux Ubuntu 16.04 or newer,Processor:,Intel Core i5 or AMD equivalent,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia GTX 960 or AMD equivalent,Storage:,8 GB available space",,

									",English,,Massively Multiplayer," About This Game  CSC is an open-world, sandbox-style space MMO that features a Play-to-Own Economy . Players can mine, harvest, craft, and explore in a quest to help humankind colonize the cosmos. Experience a free-market game economy for the first time with the ability to buy, sell, and trade without limits. Any items found, crafted, or earned in CSC can be moved freely both inside and outside of the game universe. As a Commander in the CSC Universe, you'll have true freedom, and savvy players will discover endless opportunities. Universe of Opportunities Your journey begins as an adventurous miner hunting rare resources in the depths of Fringe Space. Become a master crafter of high-tech modules, equipment, starships, or even a fully player-owned station. Perhaps you'll focus your attention on supporting the growth of the Galactic Federation by transporting consumer goods, resources, colonists, and workers to new outposts, earning valuable credit.  Or you could armor and equip your starship to hunt for pirates and other treasures in dangerous and unsettled space. Keen on building a business empire? Then dominate the markets by buying, selling, and trading valuable goods from around the cosmos. The choice is yours... What destiny will you choose? Join the community and learn more about CSC in our Official Discord Channel  Community CSC has been in development for over a year with a playable client and community since late 2018. During this time, over 16,000 Commanders have signed up, mined over 30 million tons of resources, completed over 26,000 mining missions, acquired a space station, formed clans, and claimed hundreds of ships as their own. In addition, we have had several events that have brought our community and developers together in glorious space combat. And all this is only the beginning... imagine what the future holds. Overview CSC starts players off as newly-recruited Commanders of the Galactic Federation. As Commander of your very own starship, you'll undertake missions, discover resources, and regularly acquire new skills in your quest to dominate the galactic frontier. Players can travel to different star systems to explore the vast expanse of deep space, mirroring our real-world corner of the Milky Way. Star systems are vast and rich in resources, blueprints, and new technologies just waiting to be salvaged by you. But be warned, the further you travel from Sol, the greater the danger. Starships As a Commander, you can own a fleet of starships, but you can only command one at a time. Starships are specialized, and some are better suited to specific tasks than others. Build a fleet that suits your needs, whether that's mining, combat, trade, or exploration. Each starship in CSC can be endlessly customized with equipment modules, which add or upgrade weapons, shields, and nearly any ship stat. They can also add unique functionality to starships such as cloaking, scanning, or even instantaneous singularity jump drives. These modules can be acquired through crafting, missions, player trades, or event drops. Fringe & Core Space Space in CSC will be divided into two regions: Core Space and Fringe Space. Core Space allows players to explore with relative safety and will have limited PvP (Players vs Player) interaction. While Core Space offers players a safe zone for research and exploration, certain resources may be more difficult to find. Fringe space is akin to the wild west, where laws are merely suggestions and players are at the mercy of local player-controlled governments. Fringe space makes up most of the explorable universe, but it's much more dangerous than Core Space. Those brave enough to venture deep into Fringe Space will find abundant and rare resources, higher bounties, and more lucrative quests. Crafting, Refining & Discovery Almost everything in the CSC universe can be crafted. The crafting system is uncapped, allowing players to continually improve on the quality of their crafted items. Specialization is encouraged by the CSC crafting system, rewarding players for focusing on specific skills or items, creating truly unique and valuable in-game assets. Refining allows players to convert raw ore or harvested resources into usable crafting materials. Refining rigs are available in GFI-controlled stations but can also be created, customized, and offered as a service by other Commanders. Players possessing the necessary skills and resources can begin the process of crafting items. They'll spend real-world time researching how to craft modules or ships, and as they craft more items and improve their skills, their odds of discovering new variations will increase.  These variations can prove to be valuable commodities in the Player Owned Economy, since these items are ONLY provided by players and never the Galactic Federation. Travel & Transportation In CSC, all starships come equipped with a base FTL (faster-than-light) drive, capable of traveling vast interstellar distances in a matter of hours (1 LPH = 1 light year per real-world hour). The average speed of the initial batch of starships will be 1 LPH. As a general rule of thumb, smaller ships will be faster than larger, heavier ships. This base speed can be improved significantly with module upgrades and various crafted items. To help facilitate early exploration, the Galactic Federation provides an instantaneous travel option via Jump Gate. Jump Gates will facilitate system-to-system travel and will require Trilite Concentrate Fuel (TCF) to operate. TCF can be crafted from the rarest resource in the CSC universe, Trilite, or can be purchased from GFI Stations. Players will also have the ability to create their own transportation networks. Hangar modules will be available for large and capital starships. Players who focus on transportation as a career path can train skills to boost their LPH speed far beyond what the GF can offer. Ultimately, a player who acquires or creates a large class ship with a singularity jump module will become an economic powerhouse capable of moving starships, cargo, and players around the universe instantaneously. Mining & Resource Collecting Resources are spread throughout the universe and are primarily distributed throughout asteroid belts. Players can locate resources using a scanning mechanic, and once they're discovered, properly equipped ships can mine until the resource is depleted. Pools of resources will regenerate over time, and the rarest and most valuable resources can be found in Fringe space. In CSC, resource scanners come in a variety of styles, each with their own advantages, disadvantages, and levels of quality. Differences in quality will affect a scanner's accuracy, range, and number of resources recognized in a single scan. Contracts and Economic Development CSC is designed to facilitate all facets of economic gaming. From the traditional gamer looking for a deeper, more immersive experience to the game entrepreneur looking to grow and develop game economies—all players can succeed with enough skill and wit. The contracts system in CSC will allow for complex actions and trustless cooperation between Commanders. For example, a CSC industrialist might see the opportunity to sell a Prometheus class vessel in Wolf 359. This savvy player may not have the skill or time to collect the necessary resources or craft the item, but they may have the funds to get it done. This player could choose to set up a series of contracts, beginning with a resource contract that triggers a crafting contract on fulfillment and ending with a sale contract when the ship is created. Once the player sets these contracts up, the blockchain and our Scarcity Engine Technology will enforce the collection of resources, distribution of currency to players, and creation of a marketplace listing for the completed item. That savvy player will have discovered an opportunity in the universal economy, created jobs for other players to complete, and profited from the sale of the created goods. This open economic system creates a symbiotic relationship between players and play styles.",,,,,

									","English,Italian,German,French,Spanish - Spain",,"Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG"," About This Game The Gods have abandoned Midgard. Once a prosperous land teeming with mythical beasts and beings, it now rots from the inside, tainted by unknown forces. Odin’s chosen guardians of the realm are gone. In their absence, the sacred Elder Tree they swore to protect is exposed to abuse and manipulation. Now, the only remnants of hope reside in Estra, the daughter of mankind’s last great leader. With a heavy emphasis on narrative, Estra’s journey through Midgard is filled with Nordic lore, mysterious twists, and consequential decisions. Players will converse with a variety of characters and share in Estra’s discoveries as she learns more about her family’s past and the looming darkness spreading across the realm. Interactive Story Estra’s path is fraught with difficult decisions and untrustworthy characters that can lead her astray. Her story is intertwined with the player’s ability to discern fact from fiction and to decide right from wrong. Avoid battle, help companions, save your people, but remember that the consequences are Estra’s to bear. Puzzles Along the way, players must solve incrementally challenging puzzles that reveal insightful secrets, fantastical abilities, and hidden passageways. While trial and error is useful, patience is necessary. Not every problem allows for multiple mistakes and failure is most certainly an option. The answers you seek may be lost if you make the wrong decision. Combat Violence isn’t always necessary, but, when push comes to shove, ATONE’s combat is a delicate dance of sword and axe. Combat is grounded in the rhythm game genre and the mechanics of titles like Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution. Music is a crucial component, with each fight receiving its very own song. Music ATONE’s music and sound design are composed by Australian artist, Luminist (a.k.a. James Shuar), who blends a synth-heavy score with the digitally corrupted sounds of period-specific instruments.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7+ (64-bit),Processor:,Intel Core i3 3217U 1.8 GHZ Dual Core,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia GT 730M / Radeon R7 M270,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,4 GB available space,Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Mac OSX 10.12.6+ (64-bit),Processor:,2012 or newer Intel Core i5,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,NVIDIA GT 650M or AMD equivalent,Storage:,4 GB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system",,

Although the place is warm and inviting during the day, it becomes a different place at night. Locals refuse to approach Rybalka Lodge and the owner is fire-fighting rumors of it being haunted. The original lodge burned down just one year ago, possibly by Vikmordere arsonists, and killed the visiting Ambassador Valdritch with his entire retinue. Now with the imminent arrival of a Klavekian Prince on the anniversary of the tragedy has stirred up both memories of the fire and the spirits of those consumed in the flames. Can the party get to the bottom of what is going on before the prince sets foot in town? Will the spirits of those who suffered from the arsonists attack get their revenge? Will the Vikmordere try to instigate another assassination attempt? And who is the mysterious woman occasionally seen in the shadows around the new lodge?

									",English,,"Action,Indie"," About This Game Gravia puts the power of black holes right in your hand. Gravia is a first-person action puzzle game centered on the concepts of black holes, and gravity. In Gravia, you have the power to create small black holes in the area around you. These black holes pull in and destroy almost everything in the environment, including yourself. You'll use this power to destroy obstacles, solve physical puzzles, defeat enemies, move massive object, and move yourself at very high speed. You can even bend the path of laser beams.  The main game mechanical in Gravia involves the use of the Gravia Glove. This glove fires a small, fast-moving projectile in a straight line away from you. When it hits something, the projectile instantly transforms into a small black hole, pulling in the objects around it. You also have the option of converting the projectile into a black hole in mid flight. In most cases, you also decide when to destroy the black hole, which immediately stops the gravity effect. Careful and controlled use of the Gravia Glove will allow you to move yourself through the world, reaching places you could never reach simply by running and jumping.  Black holes are extremely dangerous, and it's very easy to kill yourself accidentally or destroy things around you. Much of the challenge of Gravia comes from performed controlled actions with a tool that is anything but subtle. On the other hand, most of the environments in Gravia are designed to be highly destructible, as there's a special joy that comes from watching the world fall apart around you. Most large, destructible objects in Gravia bend and deform as they are drawn into black holes.  Gameplay typically alternates between challenges that require pure problem solving skills, and those that require speed and timing to proceed. As your mastery of the Gravia Glove increases, you'll develop the skill to move through areas without ever needing to touch the ground.  Gravia has a rich, linear storyline that takes place within a high-tech research facility called `Gravia Technologies.`",,,,,

You must settle in a new land, so collect resources, train with your master, and grow stronger by learning powerful skills!! For those just looking to experience the story, there are 2 distinct modes. Full rpg experience with combat (10-18 hours), or… “Adventure Mode” (4-6 hours), which removes the element of combat and strategy, but leaves the story, puzzles, and exploration to enjoy! Key Features/Mechanics A cave painting come to life! Most progression comes from exploration,  find items to raise your stats.  Some of the best skills require items to learn too, so choose wisely! Heal in between battles by eating/hunting the small animals such as bats, squirrels, and lizards.  Also recovers SP used for many skills, so you can keep on moving.  Just make sure to have enough stamina in order to DASH. Many skills push or pull enemies. This changes what skills they can use in battle as well as some stats.   Line them up strategically to hit multiple enemies with a single attack! Timed button presses are needed for some skills, so stay on your toes! Open progression system:  Animals in your party can be upgraded by finding items.  Their HP and SP will go up with each level but the other stats are up to you!  Choose many new skills to learn with EV points, even from the start!  Create some powerful synergies with your team! Puzzles and variety in every area:  Use clues in your journal to solve various puzzles.  Or just figure them out on your own… maybe…  Use various plants in the environment to refill stamina instantly, see hidden tracks, or gain temporary power 2 versions; one for RPG veterans and one for those who just want to experience the story 10-18 hours to complete the game in the normal version Developer Profile: I am a therapist in Santa Ana, California.  I currently live with my wife, two cats, and one dog. This is my second game so far.  I’m a life-long gamer, (growing up with two brothers, we played a ton of different games) and an RPG lover. I worked on this by myself, but had input from testers, family, and friends.  Big thanks to the creators of many useful plugins too! So you know where some of my influences come from, some of my favorite games are; Castlevania, Mario RPG, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Smash Bros., ‘Tales of’ games, Zelda, and Albert Odyssey.
