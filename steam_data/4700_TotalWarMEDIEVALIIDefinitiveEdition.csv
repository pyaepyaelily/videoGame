84,74681100,english,"[u]Rating[/u]: 8 out of 10 (see remarks below)
[u]Recommendation[/u]: I mainly play battles and skirmishes so am not familiar with how the campaigns are. Despite modeling many effects in real time, the game is not too demanding on your hardware. There are a few minor glitches, but they do not affect tactics that much. It can seem expensive, especially considering its age, so you might want to wait for a promotional sale.

[u]Positives[/u]:
Overall the unit types are modeled quite realistically in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Examples include spears and pikes, swords, axes, hammers and maces, polearms, bows, crossbows, firearms, javelins, heavy cavalry, light cavalry, elephants, mounted archers and crossbowmen, and siege weapons; some carry shields while others do not. The combat mechanics takes into account factors such as obstacles, concealment, shield coverage, the momentum of cavalry charges, stamina (which recovers more slowly than it is drained, especially for mounts such as horses), armor piercing capabilities, and magazine capacity. Morale is also modeled, where less disciplined troops rout more easily, which can snowball across an army to your advantage or detriment. You may need to balance between quality and quantity, defense and offense, range and melee, field battle and siege performance. Although the game was released more than a decade ago, the graphics is still very much acceptable compared to newer titles, and running it consumes much less computing resources.

[u]Negatives[/u]:
I tried the campaigns a little but found them terribly boring and tedious, like variations on Civilization but with more micromanagement and less focus on economics. There are a few glitches with combat affecting certain units' animation and vulnerability to interruption, but the difference is not that noticeable in my experience. The game manual does not cover every detail of the combat mechanics, such as shield coverage and armor piercing, so you may want to do your own research online. The game might come bundled with expansions and add-ons, including new units and campaigns, and as a consequence be priced somewhat high. If you are not interested in the package deal, then you may want to wait for it to be on sale.",1598035766,1600832882,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False,76561198074519955,11,8,6400,0,6400,1560757166,,

43,21872195,english,"So, I've put a hell of a lot of time into this one, but sadly in hindsight must admit that it's time I half wish that I could get back, as there is enough wrong with this game to make it unlikely that I will play it again. Although, the fact the footwell of my car is full of Mcdonalds' bags and empty bottles of coke attests to the fact my willpower is not the best when addictive crap is involved, so I probably will.
This was actually the first steam review I wrote back in the day, and was effectively a prolonged whining session after I had rage quite the game for the umpteenth time. I owned the game pretty much from release in my early teens, and endured an epic saga simply to get it to run on my Dad's primitive computer, only for the game to fail to import the unit animations (As in, all of them) on multiple installations, so despite owning it I had to buy a second copy when I was 19 and spent a good amount of my summer and first university semester playing it, and have done so on and off ever since. I'm a long term fan of the series, even owning (somewhere) a copy of the very first Shogun total war, and I honestly can't understand why this out of all of them is remembered as the best, but that might be others' childhood nostalgia speaking. 
I think my big issue is that most of the game mechanics are marred by some of the most dimwitted AI ever to grace the screen of my PC. Diplomacy, to put it kindly, simply does not work. Unless you are one of the Iberian three, every single faction that you share a border with will declare war on you with zero provocation, and will refuse every single diplomatic option you have except you handing them a big stack of money, and will maybe offer a very temporary ceasefire if they are on the brink of defeat, but even then this is only to give them enough time to get back on their feet to attack you again. Like in Rome, a faction on the brink of defeat will happily charge right across the map to attack you, even as it's last settlement falls to it's enemies. Alliances are worse than useless, because presumably the game developers understood alliance as ""Do nothing and then backstab."" Not even at the first opportunity, as that would imply the AI has any tactical sense. The fact you are constantly at war with most of the map would seem to be an issue, but most factions you are fighting will just endlessly send hordes of very weak troops to die against you in sieges. They can sometimes have four or five weak armies attacking you all along the border, where maybe investing that money in one strong one would have ensured that their attacks would actually have a result besides wasting time. Your own settlements need a family member present, or else the auto management will activate, and your settlement will be handed over to a Tory Mp, who immediately sets all the taxes to maximum and spends all available money on making endless stacks of weak infantry and useless siege weapons, which will result in you both likely loosing the settlement to the inevitable rebellion and loosing a lot of money on upkeep for the armies of ballistae that you didn't order. Thankfully you can turn this off just before you start a campaign, but even with it off you seem to have public order issues in settlements without a governor present, so I hope you like finding whichever random settlement your generals and family members spawned in and trekking them across the map. I bring this up as the AI seem to be saddled with this issue too, as they are constantly teetering on the brink of both bankruptcy and mass uprisings. I have heard from a friend (and bear in mind that this is hearsay) that the AI will declare war on you if your economy is outperforming theirs, and if so then their economic management must be truly awful. Also, whilst on the topic of economy, the game has two factions that invade part of the ways through the campaign, the Mongols and Timurids. Besides the utter absurdity of these two factions existing at the same time (As Tamerlane was pretty much Genghis' ultimate fanboy), they, unlike any other faction in the game, are not obligated to pay upkeep, and so can steamroll the entire map by attrition. Other campaign issues include your own army AI, which will march  for a dozen turns to get around an army, and both armies and agents will constantly forget their orders if they run into an unexpected army or agent. Which is constant, so you cannot set them to make long journeys without constant supervision. Also, no matter who you are, or how far away you are, Milan will find and declare war on you.
Now, on the second big issue, which is also AI related. The battlefield AI. Artillery is useless, as it is so inaccurate against anything smaller than a castle wall that it's more worth your money to fill that slot in your army with a unit of peasants, because they have a significantly higher chance of killing something on the enemy side than an entire battery of cannons do. Cavalry units (Besides often feeling far weaker than they should) have very little cohesion, and the amount of times that I have ordered a unit to charge only for most of the models to simply stand there, or even flock off in the opposite direction is nothing short of ludicrous. This was also not an issue in Rome, so I'd really love to know how they messed it up in a game that was basically a reskin of rome. Infantry don't even really need to fight as you can literally click right behind an enemy formation and they will just barge their way through. (Something that is an issue in total war ""Troy to get me to use the epic store"" at time of writing, but not to my knowledge any of the other games). The Enemy Ai has very little grasp of tactics or formation, and is far far too easy to bait into chokepoints or trap in envelopments. Every battle is Cannae when your enemy cannae defend their flanks. (If I didn't know I was already going to hell for liking Postal 2 I'd be going for that joke. I can now go to super hell, which is more exclusive, and has a salad bar). There are also an alarming amount of glitches, such as infantry with two handed weapons being useless because their attack animations get interrupted and can't get attacks off, top tier units from multiplayer than are inexplicably missing in game, or the game taking a tantrum and often crashing if I dare use alt tab to change my music playlist or take a quick break to apply for more Dole under yet another false name.
There's also quite a few balance issues. The Lack of Koumiss taxation to curb the horse archers has already been mentioned. Elephants are broken, and with the horrible artillery accuracy there seems to be no way to counter them. Firearms are too slow and inaccurate to be of any real use, and a lot of top tier stuff from certain factions gets utterly destroyed by mid tier stuff from weaker factions, but besides the Steppe Tide it's not a gigantic issue. Certain factions also seem to have severe issues with moneymaking. I've played around a little with transplanting factions around the map, and Russia, Byzantium and Poland seem to be poorer than everyone else regardless of where you put them. Finally, the game could really do with a few more islamic factions, as there are only three, and they get terribly bullied by the catholic factions.
If you can set all the issues aside there's a decent enough game here, but I have to admit they are too much for me. Go play Warhammer 2 instead, it has rats with machine guns.",1458146988,1600102831,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198124748015,452,41,23829,0,23829,1540492033,,

58,75829769,english,"Summary: It's a fun Medieval themed turn-based grand strategy game. It's broken in a lot of ways, but the game somehow manages to remain pretty fun. Just so you know what you're getting yourself into...

Pros: 
- Monster ribualt go brrrrrr (it's 40 guns on a wagon, what could go wrong?)
- Conquer the world as Denmark. Bet they weren't expecting a good old-fashioned Viking raid!
- You can keep assassinating the pope if you don't like him (it's the only way to make that system not work against you)
-  You can troll the AI and sneak around to a far away city by boat, then one-shot them with a bunch of siege artillery. Not so funny now, eh Portugal? 
- You can conquer the Papal States and watch the AI factions lose their minds. 
- Wage religious warfare against your neighbors. Send a bunch of priests/imams over and watch their cities descend into chaos. There are no diplomatic ramifications, so have fun.

Cons: 
- Diplomacy is broken. The AI factions will seemingly randomly declare war on you, then will refuse any reasonable attempt at diplomacy unless you give them all of your money (because they're broke).
- You must bow down to the all-mighty Random Number Generator gods! Seriously, there is so much RNG, and somehow it seems unfair. A 95% success chance fails waaaaay too often to be accurate. 
- Unless you love the RTS part of these games, it can get very tedious. Every battle is largely the same, and you can have 150+ battles in a campaign. On the other hand, the auto-resolve function for battles is subject to the same wonky RNG as other parts of the game. It's a good way to lose a giant army in one battle... I suspect because the AI tries to lead charges with archers or something.
- Naval combat was tacked on. There is only an auto-resolve function and there is no option to retreat, so you will eventually lose an army when pirates attack you while trying to sail somewhere. 
- Crusades are ridiculous. You can request a crusade against any non-catholic faction to include excommunicated factions. I've seen crusades called against cities in the English isles, central Europe, and Italy. 
- Calvary are largely useless, for all factions. Again, the AI doesn't apply strategy when auto-resolving battles, so they're just really expensive sub-standard infantry. 
- The merchant characters are bugged. The AI will ALWAYS win in merchant take-overs, and you will ALWAYS lose. 
- Your generals are a bunch of disloyal flakes. They'll sometimes just randomly decide to join the rebel faction while moving between your settlements, because why not. 
- Speaking of generals, you tend to rack up a decent number of worthless, disloyal ones. Since they're high-stat units that seldom die in combat, I like to band them into makeshift armies and send them out into the countryside to ""fight crime"" - i.e. hunt down my other idiot generals who decided they wanted to be rebels. 
- The AI flat out cheats. If you assassinate all of their leaders, random high-stat new ones will appear out of nowhere.
- If you're about to wipe out a faction (because you're sick of their bullshit) the pope will step in and threaten to excommunicate you if you attack them for a few turns.
- There are actually only 4 factions in the game: The Northwestern Europeans, the Italians, the Slavs, and the Muslim nations. The flags and starting locations may be different, but the unit rosters are almost all the same.",1599883884,1599883884,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198191240078,61,6,7617,0,7617,1599425939,,

38,75250816,english,"Total War: Medieval II is often considered to be the best entry in the franchise. And it is, for the time it came out. 

I never grew up with this game, in fact my first introduction to the entire franchise was Empire Total War. I'm not looking at this game with the same nostalgic glasses as some long time players of the franchise are. There is a lot to love about this game but there is also plenty to dislike. 

Let's get the good stuff out of the way first. 

1. The era is fantastic to play in. Starting out in the early 12th century and ending right around the late 15th century, there are so many different events that the player can experience. From the crusades to the hundred years war to reconquista, a lot was happening in those three to four centuries. The player even gets to play with the beginnings of gun powder weapons, advanced siege craft, moving from chain mail to plate armor, there's a lot to do. 

2. The campaign is really fun. Going back to studying a spread sheet for finances, assigning nobles to either lead armies or govern cities, disbanding your army then recalling them back to on another campaign, it's charm and detail that a lot of the newer games are lacking now. It really does feel like you're managing a kingdom or empire, and not just collecting capture points. 

3. For a 2006 game, the visuals are still pleasing. Yeah there are parts where it hasn't aged well, especially when it comes to the models, but the effects, building destruction, and troop movement/combat is still great to look at. 

Now it's time for the bad, and this is where my statement about being great for the time it came out applies. 

1. The game has a certain clunkiness that hasn't gone away and is very awkward now. The camera controls can be very sensitive, I just what to pan to the camera to the left a little and it goes half way across the map. Titling the camera isn't any better either. 

2. This also ties into the clunkiness from before but deserves it's own section. Battles, while fun, can also be frustrating. Not in a I lost frustrating, more of a ""attack the f***ing enemy that's right in front of you"" frustrating. Every time I'm in a battle, an entire unit can get caught up on one enemy soldier that stray from his battalion, take five minutes to kill him, while ignoring all the other enemies around them. Or, I'll go for a flank attack but the entire unit stops when one or two of their guys strays from the pack and goes for the flank attack on their own. Like this is launch day Total War Rome 2 levels of AI stupidity! It is an absolutely frustrating thing and I can't believe that CA didn't patch this out when the released the definitive edition of this game. 

However, even with all that frustration from before, I still recommend this game because it is the best of the early days of Total War. I don't think it's the best over all, I personally think Shogun 2 is better. But for the time it came out, when comparing it to Rome, Shogun, and Medieval Total War, this game really is the best of the early days of this franchise.",1598926284,1598926284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198047003651,75,5,10385,0,10330,1599010379,,

It was rough in the start while I was building my armies and my economy but once I got past that little hiccup I really got into it.

1,62973802,english,"For a while, I didn't understand how people could think that Medieval 2 was the best Total War game. It seemed too dated and clunky for me to ever enjoy. After giving it a fair chance and finishing a campaign I realize now how wrong I was. While it isn't my favorite Total War game, Medieval 2 is undoubtedly the best Total War game I have ever played. I know now how many steps back Creative Assembly have taken, and how much depth the newer games lack compared to this one. 

Coming from the newer Total War games, I never would have guessed how much of a roleplaying element this game has. The ""traits"" system lets you add personality and complexity to generals, turning them into shining pillars of chivalry, or deplorable, malevolent warmongers, through your actions in war. These extreme poles of morality come with their own effects and bonuses. Dread leads to decreased enemy morale in battle, where as chivalry leads to increased friendly morale in battle as well as extra population growth in settlements. When generals inevitably die, in combat or of old age, it can be emotional, because you were there with them from the start, built them up from nothing, and watched them conquer, only to have to watch them die. This kind of connection to these characters gives such a layer of intricacy to this game that the newer games don't really have, especially Warhammer, as in that game faction leaders and lords are immortal gods of slaughter. 

In Medieval 2, men win wars, not magic tricks. Battles last a long time, soldiers beat each other to a pulp before routing, as opposed to some of the newer games where early routs are commonplace, and battles only last a few minutes. There is much more room for strategy, no dropping down magic spells on giant blobs of enemies. Taking heavy losses takes a toll on the player, units don't magically replenish themselves, and the weight of death can be felt, because you are a human, fighting and killing other humans. At the end of the day, in my opinion, human conflict will always be more interesting and meaningful than the conflict between fantastical races and magical creatures. 

On the campaign side of things, you have diplomacy, which is somewhat complex for a game this old, but still not nearly as complex as Paradox games. You control your own diplomats, in order to initiate diplomacy with another faction, you literally have to move one of your diplomats to one of their cities, as opposed to a few clicks of your mouse in the newer games. Merchants are a way for you to earn a bit of cash on the side, by finding valuable resources to bring back to your capital. Spies are helpful when it comes to waging a successful war, or finding out information about rivals. Assassinations can be attempted on many characters (including the pope) and this adds to the sense of mortality of characters in this game. All of this adds to immersion quite a bit. As the campaign progresses, time moves on, armor and weapons become more advanced, one must adapt and modernize their armies and strategies in order to keep up with the rest of the world. 

Rewrite history, turn heroes into villains, turn despots into saints, or try and follow history as accurately as you can, it's really up to you. This game is a history lover's wet dream come true, any fan of medieval history will probably end up falling in love with this game, and even those who aren't that interested in history can still find something to enjoy in this game. It might seem like I am taking shots at the Total War: Warhammer games, but I still think those games are good, just not nearly as good as this one.",1580841956,1598005747,True,87,2,0.876536071300506592,0,True,False,False,76561198055476222,331,15,5496,318,1555,1601421381,,

70,74116070,english,"Total War: Medieval 2 is to date the best strategy game, generally, that I've played. The combat is smooth and works well, especially when I use the micro-adjustments to the speed of time, allowing me to play in 1/10th increments of the normal speed of combat (for me, 0.2 or 0.3 usually works the best, allowing for real-time play while also giving me a sense that I am on a par with the computer in terms of seeing things play out, recognizing them, formulating a response, and then executing the orders to my troops). The management of settlements and of military personnel is also very deep, intricate, and fun. I am able to, first of all, micro-manage the degree to which I am able to manage my settlements. For example, if I want to be able to initiate construction projects or soldier recruitment without the presence of a military leader/male member of the royal family, I can toggle that. If I prefer to play hardcore and disallow building or recruitment without the presence of a male member of the royal family present, I can toggle that, instead. Then, I have to manage population growth and financial growth/productivity against public order and religious sentiment on the other. If I push too much toward productivity/wealth, without proper attention to the happiness or well-being of the populace, the people could become so unhappy that they revolt. Within all of these concerns for the wealth of my coffers, I need to also balance military research and construction projects; without them, all that money does me little good. Recruitment not only includes troops, it also includes a host of agents, such as spies, assassins, priests, diplomats, and merchants. Organically, I can also have access to female nobility born to my lineage, which serve as specialized diplomats. Each of these agents perform specialized roles, and they require different skills and approaches on the part of the player to be worth anything at all, let alone powerful in their own rights. Your generals, or the male nobility, have RPG-style personalities, which impact how well they do at various roles they can play, including governing or managing a settlement (influencing trade, taxation, public order, farming output, construction costs, recruitment costs, etc.), traversing the map or marching, and combat (whether attacking or defending, whether attacking or defending walls, whether using siege equipment or not, whether engaging the enemy on preferred terrain or not). These personality traits of your commanders are developed over time depending on what the experience through more or less random events generated by the game code, and depending on actions that you the player take with them, deliberately. What's more, this RPG-style personality and trait system applies not only to your generals, but also to your agents. There are also tech trees that are not visible for many hours into the game, and specialized guilds and specialized military units that you can not have access to for many hours and many turns into the game, and which you will not have access to unless you just so happen to be playing the game according to those guilds' preferences. In addition to all these things are mining, seafaring and ocean-based combat (which is all computer simulated - can't have every detail included in a game), trade, detailed diplomacy, natural disasters, crusades, jihads, rebellions, port blockades, and invasions of vast 'barbarian' hordes. The visuals are solid or outright amazing (see: individually animated troops - thousands of them - on the battlefield). You have to manage troop ammunition - archers and catapult crews can't carry around unlimited supplies. The environmental sound are astounding, and change according to how far zoomed in or out you are: zoom in to hear birds and rustling of foliage along with noises of people present; zoom out to hear only the whistling and roaring of the winds. The music is particular to each human culture you are playing, and is beautiful, engaging, and stays fresh - I find myself humming or singing after I have been playing for a little while. The human speech and 'voice-acting' is all really fun and thorough, as well.

78,74066610,english,"Great game which unfortunately aged like milk.
I wish there was a way to post both a positive and negative review of this game. For the sake of simplicity, just refer to the mountain of positive reviews for the general stuff. Yeah, this is probably going to anger some people and especially those who deservedly give Medieval II the title of cult status. Back in 2006 this game was incredible. Amazing graphics and one of the best Total War settings ever. Medieval II thankfully has a very few bugs or glitches and at least for me, it was a stable experience. The problem in the game, which is the cause of the negative review is its horrible engine. Allow me to elaborate.
Medieval II uses the same engine as Rome I (TW Engine 2), albiet modified. While this engine offers an enjoyable and fluid experience in Rome I, it just doesn't work all that well for Medieval II. Animations in Medieval II are horribly sluggish and slow, which directly harms a few units, namely the infantry wielding two handed weapons. Archers have it even worse. While their arrows perform well when they shoot straight, if they try to shoot over the walls, the arrows that fly in an arc do as much damage as raindrops. Pikemen have it worst, however. Due to a weird bug which CA never bothered to fix (even though it would have taken them less than an hour), pikemen tend to drop their pikes in the middle of combat and switch to swords which makes them completely useless. There's a few more things like some units being unavailable like the English armored sergeants and HRE dismounted gothic knights. As far as the knights go, their performance is generally underwhelming. Charging into the mass of disorganized infantry rarely goes as planned since charges with couched lances regularly get interrupted by a bunch of routing stragglers rather than barreling and cutting through a disorganized mob of troops like in the modern TWs and Medieval II's predecessor Rome I. Musketeers are also in a pretty bad state. They are forced to completely line up to fire their guns, and if one gets killed by arrows, it can take them ages to reform their ranks a fire a proper volley. 
Multiplayer is another issue alltogether. While it is impressive that a 14-year old game still has a functional and active multiplayer, the game mode is far from impressive. Multiplayer in Medieval II can get very laggy and stuttery, especially siege battles. Knocking down a wall causes a giant lag spike and the balance of troops is awful. Spearmen cost almost as much as the vastly superior dismounted knights for some reason. Knights are a bit problematic beacause the early ones equipped with only chainmail tend to defeat the late knights in plate armor due to the fact armor is mostly meaningless in this game.
The mods for this game deserve a separate review because some of them fix almost all issues the base game has.",1597039931,1597039931,False,3,1,0.507269144058227539,5,True,False,False,76561198046722489,81,4,7702,0,7702,1591736178,,

14,73806235,english,"[i]Medieval II: Total War[/i] is one of the best Total War games. The game looks amazing, oozes charm, has incredible gameplay, and the best collection of DLC.

Medieval 2 looks absolutely amazing. Even decades later the graphics and art still hold up. The game is colorful, and all of the textures are smooth. The amount of depth behind each unit has yet to be matched. Knights wear personalized crests, and their armor becomes more complex over the course of the game. Plain levies are replaced by late medieval and even renaissance era units with age appropriate clothing for every faction.  

Medieval 2 has alot of minor details that add up to make something special. Build an early game armor building?  The specific units that have been given the upgrades will have leather armor added to their models the battle map. Each historical event and agent action is given a narrated cut scene that gives the game an amazing amount of charm. Even the pre-battle speeches are customized based on the campaign map and tactical map situations. The tension and excitement built up by these speeches works well with the fast-paced action music of Jeff van Dyck. 

The gameplay of Medieval 2 is simply perfect due to its constantly changing balance. Every faction is specialized, and that specialization evolves over the course of the game. The meta of most of the  game is cavalry, but every region of the world uses different kinds of cavalry and has varying dependence on cavalry depending on the era. The whole world sees the slow rise of professional infantry that counters cavalry and armor in different ways. The constantly evolving meta of this game is not seen in many other Total War game, and the fact that nearly every faction is viable is almost never seen. 

The DLC of Medieval 2 adds hundreds of hours of fun gameplay. The Teutonic, and Third Crusade campaigns put the heaviest of knights against armies that rely on lighter units. The Americas and Britannia campaigns put heavy cavalry against armies based around large numbers of  unarmored infantry. Each campaign has several factions, and multiple historical events without straying from being sandbox experiences. 

Thousands of hours can be added to this game by mods. Medieval 2 has one of the best modding communities. Mods such as the Lord of the Rings mod, and Warhammer mod are still played due to the amount of effort that has been put into crafting them.

I purchased MTW2 Definitive Ed on steam because I wanted to play Stainless Steel 6.4. After purchase I installed SS 6.4 by following Zachman1201's guide on Moddb. 

But after installing I get the message - ""Unable to locate Kingdoms.exe Is Kingdoms .exe in your MTW2 folder?""

If you like Real Time Strategy and/or Turn Based Strategy Games, you'll love Medieval II: Total War as it combines aspects of both Genres and does it really well. 
You can either choose fighting battles (only Real Time) or playing a campaign (Real Time and Turn Based). 

In campaign mode you can choose one of 5 playable factions (more may be unlocked). Everyting except Battles is handled in Turn Based Mode. You manage cities, build buildings, train troops, forge alliances and move your armies and various agents. Each faction has its own goals. (for example; conquer Rome as Leader of the Holy Roman Empire).

The battles themselves are very engaging. The game features about 300 different types of soldiers which are recruited and controlled as whole unit with multiple soldiers (eg. an English Longbowman unit consists of 48 soldiers, a French Mailed Knight unit of 36 knights).
There are many factors that can decide a battle; Size and quality of you army, strategy, terrain, morale, weather, ...
Land battles also include sieges, where the attacker has to breach the gates/walls of the defenders city/stronghold with siege equipment while the defender enjoys additional protection from their walls and towers. If the attacker doesn't want to risk a siege, they can always try to starve the defenders out.
Sea battles can only be auto-resolved. 

The campaign never gets boring, even if you control multiple large cities and huge armies, historical events like the plague or the invasion of the Huns may foil your plans for world domination.

The game comes with great soundtracks (James Vincent, Jeff van Dyck, Richard Vaughan) and has pretty decent graphics considering its release cate (2006) and the vast number of soldiers.

It's one of the biggest titles in the Total War Franchise and in my opinion a must-play for strategy-fans.",1356273968,1595507414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198002571907,945,7,14888,0,14565,1561069368,,

You can immerse yourself in a particular historical setting in mods like Broken Crescent or inhabit well-known fantasy universes such as Westeros, Tamriel or Hyrule that are almost fully realised representations of their licensed counterparts.

I would especially recommend the Stainless Steel total conversion mod for a more polished experience than the vanilla campaign and Third Age Total War: Divide and Conquer for a beautiful rendition of Tolkein's world with some really interesting factions and unique mechanics.

Highly recommended.

However, if you have only ever played Rome total war 1 (not the  crappy Rome 2) then you will find this game to be completely different. You make way less income per turn and your armies seem to cost so much more than they would in Rome 1. Not to mention that units in this game will often times fight to the bitter end, unlike in Rome 1 where units could break very quickly. So just be aware of how different this game is compared to Rome 1, but the cities/castles are gorgeous. The Pope/crusade/jihad mechanics are awesome. The Mongol invasion is a super challenging and enjoyable event in the game. Units are incredibly detailed and look lovely and real. Unlike Rome 1 where every soldier in that unit looked the exact same, there is a lot of variety in the unit models. I would argue that since you make so much less cash in this game compared to Rome 1, a good way to challenge yourself is to try Very hard/Very hard for the campaign to see just how grueling the game can really be. Not to mention that the faction Milan is a DICK and will always declare war on you regardless of where/what factions you happen to be. Also archers in this game are insane and you should invest in them early. Even peasant archers can mess up a body guard unit if they are up on a castle wall. All this said, wait for a sale and play this game as long as you have a nice setup and enjoy the game on high resolution for all the graphic settings and you will have a game where you feel like an evil leader of a genocidal faction, killing all that even try to stand in your way.

While I prefer the medieval setting the most, the gameplay is frankly inferior to the likes of Shogun 2. It's hard to recommend Medieval 2 when there are better options available.

Overall, I'll give Medieval 2 a:

14,72204985,english,"I originally bought this game as a kid on CDs and got tired of keeping track of my physical copy and Disc Code and all that nonsense half the people on Steam now probably don't even remember. It's been the only Total War game I've ever needed. I tend to boot it up every couple of years and spend a couple dozen hours on a full Grand Campaign. It's real fun.

I'd say if you've never played this type of strategy game before, this is a cool place to start. You've got all of Europe to conquer, and the map stretches all the way to the Holy Land and late game to the Americas. If you don't want to get stressed trying to micromanage where your officer units are and how to keep every city maintained, you can turn off the stipulation that a castle/town needs a governor for you to build things, change taxes, etc. The battle system is fun, with a kind of rock, paper, scissors between cavalry, spearmen, and archers. But it can get way more complex than that when you factor in light vs heavy cavalry, artillery units, armored knights that can shrug off a ton of arrows, etc. It's cool.

If you HAVE played this genre a ton, you'll know more than me. But obviously I've enjoyed this game for years, so the potential for fun is there. And during sales it's like $5, so worth the gamble. If you think you'll like it you probably will.

Oh and final note: personally I think the voice acting is hilarious. There's this Chivalry/Dread system and it means your officers will come across as either pompous dolts or sadistic jerks. Like if your unit can't move any more that turn it'll either be ""We must make camp until morning, sire."" OR ""I'VE TRIED WHIPPING THEM, SIRE! ...but the men are spent.""",1594093591,1594093591,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056972440,354,3,15318,401,14749,1601958108,,

Pros

#1.Still cool that you can kill a king on the battlefield

#2.Gives an idea of expensive funding a war can be

#3.Still a lot of strategy needed to win


Cons

#1.Graphics are starting to look old and will be a deal breaker for some new players

#2.The price is $24.99 for this game full price.The game is 13 years old even though some will love this game you can get some newer games for that price

#3.The AI can be really stupid at times 


The Bottom Line -

Still a good strategy game as those who love it could literally put 1000 hours or more into it.I had a roommate this was his favorite game.

With its older graphics and being 13 years old I would say it is worth about $10.Get it on a steam sale not knowing if some total wars ever go on sale.

28,71117334,english,"This is a great game.  It was a great game when it was released fourteen years ago and age hasn't wearied it greatly.

   I've played Total War since the first Shogun Total War.  The first two editions (Shogun and the first Medieval) were far more abstract with provinces like chess board squares where only one army can be based.

   This game is the sequel to Rome Total War which changed to the more realistic maps of the present games.

   Firstly this game dates from the Golden Age of the series where when you bought the game you bought the game - rather than now where you buy 75% of it with the rest added as comparatively over priced DLC later.

   What the Total War games did was to satisfy the fantasy of every child (okay - mainly boys) who wanted their toy soldiers to actually march and fight.  So the game balances province management - which buildings to build or upgrade - with strategic - which of your forces to deploy where - and the tactical.

   The tactical matters with weather and terrain having a significant impact on troop performance as well as the presence of  your family member commanders.  The ""Gladiator"" tactic of softening up the enemy with missiles and artillery, pinning them with a frontal infantry attack and then hitting them from the rear with a heavy cavalry charge holds good here.

   The enemy AI is good enough not to be a total embarrassment but poor enough that you can win battles when heavily outnumbered.

   The scope of the game is huge and by the time you have ten or more provinces managing them all becomes mentally taxing.

   In game the main impediment to your slaughter (as a Catholic nation which in Medieval times was most of Europe) is the Pope.  The Pope generally doesn't like Catholics slaughtering each other when they could be slaughtering Muslims.  Lose enough popularity with the Pope and you will be excommunicated which means you'll lose most trade and every Catholic nation on the map will be able to attack you freely.  Avoid the Pope's displeasure by building chapels, churches, abbeys, and cathedrals.  Also use Priest agents to convert the population to Catholicism and burn witches.  Medieval times were brutal with notions of human rights barely acknowledged and even less adhered to and the game matches that brutality.

   Fourteen years on the game still looks good.  The game's concept and execution are both solid with some of the more irritating aspects of other games (Barbarian factions in a Rome Total War expansion) not present here.

   There are some minor irritations.  Naval combat is a pure numbers game (the video rather cheekily is showing Napoleon Total War not this game) which if you're used to the naval battles of Empire and Shogun 2 is a bit retrograde.  Heading from England by boat Crusade troops still desert even if you are going as fast as you can (which is obviously not in a straight line).  Brothels and inns which help with keeping the population happy and spawn spy and assassin units have transformed my once proud family of holy warriors into a bunch of alcoholic freaks who aren't siring children.

   But these as said are minor irritations.  This is a great game but a massive thief of time.  This is a game that's going to take you upwards of 50 hours to complete one campaign if you fight every battle.  

  And as for price ?  Next week in the Summer sale it will probably cost you £5.00.  It's definitely worth that.

If you seen through the nostalgia addled narrative of the fanboys. Factions in Med2 are hardcoded to wage war against the player if he's reached their borders, there's no way around it. You share borders with anyone and they will make war. The Pope will punish you for fighting against invaders and excommunicate you if you don't let them take your lands. Then they can wage war against you without repercussions and even increase their standing with the Pope because they are fighting against ""heretics"" and no one will make peace and there's a lot of public unrest. You might even get crusades called on you. You can try to get one of your holy men be elected Pope, but it doesn't matter, he'll do the same thing as before. That's why playing as a Christian faction is one of the worst experiences in all of Total War.

55,70897357,english,"A great deal of fun! If you are into strategy, history generally and the medieval era in Europe and Western Asia in particular, you will likely enjoy this. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially if you have never played an RTS style battle that is based more on real movement than the unnatural, superhuman motion of most game characters. Initially, moving my cavalry into position to charge and then their doing so seemed to take far too long. I would often abandon such tactics, thinking I had messed them up, because everything didn't happen at once. You have to let your line battle it out and take casualties while you set up such a maneuver. This is natural to a general, less so to a gamer (at least, in my case). Please bear in mind that I am no strategy or RTS expert, and your experience will likely be far smoother if you are.

I am, however, a huge enthusiast of history, and while there are many inaccuracies (necessary perhaps for gameplay's sake in many cases) it still does a wonderful job of creating a medieval battlefield unlike any other I have seen. Seeing the Normans heavy cavalry, Turkish horse archers and Latin knights battling it out alongside hundreds of archers, infantry and other assorted combatants was thrilling just to behold. Managing my nation's growing realms was satisfying, though the bizarre way aging and the passage of time are left unaligned was disappointing. I imagine a mod or fix is available to change it, however, though I have not looked yet.

The best part today, perhaps, is the price. When I bought it on sale I got the 'definitive edition' for under $10, and this sale seems to reappear extremely often. I have played 145 hours thus far, and have not come close to trying all the game has to offer! At such a price, I wholeheartedly recommend it unless you hate the time period, strategy games or RTS-style battles.

Interesting system with General traits, makes your generals kinda feel like real people, and I always love to read the different descriptions for their stats (dread, authority, etc) and their traits.
Kinda diverse factions, having Europeans, Middle Eastern, Americas, Teutonics..

Very good music to fit the action, the only better in this is Rome TW.
Characters behave like they are in a war
 
The bad:
If you're pretty good the AI is kinda dumb. 
The campaing gets a bit boring mid to late game if you dont have imagination to run your story
Game often prioritizes Western European factions to everyone else, for example Turks, Egypt and Moors dont have general speeches. Neither do Orthodox Christians. Native American factions dont have Level 5 or 4 cities or any forts, which is disappointing but understandable.
Somewhat racist and inaccurate historically, but they did their best i guess.

Medieval 2 has a fantastic modder community that makes it something of a 'gary's mod' to the total war franchise- many of the mods are frankly receive far more love than most total war games frankly, and Divide and Conquer is arguably one of the best).

THIS IS THE STORY OF ALF THE LUCKY, THE WORLDS GREATEST HOBBIT FARMER/GENERAL.

-Starts a new campaign. Decides to play as Bree-land
-Bree-land is basically the town of Bree and a couple of hobbit villages
-Turns out being rural countryfolk makes you poor; can barely field any troops
-Turns out countryfolk also don't make the best troops; basically fielding rag-tag archers and men/hobbits with pitchforks
-Scout the area with my generals (including Brave Sir Alf the Hobbit) and struggling to really do anything, with the Remnants of Angmar encroaching to the north and Duneledings to the south
-Suddenly Alf gets attacked by orcs just south of bree; however allied dunedain rangers are nearby 
-Brave Sir Alf and his small halfling milita make a stand against the orcs whilst waiting for the rangers
-Doesn't work out so well, turns out orcs are a lot stronger than hobbits
-Running on tiny legs, the last remaining halflings leg it in the direction of the rangers
-Turns out orcs are faster than halflings
-The halflings are getting cut down as they flee
-Just a dozen hobbits are left, but the rangers can be seen on the other side of the hill. The remnants of the troop make a last stand so their general can escape
-Brave Sir Alf he ran away
-Bravely ran away, away!
-When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled!
-Yes, brave Sir Alf turned about and gallantly he chickened out!
-Bravely taking to his feet, he beat a very brave retreat!
-Bravest of the brave, Sir Alf!
-Alf, now the ONLY hobbit left alive reaches the dunedain rangers
-Turns out rangers are a lot stronger than orcs and turn them into pork pies
-Alf sits quietly in a corner sucking his thumb surrounded by rangers as the battle ends
-With the orcs gone, Alf is awarded the village of Mengalen (it seems the orcs which attacked previously occupied it)
-As such, Alf is dubbed 'Alf the Lucky'. Also turns out Alf is a farmer with a massive pumpkin
-Some 50 turns pass. The Dunedain keep the remnants of Angmar at bay, whilst Breelands ally with the Enedwaith to the south to take on the Duneledings. A slow and painful advance ensues, but eventually both the Breelanders and Enedwaith gain ground, with Bree even taking the Duneleding capital of Dun Larach (with Alf's help).
-Seeing victory imminent, Alf heads a large army (still made up mostly of farmers) from Dun Larach to the east
-The duneledings make a last stand, causing a a full stack of their top tier units to appear north of Alf's farm squad. 
-They immediately siege Dun Larach.
-Dun Larach quickly falls back to the duneledings. It becomes very apparent this Duneleding horde threatens the very exsistence of the Breelands; Alf has the only army of any size and they are mostly bottom-tier troops
-Now completely cut off, there was only one thing to do: 
-Brave Sir Alf he ran away
-Bravely ran away, away!
-The duneleding death army tries to engage Alf's farm squad but they retreat further north, on the bridge just south of the Breelander-occupied town of Tharbad
-The Duneledings engage again, forcing Alf to make a last stand on the bridge
-Alf's angry pitchfork boys desperately hold the bridge whilst archers rain hell on the angry enemy horde
-The town's small garrison arrives as the Duneledings are breaking through, bolstering the defence
-45 minutes of battle ensues. As the archers run out of arrows one by one they join the fray but the Duneledings don't buckle
-With almost all of Bree's forces killed Alf charges in on the Duneleding flank, taking out the enemy general. However, with no arrows left the remaining Breelanders are no match for the duneledings are are slaughtered. Just 27 men make it make to Tharbad. The Duneledings win a phyrric victory, losing 1700 of their 2000 troops, thus losing the ability to retake their lands.

Rest in Peace Alf the Lucky, Conqueror of Mengalen, Planter of Large Pumpkins and Saviour of the Breelands who didn't bravely run away at the battle of Tharbad Bridge.

Stainless Steel for an enhanced version of the base game,

For a very, very long time I considered Medieval 2 to be the best entry in the Total War series. That is no longer the case, but only barely so. (The new king is Shogun 2: Total War, by the way.) Medieval 2 still stands very near the top, with some of the most engaging gameplay in the genre, in both real-time and turn-based modes. In most regards, Medieval 2 has aged very well, and still looks fantastic in 2020, but be aware that certain mechanics feel a bit dated. The camera controls, in particular, come across as fairly clumsy, and the naval mechanics are little more than an afterthought.

While the vanilla campaign is very solid, I would still strongly recommend new players try out the Stainless Steel mod, which improves almost every aspect of the game--most crucially faction AI, unit balance, and the campaign map--which is made much larger and more complex.

Beyond the vanilla campaign there are two particular aspects of Medieval 2 to be aware of.

First: the modding scene is fantastic. There are numerous expansive total conversion mods out there that make Medieval 2 the ultimate Total War sandbox. Some of these, like Stainless Steel, vastly improve the original game, whereas many others completely transform the Medieval 2 into something else, built around various fictional settings like the Lord of the Rings, the Legend of Zelda, Game of Thrones, and so on. Subsequent Total War games would prove much less open to modding, making Medieval 2 the last, best place for awe-inspiring total conversions.

Second: I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention the ""Kingdoms"" expansion. It's, uh, it's bad. Really bad. It purports to add the American continent(s) to the campaign map and introduce a number of Native American factions as well. The native representation, such that it is, is problematic in about all of the ways you might expect; the and the added continent at the strategy level is laughably bad. They didn't even try to model the actual geography of the Americas: instead it's only a rough approximation of the ""new world,"" that feels empty and pointless to explore/conquer. Thankfully the original, vanilla game is exceedingly excellent, so it doesn't matter too much. But, still, it bears mentioning.

20,51335215,english,"I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good Medieval Period strategy game or to Total War fans who missed this title. This is basically Rome in Middle Ages with some changes here and there. Historical period spans from 1080 to 1530 with more than a hundred European regions to conquer and a cool little detail like the discovery of a New World.

I like the much simpler map style compared with the newer TW entries. The UI is very straightforward and easy to use. Units have a good variety and a nice visual armor upgrades through better smith buildings. Vast and detailed city and castle settlements on battle maps are a big plus. Excellent modding capabilities. Very pleasing soundtrack. 

Some negative points are the weak and glitchy diplomacy, two-handed weapons bug and not so smart AI. I'd personally prefer the game to gradually remove older period units. It would be nice if the game had at least two different time periods to start the campaign like in Medieval 1 because most people finish playing much earlier than 1530 and never truly use late game units which is a shame. Stability was pretty good for me on Windows 10 and the only bad thing were the fps spikes with structural destruction while playing sieges.

In my opinion, Medieval 2 is the best game ever brought out of the Total War Series even though the economic system isn't as powerful as it's in the later games but reflects accurately the Medieval era, especially during the hundred years war.

First off, let's start with a trick: If you change a bit one of the .ini files, you'll have the possibility to play nearly every faction, even the Papal States.

Combat is also different from faction to faction as every faction has unique unites which have to be used differently.

The graphic is decent and the accurateness of the historical references and units awesome. There are actually multiple ways to play this game: from being a high warmonger to the sneaky king which loves to assassinate, sabotage and plunder.

Be careful of your choices as every one of them might influence your main characters. They will loose/gain traits, command points, loyalty, piety or chivalry/dread. Every one of this points will influence your city/fortress moral, growth, your troop or enemy moral.

Through merchants, blockades or sieges, religion and units in other countries, you can actually try to accomplish an economy warfare. Those people/units will gender unrest and corruption in foreign countries which can lead to rebellions.

By assassination you can actually delete some factions from the world surface.

Buildings which are damaged or from foreign culture will make people unrest. If you've the finances, repair or destroy them to avoid growing unhappiness.

There is one thing I actually miss from Medieval: Total War. It's the ability to assassinate your generals.",1589828650,1589828650,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198050534153,170,13,1544,0,1544,1541768030,,

22,69207256,english,"Absolutely amazing. The height of the Total War series in my opinion. Fixes several issues and bugs from Rome 1 while retaining the weight of two armies slamming into each other, something that I feel was lost with the new engine. Features a tutorial cutscene with graphics I'd consider amazing for the time, an excellent campaign, and several extensive scenarios like the Crusades, Teutonic wars, and colonization of America thanks to the Kingdoms expansion that comes with it for free in the Steam version.

The game begins a little after the Norman invasion of England (which is the tutorial), and goes on until the Age of Discovery, with musketmen and cannons being the final units you unlock. You can play as various nations from the High Middle Ages, from Scotland, France and the Holy Roman Empire all the way to Egypt and the Byzantine Empire. Some nations like Spain and Russia are there because I assume they didn't want them broken up into smaller, less flavorful factions. Every faction and faith has unique units and buildings. England has Yeoman Archers, the HRE has Gothic Knights, and the Byzantines have the Varangian Guard. Western Catholics can build Jousting Fairs while Muslims can build Shisha Bars and Racing Tracks. Spain has Bull Runs and the Byzantine Empire can build Roman style Public Baths and Aqueducts.

The campaign is turn-based, with you moving/training armies and constructing new buildings in your cities every turn. You can build farms courthouses to help your towns grow into sprawling metropolises, which is how you unlock the best buildings in the game, you can focus on building new military facilities to get powerful new units you can train, or build markets and dockyards to help trade and taxation pour money into your treasury. When two or more armies meet, the game shifts into a real-time strategy battle where you command your forces directly. You tell them where to move, when to fire and where to charge. The battles are the highlight of the Total War series, without them I'd bet it'd be an obscure series nowhere near the popularity of Civilization or Crusader Kings. It's the first time I've ever felt like I actually had total control over an army, with thousands of soldiers at my command. Setting up ambushes, taking a hill for your archers to fire from, and directing devastating charges with powerful mounted knights is something other strategy games simply fail to allow you the ability to do.

If everything the game and its expansions has to offer isn't enough for you, there's an almost endless array of free mods, from new factions and mechanics (Stainless Steel 6.4 and Grand Campaign), all the way to a brand new setting or world, like Broken Crescent's focus on the Middle East and Asia, and mods that change the game into a fantasy setting like AGoT, Elder Scrolls or LotR. You're playing the exact same game, but it feels like something completely new, every time.

You could play this game for thousands of hours, honestly. It's well worth the price, and during sales it can dip all the way to ten bucks, which is almost criminal. The Steam version also doesn't come with the strange graphically-caused crashes due to playing on a modern PC, like the disc version does.

You really shouldn't miss this one.",1589591591,1589591932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198021269329,129,6,37737,0,35610,1599761759,,

The game is the most moddable total war in existence. Lord of the Rings? Witcher? Westeros? Napoleonic Era? Ancient Era? Warhammer? Three kingdoms period? a world where santa claus rides a  T REX? Star fucking wars? These are just SOME of the mods avaible for this game.

No don't get me wrong, vanilla med 2 is still a game worth playing and offers tons of fun, but the strenght of this game is in its incredible modding community. This is worth 100x more than the Steam Price. Before steam i had this game, god knows how many hours i actually have in med 2...

Pros: There are more overhauls mods for the game than games in the Total War Franchise. Voice Over is funny as hell. Everyone can learn and have fun. 

Cons: Historically innacurate, unstable in modern computers and the AI is shit. ALL OF WHICH CAN BE FIXED FOR FREE.

Conclusion: You should buy this game if you are into downloading awesome mods. You should also buy because its incredibly fun even without mods. You should not buy if you're not into mods or is a history buff FANATIC that screams ""unrealistic"" at every damn movie, TV series and book you read on the middle ages.

If you like some nice archery slaughter, download the Third Age mod, play as Silvan elves , stack archers with a few spear men to handle any cavalry or infantry that manage to get close....and let the dopamine flow while you watch the bodies drop to the pleasant sound effect of arrows piercing armor and flesh.

The vanilla game covers such a big time span though that it cannot properly show all of the crusades or the Crusader kingdoms. For that, we have the Crusades campaign. It fully fleshes out the crusader kingdoms and gives them their own units. The same thing goes for the other expansions.

58,65403703,english,"One of the major selling points for Medieval II, for me personally, is that the pace is far slower than Shogun II, Rome II or Warhammer I. It is not that the game is *slow* but rather one does not feel constantly rushed to power play, or lose. It can also be a very difficult game. One slip up diplomatically, such as a careless excommunication can lead to other kingdoms dog-piling on you. 
Meaning, simplified, the game models the Catholic church as follows: kingdoms vote for a pope, who will come from one of the Catholic countries. The Pope will have favorites, and might pose e.g. ceasefires on warring Catholic factions, with either loss of favor or excommunication as a reward if the ceasefire is broken: excommunicated kingdoms face unrest and possibly Crusades by former Catholic friends. Pretty cool idea, even if the execution is a bit half-baked. 
One major thing for me is also the fact, that ranged units feel *heavy*-- it is not only the number of casualties which longbows or Italian crossbows can cause, but the feel for the weapons. What I disliked about Warhammer was, that archers in that game feel to be shooting pieces of straw. The feedback from hitting the enemy ranks is not there in Warhemmer TW. In Medieval II the sound effects for chain mail being pierced, and the fast moving arrows coming down as a cloud of death are on point. Fire rate is slow, and it makes perfect sense to keep auto fire off, as not to risk friendly fire and e.g. break a cavalry charge with a well timed volley. 
Melee tends to be messy, slow and exhausting, especially for modded, and higher difficulties. Generally, clean victories only come to the side who outmanoeuvres the enemy and gets to charge home to a flank with cavalry, or manages to split the hostile army and deal with the pockets one by one. 

Mods are Great for Medieval II. Highlights are probably Third Age: TW for the LotR theme, and the historical Stainless Steel. I like the very basic Darthmod, as there really is no need for total conversion-- vanilla has all the bits and pieces needed for a classic, just maybe in need for the community to fine tune somewhat. 

The game shows its age in sieges, where it is very difficult to get units off the walls (or on), and the same problem rears at times in field battles, as the unit AI needs some prodding to reform the line after combat. Cavalry sometimes abruptly slows its charge, or halts it entirely. 
Reinforcement mechanics can be irritating, as one needs to replenish units in a city, or a castle, which houses the appropriate production building. Very annoying, if taking an enemy city, and the AI has done very little military building. 

But the good by far outweighs the bad. Probably my preferred TW game, even if dated. Recommended!",1584716688,1585404081,True,29,0,0.770319640636444092,0,True,False,False,76561197978562969,601,23,13766,0,12276,1591456936,,

You do what happens in any Total War title, you build several armies, conquer settlements, and maintain an economy by building different military and civilian buildings at your settlements. Add keeping a small garrison of units there to keep the peace and ward off attackers, and you repeat these steps until you complete your objectives and win the campaign you have chosen. Each faction has a campaign with different objectives to be met. In terms of custom battles, create massive armies and have them fight to the death, literally. If your army is set to defend a fort or larger settlement, they will rout to the settlement center and not off the map. Bodies will stack, morale will wane, and your coffee cup will empty. But they all can be refilled in the next match. I highly recommend this game at it's current price to anyone who loves Total War games or RTS games in general.

No clunky skill trees destroying the pacing, no stupid diceroll events, no clunky half-baked wannabe-paradox bullshit when you just wanna be fighting battles and roleplaying as a medieval King. Did I mention the loading screens take 2 seconds on an SSD? This game gets you right in the action with no wasted breaths. 
 Become enemies with the Pope and feel the wrath of Christendom as you convert Europe to Islam with a vicious Jihad, or become his sword against the rising menace from the east. But wait, as you're squabbling, the Mongols are coming, so there's that. Yeah, this campaign is nonstop immersive perfection. Watch as your troops in battle actually acquire better armor when you give them armor upgrades on the campaign map.  Watch as your bannermen charge in to battle swinging their flags. Watch your army of shiny cavalry smash a bunch of stupid peasants into oblivion. It's great fun and before you know it, 10 hours have passed.
This game has the best pacing in the series, unhindered by excessive skill trees or diceroll events. Loading screens are quick, everything you do is fun and simple and yet deep and expressive. It has a vision and it perfects it.
Best speeches in the series, with dynamic traits and rivalries between factions that alter the dialogue (also changes the dialogue during diplomacy in the strategic) Best campaign map gameplay.

79,64664219,english,"The goods :

- The game has a smooth learning curve where you progressively unlock unit types and are afforded time to familiarize with their strenght and counters.
- Random trait accumulation from your characters make your characters become better at what you use them to do, and worse at what you don't use them to do. This sometimes prompt you to make decisions that are sub-optimal hoping your characters can get an edge for later on.
- Charging an heavy cavalry unit into an ennemy flank and watching foes go flying everywhere never gets old (and I would know, I played 4000 hours of this).
- Good faction variety.
- Excellent mod support.
- Will probably be runnable by your machine.

The bad : 

- Battle UI is decidedly worse than in later titles of the same franchise (but the battle engine itself is better)
- Your favorite characters keep dying of old age (though you might like this)
- Ennemy factions eventually fold easily to your mid-game armies, which might mean you won't get much use of your shiny late-game units (which is fixed by playing any of the Kingdom expansion which make the late-game units appear earlier).
- Getting to the most exciting part of the campaign where you start winning but you aren't just crushing everyone yet takes time and doesn't last very long.

Whilst you can mod the game, the gameplay itself feels not only very underwhelming but also unsatisfying. Building system and Army recruitment are to put it simply: annoying. There is no fun in it, it feels more like a hinderance than anything really!

The best total war game. The most fun. It's perfectly balanced between fun strategy (ranking up priests to convince the Pope to call a Crusade to trick France into sending one of its armies away so you can take Alsace/Lorraine (as Denmark) to the mindless, stupid fun of watching your general give a unique pre-battle speech based on your faction, the opponent, and his own personality (like creative insults). Also, each agent gets a video for attempting a mission. And also cavalry impact is the best of any total war game.

Reader: Play this Total War game first. It's simple to pick up, the colors are pretty, and it's easy to like.

Caveats/bugs: merchants are underpowered, two-handed weapons don't work, and mod support is not available through Steam.

Edit 1: Let me rephrase after accumulating my thoughts a bit more. This is TRULY a piece of shit game.

Edit 2: I can't believe how rubbish this game is. The controls are trash. The unit response is trash. The overall gameplay is trash. You're trash. Multiplayer is dead and so will you once you buy this game and drown in regret.

Edit 3: This game at its current state is ABSOLUTELY unplayable and the only people who could truly like such a piece of shit game are neckbeard autists with nostalgia of being in their mother's basement for 20 years. Ultimately, this game is 100% T R A S H and if you buy this so called """"""game"""""" then you've clearly wasted it.

Edit 4: So you release a so called """"""Definitive Edition"""""" which is nothing more than an old DLC pack which should have been included with the base game to begin with and no model 4K overhauls or anything else fancy as seen in other games that got their definitive editions? What a joke.

Edit 5: It boggles my mind how TERRIBLE every single aspect of this garbage is. All the positive reviews are fake and literally no one is playing the game except for faggots like you who have no drive to explore other games and got stuck with a single shitty """"""game"""""" like this one just because it happened to fall into your mother's basement where you reside like a disgusting cave troll by chance. It is a fucking joke that anyone should even pay a cent to suffer through this god awful experience and rather people should be paid to even unfortunately waste a single minute into this rubbish in mental damages.

3,62462298,english,"Honestly the best Total war game made, even 13 years later. Medieval 2 takes the best features from Rome and improves on them, adding more features to improve on the not so great parts of Rome. The campaign is more rewarding when you play it for longer instead of the monotonous routine of Rome, Get strong, Get 10 pop with people, Start civil war, take Rome, take rest of map. Medieval 2 puts more effort into making you think ""Do i want to do this yet"" based on variables such as the pope and Crusading. The addition Of the horde factions makes it so you don't just conquer a territory and never lose it, providing you to think more about strategy and Consequences. Diplomacy is lacking, which is to be expected with the Earlier total war games which were very battle and army orientated. The graphics are impressive for a game made in 2006 and i would argue better than empire, the game after it in the series. My one big gripe with the game was the Activation of the Americas campaign, which comes much to late, leaving only one faction to take part in this big scramble that CA intended it to be, most of the factions have either been destroyed or are too weak economic wise to send armies to america. If you would like a first experience into a Total war game, i recommend this or Rome 1 , as both games leave you wanting more.",1580058686,1580058686,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198448274382,27,2,6605,0,6085,1587478965,,

46,62211046,english,"It definitely has a learning curve but if you've played other Total War games, you're certainly in for a treat.

The graphics hold up nicely even in 2020 (sure, max zoom can make things look a big low-poly and the textures could use with a little highter res).

Sound is OK. The music is fun but gets old relatively fast. The sound effects show some age but they were highly polished by then's standards and still are relevant and don't get annoying easily.

The interface is a bit clunky and some shortcuts are missing, especially if you are a micromanaging beast like me (the roster that lists your units doesn't allow you to filter, order or do mass-actions and if you deal with one character, you'll have to open it all up again and scroll all over again. Gets tedious late game).

The multiple campaigns with different maps are food for those who crave for more when they're done with the main europe/north africa/middle east region. Americas and Crusades really add good variety and the maps are fun to play. Highly recommended.

This has immense replayability, especially when you realise how powerful diplomats, spies and assassins really are. After all, warfare is not exclusively about troops and siege contraptions! Going for 100% religious unity is also a great challenge for those already accostumed to regular play.

Do yourself a favor and play it on easy and auto-resolve all battles. The real fun in the total war franchise is the empire administration. If you want a truly in-depth troops field management experience, refer to more established RTS's such as Starcraft, Empire Earth and the ""Age Of ..."" options. This is 4X at its best and definitely one of the most compelling installments of all Total War.

It has a smaller number of factions then compared to something like Rome 2, but the factions are more varible in this game, in my opinion. It also, in my opinion, can help keep a player engaged for longer times because it has preset goals, and as times move on curcimstances change, from things like the Mongol invasion to the discovering of America in game.

70,61202233,english,"Total War is a franchise that practically sells itself: massive battle lines of hundreds or thousands of soldiers fighting in highly tactical combat with the added bonus of specialized troops, upgrades etc based on your ability as an administrator. But I am going to sell you on Medieval 2, specifically, not Total War in general.
For the first quarter of the game you are an impoverished country pitting your militias against enemy levies of militias in this part of the game bows will sufficiently murder just about anything that is within range, to say nothing of your general's elite heavy cavalry who, at this point in the game, can kill an entire army even when outnumbered 10 to one. 
The next quarter hits you with a twist: the Mongols have arrived to MURDER EVERYTHING. You think you're safe in your castles and cities? Think again. You think you're okay marching your army through the open map? Absolutely not. For hundreds of years the massive and terrifying might of the mongols can hold your entire focus--fighting the mongols in direct combat is as bad or worse than fighting the entire rest of the world. But you learn and you grow. Your elites start to clash with theirs.
Gunpowder rears its head and changes the game dynamic in two major ways: 1) armor is entirely useless against a gunpowder wielding army. Armored units are slow and even steel plate armor doesn't provide adequate protection the thundering might of a gun line. 2) The dominant force of power shifts on its head. Where once your heavily armored elite troops recruited from castles were your mightiest and fiercest soldiers, now the militia trained from your largest cities hold sway over the battlefield. Even the most poorly equipped troops in cities have their uses; if they can hold the enemy in place long enough for your muskets to fire another volley, the militia has more than earned their keep and if even half of your cloth armored, spear holding militia troops die, the cost of training a new unit is dwarfed by the cost of the enemy training new heavily armored sword wielding elite infantry. 
Now that you can recruit gunpowder units you have a huge advantage over your enemies and can bowl over everyone else with superior technology, aye? No. Right around the time where you are able to recruit gunpowder units in earnest from a few of your wealthiest cities, the Black Plague hits and everything goes south. Every unit you have trained starts leaking men as they fall to the horror of contagion. Thousands die, then tens of thousands until you're losing 50,000 citizens in a single turn from the plague and all the while trade suffers and you're suddenly bankrupt and have to slowly rebuild. And if you're lucky, you've rebuilt enough to take on the legacy of Timur the Lame and his war elephants who literally carry cannons on their backs and are incredibly difficult to kill. Medieval 2 uses real crises and events from history to balance the game. You can't ever feel like you're doing too well because there is always going to be something to keep you on your toes or some new horizon to shoot for. Alliances are fickle and end often. Wars more often than not last until one side is completely eradicated. This offers two styles of play: Kill everything with massive armies until no one lives but you and your kingdom, or establishing solid borders in a few key cities and expanding outward in rings of increasing size, simply marching out your men from the cities you've owned for 100 years to garrison your next city. 
Gunpowder is exciting and horrible and seeing its effect makes you long for the simple days of sword to sword combat, but generally this is only when you're on the receiving end. On the offense it's both satisfying and almost disappointing--somber even--to see the elite heavily armored infantry of your enemy falling in scores to your marksmen, or seeing the enemy kings, princes, emperors and their descendants falling one by one to cannon fire. Medieval 2 is a satisfying game with strong design choices that was well thought out and certainly stands the test of time. It is both in setting and overall execution, my favorite of the Total War games not just because it immerses you in the setting, but because it shows you a complete story ripped from the pages of history books without a word of dialogue to explain the developer's stance.

The AI could be improved particularly when you bring an army to support you and they are set to an aggressive stance which results in what can only be that the AI is actually just got their army standing a bit aggresively in their lines as they watch back to let the play get on with the work, occasionally they will pop in at the end of the battle just to check all is well.

I enjoy the different factions and the addition of the kingdoms adds a refreshing change that allows you to focus on one area of war across the world. This game also has massive mod support and there are many very well designed including LOTR and Game of thrones.

We fought on Seine (the river that runs through Paris). I put my car in a block. Then... we begin.

Let me preface this with I am not a stranger to Total War but what I witnessed today... it changed me. 

I charge my men into his pikemen heavy lines, causing me to say ""oh shit!"" He laughs, thinking he has won. Then, he unleashes his secret weapon: a torrent of flame from his bombards. A dozen Mongols go down. I yell ""Oh No! KILL IT!"". I target his cannons, hoping to break his pikemen with less than 3/4 losses. Soon, my horses turn to hornets, swishing and swashing left and right faster and faster. I could practically feel the friction piercing my screen. My friend looks on in horror, scream and praying to his God, only to be answered with deaf ears. Soon, droves of pikes lay on the ground as a hoard of hornet like Asians bum tickle his lines deeper and deeper. Like a hot knife through butter, I smash his lines and vanquish his cannons.

24,59787205,english,"When you think of Medieval II Total War, you think Classic Turn-based Strategy! This game is one of my favourite strategy games of all time despite being released in 2006, it recaptures its nostalgic feel and the reminiscence of playing a Grand Campaign game for many hours on end. I have previously owned the game on a CD (hence why so little game time as I am writing this), and I couldn't be more pleased that it is accessible on Steam! The variety is great with many different factions being composed of numerous units and a game plan that is forged upon these units (e.g. the Faction of Byzantines has a heavy amount of Missile Cavalry or Spain with its early-game skirmishers) Soon, you begin to prefer certain units or Generals over others and forge alliances which decide your preference of friends and foes. Crusades are quite interesting since they allow you to open a new theater as well as new lands for your kingdom and later invasions of many new factions (I'm not going to spoil for those who didn't play it yet) allow for constant immersion and a more interesting challenge. My favourite part of this game are the battles. The very well-known aspect of every Total War game. They are immersive, strategical and decisive (especially on harder difficulties) and a range of tactics and battle plans can be approached within them, some more successful and some less. It is interesting to see the superpowers of the Medieval era to battle it out on the land of a field in the middle of Europe. There are only two disadvantages to Medieval II Total War. Firstly, the more important one, is the price right now on Steam. I bought the game for around £20.00 and that is quite a hefty price for a game released almost 13 years ago (I understand it's a classic)! Secondly, the naval warfare is very boring as there is no real battle simulation to them, only odds (however I do remember it did not work out so well for certain Total War games when this was implemented).",1576268187,1576268187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198272232335,17,3,4906,1385,906,1601632100,,

The battles are different every time and are a perfect mix of action and thought. A perfect real time strategy with a nice turn based campaign.
The campaign, while simple, is a nice challenge on the harder difficulties while still feeling fair. 

Normally in a review I would make a pros and cons list, but this game has so, so, so many pros and very few cons. 

This game becomes a different beast with mods. I have spent hours on the Call of Warhammer mod. This games overhaul mods make a game already with possible thousands of hours of content, infinite. 

You will not be disappointed. This game is now cheap, will run on almost any computer (it even works on my crappy laptop). It still looks great. It can still look even though its more than a decade old. 

The only con I can think of is how, no matter how many mods you try. All campaigns (Vanilla and Modded) feel very similar. There isn't much uniqueness (even in the fantasy mods). Even in the different periods its the same thing, it sometimes feels like a grind to recruit units and march them. 

Don't let that distract you from this amazing game. I have put almost 400 hours into this game and only get burned out after days on end of playing. When I first got this game I couldn't put it down, 120 hours in the first month or so.

Any strategy fan should have this no matter what, any total war fan probably already has this. Any big fan of the medieval era or a world that is supported via a mod should have this game. 

Basically if you are interested in this at first glance you'll at least think its cool, at most fall in love like I did.

 If you don't like strategy then maybe it isn't for you. One of the best strategy games ever made is still a strategy game.

Highly Recommend!

32,58070365,english,"          Firstly I'd like to start with giving this game a 5/5 even though there is some small things that could have been better. The reason it will still be a 5/5 game in my opinion is because of the games core mechanics and the way it plays and what it has to offer for me to have reached this one thousand hours of playing review/recommend post. Now to some of the minor dislikes that i hope to see addressed in greater depth and detail in future titles. Such as a Medieval 3 anyone. Before I start let me say the developers had a vision they executed it and turned out an endless amount of simulated medieval combat that will keep me entertained for a thousand plus more hours of playing. One, the AI on the campaign (even in great mods like stainless steel) are poorly developed and easy to beat. And that's unfortunate. They suicide charge every pitch battle. You literally have to do nothing but set up a defensive formation and let their soldiers sprint all the way your way and throw themselves on you. Hold fast then swing around your cavalry and done. Then you have the pain of the AI jumping around the map with tiny pathetic forces to pester you and your holdings. If they are going to attack you they should be more strategic and tactful with how they assault the player. If they lay you to siege they never mount the walls. You confront them from within they slink back and you have to chase them. This mechanic could have been more. That's really it on gripes honestly just some poorly designed AI. They could have taken the strategy portion of their idea and actually turned up the dial a bit. Instead of a highly difficult and rewarding campaign that had more depth. I would share my ideas on that but this is getting long enough as is. You get a sandbox build army go destroy every poorly disciplined nation around you without much thought and really quickly and complete the goals of the campaign within set amount of turns. So the strategy here is to go beat face around the map like a madman quickly. The game needs campaign goals but more drawn out. If the game is 1000+ turns in that's cool too. It's really my play style talking here. If people like the run around quickly go for it. I like to watch my kingdom grow become successful and go to war when and where i will. I don't need to take every place i assault. Sometimes i've taken to giving those territories to allies or weak nations, or hell even the pope. I once as England conquered the whole of Italy sacked all of the settlements and gave them to the church. Growing the Papal States into a formidable faction. That was fun try that sometime. And you can do the same thing in the Islamic countries. Anyway to wrap this up it's a fun game giving untold number of hours of entertainment and keeps you playing. Quick battles, Historical ""attempts"" battles, the campaign itself trying new ways to entertain yourself around some sloppy AI. And still manage to have fun. Mods like Stainless Steel (Especially this one because it's the best that stays to medieval and gives the vanilla a face lift  the developers need to take note from), and any of the themed  mods to spice it up are all what contributes to this being a 5/5 recommended title and franchise to play. And if you are entering this style of game as a first timer start here with this title at a fair and awesome price tag for access to hopefully your newest addiction. Start vanilla then go mod crazy and have fun.",1574829767,1574829767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198181891261,18,1,67885,1551,60025,1601610280,,

42,57510759,english,"I dont know what can be said about this game. It is in my eyes, a Timeless Classic. Without question. The game in vanilla form is a diverse experience with multiple nations to play as. The expansions offer smaller versions of the same great grand campaign but with a handful of select and new nations. These games are often games that are played with much anticipation but due to such a grand scale, players can often feel as if they're ""running out of gas"" when playing. Adopting an external mindset of ""role playing"" can totally help invigorate even the most veteran of players. ( An example would be playing say the ""crusader expansion"" and adopting ruthless Templar behavior and playing as those individuals would.)  Now if all the vanilla offerings and personal role playing isn't enough, there is sure to be a mod out there for you. From Lord of the Rings to Warhammer and even some Game of Thrones mods (i believe)....there are tons. You may need to utilize google to help with installing such mods, it can be arduous but worth the pay off. A lot of mods even have ""sub mods"" which add even more content to Total Conversions like the Lord of the Rings mods. The graphics are for the most part dated and key configurations may be dated to some as well... but simply put it is well worth the grand strategy and hands on battles the game has to offer. This can be said for a lot of the Total War games. Regardless of their releases, bugs, lack of content, etc, there exits mods, fixes, solutions for just about anything. At 149 hours in under a year, I have undoubtedly surpassed the time spent playing recently compared to when the game debuted and I fell in love with it back in 05-06.

Summary: TW:ME has a mix of game styles which is refreshing. If you enjoy the Civilization style building that is turn based (changes through seasons, which is a nice touch.) but the intensity of real-time combat, than TW:ME is it. Diplomacy is amazing, lately I've been receiving Alliances w/marriages to Princesses into their bloodlines... really cool touch. Combat and units vary depending on the country you pick but the mechanics are all the same. Heavily fortified cities are much harder to invade than non-fortified. Hence the use of siege units which is a must for castles and their brutal upgrades. Bloodline / Family tree spin is a really cool touch too. Having offspring and everything else makes for very dynamic play thru(s). The religious system is also interesting and acts a lot like the U.N. if you've ever played Civilization. Real-time combat is amazing, well done visually and holds up to todays standards imo. Great for more modern laptops. Additionally it follows events historically, the crusades, mongol invasion, et al. All in all... great game.

     [b]Medieval 2 is one of the best Total War games to date.[/b] Aside from the brilliant 'kingdoms' expansions, it offers a fun campaign spanning Europe [spoiler]and even portions of the new world[/spoiler], a diverse roster of units for each faction, unique agents, the modding community for this game in unrivalled. I would highly recommend this game for anyone new to Total War and unsure as to which game they should try first. Cheap, easy to get to grips with, and not to taxing on low specification machines, Medieval 2 is a masterpiece.

     [b]What's great about Medieval 2?[/b]
- Will run smoothly on older machines, even Macs.
- Easy to understand mechanics.
- Emphasis on fun gameplay over complex, unnecessary features like in newer titles.
- A wealth of great mods to run.
- Good DLC expansions.
- Low price for a Total War game, good starting point for new players.

     [b]What could be improved?[/b]
- Is an older game. Graphics have not aged well.
- Campaign may crash sometimes.
- Unit recruitment is slow and can get tedious in long campaigns.
- Multiplayer on Mac is almost non-existent.
- Limitations of older game engines, etc.

     [b]Who would I recommend this game to?[/b]
1. Newer Total War players who are unsure as to which game to start with.
2. People with low specification systems or Mac users like myself.
3. Any strategy players interested in the medieval period.

In that time, Medieval 2 has been my favorite. The depth of gameplay, the return of video assassinations, and the historical events, all masterfully done amidst the realistic religious strife...It makes it a complete game.

Become a Catholic nation whose neighbors war with you immediately. Send assassins to Rome to eliminate Popes with whom you have fallen out of favor. Continue your reign of terror until you can place one of your own Cardinals in the Vatican, firmly securing yourself in a position of favor within the Papacy.

Or strike hard and true as the hard-fighting Turks, with their naphtha bomb throwers and their mastery of gunfire weaponry later. Call on your Muslim nations in a Jihad to reclaim lands lost, or to fight the infidels of lands far away.

Watch as your generals grow from young men to battle-hardened veterans, acquiring mercenary entourages as well as slave-women concubines -- until it turns out your general prefers men. Watch as he slips into madness and is cast off as a lunatic, all to see him claim the throne as his father dies of old age and he is next in line for the throne.

Master the art of the longbow or the crossbow, or the art of the heavy cavalry charge. Whatever your faction's strengths are, play them to their fullest and succeed on the field of battle.

Watch your provinces grow from small villages to mighty towns and cities, only to be wiped out by the Black Death. Watch your resources and money plummet as you go into severe debt (along with the rest of Europe and Africa and the Middle East), only to survive the ordeal and to find that, just as you are weak, so now are all your opponents, and you might just have enough strength to assail them in their moment of weakness.

85,55137819,english,"The good: 
	- factions
		○ With a whopping 17 playable factions in the game, medieval 2is one of the most diverse total wars to date., and all these factions are available for freethey are not all available from the start, only 5 are, them being England, France, the holy roman empire, Venice and Spain. You unlock the other factions by destroying them in the campaign, which grants replay ability to the campaign as you unlock all the different factions
	- A lot for your money
		○ The only dlc released for this game was the kingdoms dlc, which is a fantastic dlc giving even more replay ability to the game. Instead of locking off content already present in the game, It adds four new mini campaigns with new maps, factions and units added.
	- Slower often more methodical battles
		○ If you are a total war player who enjoys the slower more tactical side of things, the battles in medieval 2 are for you. Units generally fight for longer if let to just duke it out, but tactics such as hammer and anvil, standard rear charging, and out flanking can and will send units running fast. The effect cavalry has in these battles really captures the dominance of heavy cavalry during the medieval age.
	- A deeper settlement managed system
		○ As the total war series has progressed, the settlement systems especially have generally become much more streamlined and easy to use, with most important effects coming down to if you have enough of one resource; money.This is not the case for medieval 2. in addition to money cities are also constrained by their population, their religion or their culture. You will not be able to recruit knights from a 500 man village and you cannot recruit French soldiers from an English town, however the beauty of this system is that these factors can be changed, an village of 500 can be grown into the military hub of your empire, and any culture can be assimilated
	- The modding
		○ The game is one of the most moddable games in total war history, and has an active vibrant modding community to this day, whether you like total conversions, overhauls or aesthetics there is a mod out there for you 

Neither good or bad
	- The AI is simple, but it works, after a while it became very easy to outplay the AI
		○ As with most total war games, the AI is not a highpoint, however it does not mean that the AI is incompetent. The AI is aggressive on the attack, defensive on the defence, it attempt to protect its flanks and is generally active on the campaign map. It is however very one-dimensional on how it executes its tactics. If they are attacking they will advance straight at you every time, the cavalry will attempt the same flanking manoeuvre time and time again. The same goes for sieges and when it's on the defence. This means after a while the AI will become quite easy to outplay, outmanoeuvre or even straight up cheese. All in all, it isn't bad, but it is not a positive either.
	- The economy
		○ The economy of total war games is something that has become more streamlined over the years, and it's one of those I things that I personally don’t mind being more streamlined, because there are many times in medieval where I have been losing or gaining money and I have had no idea exactly where the money was/wasn’t coming from. I will not put this as a negative because it’s a very personal gripe I have with the game.

The bad
	- For players coming from newer games: 
		○ Game (especially the battles) can feel very clunky and unresponsive
			§ The game is old, and that age comes through, in my opinion, the most during battles, the base controls feel awkward, although these can be changed of course. My main gripe is how unresponsive your units feel, when an order is given it often takes atleast 2-3 seconds before the entire unit is in motion, and orders like running and such aslo feel really delayed and unresponsive. While this might be more ""realistic"" than the more robotic instant response from units seen in later games, it feel better. Having it reissue an order several time just to get it to run or move is not fun gameplay.
		○ research isn't clearly explained and can cause confusion early on
			§ As with other total war games your faction will advance scientifically as the game goes on, issue is, at least for new players is that how this process occurs is not immediately obvious to the player.
	- Game tend to become a stomp after the mid game
		○ This is an issue with nearly all total war games and strategy games in general, as your faction becomes more powerful, the AI will struggle to keep up, and by the time you have knocked out your initial enemies in the early mid game the main challenge from the game is gone. The game tries to remedy it with the Mongol and Timurid invasion, which helps add some late game challenge, but in my opinion it isn't enough
	
	Conclusion
	Medieval 2 is a solid and classic entry into the total war franchise whose main drawback 13 years later is its age. I want to recommend this to all new fans of total war, however at this time I will not because of a recent price hike on this 13 year old game, this is bad faith by CA, and I cannot recommend this game as long as that remains.",1568628699,1568628742,False,18,1,0.633862853050231934,0,True,False,False,76561198110125087,66,8,11420,0,8143,1592377429,,

This is One of My favorite games of all time, second only to Star Wars Battlefront 2... the original not that EA piece of Hearting $###. 
I've put over a thousand hours into the game, though my steam account has only 340 hours ah well. If you have any money lying around and like strategy or are just getting into it I can't recommend this enough. Thank you for having the patience to read this post and have a great day!

EDIT/Addendum:
Yip Yip Hooray! My second favorite game of all time just had a price hike... yeah, so quick catch up for everyone (Especially if steam makes me re-upload the whole comment) I posted this back in July of 2018 and received 29 helpful and 3 funny reviews which surprised me considering how long this comment was then, now I'm adding a full paragraph to the beast. Alrighty, for those of you blessed enough to be unaware of current CA issues let me destroy that shred of innocence, ahem, CA has now partnered with a company that shall not be named in order to open up a large portion of the asian markets which, long story short, has resulted in price hikes across nearly-if-not-all CA products (Including DLC) of anywhere from 10-100% which is now causing fan uproar and slowly leading to large scale down vote trends on every CA account, forum and store page, Yip Yip... Hooray. Now then, before anyone ask or questions as for why I will not be down voting this game and joining the trend? well it's pretty simple CA 2019 doesn't represent the CA that brought about these earlier games nor should they be compared to the current state of CA and even with their current marketing lunacy they still have good people working for them and at the end of the day you hurt the companies dollar you hurt the companies people, every last one of them. With that being said however, I cannot support their bad decisions and can no longer defend this company, if down votes and pitchforks are the only way to address the issue then so be it. I will also not be updating the previous paragraph because I'd like to keep my unbiased opinions on the game on its own merits within the review and not just the new standing on CA but hopefully I will be able to delete this paragraph or make an addendum to it in the future. until then:

Playing as gondor I end up with several stacks full of tower guard just sitting beside gondor, playing as free peoples of eriador/arnor i end with stacks of knights of annuminas etc. I never get this feeling of attachment to the units with the newer total wars, i spam out high tier armies and throw them headlong at walled cities rather than trying to siege or use cheap fodder.

There is also a deep militaristic attribute to supporting the national religion. Formally, religious units rid unrest often caused by civil dissent. However, they can be recruited for the purpose of promoting trouble in foreign lands, giving your unsuspecting enemy rebellions to deal with and help keep them confined to their own position, while your nation can focus on gaining territory. It is good to play passively and cunningly, keeping allies and buying territory is a favourable way to play, but make too many small mistakes, even tiny ones, like mugging the army and navy off, and a strong empire can take extraordinary losses.

32,54634539,english,"LINUX port review; ignore if you don't use linux
--------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry about the 'don't recommend', it only reflects my view on the linux port; the game is actually good, but steams binary do/don't recommend system forces me to pick the option which is most in line with what I here am writing.

Even though Feral interactive have done a good job porting other total war games to the more elegant operating system for more civilized users (In the case of Empire total war they even somehow managed to make a more stable game than on windows), they have not done a very good job in this case, and I am experiencing a number of issues:

Interestingly, wrong textures are sometimes loaded.

I always find the character portraits (on the family tree) replaced by random pieces of terrain or (whatever texture from the game really) and I have even seen the (entire) ground texture on a countryside battle-map be replaced by cobblestone (not just inside a city or on a road, but all over the countryside, including under the trees in the forest).

Furthermore, as far as I can tell, the game is less stable than the (admittedly not very stable) windows version; sometimes I have experienced simple crashes, but other times the game has frozen and become completely irresponsive to any inputs *even going as far as to ignore 'sudo kill' commands (!)*.

And obviously most mods don't work, as they have not been tested for the linux version; this is of course true for most games, but in the case of this game, the mods is a huge part of its appeal.

In conclusion, while you certainly can download, play and even enjoy this game on linux, you should just play it on a windows environment, either on a dual boot, a windows emulator/virtual machine or a compatability layer (such as Wine) or on a windows machine (as the game is rather old, it is perfectly playable on one of these tiny laptops most of us have lying around anyway). 

Note that I have only tested this game on Windows 10 and Arch-linux through the KDE desktop environment using the runtime version of linux; I have for one thing not tested it on Ubuntu, which the game likely has been playtested for (considering the minimum system requirements)",1565894743,1565894743,False,0,1,0.471124589443206787,0,True,False,False,76561198861586583,5,5,15562,0,5118,1593443320,,

This is the first game I purchased as a hardcopy. What makes this game unique is the possibilities. The game lets you use your own ideas; there are no patterns you should follow. Watch me kill cavalry with archers, kill spearmen with cavalry, win impossible battles, watch me use merchants (which are called useless by many veterans) to earn money enough to bribe all armies and cities, remain allies with France as England with 3 marriages. The game doesn't shape how you play, it is in your hands.

Some of my achievements I can remember;

* Prevented the Hundred Years' War between France and England
* Made 20k income per turn in 50 turns without invading a single land
* Prevented Osman to build the Ottoman Empire by assassinating him
* Conquer Europe with Orthodox priests as Russia
* Elected as Pope and started crusades
* Stopped Mongols and Crusaders as Egypt without giving a single land.

* Won battles that had 95% chance of losing. Was awarded with many cross-swords in the map, which were nice tokens to remember your efforts.
* Defended a simple castle with 300 hundred militia against 3000 men without having archers or artillery (Did the charge in the movie last samurai with 3 light cavalry units outside the castle. 1 flanked right, another left; disturb the enemy formation, last cavalry unit with triangle formation went out from the front gate and charged directly to enemy general at that open space. Only 3 cavalry reached the general unit, killed the general, the enemy started to flee.
* Killed 3 heavy armored dismounted knight units with 3 Sipahis. Arrows run out, only 1/5 of the enemy was killed, tired the enemy by let them chase sipahis and rest sipahis. After numerous charges, I had 3 sipahis against 5. Was desperate, run up to the hill and hoped the charge down will be enough. It was enough. The battle took 5 hours in real life.

The vanilla game is a classic and provides a great sense of epic conquest as you spend countless turns building up your lands and armies before sending them forth to claim the world, or at least the majority of it on the classic vanilla map. The game has its issues and will have newcomers slamming their keyboard when played on higher difficulties (the A.I. gets a lot of bonuses), but with time you'll develop a play style that works for you and your faction in this weirdly well balanced game given its age. 

The definitive edition includes the expansions and though I have far less experience with these, I can say they are worth a go and a welcome addition. I owned this game back when it first came out and can say I easily put months of play into not only the vanilla game and using every faction, difficulty and expansion that was available, but also many of the countless mods that are out there (honourable mentions to the Warhammer, Elder scrolls and Lord of the rings mods in particular).

Sure the AI isn't the greatest, and general's bodyguard is borderline broken, and there's that two-handed glitch, (and diplomacy is sorta messed up), but I still enjoy the game every time I pick it up. Plus, there's a sizable catalog of mods. Everything from stainless steel, which fixes and adds many features, to Santa's Invasion, which changes the Danes into the North Pole (my personal favorite, come at me), to total overhaul mods like Third Age, which turns Medieval 2 into a LotR game. And even if you get bored of all that, there's still the expansion, Kingdoms, which adds 4(?) campaigns at a very cheap price compared to other CA titles.

53,54273181,english,"After almost 80 hours invested into the game and finishing the campaign I finally feel that I know the game enough to write a review. I will often compare with Rome total war (RTW, the first one, to be honest I played as of the date of this review only these two titles so I cannot compare the game with any other titles from Total War series).
In general the game uses a very similar system as in RTW in terms of city management, buildings, taxes, squalor and that sort of stuff. There are two types of settlements, either a regular city, usually with almost no decent units to train and then you can have castles. Castles allow you to train elite troops of the time period but the disadvantage is substantially lower income (let's say 50% of a city). The good thing is you can change your cities to be castles and vice versa at any time, however since there are different buildings available in both settlement types, certain (unit training) buildings are not allowed in cities and some in castles, which means if you do not wish to rebuild from scratch you should set your mind at the moment you take the settlement and go with it for the rest of the game. Fortunately for a conqueror like you, factions standing against you will always have at least two or three castles so if you manage to take those, in a few rounds you can start producing troops from there and do not have to march them through half the map.
Let's continue with units. The game offers a wide variety of units and although I did not try many of them, I would say there are at least as many than in RTW if not more. Perhaps a downside to units trainable in a city is that they aren't any good in neither attack nor defense so it does not make sense to train them. While a city full of city troops could stand against a few stacks of castle units, if forced to fight with equal numbers, they would be badly beaten. AI isn't (luckily) as stupid as to train city troops and attack with them (if it has any castles to produce the ""real"" units, of course). Along with soldiers you can have an array of ""standalone"" units such as diplomats, spies, assassins (just like in RTW) but they added also princesses and merchants. I confess I did not understand the reason behind using princesses so I did not use them and I did fine without them. The tutorial or the advice panel that pops on the upper left screen if you click on something for the first time tells you something about them but it does not tell you the most important thing, WHEN to use them so it may be as well worthless. Similarly, it tells you how to use merchants but it does not tell you that merchants of all other factions will try to take your merchants away and they will succeed without you being able to do something about it (well, you can run away with your merchants but what is the point of having merchants when you need to run with them constantly?). Of course, you can use assassins to try to kill their merchants but you usually don't have about ten assassins just lying around, waiting for some poor merchant to come. Furthermore, income from one resource is on average somewhere around 30-50 gold per turn and given each one of your merchants costs 550 gold to train, it can be quite expensive to train them (especially at the start) and the profit usually comes after at least 15-20 turns (during which anything can happen to the merchants). And when they are most profitable, earning about 100 or more gold per turn and you are actually glad you invested in them some 30 rounds ago, they just die of old age. I get the premise of not having a 300-year old merchants as the game time goes by but in my opinion, the merchants are not worth it in the long run. Besides these you can train a priest to increase the faith percentage in your towns and regions but once again, I did not use them and I did not have to (even though that my kingdom was a paradise for all heretics and witches).
A few times when playing the game I had the feeling that some things were done to make the game more realistic but at the same time these things ruined the game a little. For example, you attack a city and you built 5 towers to scale the walls. If the defender positioned some basic cheap archer militia on the walls, then you are doomed, as NONE of your towers will survive and all will burn down. I remember that in RTW it happened sometimes that one or two towers were destroyed but never ALL of them. Sadly, the same goes for ram. I get that it would be quite costly to put iron shields in the front of a whole tower (hypothetically speaking) but it could be done to a ram but apparently people were so dumb back then as not to realise that their wooden siege weapons will burn down when used against flaming arrows. So one can picture my relief when finally gunpowder arrives and I could build some basic bombards to smash the gates and give the defenders some real fight. Of course, the tutorial window does not tell you this vital info so you don't have to end the siege just because your siege weapons got destroyed. The only usable and effective ""siege weapon"" are the ladders but here you have to prepare yourself for the losses you will suffer until your troops reach the top of the walls and start fighting (and not mentioning here another stupidity that the ladders cannot be reused once used so in case of a castle siege with more levels of walls you have to take care not to use all your ladders on the first walls or you automatically lost the battle). It is a little stupid that until there is just one defender unit left on the wall, the towers will fire arrows on your soldiers, which is particularly annoying during longer wall fights. The fighting looks good given the time period when the game was released, of course if you ignore the fact that every soldier dies in just one of two ways. However, it feels very authentic, especially at the beginning of the campaign, to watch your men fight the enemy and to hear their cries, just as you would in a battle. Another realistic thing I like is that when your line clashes with your opponent's, at first you can make out which troops are yours without clicking on them but a few moments later it all just mingles into one giant fighting mass and you can only observe. I don't know if this feature was also in the real medieval battles but it just feels realistic. Of course, you are free to give orders at any time but in this game the pathfinding is worse than in RTW so when you order your unit that is in the middle of it to go left, for example, it will but it will not do it as a whole but some soldiers may be stuck somewhere or the whole group of units may go in the other direction for whatever reason, so you have to be careful when issuing orders to make sure the units are doing what you told them and not some other nonsense that could potentially ruin your battle. I almost forgot, at the beginning of each battle, do not wait for some witty or brave speeches as it was in RTW, it is the middle ages and everybody is serious after all. Contrary to RTW, if you click on some stack of units that don't belong you or even rebels, they will always retort something based on your relationships with their owner. So for example a rebel general may call you a coward for not facing him, a neutral faction general may declare he is not your enemy and your enemies have the best lines going like ""my master will reward me for your death, infidel"" (the muslims, obviously) or ""come and face the might of the reich"" (guess who) and the most hilarious retorts are from other princesses: ""I will never marry you"". That being said, it makes the game a lot more atmospheric.

67,54099169,english,"This is the 2nd best Total War game to date. It would be the best were it not for the two joint best being Shogun 2 and Warhammer 2.

Ive played every Total War game since Shogun the original back in 2000. I'll start with the positives;

The UI for both the world map and battle maps is unsurpassed. why they changed it to the 'provinces and capitals system' after Shogun 2, I have no idea. Everything is simple to learn for beginners and intuitive.

The Scale is unsurpassed, even by present day standards. You may play through centuries of civilisations, including historically shaping events such as the dawn of the Knight and chivalry, or the Crusades, even discovering the new world, and shamelessly taking advantage of south american native cultures like the Aztecs and the Mayans (gold isnt as precious as you think guys, heres some wool...lets swap..)

So many factions to control (upon completion of campaign) and world domination never gets old, the management of settlements is optional, from micro management down to basically letting AI control your finances (dont let it, it spends like my GF on payday) 
its really engaging, and there is excellent balance between governance and brutal conflict.

The Graphics are excellent for the age of the game, and are still mustard today in my opinion. The sounds of peasent soldiers squabbling, or an English General questioning French sexual orientation are gems, and there is plenty more comedy gold as you scroll over your troops at the start of a battle.

The Soundtrack is great. Not as good as Rome 1 soundtrack, but general very rousing, and theres only so much sound you can get out of a Lute am I right?




The negatives:

Diplomacy is basically toilet, as with 9/10 TW games, It doesnt matter what you do, how loyal or Noble you are, you will be at war with every faction that borders you within a handful of turns. Very irritating. It wont bother you for your first play through, but it'll start getting on your tits after youve completed it a few times, as it really limits your approach to the game. youll find yourself applying the same doctrines to world domination. The way round this is to have a functioning steam workshop to fix the AI diplomacy. Steam however currently doesnt seem to be able to search for this game in the workshop though so dont expect a mod for diplomacy, although im sure they exist.


Doctrine. Youll find yourself approaching each play through with the same mindset. thanks to the above diplomacy, there are few options for a tactical approach, forming close military allegiances, or fiscally starving out opponents are all out of the window in favour of amassing a huge army and clattering any fool who gets in your way. however, this is great fun, and the game would be pointless if it was one big EU friendly SJW utopian wet dream.



Summary;

Get the game its well worth the money and is literally years of enjoyment.

80,53943574,english,"Medieval 2 Total War is entirely worth it- on sale doubly so. I bought it for £5, which is a bit more than you'd get Rome Total War for. I've played Rome 1, Napoleon, Alexander, and a bit of Shogun 2, and this is possibly my favourite or second favourite total war game, and this is as someone who plays a lot of other strategy games like hoi4 and civ v. This game holds it's own against them.

Let me start by saying that this game has an insane amount of content, especially in the definitive edition that is now the default. You can play as England, France, the Holy Roman empire, Milan, and a bunch of others. It starts off in 1066, after the battle of Hastings.
I've begun playing on easy as England, and this game feels like Rome Total War from the sheer fun of the combat, and the scale is much increased. The general's speeches are really nice, and the combat is much improved over previous iterations. 

Sieges are also great, and it feels like I stand a chance against a much larger force. Arrows feel like they do a lot more damage now, but I may be misremembering other games. The fire arrows absolutely obliterate advancing forces- every unit has it's strength in this game, which is awesome.

I truly reocmmend you give it a go. I won't spoil any more content, because there are some cool surprises. Also, treat this game as you forging your own history rather than anything else.

82,53941910,english,"Epic"" doesn't quite begin to describe the scope and scale of the latest Total War game--there's a lot of strategic depth, with plenty of amazing combat to enjoy.
Like in most strategy games, your goal in Medieval 2 is to try to conquer the known world. And as a ruler of a medieval kingdom, this means you have to rely on knights, men-at-arms, archers, catapults, cannons, and everything else you'd expect out of a movie such as Braveheart or Kingdom of Heaven. That's not all, though; you also have a small array of agents to call upon. Diplomats can negotiate cease-fires (useful when you need some time to rebuild your strength) or alliances; princesses can shore up the loyalty of a general or a neighboring faction through marriage; spies can give you a peek at a fortified city's defenses; assassins can take out enemy agents. Then there are priests, but we'll get to that a bit later.

Since it's a Total War game, Medieval 2 sports two layers. The ""big picture"" is covered in the turn-based strategic layer, where you can examine a map of Europe and manage your empire. From here, you have command of all your settlements, armies, navies, and agents. You can also construct improvements to enhance the economy or allow you to build the latest in 15th-century military technology. For example, building paved roadways not only increases trade in a province, but it also helps speed along troop movement; improving farmland, furthermore, can help generate more food, and thus more gold.Medieval 2 introduces a few new twists to the established formula of the original game. Settlements come in two flavors now, towns and castles. Basically, towns and cities generate a lot more cash, but castles generate a wider variety of military units and are much harder to capture. It's an interesting idea, and it's not exactly a detriment to the experience that the supercities of the original game are no more, but this does add in a bit more micromanagement as you have to constantly shuttle troops and agents between various settlements. For instance, you might want to send depleted formations back to a castle where they can retrain and upgrade with the latest weapons and equipment.
All of this costs cash, of course, and it's safe to say that you'll be scrimping for every spare gold piece possible, especially early on in the game. The economic game has been bulked up a bit with the addition of merchants and resources. Basically, there are resources such as wheat and wine that are located on the map, and by enlisting a merchant and placing one on a resource, you can tap that resource for gold. However, one merchant can try and ""buy out"" another merchant sitting on a resource, so you'll be managing merchants while you're also busy maneuvering all the other pieces in the game.Campaigns will last even longer if you choose to fight out each battle in real time, and while you can usually skip over the minor skirmishes by letting the computer instantly generate the results, you'll most likely want to dive into the larger scrums--not only because you don't want to risk losing a major battle with roughly even odds due to a flip of the computer's coin, but because there are plenty of jaw-dropping moments in Medieval 2's combat. The ""clone"" armies of Rome: Total War are no more, and the brightly colored formations look incredibly detailed and varied. Best of all is that the combat animations are much more fleshed out. In a huge battle with thousands of warriors slamming into one another, you can easily pick up the individual duels going on as your men fight for their lives. You'll see guys getting knocked to the ground and struggling to get back up on their feet when their opponent delivers a finishing blow, as well as other cinematic moments. There are some weird anomalies, like when formations of men get jammed around a ladder, but the awesome spectacle of it all is glorious.Control over all these units is a bit nightmarish, but battles tend to have that effect on command and control, as all plans fall apart once contact with the enemy is made. You're rewarded for using tactics correctly, like not sending knights into the teeth of pikes and maneuvering them to hit the enemy from the flank or the rear. Or you keep your archers safely protected to the rear, where they can inflict the most damage on your enemy. All the decisions that you made during the strategic campaign finally pay off in battle, like the composition of your armies, the upgrades that you've equipped them with, and the generals that you chose to lead them in battle.You'll need a fairly powerful system, though, in order to appreciate the large-scale battles in all their grandeur without any frame rate hits. This is a demanding game, especially when there are thousands of warriors fighting onscreen at once. Our midrange system struggled to keep up, but on a high-end system the visuals were good enough that we could just sit back and soak it all in. And the campaign map looks beautiful, aided by the sense that you're not so much looking at a map but rather at a 3D representation of a living, breathing world. Tiny ships ply the trade routes between cities, caravans haul goods on the road network, and much more. The visuals are also aided by the addition of cool cinematic movies that show the results of various actions, like assassination attempts gone comically awry, royal weddings, and papal elections. Medieval 2 also has excellent audio. The music ranges from pleasing and subtle throughout the campaign map to bombastic and pompous during battle, though the musical cue that we liked the most was the haunting defeat chorus after losing a battle. There's plenty of voice work, too, as most emissaries will talk to you in appropriately accented English depending on their nationality. The prebattle speeches given by your generals are both rousing (in a Shakespearean way) and tactically sound, and you can glean important hints about the upcoming fight.Aside from the single-player campaign, there are a few extra modes in Medieval 2. A single-player skirmish mode lets you create custom battles, so you can pit the Mongols against the Aztecs, for instance, while there are seven historical battles that revisit great moments in world history, such as Agincourt, where Henry V overcame all odds and crushed the French. The multiplayer portion of the game is restricted to battles. Indeed, given the scope and scale of the single-player campaign, we imagine that resolving a multiplayer game would be all but impossible save for the most dedicated of players. Yet one day we'd like to see some kind of small-scale multiplayer campaign that lets you use all those strategic assets against other players. Multiplayer itself features only two modes, last man standing and scored resolution, but the basic idea remains the same in that you want to kill as many of the other guys as possible. Battles support up to eight players, so you can really get a big scrum going on, but the meat of the game is certainly in the single-player campaign.n our version of the Hundred Years' War, England was well on its way to spanking France in record time when those dastardly Danes betrayed our alliance and ruined the fun. About 150 turns later, we found ourselves bogged down in a three-front war against France, Denmark, and a late-to-the-party Spain, though at least those tenacious Scots were finally put down after a lengthy, hard-fought campaign in the north. Still, armies and navies were committed to battle as quickly as they were raised; spies, assassins, priests, diplomats, and merchants scrambled around the map and did their thing; sieges were laid and cities sacked; and battle followed bloody battle. And this is the ""short"" campaign in Medieval 2: Total War. In a nutshell, that summarizes what is both awesome and somewhat daunting about the latest game in the popular Total War strategy series. With its huge scale, deep gameplay, and beautiful graphics.

This game have nice graphics(not BF1 but you understand, this game has 11 years) really nice historic line with different events and HUGE tactics on the battle field, everyone own some and those are what makes a fight epic.There are only terrestrial and siege battles, not navals fights but you have them in Rome II :Total War :D

[h1]The Mods [/h1]

More the 4 mods in the Kingdom DLC (Britanny isles,Crusade,Teutonics war and the New World) there are tons of nice mods made by the community, like the Third age;Divide and Conquer;Game of Throne;Stainless Steel mod.There are really easy to download and install but you need to buy kingdoms :D

[h1]The Community [/h1]

We aren't in CS:GO or COD then there is a decent community, you can ask for help without getting spit out.
There is also a really big communty on the game, almost 3000 permanent players.

We honestly don't this much realism and immersive experience in most of the recent total wars. Not to mention this game doesn't bombard you with overpriced and not well done DLC like Rome 2 and the Warhammers

In addition, there are so many fun overhaul mods you can add on to the game that can improve the experience. Honestly those make up most of the hours I have in comparison to the Vanilla and Kingdoms campaigns. Examples include Third Age, Hyrule, Elder Scrolls, Stainless Steel, Thera, and Planetary.

It used to be 2 separate games in the library (regular and Kingdoms) and I believe that some of my time in game wasn't carried over when they merged them, so I am confident I have a few hundred more hours than my profile suggests.

Medieval 2 falls in just the right middle ground of simplicity and potential. It hasn't been streamlined in many of the ways newer Total War games have, and far from suffer from that, I believe it is stronger because of it. The city management, and campaign map aspects of the game just feel right to me. Both Simple on the surface, but also hiding a satisfying amount of depth. And because of the nature of the game, it is EXTREMELY mod friendly.

Although I have certainly played all the campaigns that come with the game, most several times over, the vast majority of my playtime is in the form of overhaul mods (mods that completely overhaul the game experience in one way or another). 100+ hours were in the form of Lord of the Rings overhaul mods, that turned the game into a turn-based/real-time strategy game set in the world of Middle Earth. I have also played multiple mods which simply update and improve the base gameplay, allowing you to play familiar campaigns, but with much more complexity than the regular game can provide. At the moment of writing, I am 50 hours into a Warhammer Fantasy overhaul mod, and loving it.

The game is by no means perfect. Most of the flaws are concentrated in the Real-time strategy portion of the game (battles). The largest flaw is probably the AI. Not only the AI of the enemy, but the AI that governs your own units. Sometimes it takes several attempts to get a unit to properly follow your movement order (although this mostly tends to only happen on city/castle walls). Certain AI interactions also don't work properly; case in point, if you put stakes up inside of a city/castle you are defending, the enemy AI doesn't properly recognize them, and will happily run their cavalry straight through them, causing mass casualties (the issue doesn't really appear on open battlefields though). It is pretty safe to say that most of the biggest flaws seem to occur in the siege portion of the RTS gameplay, where-as open battles seem to work much better. The AI controlling enemy factions on the campaign map can also at times make odd decisions, but it is much less impactful overall (and if you play on the hardest difficulties, you will be thankful for enemy mistakes, not critical of them) 

Obviously this game isn't new, and its age can show at times, but newer isn't always better and I believe Medieval 2 is a great example of this. If you enjoy turn based strategy and real-time strategy, chances are you will enjoy this game too. I certainly will never regret buying it all those years ago.",1561949822,1561949822,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198026673423,243,2,35538,0,35418,1562007109,,

27,52652301,english,"Recommended game if you like manage a bunch of cities/towns/castles and campaigns against your enemies.
There is a lot of things that happens on the same time in this game on board: 
1. Your empire is going down and cities start riots because the taxes are too high, you earn less money every turn and your army gets smaller.
2. Completing a mission is your best friend.
3. Your capital is far away and you need governors for the new cities conquered.
4. Your merchs gets kicked, your spies die and your diplomatic is dumb.
5. Well, people are getting married even if your empire is falling into the void. 


The RTS battles are something else, is like you are playing another game, but everything matters that happens on board. Try to learn that spears are for fighting horses, best advice! 900 cheap units is not the best option, even if you have the advantage, you'll lose more than you can imagine: pride, morale, will for living, units...


Buy the DLCs, such as Americas, Britannias, Crusades, Teutonic... There's a difference.

The reasoning for this is that the AI seldom (if at all; I forget how it behaves on VH/VH) ever cheats, by giving itself free money or troops. For that reason, well into the lategame, you'll tend to face rather low-tier units even against your best-upgraded top-tier armies. In addition, in singleplayer at least, the AI is quite susceptible to battle tactics based around artillery, and strategically speaking, it's quite easy to bully via the diplomacy options. This aside, the game is quite well-crafted, and most of its mechanics stand the test of time quite nicely (I, for one, am a fan of having separate building chains for castles and cities, complete with all the units available in either based on the time period). It's home to some of the more enjoyable campaigns I've played in a TW game (Ireland in Britannia, Byzantium in vanilla and Crusades, Novgorod in Teutonic, and New Spain in Americas), and a title worth picking up even today.",1561826864,1561826864,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198079206106,112,3,17795,0,15111,1598374846,,

Well, here's a quick summary of the game!

1: It's obviously similar to many games made by Creative Assembly.
2: It's somewhat ""cheap"" compared to other games
3: Better AI than Total War: Rome II (as many others would say)
4: Not split into little DLC peices, compared to today's Total War games
5: This game is still active in multiplayer, 10+ years after it's release!

My opinion: It is basically Total War: Rome II, but better and it is worth it's price, including the DLC (Kingdoms). So if you're thinking about buying this, I would say yes. However, this is just my opinion of the game, so you can choose if you would like to buy this or not. Anyways, have a nice day and I hope I've helped you make your decision today! ^-^

8,52011151,english,"10/10 would play again. Apart from this game will take over your life if you're not careful, like "" I'll just take this city and destroy this army"" 4 hours and many more battles later and you're in full blown emperor mode and then spend the whole weekend conquering the medieval map. 

Battle mechanics and control aren't exactly ideal if you have a large army but for the vast majority of sieges and medieval engagements the system is excellent. Holes show up more in pvp but I'm sure if you took the time reading some guides it's not too large a jump to using hotkeys etc. 

But let's not veer too far off course...The campaign, and it's associated power trip, make up the majority of this game and it's amazing. The start is spent mostly building your economies, allies and killing rebels. Most of your middle campaign will be dying from the plague and watching your allegiances burn as one/two problem nations (not to name names but it's always got something to do with the Milanese - just sayin'). Late game is ""Oh no, the Mongols"", quickly followed by ""Oh no, the Timurids"" and then you take the last settlement and there is no more outcry because everyone loves you (lest they openly show their distaste and get assassinated). 

On that point, assassin/spy/general espionage mechanics are a right laugh and if you really want to, you can use these to simply make cities riot to the point your opposing faction gets kicked out. Likewise, the religion mechanic is also pretty cool. It's less cool if you upset the Pope early game and get multiple crusades called open you. Buuuuut, it is super cool when you control the college of cardinals and effectively get given carte blanche to crusade most of the Middle East and Africa (which you'll probably want to do anyway) and get a load of free bonuses. Conversely if your campaign starts in the Islamic East/Africa the Caliphate can be equally rewarding. You're still going to get crusaded and the plague though so don't think you're avoiding that by starting outside of Europe. 

Graphics still hold up for the most part and the soundtrack is, although not overly memorable, certainly immersive and helps suck you in to a half day play through pretty quickly. There is plenty more I could cover but ain't nobody got time for that. Worth a buy but not like super pressing if you value your life outside of medieval murder sims. You're best just picking it up when it's next on sale and having an absolute whale of a time.

44,51520390,english,"Based on the systems of Rome: Total War, Medieval II has all the charm of that game but with a more polished feel and simulation. There is really no reason not to get this game if you are into strategy games but don't necessary need something as complex as a Paradox game.

The game takes place over the course of the entire Medieval Era/Renaissance, but in a way that is compact and manageable in terms of depth vs. breadth in the main campaign. There are smaller campaigns that focus more on the Americas or the Crusades, but these aspects are also represented in the main game.

There are still a lot of quirks with this game that had not been ironed out from Rome. Even at higher difficulties, it is quite easy to roll across the map, the only possible challenges being the addition of the Mongols and Timurids, which spawn giant hordes of units and lay waste across the eastern part of the map. Once you learn to deal with the AI of these factions, they are not difficult to defeat even though they seem ominous at first. 

If I had to rank Total War games in terms of the experience they provide, I would probably place this one close to the top. It may not be as sophisticated or good looking as the newer games, but it has its own charm that balances how easy it can be. Unlike the newer games, which make your units look like greyish brown shapes shooting neon white lines at other greyish brown shapes, this game has a more colorful style that makes the battles seem more epic, even if it is not entirely realistic.

I highly recommend checking out this game if you've never played a Total War game, or if you've only played the newer titles.

I know my steam hours may be deceptive but I've owned this game for almost a decade now. It was one of the big things that ignited my initial love of the Medieval era. My historical field of study has changed but my love for what this game was never did. I spent six years doing a world domination campaign as the Holy Roman Empire in the Stainless Steel mod. Even before that I poured thousands of hours into the vanilla game and its original expansion long before I knew about the modding community. So when I tell you something is different you can't tell me it isn't. I have an old hard-drive lying around from an old computer that hasn't been hooked up to the internet in a few years that has the original copy of the game. So CA can either admit they changed the game or people like me will put the code side-by-side and show that you changed it.

Side note, people getting mad about Kushites and other factions having female generals are being ridiculous. Most of the factions I've heard about do have confirmed historical female generals or warriors, especially the Kushites. Why do people even play the broken mess that is Rome 2, anyway? I hated that game long before they added that in. I don't really care, frankly.

Ballistics are now totally wrong in the base game and it even shows through in mods as well. I've been play-testing several today and range values are different, damages levels are different, and even the AI in battles behaves differently. Diplomacy has been changed so now you can hamfist multiple deals in one diplomacy sitting, taking out all the depth behind each diplomatic interaction every turn and even making it so I can exploit an AI for tribute even on VH/VH. Tons of new features and titles are now in the game that were not there before. Even new bugs have appeared with trade and path-finding! It's utterly absurd and I'm glad I finished my final magnum opus campaign before any of this stuff started.

I didn't buy the new titles because I didn't want them or their problems. Now you're forcing me to accept changes through Steam? What else are you gonna do, CA? This is even worse than what I thought CA would do to mods when they got their hands on a license and wanted 0 competition.

The gaming industry has become one of the most dishonest, backhanded, abrasive, shifty/shady branches of entertainment in the world home to some of the most untrustworthy companies on the planet - considering the kind of stuff we've seen over the last few decades, that is really saying something. I've spent my fair share of time in board rooms and in some of the less reputable ways to make a living and I've seen some stuff that just blows my mind in terms of how greedy and arrogant people can be. But the gaming industry? Updating older titles or outright breaking them to make people buy newer games to get their fix? That's a new low.

Wanted to post a short friendly review for quite some time.

1.  Perhaps the best TW for battles  - including Castle/City defense & assault.  TW games, After MTW II, - include No cities, only small forts to be assaulted.  There exist no population to consider, or exterminate.  A world without people.  Just like computer gaming.  Exception is RTW II - the worst TW, has 'cities' where you cannot build walls, (1 in 3 has walls, and not good walls).  It is pathetic in so many ways!  Not worth further commenting on.

2.  As with ALLLL TWs - NO DIPLOMACY!!!  If they border you, regardless of their weakness, they will Attack!!!

3.  Best artwork & depictions, and landscapes - mountains you can actually fight on.

4.  AI cannot Bridge defend, or attack (in any of the TWs).  Some most important battles in history were fought over - near Bridges, and river fjords.

5.  Vewwwy Important!!!  MTW II was never improved on (by the developers).  Left as half a game.

Conclusion:

1.  Toooo EEEASY!!!!  

2.  Longbows rule.  STAKES!!!  Never seen AI use stakes, bridge defenses.

3.  Best looking,  Did I mention - toooo easy?

4.  Don't mention MODS!  They cannot rescue an unfinished, or poorly programmed game.  *Could JFK save the independence & sovereignty of the USA?  He tried.

5.  MTW II - nice to look at.  Great Castles & Cities.  Step up from RTW artwork/programming.  As with all TWs, NO functional AI.  AI functions at level of American Congress/ & rest of Gov't. (& most every other Gov't).  Apologies for the political comments.  Just ignore them.

I PLAY:

1.  Ultimate General CW,  - with faults, takes real time War simulation to a higher level.

2.  & the Extended Greek Mod for RTW.  RTW - the first, was the best TW effort (obviously my opinion).

The XGM Mod adds some Culture flavor, & expands the Game MAP, and adds more civilizations to the mix.  It cannot Save RTW, but it helps it greatly.  I enjoy flattening the Romans with the Greeks, & Unifying Italy with the Romans.  Still, if they border on you, they will attack!  There is some tacky difficulty added by XGM, & a control that allows you to control the Diplomacy (a bit).

God Bless!

This game defined my childhood alongside wc3 and is considered the best total war by both myself and a large number people in the community for a multitude of reasons. 

TLDR: Crusades, merchants, you can assassinate the pope, more crusades, more merchants and you can also assassinate the pope (trust me the pope in this is not a friendly pope)

PROS: 
-Crusades
-Merchants
-You can assassinate the pope
-The graphics are a huge step up from the titles beforehand(Rome is kinda arguable) and haven't aged too badly
-Stainless steel, LOTR, Warhammer and a number of other mods though the base game is still fantastic
-Huge battle map with plenty of room to run down infidels, varied terrains, weather, night and day, and huge cities and fortresses to fight in with designs that can make major strategical differences
-Huge campaign map which is also gorgeous
-AI don't really cheat to make up for lack of skill like later total wars
-Way more build options for cities and castles rather than just some build slots like later installments
-longest historical period covered
-you can get your generals through marriage, adoptions, birth, or leaderless army with a lone captain being a bad*** on the field and getting promoted 
-solid number of factions to choose from

Cons
-who care but I guess I'll name them
-the AI is dumb, they can be cheesed like no ones business because they don't get 10 doom stacks from having one settlement (except for the mongolia and timurid appearance but who picks egypt, russia or the turks anyway) like later installments along with buffs that turn their peasant degenerates into elite units
-Christian factions don't take kindly to Islamic factions moving into Europe, everyone including the pope will declare war on you but they will do that eventually anyway
-the pope will excommunicate you and then declare war on you unless you play as an islamic faction at which point he will just declare war on you
-could be more crusades

This game is TotalWar done right!!!!.
Fine, it is a bit late for a review, but damn this game is good.
How a Total war game should be done! Ohhh I said that!

Ok, so it plays well (SP).
MP is fine. Lots of improvements later on MP wise.
Ship battles not present (obviously because of the year of release). 

Fancy being King John? or William the Conquerer (Norman)? Well you can re-shape Europe in your own fashion!!!
Better not be high-tops and Willy-Wonka tube-tops!!!

You can also visit the New-World!!!!! Better bring your Scimitar and War-Axe!!!

Seriously though, this is one of the better entries into the franchise. I would highly recommend it.

I'm also not particularly experienced with effectively summarizing reviews for games and my reviews easily get way too lengthy, but I'll at least say the following.

A lot of players complain about diplomacy, but the only issue I've had are AI diplomat characters going through the animation as if they're going to address you, but it only ever goes through a portion of the time. It's as if the faction is indecisive as to whether or not it wants to declare war on you, strike up relations, etc. but is willing to spam the diplomat on a single settlement repeatedly.

Diplomacy itself, in my opinion, isn't actually broken. Deals, relations, etc. need to be struck up very early and typically not with your expansionist neighbors that are obviously going to betray the alliance at the first opportunity they get. Factions have reputations for a reason- not every faction is meant to be reliable or chivalrous, as not all leaders in the real world are either. It's just another part of the game you need to plan out unless you want to pointlessly frustrate yourself about the game ""ganging up"" on you like a lot of critics seem to mention.

Good game- just wish the multiplayer included the campaign. Wouldn't care if my friends and I had to repeatedly save and pick the campaign back up from where we left off- it'd be more fun that just the battle scenarios. Also, the automatic resolutions for the battle scenarios in campaigns (as opposed to manually controlling the units in the battle) can be a bit strange. Often had the ratio of power WELL in my favor only to leave me with a stunningly large defeat and very few units left over. Usually forces me to fight manual battles even if I'm not in the mood for them.",1556279540,1556279540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198069744218,79,7,5351,0,4120,1593791159,,

No Sea Battles and i like it very much. But it was to early for Sea Battles in the History of the Total War Series. Maybe! Additional Armies in Battle cant be ordered in the Basic Game. Why this is possible in the DLCs but not there? It costs more as one Battle for me to find a way to ignore it. Or to find another way to live with the Bullshit the AI Commanders are doing. Non Playable Factions! Its a Steady insult for all of the Games thus even in the Definitive Edition not all Factions cant be played. I personally am a bit to lazy to mod every Game. Why are Traders attacking other Traders even from Factions wich they arent in War? And why i am not able to avoid Rebel Scum Forces to exist or to pop up even in Areas where everything theems to be fine? The Handling of Units is sometimes difficult because i am not able to see where they are went to marching and or where i can place them accuratley.

It's still pretty enjoyable even now, but I do recommend that you install mods to improve it. There are several flaws, the one I find most glaring is the balance and realism of some units. The good news is, there are a lot of mods out there. One of the biggest which doesn't change too much is Stainless Steel, which I really recommend.

Update: 
I have played Shogun 2, another great total war game. There are a lot of things to love about Medieval 2, and in many ways I prefer this game (modded) to Shogun 2, especially in its battles (which is a lot less rock-paper-scissors, with more unit variety too). People love this game and its old engine for a reason. 

All that being said, it's an old game, and it shows. People who've played this game in the past are probably used to it, but if you haven't played it, it's probably more difficult to get into. Bad pathfinding, units getting stuck in awkward melee because one guy is left behind, the simpler campaign map, etc. It also may not work perfectly with modern engines, and you'll have some crashes.

It is still damn fun, so if you're willing to take some risk, buy it when it's on sale and see if you like it. If you do, you'll have quite a number of mods to choose from, and some of them are still being updated to this day.

57,49644662,english,"A disclaimer before I get to the actual review: I am reviewing Medieval II: Total War NOT Total War: Medieval II - Definitive Edition. This game is nothing more than a cash grab, a definitive edition that changes nothing, fixes nothing and runs terribly on high end computers. What's more, before this ""definitive edition"" came out, you could buy Medieval II + Kingdoms for 20 $ total as opposed to 25 $ this garbage cost. So in general: Screw you Sega, I hope you choke on that money.

Now to the review of the actual game. I've spend hundreds of hours playing Medieval II back when steam meant water vapor not the biggest digital storefront. I bought this primarily to leave a positive review. It is in my opinion the best TW game. I love the setting, I love how each faction is different and plays differently, I love the cavalry charges and longbowmen laying waste to approaching infantry. 

This is a game made in much better time, when you unlocked new factions by playing the game not by buying them (shame on you CA and Sega). It's a game that, when you've spend 1/3 of original price on the expansion you got FOUR new campaigns with multiple unique races, not one race added to already existing map with four ""unique"" starting points (who are you trying to fool CA - they all play almost the same).  This is a game where you besieged actual cities and not Helm's deep every freaking time. This is a game where nothing was carved out to sell it as a day one DLC.  This is a damn near perfect strategy game, 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I didn't enjoy later games in TW series, but Medieval II is the game I return to when I want to remind myself what this series once was - a game made with passion and not to stuff the wallets of Sega execs. If you never played TW or only played later installments I highly recommend this game. The graphics look dated but are still pleasant to look upon, especially during battles. Last time I installed this game, I started playing 8 pm and few minutes later it was suddenly 2.30 am.

I spent thousands of hours on the CD-ROM version of the game only to have to download it again on my MAC.

Fight for the Crusades for the glory of christendom, fight to preserve Byzantium and the true descendants of the Roman Empire, fight for Islam and Holy Caliphate and spread the word of Allah, or become Russia and just fight to have loads and loads of empty space, with barely any resources.

The main campaign has an amazing map, with beautiful detail that is still accessible to everyone - system mechanics work really well and the campaign doesn't get too deep into politics and the awkward building of selected buildings which i found later TW games to have.

The Crusade, Jihad and mission system works great and there is truly nothing quite like murdering your way to the top of the Papacy.

The Kingdoms expansion is the best total war expansion giving you 4 additional campaigns - Britannia and Crusades are incredible, and are worth about 100 hours each on their own.

Total War: MEDIEVAL II is a game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by SEGA, it is the sequel to MEDIEVAL: Total War and forms part of the Total War series

The game offers some pleasant graphics and really vibrant colours, although some ugly glitches here and there, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Total War: MEDIEVAL II overall, however, is a fun game to play, yet sometimes flawed, but is a great grand strategy game to play in short bursts!

by default it has 3D image unit cards , i hate that they started using drawn unit cards in subsequent games - these show you what your troops look like without having to go on the battlemap to find out 
this total war game has more slow strategic battle mechanics than more recent total war games especially if you add a mod like stainless steel , which will make walking  your troops like walking your troops and in the end result will cause you to have to be more strategic about moving your troops around  on the battlefield ,you cant just rush them across a kilometer of map into position ,  the mod makes the ai much smarter as well 

still a crazy good game even in 2019 , if you missed it , you missed something , if you never played total war , this is a great place to start

7,48319650,english,"Out of all the Total War games I've played, this is the one I've had the most fun with.

Every faction has a unique playstyle which gives this game extrodinary replayability, both in who you play and whom you wind up fighting.  The music is fantastic and vary's from faction to faction and region to region, which makes the whole world come alive and feel organic.  And every part of the overworld map has been been turned into a unique battle map, meaning there are litterally hundreds of different battle maps you can fight on.  A tall mountain range, a dense forest, a open plain, or behind the walls of your city, choosing your battlefield is very much important in this game.

The game of course is not flawless.  Increasing the difficulty of the game mostly just means that the AI is more agressive and will pick a fight with you more often.  On top of that, when storming a city or a castle, the AI will rarely rely on a strategy beyond ""amass or entire army to one side of the city and try to pour through"" which can be stupid easy to counter when you know what you're doing.  On top of that, naval combat litterally does not exist beyond auto-resolve.  However in all fairness, with how massive the map selection and unit choice for land is in this game, it can be forgiven for skimping on this aspect.

Overall though I feel this is by far one of, if not THE best Total War games out there, although I know it won't be for everyone.  The graphics are thirteen years old as of this writing plus the lack of naval combat and the highly predictable siege battles will be turn offs for some people.  But the breathtaking amount of different troops to play with, the meticulous eye for historical detail, and near infinite replayabilty makes it more than worth it.

So in short, if you like immersive historical strategy games with a wide range of possible play styles for you to choose from, I'd say give this game a try.  If old games with old graphics and no story (other than what you create) plus hyper agressive AI turns you off, then I'd give this game a pass.",1547433579,1547433579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198013658336,448,18,11653,0,11248,1598143319,,

75,47581701,english,"total war medieval 2 is an amazing game with a lot of depth and replayability but dont let that fool you as the game still has many flaws. let me get the pros out of the way. The game has two different parts, real time battles and a turn based overview campaign map. The battles are a blast and are pretty enthralling as you deploy many different strategies and the tides of battle can be turned around at any moment as soldiers can get scared and rout the army.an army losing 1:10 can catch the enemy by suprise with a stray unit and kill the enemies general which can cause a chain rout on the enemy side. artillery can even be used to launch the carcasses of rotting cows which can rout enemies. There are two different battle types: Normal field battles, and sieges where one force has to defend a city or castle. from the other. Field battles are just battles between two to 6 armies on an open plain which can occur anywhere on the campaign map and each location is a different scene. these are fun battles to have as there is a lot of space for you to use your army and deploy various strategies. siege battles on the other hand are much more linear and require more skill and knowledge to win. Artillery can knock down walls or they can be scaled with ladders and siege towers. In multiplayer siege battles require so much teamwork and communication in 2v2 situations. All of this leads to a very diverse and replayable experience which fun every time. The campaign side of things is also very fun, you have to balance your countries economy, armies and relation with the pope (if your a Catholic country) and other countries. You have to control cities, by building new structures  to keep the population happy and under control, to increase trade or to be able to train a more diverse tree of units for your armies. if you cant keep the population of a city or castle under control  the city can revolt and overthrow the governers and your control of the city. You also have to keep your generals, governers and family happy so they dont betray you and give a location or army to another faction and join the other faction.  the main goal is to gain as many territories as possible (45 to win the game) and for some countries a certain territory. For catholic countries you have to conqueor jerusalem. This is an enthralling experience in its own and is massively replayable as there are many different play styles and countries to choose from. Now lets get on to the cons. The ai in this game is massively outdated and can be easily exploited with calvalry which can detract from the experience during battles. Another thing that is terrible is the diplomacy system. Your country is almost always untrustworthy for no fault of your own and diplomats are near useless as every proposal you make is 99% of the time turned down. Its actually retarded. Alliances are pointless as the faction you are allied with will end up attacking you nonetheless and you will always end up getting gangbanged by every country in the late game. This makes every campaign feel the same as you are just repelling attackers constantly and attqacking other countries and not much else. It would be nice to ask allied countries to assist you in a war against another country and for them to accompany your army or something. Another thing thats dumb is merchants. they are fucking useless.

There are few starting factions but after winning one game, all are unlocked, and there are a large amount of factions.

The expansions include: the colonization of the americas, the third crusade, the teutonic wars, and a fight for the british isles.

94,47407971,english,"My first total war game and still perhaps my absolute favorite. The game is extremly simple and the factios are brilliantly balanced. Each faction has unique troops and buildings that add flavor to the game. Unlike other later Total War games all factions are portentially playable. You get rewarded for defeating certain factions entirly, you get to play as that faction. When you win the grand campaign all factions are avaliable to you. I love this feature as it allows for nearly endless replayablity. Not only this but the DLC campaigns are stellar. New factions and units that each have the same level of depth as base game factions. 

To add to the general stratagy the game allows for far more strategic depth than newer games. Newer total war games you are limited to very small numbers of armies. In this game however you can deploy as many armies as you have units (each unit can be an ""army"". This allows you to strategically place troops around to control mountain passes and briges. These armies may become rebel armies if you are not careful so it adds great depth and interesting mechanics. An even better feature that makes this game far superior is the ability to retreat and lose a battle and not have the entire army be whiped out. Modern Total War games cause you to lose your entire army if you retreat and lose a battle, or lose two in a single turn. This means if an ene,y faction beats one of your limited armies you can not recover for quite some time. In this game your armies remain in tact, all be it heavily depleated. This means you can consolidate troops in different locations, forcing you to decide between taking time to retrain your expereinced but weakened units, or just make new ones.

As for the game itself, it is a decent representation of its genre, but it does not overcome its genre's flaws. The flaws mainly have to do with the AI, which is utterly incapable of putting up a fight. This is a single-player game mainly, and the AI is so bad that single player is not a challenge even on the hardest difficulty. A singleplayer campaign is a slog through successive 
fights with AI armies which eat up your time without offering the possibility of defeat. Familiarizing myself with all of the units and mechanics, and witnessing the novelty of mass battles occurring between pixelated miniatures was of mild interest to me. It furnished the early period of my experience with a degree of entertainment sufficient to keep me playing. But eventually the novelty wore off and I was left playing a brokenly easy game with little to no entertainment value.

51,46873115,english,"One of my most treasured moments in my gaming life was my first victory against a larger foe in Medieval: Total War 2. This was because at that time, I thought the game was a realistic simulation of how battles were fought in history. Only after several hours of playing did I realise that the AI had only a few tactics and that you can learn to take advantage of it's dead spots to win outrageous victories, kindof like a Medieval type of circle-strafing. 
Sometimes, though, the AI does it's job and you can have an interesting battle but you have to wait a long time for these to happen. The campaign map is boring and slow, and relies a lot on luck. When you use agents (like assasins or spies) you get lovely cut-scenes that make up a lot. Wonderful! 
The Mongol and Timurid invastions are enormously exciting but they only involve you if you play as an eastern empire. In the west, you might instead go on to invade America but this only takes place at the very end of the campaign and by this time you might already have finished the game, for sure if you play the short game. The long campaign has the trouble of being to easy after the watershed moment halfway through, when you have managed to become the largest empire in you part of the map. The AI players are usually pretty even-keeled so none of them will match your army size. The game becomes too easy and boring at this point. You just want to capture enough castles by that time, a monotonous chore if the enemy will not be able to launch any siginificant counter offensives. 
Another big problem for this game is the prevalence of bugs, especially because they can decide the outcome of battles in a frustratingly unfair way. For example, in mountainous area's, the enemy bowmen may appear on top of an unclimbable rock. They pick off some of your men and you can't approach them. The only thing you can do is give up and the game kills a number of your men as a punishment. Crummy! The other bug that pops up often is the sleepy attacker. It happened a lot when I was defending my cities against the mongols. I managed to knock out their catapults and as a consequence, the Mongol hordes just stood there shouting at me. This gave me two choices, attack them head on (and be killed) or quit the battle (and be killed). Maybe this is how the Mongols were able to conquer the largest land empire in the world?

Anyway, this is just a series of negative points. But you criticize what you love, isn't it? I believe this could have been the best strategy game ever if some of the above points weren't there. 
Definitily play this game until you've defeated a stronger foe in a huge battle. Feel like El Cid or Suleiman and image you celebrate with huge casks of wine (or shisha pipes) with your men afterwards.

26,27785547,english,"This game really stands the test of time. Its old, looks old but the gameplay is still fun its better then the newer historical game in terns of depth but not as deep as crusader king II however but is more freindly to new comer to the these types of games, plus this game has live battles you can fight making for some epic moments.

Story time: I had married my princess to get a epic general with amazing trait that gave his army high moral and himself a high HP pool. however he wasn't able to return to my kingdom because he couldn't move for the first turn and he was just in range of a enemy army.
So i hastle recruited a few mercernary knights and spearmen. I was really scared for losing him and the princess I used to get him first of his line. This man would one day become the King of France.

Right as I expected the enemy force attacked me and I couldn't withdraw and I hadn't saved either. I thought to myself if he is going to die I'll give it all I got.
The enemy out numberd me by 10/1 first thing I did was let the enemy come closer and attack the few spears I had while the cavalry was hidding in the woods. I charged the crossbows units because my frontline had already broken. The enemy cavalry charged and so did I however they didn't stand a chance against my elite bodyguard and with some flank charges with my mercenery cav. However what was left was the enemy general with health stacks of heavy infantry running down my infantry. What happend after that me isolating a single unit and charging them from both sides however I soon lost all my cavalry due to some of them dying on the charge. With only 6 man left of my bodyguard and my general I charged the isolated general still with full hp.
The two generals where facing off mine was already wounded but that didn't stop him. The two generals exchanged blows 1 after the other anyone of these blows could mean the end but then, somehow, my general managed to strike his sword through his armor and droping the horse he was riding on killing him. With only him left now I retreited with the dead generals bodyguard running after me and then my general broke moral and fleed so he didn't die.

A few turns later he was back with a full stack to take his vengance.

-CONS-
AI is pretty bad and can be abused (Hasn't improved much in newer TW Games)
Some units are glitchy and dont work like intended. (Pikemen and Two-handed)
Mongols are annoying to fight and not as epic as hoped.
Seige battles vs AI isn't very good.
Diplomecy is very shallow.

-PROS-
Deep mechanics something that used to be normal in games back in the day.
Traits are fun to mess around with and creating a picture what your King/general would act like.
Easy to learn.
Historical battles are fun and creates unique a challages to overcome.
Can be moded (Strainless Steel, Lord of the Rings).

Campaign is long enough that it feels worthwhile to put many hours into it.

Brilliant live battles play out seamlessly with good controls, allowing you to control most aspects you would want to for your troops.

Would say anyone interested in total war or strategy games should give it atleast a try. If achievements were added there would be far more replay value for the campaign, but this game is 100% worth the price.

To improve, the game could have more in depth diplomacy as with EU4, better border changes rather than by whole province, and a city-building scheme like with CIV games.",1519939742,1542679081,True,0,0,0.491606712341308594,0,True,False,False,76561198343786250,60,22,12977,0,11742,1542491698,,

Details: It is the Lord of the Rings game every total war fan always wanted. High Elves, Dwarves, Cave Trolls, Elephant riders, Units of 250 orcs, Ents, it goes on. Epic battles that can field over 4K troops. There are even themed maps, such as Moria (my most favorite), Isenguard, the Black Gate (my favorite), and way more.

And it is far more loved then Total War Warhammer. 14 factions from the start each with their own objectives, and a Fellowship of the ring campaign thrown on top.

43,45816995,english,"The Crusades were a series of religious wars sanctioned by the Latin Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known Crusades are the campaigns in the Eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule, but the term ""Crusades"" is also applied to other church-sanctioned campaigns. These were fought for a variety of reasons including the suppression of paganism and heresy, the resolution of conflict among rival Roman Catholic groups, or for political and territorial advantage. At the time of the early Crusades the word did not exist, only becoming the leading descriptive term around 1760. 
In 1095, Pope Urban II called for the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He encouraged military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, Alexios I, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonizing Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East–West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself as head of the unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church. Some were hoping for a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God's forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain. 
The two-century attempt to recover the Holy Land ended in failure. Following the First Crusade there were six major Crusades and numerous less significant ones. After the last Catholic outposts fell in 1291, there were no more Crusades; but the gains were longer lasting in Northern and Western Europe. The Wendish Crusade and those of the Archbishop of Bremen brought all the North-East Baltic and the tribes of Mecklenburg and Lusatia under Catholic control in the late 12th century. In the early 13th century the Teutonic Order created a Crusader state in Prussia and the French monarchy used the Albigensian Crusade to extend the kingdom to the Mediterranean Sea. The rise of the Ottoman Empire in the late 14th century prompted a Catholic response which led to further defeats at Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444. Catholic Europe was in chaos and the final pivot of Christian–Islamic relations was marked by two seismic events: the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 and a final conclusive victory for the Spanish over the Moors with the conquest of Granada in 1492. The idea of Crusading continued, not least in the form of the Knights Hospitaller, until the end of the 18th-century but the focus of Western European interest moved to the New World. 
Modern historians hold widely varying opinions of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied moral authority of the papacy, as evidenced by the fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades had a profound impact on Western civilisation: Italian city-states gained considerable concessions in return for assisting the Crusaders and established colonies which allowed trade with the eastern markets even in the Ottoman period, allowing Genoa and Venice to flourish; they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that galvanised medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced a connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.

45,45795064,english,"TLDR: Great TW game and is still my go-to TW game over the newer ones. 

Before I lost my old account, I had another ~200 hours on that one. As far as world mechanics and strategy goes, this has always been my favorite TW. Still, I have a couple gripes that I'll lay out below. 

Pros:

- (Once all unlocked) huge, unique choices for nations spanning across all of Europe and West Africa. Russia is weirdly a full nation here, but other than that most are fairly accurate to their portrayal as far as positioning and power rankings goes. 

- Rewarding in-campaign progression, you feel your armies improve vastly with each unit upgrade. You also see the disipline of your soldiers who are ranked more with battle experience, they tend to stay and fight rather than run away

- The integration of the church is awesome. It's a ass kissing game for who can win the popes praise/favor. And when the Pope dies, a new one gets elected. If your nation is the most religous (has the most priests/catholics in your territory), you get the power to elect one of your own to become the next Pope. The most valuable part of this is that the Pope can biasly call for a Crusade against any nation that is at war with you. Note though, that the vice versa can happen if an enemy nation get's their guy elected as Pope. The Pope also hires Inquisitors that can execute enemy generals for heracy. 

-Siege battles are great, good mix of breaching options including rams, ladders, towers, balistas, catapults, trebuchets, and (very late period) cannons. Huge/max upgraded cities have 3 layers of walls for you to breach, and battles can get bloody and personal.



Mixed/Cons:

-Political system makes literally no sense *sometimes*. Multiple nations feelings towards you would go to ""Abysmal"" (the worst it can get) after they attacked you first and you beat them, as if somehow this was your fault. Diplomacy at this point is almost non-existant. When you offer a ceasefire to a nation that is clearly not going to win the war, the AI persists on continuing the conflict no matter what you offer. And I mean, NO MATTER WHAT. Example: I just completed a Holy Roman Empire campaign, and tried making peace with Hungary due simply to their pesky raids on one of my border towns. I've offered them 10k, 20k, 30k, 40k, + 1, 2 and even 3 settlements. As well as trade rights, map info etc. Then its just ""firmly rejected"". And I look at their power rankings and their military is weak and their economy is set to bankrupt. 

-Some generated maps can get really glitchy with large armies, where units won't go where you told them to, or just constantly run back and forth between 2 spots. This though, is rare and also forgivable being the scale of this game at the time it released.


All in all, great TW experience. Desparately waiting for a true Medieval 3 to come out instead of expansions like Britannia.",1542115297,1542115297,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False,76561198076176974,250,23,5169,0,4552,1576125312,,

This is my call to arms, we must call the remaining loyal banners and rally all allied houses to this cause dear friends for we are in dire and bleak times.   We are on the absolute precipice of all out war acrossed the entire Known World.  The time has come to put down your torches and pitchforks of civilian life and pick up your torches and pitchforks of WAR!

As a great king once said back in what seemed a mythological era: ""Ask not what your king can do for you, ask what you can do for your king!"".  In this case your king is Total War™! We mustn't falter and we musn't fail in our righteous and just Crusade for the uplifting of each and every Total War™ merchandise assessment on Steam.

One man of almost mythological standing has words of wisdom that reverberate throughout time immemorial.  These words still ring true and are highly applicable in this era of humanity:  ""I have a dream that one day my four little children will live in Medieval II: Total War™  (or Rome II: Total War™ ) times where whether they grow into men or women they aren't judged for their gender but rather by their ability as a general, a leader of WOMEN and/or MEN! I have a dream today!""

81,45400824,english,"One of the best games in the Total War series, Medieval 2: Total War is all about conquering the map and hoping the pope doesn't excommunicate you, if you are playing a Catholic faction of course. There are plenty of factions to play with unique playstyles. I also used to play this game a lot when it was not on Steam, I can't tell how many hours I played this title. That's how much I like this game. There are very few annoying bugs and glitches in this game, but it is barely noticeable.

If you want to expand your playtime, I would recommend getting some of the mods that are finished for this game, like, Stainless Steel, Third Age: Total War. There are a lot more mods than this to play too, so try them out as well when you get the chance, you may like it.

That being said, I would definetly recommend this game if you like Strategy titles or into Total War games, which im sure you already got it ;)

No... It's great. One of the best strategy games I've played, actually.

The campaign side requires the player to make some strategic decisions - not many and not that difficult ones, but they do have consequences and, contrary to popular belief, it's possible to lose a campaign (because the AI cheats).
In battle, all units have a direct counter, so it's fairly balanced (Alternative view: cavalry, archers and pikemen are all severely overpowered. That would make most of the units in the game and they all counter each other). The military tactics you end up using tend to be surprisingly historically accurate, unless you exploit the AI, which is quite easy because the game is quite old.
The graphics are decent for a 15-year-old game, not so much now. It's also poorly optimised for modern systems, can only use 2 GB of your RAM and only a single core of your processor - not that much of an issue for the base game and its expansions, however...
This game is extremely moddable, there are many conversion mods, both historical and fantasy. I've spent far more time playing the mods than the base game. These mods tend to upgrade the graphics to the point that the game's poor optimisation can't handle it - some crashes are to be expected then.
The in-game music is well done and fits the atmosphere, both in laid back campaign sections and in action-intensive real time battles. The soundtrack might be worth listening on its own.

Compared to modern TW games... I tried to enjoy the new graphics etc in the newer TW games, but just can't get past the brutal micro on cities, generals, and can't have armies without generals, can't have AI support option on lets say a calvary stack to back your main army... list goes on and on.

Sega and Creative Assembly have chosen their side and it`s not with us gamers. 

They have consistently shown that they are anti-consumer with their poor overall new game quality. They push out sequals as fast as possible and discontinue support for whatever came before, despite glaring issues in their games. They are poorly optimized and polished and serve only as cash cows for the developers to milk for a short time with DLCs that should have been included in the game from the beggining. I`m talking pay to play already in game factions and that sort of shady stuff. Not even new content.

Furthermore, they seem to have caught the SJW cancer that has been spreading around of late and would rather push an ideological/political agenda than create a game for their fans. When called out on this they choose to insult and even silence said fans for daring to have an alternate opinion. ""If you dont like the game either mod or just not play"". Women simply did not, and still don`t, play a leading role in world conficts. Ever. Accept it. The facts don`t care about your feelings.

Also, they add spyware to their games and lie about it. These people feel entitled to your information. So much so that they don`t even think they should have to tell you about it. Absolutley zero ethics from Creative Assembly.

CA said they don`t want people like us, you know their fan base, buying their games. Well heed the call gamers. CA and Total War are done. Their hayday long past. Put them out of their misery and stop supporting SEGA, Creative Assembly, and unfortunatley Total War (the innocent child in all of this).",1538185228,1538185228,False,9,2,0.357947707176208496,0,True,False,False,76561198148310626,61,4,7480,0,7389,1462664189,,

Pros:
1. In Medieval total war, it has wide variations of troops that can be upgraded by some events or simply upgrade your armorer
2. You need to maintain your income, how many troops you have(u have to pay the upkeep cost),etc. Really training yourself to be the next fuhrer. lol
3. Some random events/disaster/etc may occured, so be well prepared
4. Totally worth it if you like war tactics. You can win a battle with 800 army against 1000-2000 with correct strategy, just dont be a fool that charge your heavy cavalry to speargay tho.
5. Not so easy to learn, nor easy to master. Take your time, and be prepared to lose your sense of time
.....
666. So many pros actually that cant be written here. So, this game really worth the price.. Or maybe you wanna wait for 85% discount

Cons:
1. If ure looking for simple game, this isnt for you(srsly this game is epic, i dont even want to put this on cons list)
2. The pathfinding script of troops still crap compared to latest total war game(well this game is old, what d u expect?). You may find the crappy pathfinding especially when invading castle. When you wanna flank your enemy in the town centre, you may want your knights to take different route and hold other exits so you can charge in from the rear. But, what happen is your knight confused whether which route to use so they may stop in the middle of the road or even walk out of the gate like stupid. Lol. But trust me, this game still badass.
3. I dunno whether its me and bunch of other player that surpassed the requirements of the game but still facing stutter/fps drop/etc when playing.

The dawn of the Great Milanese Empire was a time rife with war, for there is not a moment of peace within the many centuries that the Milanese were ever at peace, that is, until the end. At first, it was with the disparate Italian states around it, held within the looming vassalage of the Kaiser of Holy Rome. Milan itself was much too influential to be held under the shackles of the Germans, and so they grew in power.

Sicily insulted the Milanese, taking an island that the former had already claimed. In the heat of the moment, the Grand Duke declared war, and quickly took Naples. After several months of intense battle, the Venetians marched onto Milan. The Grand Duke himself led the breakout, leaving only two survivors. Quickly after, Venice was marched upon, and utterly crushed. The populace of the great capital was purged. An act that the venetians have still never forgave. After which, Zagreb was also taken, the armies easily being driven out. The Pope was dissatisfied of the Milanese ways of warfare, and tension grew between the two states. One utterly dwarfing the world. In order to help such relations, the Grand Duke sailed in the Grand Crusade, taking Egypt for himself and God. Although temporary, it eased the tension on Italy.

Then, the world ground against Milan. War after war, slaughter after slaughter, the Milanese became a force that the world could not stop. The mongols were but a small stir in the east. Their grand, continental army but a dwarf to the Milanese crossbowmen and knights. The once powerful state of Holy Rome fell city after city, and the pope had no choice but to excommunicate Milan, only to find Rome under siege, and the next several popes to be put to the blade. Most of Italy was under the Milanese, a self proclaimed 'New Rome'. The southern french, the Occitan and those in Narbonne quickly fell to the blade. Holy Rome split into warring Duchies. Sicily is but a coalition of Islands with hardly any army. The Pope in Rome lies beyond the alps, far from the Peninsula.

Milan marches ever forward, every battle ending the same way. All but several men left, for the Italian empire slew the rest.",1534715430,1534715430,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198136653248,94,15,17794,0,17280,1595900472,,

55,44169379,english,"For a review purpose, there isn't much to add that hasn't been covered by other gamers here. For me, this is THE Total War game, having played this from 2006 onward. Its gameplay qualities are phenomenal for a strategy game (especially with the added features from the ""Kingdoms"" add-on) and graphics-wise still holds up to today's standards. With some tweaking and modding, this can easily be mistaken for a 2010 era game, especially with highest graphical setting.

My personal reason to like this game lies in its amazing convertability for different mods. I haven't touched the base game for years (since for my personal expectations it doesn't offer enough variation, it's a wonderful foundation though), the 2100+ hours record has all been spent playing total conversion mods that offer plethora of different campaigns, concepts etc.. These are the reason I return to this game every now and then, wasting hundreds of hours for epic battles, conquest and strategy.

I encourage you search and install any mods that suit your tastes, be it a small scale gameplay improvement mod or total conversion, the modding community of M2:TW will provide. My personal favorites (which I heartily recommend to you) include:

""Third Age Total War"" (with ""Divide and Conquer"" submod) - Lord of the Rings themed conversion
""Stainless Steel"" - improves the basis of the original platform, adding new factions, units and such. Unfortunately on hold indefinitely...
""Europa Barbarorum II"" - following the original ""Rome: Total War"" submod, this changes the campaign setting to ancient Europe (ie. Roman era), aiming for historical accuracy. Better than ""Rome 2"", no question.

This is hands down my favourite game to date, truly sating my needs for strategic faction management and epic warfare. The Total War games that followed became more and more graphically pleasing, that's for sure, but unlike M2:TW they pushed for pointless limitations (restricting the number of buildings per province etc.) or stripped great features. For example, in M2:TW units have a limited pool each that takes a few turns to refresh, elite units doing so more slowly. Thus there is a need to mix peasant armies with elites (in a realistic fashion) until you once again have elites to recruit. Not so much in newer games where once you have access to elites you can just buy them infinitely, thus (unless you roleplay) as long as you have enough money, you can steamroll everything with max stacks of elite knights or whatnot, making lower grade units pointless. This is just one of the features of the game I love and if you ask me, should be implemented in future titles. 

There's so much more to say about this game, so much to love... but you get the idea. In short, the best Total War game, and personally the best strategy game I've yet to play.

Europe, North Africa, and the Near East during the High Middle Ages and Early Modern Period provides a depth and variety that few of the other games ever accomplish, despite the limitations imposed by rather simple campaign mechanics. For example, there is not an independent tech tree and all technological advances are made through the building tree much like Rome: TW. Food is not an issue at a faction level as it is in later games and I think the setting would have been enhanced by more campaign level innovations such as a more nuanced and deeper faction quest and Papal quest system (the feudal system of this era could be better represented thus) and the various agents (priests, spies, assassins, and merchants) don't add much added depth as they were probably intended to and could have been better used. For exmaple, perhaps merchants could have been used to influence the politics of another faction.  In a way, the simplicity of the campaign game (moving armies, recruiting soldiers and agents, and building up settlements) keeps the focus on the real-time tactical battles which are excellent. The units are varied and set-piece and siege battles are truly challenging and fun. I personally enjoy the Early Modern era of the game when you begin fielding gunpowder armies. This forces you to change tactics to take advantage of the new units. The graphics are dated and the game definitely shows its age. I think a remaster by Creative Assembly would be a welcome and economical way to diversify their game portfolio for those who are tired of Ancient Rome, are turned off by the limited focus of Thrones of Britannia, and may not be interested in the upcoming Chinese setting of TW: Three Kingdoms. But despite this, the game is still highly playable and the tactical battles are still impressive, especially when watching your Gothic Knights charge with lances down against an isolated unit of Pavise Crossbowman.

20 years later, the heroic Englishmen who crushed the Holy Roman Empire are killed off by the Black Plague.

Now for some bad things, like annoying mechanics, like the Pope, you can be on the cusp of winning but then get cucked for attacking a catholic faction, but later this can be abused when you control the pope, which is easy. Another thing is the AI sucks, they are almost impossible to deal with, ceasefires are impossible even on the brink of victory. They will always hate you if you border them, even if you have been allies for half the game. Ai can also be abused in fortresses they have to go back to get seige weapons whch enables them to take too much archer fire.

83,43689819,english,"Medieval 2 Total war is one of my favorite games of all time, due to several factors that make this game great even without mods. It has truly stested time and has stayed alive even in multiplayer. This can be endless hours of fun and provide an immersive experience that combines titles like CK2 and Hegemony 3 into one game while simplifying the aspects of those games so that the game itself is easy to jump into.

The real thing that makes Total war itself shine is both the massive amount of playable nations and the era that this game resides in. The medieval ages are a dynamic period that has lots of challenging but well timed events like the mongol invasion and the black death, along with technological advances that can flip your plans on it's head if exploited. Every nation feels unique and has a particular feel. The French have awesome cavalry, while the English have great longbowmen and infantry. The germans have a well rounded and unique late game army, and the spaniards have the best navy, and all the units are different in design save for a few standard ones throught the western and eastern worlds.

The campaign feels dynamic and even thrilling at times, whether you fight to the death in your last citidel or lord over a massive and ever expanding empire, the game will not dissapoint. The AI are unpredictable and make bold choices, and wars feel like they matter both logistically and in reality.

The in game economy is complex, but also simple enough for new players to grasp. Trade can be a viable option, while farming and population growth brings more tax. You can reap the spoils of war booty as vikings or outclass foriegn merchants.

I also love how the muslim nations were not ignored, making them completely unique from europe and presenting them with a whole new slew of challenges; and prospective goals! Calling a Jihad never felt so satisfying.

Medieval II Total War was the fourth installation of the Total War series and the sequel to the second installation, Medieval Total War. Riding on the coattails of the huge success that was Rome Total War, MIITW begins in the year 1080 A.D. and is a classic in video game history. It should be noted that my first Total War game was Rome and that I have never played either Shogun or Medieval Total War. With that said, let's get started.

[b]PROS[/b]

+ The campaign map was the largest in Total War history at the time in terms of pure land mass coverage, as they included the eastern coast of the Americas. As I understand, it is still now the fourth largest map by land mass coverage in Total War history behind Empire, Warhammer, and Warhammer II.

+ I believe it still maintains the second largest pool of playable factions (17) behind only Rome II (26). Only the Papal States, Mongols, Timurids, Aztecs, and Rebels are unplayable by default.

+ Offers an excellent selection of short movies throughout the campaign which add an extra level of immersion.

+ Personally my favorite with regards to agents. In addition to diplomats, spies, and assassins (which were available in RTW), religious agents make an appearance. As a Catholic, for instance, recruiting priests is a must in order to please the Pope and maintain religious order throughout your lands. Heretics and witches will sow heresy and must be burned at the stake, and success will improve that agent's ability and standing within the Vatican. Female agents play a vital role here, as princesses can engage in diplomacy and negotiate dynastic marriage alliances.

+ CRUSADES.

+ Home to some of the greatest mods in video game history, including a total overhaul mod called Third Age Total War (I'd recommend just on this fact). Also, back during the 2012 American Presidential race, someone made a mod where two armies consisting entirely of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney fight each other to the bitter, bloody end. It's fantastic.

+ Good news! Nearly all of what follows in the neutrals and cons can be modded-out or altered in the game files!

+ DEUS VULT.


[b]NEUTRALS[/b]

0 While there is a wide range of units from different cultures, most factions have access to the same units. For instance, only England can recruit longbowmen and only Spain can recruit Conquistadors, but both will find that the majority of their army at some point will consist of dismounted feudal knights or levy spearmen or peasant archers, etc. A battle can be extremely colorful, but it can also be extremely dull in regards to unit variety. It all depends.

0 Whether or not you like the battle engine is a matter of preference. Basically what they did was attempt to make the movement of units on the battle map more realistic. When given an order, units don't just turn on a dime, they actually have to receive the order, acknowledge it, turn around, start to run, accelerate, and NOW are finally in full stride. This does result in a more [i]realistic[/i] reaction to orders in comparison to RTW, but to me it just comes accross as clumsy and annoying.

[b]CONS[/b]

- The game begins in 1088 and ends in 1530. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""Holy shit, that's like 250 years!"" And you're right, except that for whatever reason, each turn is two years. Like... what the fuck were they thinking? There's still a summer/winter cycle, but characters still age 1 year per turn... which means that William the Conqueror will be 58 in 1,112 A.D. which is straight-up ludicrous. They were trying to make it so that the characters live for roughly as many turns as they do in Rome, but it just comes off as ridiculous.

- It might be the ugliest Total War ever made. I see what they were trying to do, which I shall elaborate on here: First, they added different stats for different body parts (torso, arms, etc.) which are differently armored and take different damage. However, to visually distinguish this, they totally redid the character models from RTW. Second, to add visual weight, they made weapons and projectiles bulkier, which is mostly successful, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Third, they rounded as many of the blocky corners we saw in RTW as they could. The result is, in my humble opinion, the ugliest Total War game I have ever played. Yes, I think it's even worse than Rome, which looks simply ancient by today's standards, but Medieval II is just... gross. There are mods to change this, of course, and there are parts I do think are at least pretty (like armored knights) but Christ, it can be hard to look at at times.

- They had yet to quite figure out the AI in a lot of ways. The result ranges from hilarious incompetence to unbelievable meanness.

[b]TL;DR/CONCLUSION[/b]

It's Medieval II. You love it or you hate it, or both. Personally, it's both for me.

49,42912312,english,"Medieval 2 might be the greatest strategy game ever created. 

This isn't nostalgia speaking. I didn't touch the game until 2015. It's that good. By some miracle, this buggy 2005 sequel with barely functioning AI manages to have grand campaigns and battles with a myriad of depth and replayability. On top of that, there's over a decades worth of mods; some extremely well crafted. It's kind of amazing how the sequel to Rome: Total War (widely considered to be one of the best games of all time) manages to improve on nearly every aspect of Rome while playing differently. 

The campaigns genuinely feel like you're constructing an empire. Rather than a boring ""build this to recruit this,"" there's a broad amount of customization and micromanaging that leeways into specialized areas. Some cities will be used as a trade hub. Some castles will be used to raise knights. Some castles will be used to create professional infantry and level up armour. Ect... If you're engaged with the building system, you end up with hub areas that will affect what units and strategies you'll use on certain fronts. In addition, cities (and the campaign in general) have many systems that are abusable by the player. Don't want to besiege a settlement? Send in spies to create unrest. Don't want the AI repairing damages to its cities? Blockade its port. Don't like the pope pestering you? Start a crusade to take back Jerusalem. Speaking of the Pope, many of the overarching hierarchies in the campaign are what make it so special to this day. One of the problems with Rome 1 was, after the player took the city of Rome, there were no more special elements in place to prevent the player from steamrolling everyone. While the Civil War with 3 other Roman factions was interesting, it pretty much marked the end of any challenge. Medieval 2 has the church you constantly need to deal with in some manner, the other religious which will ally against you if you pose a threat to their existence, the invasion of the Mongols at a dedicated point in time, and constant advancements in technology that change the game. It's kind of overwhelming for a first time play through, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's great. If you act with the grace of the Roman Empire the whole world will be united under multiple bands knocking on your front door.

In a game where nearly all factions have access to heavy infantry and cavalry, it's marvelous how there is still faction diversity. While not as pronounced as Rome 1's, it's there. Different kingdoms have a general set of identical units, and then access to more special units, and then they're own unique units. This is just enough to make every faction play differently (mostly. There are a couple of redundancies). More importantly is how the battles play, and Medieval 2 has, by a country mile, thee most elements and options of every Total War game to this date. There's archers, crossbowmen, skirmishers, spearmen, heavy infantry, 2-handed units, pikemen/halberdiers, firearms,  cannons, ancient siege equipment, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, and horse archers. Each unit has its own role, and (unlike later Total Wars) they don't exist in a basic rock-paper-scissors format. Rather, a lot of it boils down to the tactics each player employs. It's kind of hard to explain without giving an example, so I'll go over how the knight works. 

Knights are heavily armored, have a powerful charge, can break any unit of infantry in one rear charge, and are highly mobile. The downside is they're expensive, suck when they don't have room to maneuver, and are expensive, meaning they don't trade cost efficiently on a 1 to 1 basis. You would think this means Knights just charge everything, but that really isn't the case. Multiple units have situationally dependent counters. All ranged units will get destroyed by knights, but can trade favorably if they can get enough volleys off in time. Spearmen and Heavy Infantry counter knights well because they get a bonus against cav and have the same melee stats but contain more men per unit, respectively. So infantry can defeat knights, but not if the knights charge from behind. But getting behind an enemy requires some outmaneuvering, which will require other units. Light Cav will straight-up lose to Knights in an honest engagement, but can harass Knights with a charge whenever their back is undefended, while also being able to outrun Knights. Horse archers pretty heavily counter knights, but not if they get cornered. Pikemen chew through cavalry, but are outright useless when hit on a flank.

Do you see why this is so amazing? Knights are about breaking the enemy by plowing right into a unit (preferably from behind). However, they can still charge head on and win, but the trade may not be economical. With that said, it still may create a breakthrough for the rest of the army to capitalize on. Knights are countered by Horse Archers, but that situation can be completely turned around if the Horse Archers are outmaneuvered by the Knights. Instead of ""I have X unit therefore I counter Y,"" Medieval 2 is about ""I have X unit in Z situation therefore I can do A, B, and C against Y each with their own pros and cons.""

I feel like the multiplayer being active to this day speaks to the quality of the battles. They are a complex mind game about exploiting thee most minor of advantages to completely topple an entire army. Medieval 2 has its flaws (such as the AI being well below mediocre. The micromanaging of settlements in the late game is abhorrently tedious), and it fails at properly communicating a lot of its core mechanics, but it's an absolutely beautiful game.",1529623207,1529623207,True,63,5,0.834063172340393066,4,True,False,False,76561198068412201,188,23,8697,0,8330,1547003472,,
50,41633095,english,"I would still recommend this game even though i don't particularly like it in a lot of ways, since my opinion is not shared by many.

Many call this the greatest total war game ever made, and whilst it certainly has one of the best single player campaign experiences and certainly the best soundtrack (just listen to ""crusaders"" and tell me it doesnt), the single thing that draws me to any total war game is the battles, and i'm afraid this game lacks in that department.

It's far from both the worst and best for the battles - it doesn't have the buggy retarded nature of troop movement and combat in Empire, and the latest total war games (with the warscape engine), which look like complete moshpits, but there's nothing particularly stunning about it in my opinion.

Most of the factions work in pretty much the same way: you want to tie your opponent's army down to a nasty position with your infantry so that you can crush them with your cavalry, so as long as you have a good enough army, the battles will basically all be the same. This makes the strategies available in combat limited to me, unlike in Rome: Total war where every faction works completely differently because there are much more restrictions on unit types, eg the Scythians have almost no infantry at all, whereas the romans have almost no cavalry, which makes playing as the different factions much more interesting to me, and that's what keeps me from putting more hours into this game. This problem is not as bad in this game as others like Shogun 2, where all of the factions are literally the same, but it still means that there is not really much to go on when choosing factions for a custom battle.
Also, cavalry in this game seems a little bit overpowered - it almost breaks my immersion to see just a few horses surrounded by at least twice as many infantry soldiers once they have stopped charging, just refusing to die (though I guess I admire their constitution level),

As for the campaign, yes it's probably one of the best campaigns - there's so much more content and strategies available here than in rome: total war. However, if you want a good strategy campaign, you need to stop playing Total War and start playing Paradox strategy games like Europa Universalis 4 - i see no reason to play Medieval 2 for it's campaign given the infinitely more in-depth strategic challenge offered by these games - EU4 for example, which i have invested over 100 hours in and still barely understand many of it's mechanics, so there's still so much more to explore in that game than this.

I think you should play total war games for the battle strategy, and paradox games for the campaign, so this game is really the opposite of what it should be, but i'd be lying if i said i havent enjoyed the little time i have spent in it.

Here is a summary:

Pros:
Excellent soundtrack - you can really get engrossed in the battles with the pounding music in the background, its fun just watching the battle take place and listening to this (albeit it hasnt made me play this game for that long).
Excellent campaign for a total war game.

Cons:
For me at least, doesnt offer anything interesting that i can't get twice as good in another game:
Rome: Total war has battles that are twice as good, Europa Universalis 4 has a campaign that is twice as good.

Would I recommend it: Of course, it seems my opinion is quite unpopular so there's a good chance you'll love this game, especially if you've never heard of ""total war"". If you can truly love this game and spend 500+ hours in it, I envy you. However, if you've played a total war game before, especially Rome, then there's some chance that you'll only be disappointed for the reasons i've stated above.",1524432520,1529515544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056950970,96,3,242,0,227,1562621126,,

The campaign: It is neat to have to send diplomats to settlements or armies of other nations to engage in diplomacy and the rebels i like this feture in the earlier total wars as you can conquer an empire quickly with out the threats of enemy alliances or the pope. The Pope is a great feature as he can be an ally or an enemy because of your own desicions. Multiplayer(Battles): The battles are amazing with the different time periods makes it more immersive and the feature where 4 knights can attack one spearman is better than one on one combat in the newer games and the level of battle is neat such as when you have lost 3/4 of your army yet you capture the enemy settlment or your charge all your cavalry and you win the battle because of it this is what I like about a total war game. DLC(Policy,Is it worth it): Kingdoms DLC is a great expansion as it is has more than you expect with 4 new campaigns that have new factions and some old factions new maps and new ways to play and CA's policy in the old games are great one large or a few that are cheap and worthwhile.

Here are some reasons why you should try it out:

1. The combat simulation is quite realistic and very immersive. The battlefields and cities are huge, and each battle will vary in weather, terrain, and hour of day. No two battles feel the same, and will demand that you employ different strategies.

2. There's nothing stopping you from playing a campaign exactly how you want to. If you want to sail across the map and pillage random cities, you can do that. If you want to annex you neighbor or backstab an ally, you can do that whenever you want to. If you want to send your king on the frontlines, you can do that. It makes plenty of room for your creativity. 

3. It's very easy to understand. This game doesn't have an elaborate UI, trade system, or diplomacy system like say EU4. Once you're comfortable moving your army around the battle map, there's not much else to wrap your head around.

81,42433742,english,"Medieval II brings the Total War series back to a simpler, more focused vision. Everything you do is designed to build larger armies or a better economy, which in turn means your large armies won't get angry about late payments and plunder your realms as payment. With the satisfying gameplay loop of building up cities to watch the tax roll in, and managing your castles and armies against traitorous bastard AI, it somehow manages to feel like both a relaxing builder game and a tense balancing act of war. 

The agents all feel useful, with diplomats and princesses securing alliances or bribes, assassins and spies providing intel and an easy way to increase your ruler's authority (by murdering half of Europe's generals), and the unique merchants who add some depth and dynamism to the economic war you wage. The RTS battles feel vicious, with the older engine providing better collision than the newer shinier ones. Units act like more of a single blob, which can be both good and bad depending on if it's a highly disciplined footsoldier unit or a rabble of peasants getting stuck on corners and trapped between charging knights. And my god, if lanced knights in this game get a good charge in, you'll see why they were the ultimate killing machine in IRL battles too. This is made harder by the pathfinding though, better than Rome but still wonky. 

And then there's the mods, which range from realistic and depth-adding expansions like Stainless Steel to Planetwar, which defies description and deserves its own review. Overall definitely worth getting even if you have no nostalgia for the series, at least until they make Medieval III (pls).",1527890273,1527890273,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198072164291,514,12,21014,0,15338,1554996265,,
82,42427151,english,"Well, I guess I'm kinda fed up with medieval Europe. I bought this ages ago because I fondly remembered the original Shogun: Total War, simple as it was. Shogun introduced me to the history of Japan and since many things about it were unknown and foreign to me, it was pretty interesting and a nice game to whittle hours away. Medieval II: Total War seemed busier and it was happening in the ole' Cheeze Peninsula, also known as Europe, and since i'm from there it just seemed kind of uninteresting.

I suppose I'm not the target audience, but then take it this way: The total war formula isn't necessarily appealing to everyone unless the setting itself is exotic or intrigueing enough. Sure, medievalists among my friends might find it fun, but it's a bit too niche to give it a broad recommend.

I'd give it a thumbs down, but you're very likely to get it for not very much, and it has no achievements attached so getting it won't mess up your completion statistics and if you happen to be the target audience you might like it.

Pros:

> Variety of factions

> Super cool how certain events happen during the time line (like the mongol invasion or the Aztecs
> You really feel in control of your kingdom ranging from buildings, infantry and deciding who to ally with and who to marry/adopt.
> Fun - I have never been any good at stratergy games but this game is just so fun and captures you into the game world that you can't help but play

Cons:
> After a full campagin, you tend to have experienced the majority of the game and will probs take a break before jumping back in as it does feel repetitive after a while.

98,42190097,english,"Medieval II: Total War is a fantastic, yet tedious game.

The battles are grand, strategic, and visually stunning for the age of this game. Watching your soldiers charge and clash against enemy armies is truly a remarkable sight. Leading them, setting formations, routing enemy flanks, and finally crushing those that surrender is very satisfying. 

The statecraft is also great. As you build up your nation, you see the land and cities transform with the improvements that you build. When you build roads, you see them; when you build markets and ports, you see carriages trading on the roads you build. I know it is a small detail, but it makes such a large and satisfying difference to see that your improvements change the tangible world and do not merely increase numbers or statistics. 

This is where the game shines. I so deeply enjoyed building markets, roads, and ports to facilitate trade in my land. I enjoyed building beautiful churches to spread and defend the faith. I genuinely felt a sense of accomplishment improving city walls, building towers, exploiting the resources of the land with mines (which also appear in the world), and overall improving the state. I actually enjoyed this more than the war mechanic.

But the game fails in diplomacy. Listen, I understand that the name of the game is Total War, but does that mean that you have to constantly be at war? At times, the AI would attack at random when we had good previous relations, and when they were clearly beaten, they would not surrender. This forces you to forget the deep nation building mechanics of the game to completely concentrate on war and wipe out the enemy entirely because the AI will likely never surrender. It does not make sense. Why waste your time creating complex building mechanics when in the end, you have to focus completely on war? A constant state of war stales the game and gets tiering quick. 

But overall, the game is great and I completely recommend it.",1527062744,1527062744,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False,76561198165478271,27,1,4124,0,2117,1592432609,,

Some of the pros and cons

Pros

- A logical step forward from Rome 1
- Papacy (vote for pope), Jihad, Crusades. Agents
-improved diplomacy over Rome 1
-Settlements are either Economic or Military 
 Economic being towns->City->Metropolis
Military being Castle->Fortress->Citadel
 and you can change a town to a Castle and visa versa, when you want to
-with that in mind you can build up a small village up into a great city (later total wars restricted this to province system)
-agents work well and take time to level up. sort of balances AI agent spam in a way.
-not 60 quid or 40 quid ha
-brings back memories
-plenty of polished mods, the game is still going strong. Has the only working and released LOTR mod, the Third age, that has plenty of submods. 

Cons

well there are obvious ones 
-such as this being an old game  ha
-Graphics are outdated
-no steamworkshop for mods, you have to get mods from MOD DB.com they can be tedious to install but worth it.
-my biggest and perhaps only gripe with playing this nowadays is the lack of unit replenishment, you have to got to settlement or where you can recruit specific unit in order to retrain the unit back to full strenght.

14,42006820,english,"Don't let my game time fool you, The countless summers spent at my nans with no internet and playing in offline mode I must have put over 3k hours into ME2. But before I review, let me just say that I have NOT played the base game, or expansions in years. There's a simple reason why I haven't done that, and while it is good, especially the teutonic expansion, I personally find the base game pretty bland and boring.

Now that said... modding is where this game comes alive. I've got over 10 full conversion mods sitting in my ME2 folder, over 120gb worth of content just for ME2.

I have third age total war, with MoS, DaC, and the 1st/2nd/3rd/4th age all in seperate folders so I can play all of them when I want. And DaC in it's current form is by far the best ME2 mod to date, and it's even better than most other TW games simply because it's lotr and it brings ME2 to life. 

BOTET - basically ME2 warhammer. And lo and behold, it's ten times better than WH1/2 TW, and that's the damn truth. ME2 has such a great engine and allows modding that none of the new games allow, why CA stopped the same kind of modding through their kits is a bit of a joke considering the amount of modders for the franchise. Botet may be russian made, but they really have outdone themselves, if you head on over to moddb, or TW heaven you'll find a thread for it, download it and give it a try, it's got EVERY faction, and basically EVERY unit. No more fooling around paying £15 for fucking Tomb Kings and buying a whole NEW game for them. Sure it might not have fancy graphics or magic, but ME2 is still the best TW to date, CA knows it, so does every true TW fan.

Elder scrolls TW - another good addition to the modding scene, really brings a new 'flavour' into ME2, offers a wider range of factions with a very balanced game style. It's elder scrolls, no need to say anymore, it's good.

The game itself is amazing, I do not think the base game is bad, but it is bland. When you experience these mods you will all come to realise how weak the base game is, but it is not CA's fault. these mods have had years of dedication and are still being worked on. DaC and MoS are still being improved and updated, and the latest DaC has improved so much. Once you experience the modding scene of ME2, you'll never touch the base game again.

TL:DR

Mod ME2. Just do it. Don't pay money for the game to only play the base game/expansions. Go to Moddb, go to the TWcenter and you'll find many great mods to give you thousands of hours of enjoyment.

base game may be a good 8/10, but when you experince what the mods have to offer, it's really a 1/10. It's free to install all of these mods, it takes literally no effort other than reading how to install. If you can't get a mod to work, simply delete all the items inside the 'americas' folder, then copy + paste the mod folders content into that, then load up americas and it will run the mod. Some mods can only be ran that way, most like TATW can be ran with the ring.exe once installed.

This is undoubtedly one of the best games ever made, and before I ever came to Steam, I probably had thousands of hours on it.  It is immersive, to say the very least, despite it's age.  After downloading, today, I went to the Total War Center, and downloaded the three files for Third Age:Total War, based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's classic works, including the Lord of the Rings.  I started playing as Gondor, which is very weak, at the beginning of the game.

With my new computer, the graphics are set at the absolute maximum settings ... something I was never able to do, before.  The game's graphics ... tweaked by the modders ... came alive.  I'd never seen it look like it does, today.  No, it doesn't look as good as Witcher III, but the graphics take nothing away from the gameplay.

For those who don't know, Medieval II:Total War is a turn-based strategy game, whose origins go way back to Shogun: Total War (note that this was not Shogun II).  I've been hooked on their games, ever since.  The devs have their given games tremendous support, and there is an enormous modding community, out there (though I was surprised not to see one in the Steam Workshop).

There are complete overhauls for the basic game, in the modding community.  Although the basic period is Medieval, overhauls are available that go back to ancient times, to relatively modern times.  There seems to be no limitations to the modders' imaginations, when it comes to this game.

When an army (called a stack) is moved against an enemy army, the game immediately into battle mode, and I like to play with the action as close as possible ... get down and dirty with all the sounds, blood, and gore of the battle.

Today, I led Faramir into a re-taking of East Osgiliath against a much larger force, from Mordor.  My boys sent those orcs screaming into the hills.

If you've never played this game, you need to.

Highly recommended, to say the least.  And the price is right.  Buy the bundle, which includes Kingdoms.  You'll need it, if you intend to download any mods.

In this instance, I had been playing some Minecraft hunger games a few hours earlier, and as I went to bed that night I had thought deeply about it. As a result, I had access to everything I knew about Minecraft in said dream world. I dreamt a castle, I thought of every block I would use and where I would put them, and then it just, was. I have a little fun, I switch up my dream a little and go a few places but eventually I end up back in my castle. Remember what I said about my real life thoughts entering my dreams? I had been looking at midget porn before I went to bed, mostly to screenshot and send in discords as a meme. However, I soon realized my mistake as I found myself balls deep in famous pornstar and movie actor Bridget the midget. Usually I would be grossed out about passionate sexual relations with a famous dwarf pornstar, but the fuzzy cloud of the dream seemed to blur my reason and logic.

Absolute masterpiece- if you are Total War fan than this game is a must-have. It contains of 2 segments- [b]Turn-based grand campaign[/b] and a [b]Battle segment[/b] including land and siege battles. The game covers an era from an early medieval times up to the reneissance so you'll find yourself starting with the use of simplistic swords and light cavalry units and than end up using, first time introduced into Total War series, firearms (rifles, cannons and even elephants armed with that). It gives many, many hours of gameplay and additional mods will deliver much more fresh and new content.",1521641932,1523880796,True,18,0,0.687270939350128174,0,True,False,False,76561198332266768,227,39,322,0,322,1514412275,,

The game mechanics have all been explored in published reviews, so I won't go into a lot of detail.  The diplomacy is ok, could be even more in-depth but is sufficient for the scope of a game like this.  I think the game really shines in the real time combat.  Thousands of soldiers each individually rendered makes directing and watching the combat truly enthralling. The AI is dated, and not particularly difficult even on most difficult level, but is still challenging at times, especially if you are outnumbered.  Graphics are great for the time the game came out.  Sound is great, music appropriate.  

The only con I can think of is the AI.  It could be a lot more difficult and unpredictable, but this seems typical again for the time the game came out.  The AI's diplomacy could be a lot better, but again, it's sufficient for playability and the time period it came out.

I've tried about all of the Total War games. I keep coming back to this one. I think its the simplicity. (Well, it's not simple, the first time you play it.) Diplomacy actually made you work for it. If you knew an ambassador was going to your enemies to possibly create an alliance, you could send an assassin to kill him. No alliance was made. That was awesome! All the new Total Wars are just instant diplomacy. Click and negotiate. No fun. 

The Medieval period is also my favorite period, especially in Total War. I don't know what it is about it. Moats and castles and trebuchet and cavalry and archers and spearmen. Family trees of inheritence. It's all so fun and immersive. 

And by God, the fucking music is amazing! I don't know what happened going forward, but Medieval 2 (and Shogun 2's for that matter) music are drum-poundingly exciting. Everything about the music puts you in that era, and you feel the battle shake with the drums of war. IT's amazing.

I'd put Medieval 2, Shogun 2, and Warhammer as my top 3 most played Total War games.

53,40279244,english,"Medieval II is, in my opinion, one of the best Total War titles, up there with Rome - the first Rome.

The campaign centres around Europe and the Middle East, with emphasis on the internal feudaling in Europe and the Crusades between the caliphates and the Catholic Church. The organised religion of the time has been well represented in the game. If you play as a Catholic country, the Church will launch Holy Crusades against certain Islamic cities. If you play as an Islamic country, a Jihad may be called against Christian cities. The Pope has an opinion on each country, and if you, as a Catholic leader, do things like invade another Catholic country, you will anger the Pope. Anger him enough, and you may be excommunicated and you yourself could be the victim of a crusade.

This additional layer means politics has become a bit more in-depth. If you need help with a particular enemy, even with no allies you can call on the Pope to launch a crusade on your enemy - or call the Islamic world for a Jihad - and half the nations will be compelled to prove their faith by crushing your enemy. Even better, by then caputuring the city you get brownie points with your own religion.

Of course, in addition to this, you have the standard Total War tactics of spies, diplomats and armies. WIth the twin arms of diplomatic subterfuge and military strength, you will expand your borders and crush those who would oppose you. Leading your army from town militas with repurposed farming impliments, to heroic knights all the way to the advent of gunpowder - muskets, cannons and early mortars - you will expand your country into a massive empire, crushing all others beneath you.

Excellent strategy game.

The game puts a captain in charge so you can move companies across settlements if necessary. The penalty is you could lose them to becoming rebels or desertion for not having a general. This takes the limitation of units and expands it to more invasive tactics towards enemy units/cities.

AN IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE BUYING:
this game is only worth it when you can get all the dlc for it as well; apparently there is a game breaking bug in the main version that is addressed with the dlc
also you need them in order to play the mods in the steam version! 
Keep an eye out for Stainless Steel and Third Age, but there are plenty more to choose from ;)

1) Buy medieval II: Total War. (You'll love it, i guarentee)

4) repeat until dead.

Now, a guide to installing SS 6.4 that nobody asked for.

1) download the SS 6.3 and the 6.4 patch from Total war center. 
2) install SS 6.3 into the appropriate directory. (/steamapps/common/medieval2totalwar/mods/SS6.3)
3) install SS 6.4 into the appropriate directory. It should be exactly the same as the SS 6.3 install path.

This bug is caused by Legacy code from Rome 1. In which it had a mechanic where factions could 'raze' settlments, which was (to my knowledge) Barbarian flavour text for exterminate populace. In Medieval, they didn't need it so they tried to remove then disable the code. The issue is that they only removed/disabled the header for it, and the actual effects were still active but didn't have a flag to tell them which button on the ""what do you want to do with this settlment"" pop-up after taking a settlment. So it defaults to the first value, which in this case happens to be the 'Occupy peacefully' option.

TL;DR, Occuping peacefully in this game will make the AI think you actually just burned a settlment down to the ground and  by the 10th turn you should have a conga line of factions halfway across the world marching to take you down.",1517551162,1517551162,True,13,5,0.594400882720947266,2,True,False,False,76561198042631197,279,3,982,0,168,1580771820,,

34,39492244,english,"Before I go any further, I want to make one thing clear. Medieval II: Total War was released in november of 2006. So if you are not able to play with low-quality graphics, this game might not be for you. 

Medieval II: Total War is, in my opinion as well as the opinion of many others, part of the golden age of Total War which included Medieval II and Rome: Total War. Medieval II might as well be the peak of the entire series, gameplay-wise. 
Medieval II uses very different mechanics compared to the newer Total War games. Arguably more realistic and, as some might say, more immersive. 
The construction system isn't exactly black and white. Construction in Medieval II allows you to build all buildings in every settlement. (I'll assess the castle-city system in a moment.) After the introduction of the Warscape engine in Empire: Total War, one could no longer build all buildings in a settlement due to building slots which limited how many buildings one could build. Now this could be seen as a good thing. Limiting the amount of buildings in your settlements forces the player to make more strategic decisions as to what buildings to build where. However, during late-game campaign, it is not too strategically bad to simply build all the best buildings and ignore the others. Total War: Attila improved this by making buildings more unique to settlement types. What I mean is: In Rome II, you can build top tier recruitment buildings in your minor settlements while just building money-making buildings in your provincial capitals. In Attila, the recruitment buildings for provincial capitals and minor settlements are unique to said settlements. Although it may be seen as ""non-strategical"" (or something along those lines) to be able to build all buildings in every settlement, eraly game one does not possess the funds to construct all these buildings. One has to make strategic decisions to decide what will be profitable (not necessarily economy-wise). 

Now on to recruitment. In my opinion, recruitment in Medieval II is the height of recruitment in the entire series. Simply because of one feature: Unit pools. When a unit has started recruitment, and that was the last unit in the pool, the unit will not be available until a few turns later at which point one unit will become available. This forces army variation and is a fantastic contrast to the mass conscription of the recent games. Now you cant just spam the best unit through all your armies and dominate the world. Now you must pick up the best that is available. 

In the recent games, generals have been very streamlined. Your general fights battles, he gains XP, he levels up. Now pick a skill. Chose Skill ""Strategist"". Effects: +1 cunning, +2% Melee Defence skill for all infantry units. This may seem like a good system. And if you want that, I don't blame you. But Medieval II uses another system which is more realistic and (again, in my opinion) overall better. Your general gains traits and retinues depending on how he acts. If he fights battles and mercilessly executes captives and slaughter civilians, he will gain dread. On the other hand, if he is respectful to prisoners and releases them, and he peacefully occupies cities, he will gain respect. Dread and respect are one of four trees that have several levels. There is command, that changes depending on how much and well he wins battles. Traits and retinues can also affect governing. Increased taxes and trade income, increased or decreased public order. 

Despite this game's pros it is not without cons, no matter how small they are. Medieval II has better graphics and animations than Rome I, but the unit response time is useless. (By this I mean when you tell your units to move, it takes them a few seconds to get moving. This is very restricting when you want to pull your cavalry away from charging infantry or pull them out of a melee. And there are of course the graphics and animations. But still, the gameplay itself, can be really immersive and I would definitely recommend it. 

Overall, the game recieves a 9/10 from me.",1516478443,1516478637,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198137455918,70,8,47202,0,40108,1591522008,,

The game has a lot to offer from the unique factions that each have a distinct playstyle (Hungary for example is very cavalry focused, while Milan relies on their crossbow units, and the Moors utilize strong infantry). The graphics also look fairly good for when the game was originally released. The battles are always fun, except when your enemy spams war elephants..... Aside from that the battles are on par with the original Rome Total War, they are fun and require strategy. 

The Kingdoms expansion adds a lot more to the game, allowing you to play campaigns in the Baltic, the British Isles, the Middle East (Crusader States), and even the Americas. 

The game is also highly modable and has a ton of amazing mods you can download which offer so many new experiences. I'd recommend giving the Third Age mod and the Call of Warhammer mod each a try if you love fantasy. For history buffs, check out Europa Barbarorum 2, Invasio Barbarorum 2, Stainless Steel, and Potop Total War. Each is great in their own way.

Everything is great about it: the music, the units, the fascinating middle ages and those badass warrior units like templars, varanguian guards, heavy knights and so on.

There are still  a few annoying things in M2TW.
The diplomatic interface is simple and could be satisfying, it if wasn't more often than not dysfonctional. You may not be able to end a war with a crippled enemy, even if you besiege his last standing city; he will still refuse your offer or demand an exorbitant sum of money to agree, when he really should be the one begging for mercy.
It is also dysfonctional when you always become ""unreliable"" for an obscure reason and the only way to become reliable is to repeatedly offer money to your neighbours in exchange for their assistance against another faction. It doesn't make sense but it works.
There are many other absurdities like these, but it's still a nice game to play and it gets even better with some of the nice mods available like Broken Crescent, Stainless Steel, etc.

54,39322989,english,"As usual with my reviews, they are relevant to the time of the release of the game. Today, I’m reviewing one of my favorite games to play as a kid/teenager. This game, in my opinion, was the first (and potentially largest) leap for the total war series. Previously, total war games felt the same and every problem had very simple solutions. I remember in the original Medieval: Total War, you could basically just build cheap spearman and destroy anybody with the numbers game. In the original Rome: Total War if you had hoplites you could just put those in front of gates and you were 99% guaranteed a win (enemies would just continuously run into them and die, without adjusting). This game is FINALLY when the AI starts to get smart, different times of units start to actually matter more, and a central organization starts to actually make a difference.
	In the past, the central organization would hand out missions with rewards or “disappointed messages,” but nothing really quite as complex, rewarding, and harmful as the Papcy. This game introduced politics the likes of which were never seen in total war games before hand, with the College of Cardinals. It became INSANELY important to focus on either building lots of priests to rise up in the ranks or lots of assassins to kill your enemies priests so you don’t get excommunicated (or, as I do it just to be safe, I do both). This game brought a lot of fresh ideas that even still to this day are enjoyable (though they are FINALLY starting to feel a little dated). Heck, the game even still looks good today, something I can’t say the same for Empire: Total War. The story is what you make it like all total war games (though the more recent ones like Warhammer have improved this significantly), so the score will be similar to other total war games here, but overall this was one of the greatest games of its era and certainly the best strategy game.",1515884475,1515884500,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198007099189,60,1,1669,0,1486,1597438714,,

Abishag cherishes David in his extreme age—Adonijah aspires to be king—Bathsheba and Nathan advise David of Adonijah’s plotting—David names Solomon as king, and he is anointed by Zadok—Adonijah’s cause fails.

1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.

3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.

4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

5 ¶ Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.

6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.

7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:

10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.

11 ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.

13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

14 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

15 ¶ And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.

16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?

17 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the Lord thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:

19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.

20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.

22 ¶ And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.

23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.

24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

25 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.

26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.

27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?

28 ¶ Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.

29 And the king sware, and said, As the Lord liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,

30 Even as I sware unto thee by the Lord God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.

31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.

32 ¶ And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.

33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.

35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the Lord God of my lord the king say so too.

37 As the Lord hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.

38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.

39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.

41 ¶ And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?

42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.

44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:

45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.

46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.

48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.

49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.

50 ¶ And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.

The problem is that STEAM offers you the original buggy version of the game so prepare for a lot of frustration. And even worse STEAM does not offer any support for this product. You cannot even contact them to say hey how about you offer the game and the patches.

I am going to be asking for a refund if I cannot get a hold of Steam in getting these patche installed. They also should note the patches needed etc...before buying the game and whether they offer it or not.

The bugs are very frustrating. Below are just a few examples:

1. CASTLE WALLS - There are too many issues with the walls to really get into but my God this is enough for me to quit.
a. Many Units particularly Nafatuns and Gun Units have a hard time firing while on the walls. Many times they get stuck going throught the motion of firing without firing a single shot. Nafatus for the most part throw explosives at the walls or the floor of the walls rather than over. There was a patch that fixed this.
b. When commanding the units to get off the wall they ofter freeze in place. In battle this is very frustrating. It may take me up to 8 commands to get a unit off the wall. And if the enemy is is firing on the walls, everytime the walls gets it your units on the wall freeze. You reall reall really have to micromanage. A patch has also fixed this.
c. Anytime the wall goes throught the animations of breaking the game slows down signifcantly until the animation has completed. I have an Alienware Desktop from 2017 with all the bells and whistles so not sure why this occurs.
d. Sometimes Archer units below the wall on the ground fire into the wall versus over the wall despite being far enough back.

2. UNIT FORMATIONS - This one is also super frustrating. Especially with cavalry. Lets say you have 50 cavalry. You set the unit to have 10 units wide and 5 lines depth. As soon as you move the unit or set it to attack the enemy it changes its formation to 3 Units Wide and 17 lines deep. So you really only have 3 units in the front of that line charging the enemy versus 10. Super Frustrating. And it really does effect the outcome of that battle. A patch also exists that fixes this.

These two issues are bigger than you  think in game play.

Massive epic battles, heroic charges that put the Hollywood movies to shame, dashing heroes who die far before their prime, bloodthirsty tyrants who die of old age and the chastity belts for those wicked princesses who try and steal your best generals away from your kingdom.

I bought this game in 2014 on sale and so I have no nostalgic feelings attached to it.  I sank over 1,000 bloodsoaked hours into this game and though I haven't played it recently (need to take a break and gather my wits for some more holy Crusades) I have enjoyed every single minute of it.  This is as intense as it gets.  

Going after the Mongols and Timurids with my German soldiers, with the Teutonic Knights leading the way has never been more satisfying.  I lied, capturing the Mongol faction leader twice in the same turn and getting over 50,000 florins in ransom money was the best thing I ever did.  We captured him a third time and the Mongols executed their own leader after that.  

There are so many countless battles I could recount but they all now are in the history books.

I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for better than Braveheart battles.  Seriously, this is one of the best games ever made.

6,38767783,english,"This is the greatest game of all time. It has aged really well for a twelve year old game, so I wouldn't let that put you off. The graphics arent flashy, but they are remarkably sound, and the combination of a breathtaking soundtrack and impressive game mechanics and features make up for the graphics not blowing you away, because they make the game much more immersive than empty graphics do. More importantly, this game never gets boring. I've had this game for years before I got it on steam, and I never got tired of it. It really hits the sweet spot in my opinion of being easy enough to grasp and get good at while still maintaining depth of features and complexity of gameplay. The only complaint I can think of is that, similar to other Total War games, the AI is pretty unimpressive, and the game can get fairly easy. FOrtunately, I think this gets combatted fairly well by enjoyable aspects of politics, with the pope, crusades and jihads, and public order all being interesting to manage and adding additional challenge. Additionally, unlike some other total war games, it presets a separate and unique late game challenge in the Mongol invasion and the Americas. It is especially impressive in its rolelaying potential as well, as the traits characters can develop are extremely varied and interesting, with the descriptions often making me laugh. The traits are all based off of the lived experiences of the charaters, as well, rather than a generic linear leveling up system. That is to say, to make a character a better commander, you need to win lots of battles, the more difficult the better. It can be personalised as well, as if the character only fights defensive battles, then he will receive traits improving their command rating only during defensive battles. The traits also allow characters to gain either dread or chivalry, which offer separate bonuses and allow the player to actually decide whether they'd prefer their characters to be respected or feared. Would you like your kingdom to have such a terrifying reputation that almost nobody will dare to stand and fight against you? Then do dreadful deeds, like sacking cities, assassinating rivals, and executing prisoners. Alternatively, crusading or jihading, releasing prisoners, or undertaking projects for the public good, like building happiness buildings and maintaining lower tax rates, will allow your charater to gain chivalry, which carries its own benefits. That may seem like an overly long explanation, but it is just indicative of the outstanding depth this game has to offer. Total War is a series like no other, offering an incredible blend of grand strategy and exhilerating RTS elements, and no game in the series really comes close to Medieval 2, in my opinion (Rome 1 and Shogun 2 come closest, but M2TW is in a class of its own).",1514438828,1514438828,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False,76561198093335532,51,1,37342,6,16670.0,1601671364,,

Only thirty turns in, I was at war with three factions and wiped out due to being overwhelmed. Tried again, fourty turns in I get wiped out by the Roman empire when I was supposidly allied with them no more than four turns ago. Finally third time I decided to be agressive, took over the british isles, took a good peice of france, acted like the AI usually did.

And I got Excommunicated and had a crusade called agianst me when nearly every game before I ended up getting killed and, even if I had the highest favor with the pope, he'd be little more than like ""lol k"" with the other factions attacking me with no provoking.

So, I stopped playing and uninstalled until reciently, when I got the urge to play again but had no urge to get attacked. Then, I found out there's a bug in the diplomacy where factions would actually prefer you to sack settlements rather than take them peacefully (Well, as peacefully as you can.) due to the code having three semi-colons. So I thought ""Okay, I'll go through unpacking and fix the file"" So after finding the three semi-colons and deleting them, along with checking to make sure that the game used the modded files I tried again.

Only to have another faction attack me not even twenty turns in for absolutely no reason.

When i first got Medieval II, all i played was Stainless Steel (mod), because its got some truly awesome features to it!
However, i recently started playing again, and found Kingdoms (DLC) to be more balanced..and enjoy it very much. Some mods will require you to have that DLC, just a headsup ;)

I give this 9.7/10. There are some annoying things in it, but what games perfect?

Between  technology shifting events like gunpowder and the three major endgame superfactions it makes the storytelling of newer total war titles feel downright tiny. It does not miss small details either its great to have a secretly female priest make her way up the collage of cardinals and become Pope or watch as that general who has been away from home for years picks up a mistress. Battles last a long time and units have a real weight to them, the AI isn't too great at sieges but it is still mostly competent. If that isn't enough this game has the largest variety of quality total overhaul mods of any game I've ever played. I have easily played more than 2000 hours between this and its expansion thanks to the sheer variety of worlds people have added to the game. It is not without its flaws and especially fans of newer Total Wars may have a hard time adapting to its building and replenishment systems but overall I can not recommend this game highly enough.

An excellent title, and my first Total War game.  The base game is great, the expansion is better, the battles are fun, and everything just plays well.  Plus, watching thousands of troops slaughter each other is great fun, especially when you're doing most of the slaughtering.

It's also got a great modding scene:  Third Age: Total War (Lord of the Rings), Westeros: Total War (Game of Thrones), Hyrule: Total War (Legend of Zelda), Call of Warhammer (Warhammer Fantasy, although in this case you should probably get the actual Total War: Warhammer), and many, MANY more.  Lots of these mods have been worked on for years, giving this game a lifespan way longer than its already extensive base content.

There are a few flaws, like the squalor system and rebel system.  The former you can't really control so much as temporarily limit, and if you like long games like me you may find yourself fomenting revolts in your own cities so you can massacre the population to bring squalor back down.  The latter means that you can't get a region to be 100% guaranteed to not rebel, and since the game doesn't alert you when a new rebel army pops up, you have to manually scan your empire each turn for new rebels.  A lot of these flaws would be fixed in later games, but here they're just a minor annoyance and not a deal breaker.

- you buy an actually whole game, no paid unlockable content (ULC)
- Largest unit variety of any TW
- many buildings and no stupid building slots like in succeder TWs
- city management: manage population growth, happiness, religion, squalor, ...; not dumped down like in succeeder TWs
- long campaign, from 1080 with leather armour wearing spearmen and peasant crossbowmen into the early rennaissance with musketeers and lanciers
- agents: spies, priests, assassins, merchants, diplomats; funny event videos
- events: plague, crusades, mongol invasion, gunpowder invented, ...
- characters: many ttraits and ancilliaries, your governers and generals do actually have a personality
- diplomacy: can trade regions
- family tree, form a true dynasty
- the Kingdoms expansion is an example for what an addon/DLC is SUPPOSED to be like
- many mods available and easily moddeable by yourself (just write in the game files)
- command console

(0)
- siege battles are very predominant vs field battles
- the graphics are ofc a bit outdated now, but totally fine for me

(-)
- DRM (sell this on GOG already pls)
- some units are very bugged, i.e. cavalry, pikemen, gunpowder infantry
- AI is insanely stupid
- too easy on hard; just frustrating on very hard
- troop movement and wayfinding on the battle map is horrible, needs much micromanagement and patience
- diplomacy: cannot liberate or subjugate nations
- number of nations is hardcoded; all the smaller nations are represented by ""rebels""

It would be insanely awesome if there will ever be a M3TW with the gameplay of this but with more factions, up-to-date graphics, proper AI and troop movement.
Well, let me dream...

The Expansion, ""Kingdoms"" is -without a doubt- one of the largest expansions ever released for such a title, consisting of 4 campaigns taking you to a different time period in History. Discover the Americas as the Spanish or push back the invaders as the Aztecs, unify Ireland or establish English rule over the isles, join the Crusades or capture the Holy Land with Saladin's Army, take control of the Teutonic Order and spread Catholicism in the Baltic or bring the peoples of the region under Russian rule.

Meaning that you will be taking over cities and wipe out nations with the force of an army. The major factor to fuel this war is 'money', By strategically building cities, paved roads, market places and docks you can recruit merchants to do the trading for you. 

The game is restriced at five nations at the start. Meaning you can only play as: England, France, The Holy Roman Empire, Scotland and France. Upon completion of the campaign you will be unlocking 12 additional factions to play as. 

This game involves a lot of strategic depth. The combat system that comes with this game may be found quite complex at the start. After a few hours into the game and having encountered some battles on the field yourself you will notice that the combat system is quite understandable. 

To sum things up; If you're in the market for a quick or long strategy game in which you can put dozens of hours- this would be the game for you. If you are a casual player, a single quick campaign can last you for a good week of play-time!

As a long time Total War fan, having played the majority of titles since Rome Total War released back in 2004, I can't recommend this game enough. Creative Assembly got so many things right with this game that I even find it difficult playing other turn-based strategy games without accidentally comparing and eventually returning to this masterpiece.

Everything about it just screams love, care and attention - from the subtly different factions, the variety of maps to fight on, the global events (Mongols ftw anyone!?), the Pope/cardinal mechanic, the Americas being colonisable late game (long past the campaign victory, just for people who have global domination in mind). I have nothing bad to say about this title.

As someone who now spends most of his waking life playing Mortal Empires (in my opinion, the best release since this game), returning to this is admittedly a graphical struggle... but even in the newer titles I long for the mechanics of the old.

Medieval 2 is no exception and is possibly the best game of the series,with the exception of the newly released Warhammer. Although the graphics are not mind-blowing(expected as this is an old game), the experience is truly great.
The AI works well enough so that even early on,you can't just throw everything at the walls and see what sticks.
In my opinion what makes it better than Attila or Rome is the fact that not only did those have severe bugs and crashes,the system requirements were pretty unrealistic and very few people actually were happy with it or enjoyed them.
Last,but definitely not least, the modding community is alive and vibrant.
I CANNOT stress this enough, the mods make this game such a joy to play,whether it is the Third Age Total War Lord of The Rings modification which is fabulous or the stainless steel mod which improves the overall play.
Neither the Rome or Attila games have any mods that come near these.
If you can get Warhammer and run it on your PC well,great but otherwise,this is probably the second best game in the series.",1464455301,1511608599,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198267298909,56,3,1291,0,1252,1519661028,,

For me, it's the fact that I can utilize any space on the battle map, and it represents it's own unique landscape. There are no naval battles, which are done automatically (they appear in Empire) but there is are seige battles, which are done rather well with the occasional pathfinding issue by some unit sprites. 

There are also some issues with the AI as well as reputation, which is almost near impossible to recover from if you ended up doing something cutthroat like violate a treaty. There are mods that can fix AI issues, update graphics, and other assorted implements which extends the shelf-life of a game like this.

- Never trust anybody;
- The only alliance you'll ever need is with the Papal States;
- Milan is an asshole;
- Sicily is an asshole;
- Make sure you don't get denounced;
- if you need money you should conquer Dongola, Timbuktu, Arguin and Stockholm (and place the merchants on the resources);
- After the year 1500 and the ""World is round"" event, you can sail to the West and find the Americas;
- Don't capture middle eastern cities like Antioch, Baghdad, Alepo, etc... Before the Mongol and Timurid invasions (Jerusalem and southern cities are fine);
- Everybody will hate you no matter what, unless you give them money and military aid;
- Diplomacy is broken, don't try to understand it;
- The campaign AI is somewhat suicidal;
- DO NOT let the AI make your recruitment decisions;
- DO NOT let the AI make your recruitment decisions;
- DO NOT let the AI make your recruitment decisions;
- You don't need to have a standing army in every single city, learn where the AI attacks you and just have armies in those cities;
- If possible always have a priest in every city/castle ready to kill the heretics (they cause unhapiness);
- If possible have  4-6+ cavalary units in a castle/city ready to take down rebel armies (if possible bring a general with them)
- If your king has 2 or less Authority, DO NOT leave standing armies outside a city/castle unless they have a general with them (that is loyal) or they will turn rebels;
- When attacking a city/castle with a diferent religion, bring priests with you and/or exterminate the city/castle. Unless you have a huge army, you're going to have problems later.
- Everyone will betray you eventually, execept the Papal States;
- To win their favor with the Pope, recruit priests, build churches and avoid fighting same religion factions.
- Once you have a powerful economy that can pay for any war you want, you don't really need to listen to the Pope anymore, do whatever you like.
- Don't worry in getting one of your Bishops elected as Pope, it doesn't help you that much.

The vanilla version is great, but just like all Total War games the mods really make this one of the best strategy games.

Quick highlight: Real time battles mixed with a turn based campaign, you control a country and their ruling family with the goal of building armies and conquering your neighbor countries. The map covers most of Europe with North Africa and the Middle East.

Pros: Battles are very satisfying when you win, timeplan spans hundreds of years, you can follow the members of your royal family as they are born, achieve great victories, and die. There are a lot of mods that greatly enhance the game.

Cons: Very little depth, there isn't much to getting a robust economy other than growing in size; there is very little political intrigue inside your own family (ala Game of Thrones style); and armies can be over simplified. There are only twenty two countries, and the game is called Total War for a reason: allies do not exist.

20,36249752,english,"I finally have enough hours to make a review on this game..

Medieval 2: Total War is an extremely entretaining game. This is one of the early total wars, dating back to 2005-2006. Unlike newer versions, such as Rome 2 and Warhammer, Medieval 2 has a different battle feeling, which is hard to describe, but if you ask me, is way better than these two newer versions. I myself prefer it to the newer versions.

The game offers you limited amount of factions in the beginning, but once you win with any of them, you will be able to choose any faction you wish, from Scotland to Egypt. Mongols and Timurids, which are invading armies aren't playable (for campaing), though. Maybe with mods.

As for the Kingdoms expansion, it has proven itself worth the money. Adds four new campaigns: Britannia, Americas, Teutonic and Crusades, each of it has it's own unique feeling. This expansion also adds new factors, such as the boiling oil siege defense, which is missing in the normal version and can be really helpful, especially in early game.

The tactics works a little different in here too. In Rome 2, for example, should you surround an enemy, they would break. In here, however, instead of breaking the surrounded unit will fight to death. Cavalry also has more use and diversity here.

Sadly, the naval battles here are fought automatically. General Bodyguards are more useful and are probably by far the best units in game, even though using them would put in risk the general himself. Well used, the general can eliminate even enemy spearmen(Generals are on horse) easily, with few losses. The campaign in general is very different, too. You need to pay refill a damaged unit.

The only lacking points would be the AI, which at times is just plain stupid both in battle and campaign, the pope and the diplomacy. I managed to use a damaged unit with three average heavy infanty soldiers to stand near towers close to the AI's army, and the towers killed over 30% of their army. The pope will annoy you at first, forcing you to make peace with your neighbours that attacked you, for example. As for diplomacy, wars are endless. It usually will only end if you get the lower hand in the dealings, and even if it does, the AI will just attack you after 10 turns max.

So that would be it, Medieval 2: Total War, nice game, with some flaws, but doubtlessly, a masterpiece considering the time it was made. A game enjoyable until this day and one of the best of the series.

24,36158612,english,"Would be my favorite Total War game if just for the sheer mods alone, but sadly, it isn't, because of a few major problems.

1. AI pathfinding, the pathfinding in this game in sieges particularly is pants on head retarded, as exhibited by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF4UPzmMl84. Though playing on smaller unit sizes can help to alleviate this, the problem is still very prevalent, so prevalent that you have to consider yourself lucky to have the siege AI actually attack your fort.

2. Siege AI, the AI is beyond terrible, with a large chance of it just sitting there, allowing you to kill it's men with archers and ballistae while they sit idly, or shuffle between one command and another, never making up their mind, running in circles.

3. Clunky controls, this can be gotten used to, but it will always leave a bad taste in my mouth compared to the modern controls of the newer games.

Now, pros about this game are:

1. Good campaign AI, gone are the days (or yet to come) of diplomats threatening you with horse whippings for attempting to make a trade deal (Empire), gone are the days of AI sitting back and doing nothing all game until you walk over them (Rome II), if you choose very hard on this game you can actually expect a moderate challenge, which is an A+ compared to the pathetic show from Rome II.

2. Family trees, interesting character traits, and generals you actually give a damn about. In Rome II, Attilla, and all the games following Medieval II, there has been a severe lack of fucks about your generals. In Rome II I remember using my general as a vanguard unit, if he happened to die I would just replace him, immediately, without consequence. In Medieval II choosing the right general can make or break a campaign, and losing him would be a big blow to your conquests. Generals/Family members in this game also gain experience based on actions taken in battle, such as if your general refrains from killing an enemy unit for some battles, he may develop cowardice, compared to Rome II which just gives a random trait based on RNG.

3. Better settlement improvement, are you tired of having to use an entire portion of your capital city to build a church in Rome II? Don't worry about that here son, because you can build whatever you want in your cities, provided it has the proper population, which is represented by actual ingame numbers. All the improvements will have a visible effect on the city. For example, if you build a blacksmith, it will show up in the battle for that settlement. Build a grand temple to God? It will show up in the battle. Have a wooden walled settlement and upgrade it to stone walls? You now have actual stone walls. The game is given life in this, so much that if you build up your capital it will look like a real fucking capital when it's sieged, unlike the newer games where all the cities are made by artists, so only Rome/Constantinople have that grand feel.

4. Mods mods mods, mods make this game shine over every other Total War game. Have you ever wanted to journey into the world of J. R.R. Tolkien? To fight against the Aldmeri Dominion as the Cyrodilic Empire? To fight for Skyrim's independence? To journey into the world of Warhammer? There are massive professional mods for each of these things, just waiting to be played. Mods a scope which can never be matched in future games, due to the Creative Assembly's blatant anti Modding policy (to support future games and DLC).

The game also keeps you interested from start to finish with a constant flow of new events which change the way you play the game or your endgame goals. Each faction also feels completely different from one another and encourages different playstyles, for example the French's selection of units encourage a balance between an attack and defense approach, whereas the Byzantine empire encourages a more aggressive playstyle with a focus on picking your enemies off with horse archers before your army assaults.

Medieval 2 is a complete masterpiece, regarded by many including myself as a legendary Total War game. The campaign is unique and interesting in all aspects (combat, diplomacy, citybuilding, managing your population etc). The multiplayer is fun, but since this game is really old (11 years old) the lag is insane and the FPS you'll be getting even with a 1080 i9 16gb ram will be terrible. Also one of the reasons why this is the best Total War is definetly the setting, Medieval periods give almost everybody enjoyment.

Better Diplomacy options, more detailed espionage and agent systems, way better graphics both in campaign and in battle, to name a few. A couple of things you may not like about this game however: 

-You can't win without going into war. The only goal is to hold 10-40 regions depending on your campaing length and hold Jerusalem-Constantinople etc. There are no culture-science-diplomatic victories like in the Civilization games.
-The steam version may not be %100 stable. I had a couple of crashes and i hear some people cant even get to run the game. Hope they fix it with a patch soon
-You cant choose the time period you want to start in like in the previous game. No more starting in late period to immediately start kicking some mongolian butt (no offense to mongolians irl)

-great strategic gameplay without all the fluff of recent TW games
-Easy to mess with settings in files
-Lots of factions and Units, Expansions rock, hours of fun.
Cons:
-combat can be a little quirky
-dated graphics
This is without a doubt my favorite video game of all time. It's one of the last great TW games. Without any expansions, it is a complete game with a large map, many factions, and a campaign that feels really open ended. The units are fairly diverse and the expansions each add an awesome, unique campaign with great factions. Moreover, it's really simple to mess around with some settings files and unlock all the factions (even the rebels) and mess around with other settings. The game is straight forward, but can be challenging and rewarding, it lacks all the unnecessary fluff added in later TW. It's obvious that this game was developed by people who really had a passion for history and fun historical-strategic gameplay, and not just a bunch of money hungry jerks who want you to pay up to 200 USD for a full, buggy TW game. Honestly, if you don't care about graphics, and just want a fun, engaging, historical strategic experiences, that you'll enjoy for hundreds of hours and numerous play throughs, get this game and the expansions. It's beyond worth it.

Positives:
.great campaign
.Challenging opponents
.satisfactory graphics(considering the time this game was released)
.You play the game at the point where the world is changing and it is cool to see how the seperate eras colide (cannons vs knights sort of thing)
.The game introduces new more challenging opponents as the campaign progress eg. Mongolia and the infamous mongrels
.No real limitation to number of buildings that can be built in a city *cough* Rome 2 *cough*
.The fighting is satisfing despite not actual taking part it is still cool to see knights take on peasants and watching the carnage unfold
.Well worth the cost
.body guards are actually decent troops arent easily killed unlike in other total war games

Negatives:
.Placing troops in the city is difficult for some reason the game cant handle you placing troops in the street
.(don't know if it is a universal problem but...) I have trouble getting infantry to attack archer type troops in sieges.
.Allies are mostly useless as they never attack an enemy if said enemy attacks you or another ally. They are best used as a sort of threat for other AI.

Overall i recommend the game but I havent played the DLC and so cant say if that is any good.

This game let's you do A LOT, so let me give a few examples: If you don't like the Pope, send your best trained assassin after him, and he'll take a crossbow to the Pope's chest, and better yet, when your priests are basicly in control of the college of cardinals, replace the Pope with one of your priests, and in the beggining, it will work well for you, before you just want this Pope to die already as well. I also went on a couple of crusades(I was playing on easy difficulty, as I do for all new games I try out) one of these crusades brought me to the middle east, where I decided to spread the holy word of Jesus to the savage people of Egypt. I sacked their villages, and recruited priests and built churches in the towns, which made many loyal followers of the cross. You can also semi- choose if you want to rule with an iron fist, or if you want to be a kind ruler. Since being kind sucks ass, I ruled with an iron fist, cuz who needs morales, right? I exterminated a village of Egyptians, so they never would riot or revolt against me. Also at some point, France attacked me, didn't realize when I was dicking around assassinating their people and failing to blow up buildings sometimes that they were notified I tried to sabatouge them, so of course, I mowed France down to a single city, but it's a really well defended city, so probably no luck in taking it at the moment. The new Pope we put on is really kind of crazy, he excumunicating so many people, what if we, his own people, are next? The dude who was sent to the middle east is gay now, despite having four kids, plus he's an alcholic cuck, who's also pretty stupid. But he's also probably the most chivalrous person in the Empire. Despite sacking a few villages. Plus his son exterminated that other village.... Yet they'er still the most chivalrous. Oh, we've also been burning heritics at the stake. NO HERITCS SHALL BE SAFE IN THE LAND OF ENGLAND. BURN THE HERITICS! BURN THE WITCHES! Just please let us attack France, dear Pope. Ok, we've made peace with Egypt... SYKE, YOU JUST GAVE US $4,000 FOR NOTHING, NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE YOUR CAPITAL OF CARIO, AND SACK IT FOR $17,000! YOU JUST GOT PRANKED BRO! Also merchants can run other merchants out of buissness, that's kind of cool. And now I just assassinated a French family member.

-Cavalry is actually useful in battle (rohirrim style charges)
-Spearmen can actually hold the line
-Cool battle maps
-You can actually pick out captains/generals from their units. They're the fancy looking ones (not a big deal, just neat, also very helpful for targeting them to break the enemy's morale)
-Can play as almost any faction without having to pay for them, unlike Attila

Cons:
-Diplomacy flat out sucks in my opinion. There's not really an ""affinity"" system like in Attila, so you don't really know where you stand with other factions. Also, allies you make may very well turn on you, or each other without warning. Trust no one. Especially the HRE.
-The game is from 2006, so graphics and animations are definitely not up to today's standards.
-No General's abilities apart from rallying horn. They're just heavy cavalry that are vital to morale.
-Artillery is very innacurate. No pinpoint shots like in Attila.
-The Pope is a pain in the ass
-DLC is actually worth paying for. 4 new campaigns for ~$1.50 (on sale) 

I haven't played vanilla in a while, so I may not remember all that 100%, and I may have forgotten to mention a few things. But overall, It's a great game

53,34182643,english,"I would argue that Medieval II is the best entry into the Total War series. While it's perhaps not as iconic as Rome I or Empire, and it certainly is not as flashy as newer entries like Warhammer, it is arguably the most varied.

On top of not having any faction restrictions (once you beat a campaign once), each faction feels distinct. Everyone starts out with roughly the same units and buildings, but once the mid-game is reached, the factions diverge considerably. Very few factions share castle-built units and the ones that are shared are early-game units.

The mechanics are all straightfoward and easy to learn. There aren't multiple towns in a province to manage, just the main settlement. Settlements only come in two varieties: towns and castle. Towns make money, castles make faction-specfic military units. Taxes are on a settlement-by-settlement basis, so you can tax London to death, but leave Edinbough lightly taxed.

Lastly, the game doesn't pull many punches. Even playing on normal, the AI will backstab you, refuse to cooperate, and handle you roughly.

As with all of the Total War games, you can see a bit of the next game in each preceeding title. Medieval II is a bit of Rome I and a bit of Empire. Plus, the DLC is actually worth getting, giving you new campaigns to play and not just a new faction that should probably have been playable from the start.

Medieval II is not without its flaws, however. The Senate missions from Rome I make a return in the form of Papal Decrees (if you're a Catholic nation) or the occasional Jihad (if you're Muslim nation). The UI isn't nearly as slick as Empire and beyond. Finally, obviously, the graphics show their age.

This game is worth your investment and time, it has very good mechanics. Both in empire management, as economical management and cultural management. It is all quite in depth and well thought out. Untold were the days where you could  click a button to open diplomacy and speak to a nation on the other side of the map. If you want to do diplomacy in this game, you will need to send an envoy that has to travel so you can do your diplomacy. Man what a great game, something so simple adds so much more.

I have nothing bad to say about this game. It is dated but this is what put Total War on the map and made it the franchise it is now. This game turned total war into the tripe you cunts now will pre-order on a whim only to be a whiny cunt afterwards because they out-dlc'd you again.

For example if your England and you want to play as Scotland all you need to do is march a stack up there and take Edinburgh and the next time you start a campaign you'll see Scotland as playable. Besides graphics, the detail game mechanics wise is the main reason why I love this game. When you recruit units, the city your recruiting from loses some of its population. When you need to refill a unit you have to find a city that can recruit that unit and retrain them there. If you want to trade or sign a non-aggresion pact, you need a diplomat agent and you have to send him to the country you want to talk to and theres plenty more.

This game is definitely one of the best Total War games yet, and I would say that if you enjoyd any of the others then you will definitely enjoy Medieval 2.

Pros:
-All the factions feel very different from the others and force you to play differently on both the map and the battlefield.
-The inclusion of factions appearing and events such as [spoiler] the discovery of gunpowder, the appearance of the Mongols+Timurids etc. [/spoiler]
-Classic high quality Total War soundtrack.
-Combat animations (not quite as good as Shogun's or some other games in my opinion but definitely better than Rome).
-Absoulutely brilliant dlcs that add a huge amount of replayability.
-The Stainless Steel or Third Age mods are both extremely good.

Cons:
-Honestly none really jump to mind as although the game is old you don't really notice the graphics hugely due to the game being played mostly from a ""bird's eye view""

This game is also highly moddable. There are hundreds of mods that vary from historical to fantasy settings such as the Broken Crescent mod which focuses on the Crusades, Roma Surectum 2 which makes the game into a Roman Empire era mod, Third Age Total War which is a LoTR mod and lastly Beginning of the End Times which is a Warhammer mod.

pros: a old total war game 
rewards you for playing smart and strategicly allowing a small force to win against a much stronger one
you can play as the pope (look for a guide on how to unlock it)
the only total war game better than this is rome
muliplayer 
a realistic economy
hordes of mongols and timurids
crusades
abillity to eventualy controll the collage of cardnals
not just limited to medieval weaponry in late game there is early gunpowder weapons
you can colonize the americas
 realistic training system

cons: milan
everyone is a bit mad and will sometimes declare war while having no chance to win
ai in battles can be a bit retarded
ai can be a bit unfair 
milan
many factions that are terrible in general 
many factions that dominate others
ai will sometimes be an idiot and have one city and a small army and still refuse a ceasefire unless you become their vassal
milan
units can be picky on if they want to form up where you want or if you want them to run
some cultures have far better buildings like northern european castles are much worse than southern european castles to defend
poland allways finds a way to become the largest and strongest empire ""untill the mongols""
egypt allways gets raped
moors allways survive in spain

38,33716927,english,"Man, as a fan of real time strategy games that mix in management mechanics here and there, this game really comes off as a masterclass to me. I would argue Rome Total War has a few more loving touches (I guess holdovers of a bygone era in CA) than this game, but Medieval 2 has captivated way more than RTW ever did. It's kinda hard to describe what makes this game so killer. Every good non linear game has a loop. Some cycle that the game follows that constantly delivers the player conflict and resolution in satisfying and diverse ways. This game's cycle is, condensed; raising an empire from a few territories that can muster only a few useless peasants, making mates with some blokes or raiding their settlements for personal gain (you can't argue the game doesn't provide some riveting player choice), accruing a few key settlements you have been eyeing for turns and can now use to turn the tide in a war you have been embroiled in for ages, completely swallowing that once huge empire, and then turning to THEIR former neighbours for potential land. It's...it's not subtle. It's quite blunt, it's silly, and it is goddamn satisfiying as all hell. 


Now, a breif note: as a historian this game is conflicting at best. It does a good job at tossing in events, at getting some level of accuracy on the outfits and architecture, and properly representing more than just the standard lot of European countries. I'm pretty tired of Eurocentrism in the field and it's always refreshing to see Creative Assembly putting equal effort into capturing the Ottomans as they do the Germans. However....oh heavens. Does it get some stuff wrong. I mean what on earth are those strategies? And why on earth does Russia have so many archers? What is with that? Basically, if you have an eye for historical accuracy and are also familar with CA's other stuff, you know your lot. You'll raise your eyebrow, indignantly show off how much ""smarter you are than those fools at CA and Sega"", and then sink tens of hours into it.",1500716893,1500716893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198364323992,121,9,3980,0,1967,1526770409,,

83,33240669,english,"Englands hold had risen over the lands on the north, and jelusy began to spread. The Holy Roman Empire was one of the few who yearned for the spoils of conquest, that which rich England could provide. And so the war began.
A fortress, holding the old danish peninsula, was the site of a meeting of the great lords of England upon the mainland. There was Ambrose, cousin to King Rufus, apointed high general. There were two Generals, who had shown renown and resolve in the great Denmark invasion. Then there was John, far younger brother to the king, who had recently been apointed command. His wife, newly wed as they were, begged him not to go. But John did, knowing that his country needed him.
While there, the Imperials struck hard and fast, with a large army. They needed the peninsula for any hope of invading the north, and so brought a army that rivaled the entire peninsula's garison in size. Hearing this, John quickly saddled up, and with the assistance of Jeram (one of the generals) they rode out beyond the gates to turn the tides. The enemy, not suspecting of such heroics, marched forth lossly, and with equipment far away from forces. The two untits of brave men, mounted and baring steel, charged forth, first splintering the ladders, then burning the towers, finaly crashing into the backs of the advancing spearmen. By the time the enemy reached the fortress walls, there was little enough to think of, and arrows brought the weary soldiers swift end.
The great victory came at cost however, and Jearam and his band of knights had been slaughtered where they stood, in a final act of compasion for their country. That day, the frankish prisoner's heads rolled upon the ground. John swore an oath in revenge, and an oath to help when he could. The chance came sooner than though, for upon his return, dire news was found. The Holy Roman Emprire marched south, with another levied army. The soldiers there were unprepared and without comander.
John volunteered, and with a parting kiss to his beloved, and a strong drink with his friends, he set off. John Dreadlord was on the path to save his peaople, and to cause his enemies fear. However, on the road, he was beset upon by two whole legions of spearmen. He and his knights used supirior tatics, and with a final blow of the horn and a charge, the Imperials fell. The prisoners soon followed their compaitriots. The men laughed, and cheered for John Dreadlord. The people would be safe yet. Untill the army arived.
Did John and his men cry in dispair? No, Never! The Dreadband was strong, and despite the odds, and despite the gaurentee of death, they rode their horses still. ""Forward!"" comes the shout and the ranks upon ranks move forward. The knights laugh that laugh, a humor born of grusome thought and spilled blood upon your blade. John Dreadlord looked upon the enemy, and smiled, for his revenge was complete. A young man once, now a vetran general, feared throughout Europe from only a battle. An awnsering ""Forward' was procured, and in a deed more brave than all the battles of King William or any man ever after, the lances came down, the voices cried loud, and England lost the strongest fighter the world has ever seen. 72 enemy died, 6 by young John's hand.

This is classic total war at its peak in my opinion. It uses the older engine, which is far better than the newer one.

There are plenty of factions to play as, though admittedly, a lot feel a bit ""samey"" aside from a few quirks. Example: The four italian factions all have a very similar roster with only a few key differences. Understandable, since they are all located in the same geographic area, but after 10+ years, you end up wishing there was more variety.

That is where mods come in. To take full advantage of mods, you'll need the Kingdoms expansion pack. However, the Steam version doesnt have good mod support. This title would greatly benefit from a steam workshop of some sort. While some of the greatest mods are compatabile with the Steam version like Third Age: Total War, Stainless Steel, and Rise of Three Kingdoms work with flying colors, others like Custom Campaign 2, Lands to Conquer Gold, and Kingdoms Grand Campaign are seemingly incompatable with the steam version.

I'm aware that this more a responsibility of these mod teams than Steam, but it would be nice to have more integration and have the Steam version be more readily accepting of mods.

14,33010529,english,"I love the middle ages and am very intrested in that time. the Crusades, the wars and how each army was used. and how people just interacted. this game is one of the best games ive ever played. 

Pros
-Solid Campaign, will make you want to play every country
-Each Country feels different. countries very similar like egypt and turkey will not have the same units
-managing cities is very fun
-sounds horrific but killing entire cities and making them worship your relgion... yeah lol
-able to create an empire. My Holy roman empire covered all of western europe ( Not spain, they were giving me money not to kill them all ) all the way into Russia, from Norway down to north central africa and even in the New World.
-Battles are amazing. i played as england and fought the mogolians in the Holy Land. I thought using spears would help me but it did not. the Mogols knew i would do this and didnt take the bait, instead kept shooting arrows on my men. i then had my horses attack the Mongol flanks and the horse archers were forced away. i thyen had my longbow men advance behind my spears until the Heavy horses had no choice but to attack my lines. i thought id win and lose a million times until the mongols were beaten. 
- it doesnt feel like rock paper, each until has pros and cons but all arent stupid. archers can fight off heavy cav but is it a good idea, no because youll lose a lot. alot depends on momentum.
- a ton of other stuff that are smaller, in my opinion its the small stuff that makes a game

cons
- mostly limnited to the old engine. but it doesnt matter brcause everything else makes up for it

23,32962579,english,"This Game is Highly Overrated. The game has a lot of glitches and just a lot of big and small things wrong with it. The auto Resolving is broken. Not only in fight if you have a say 78% chance of winning, sometimes you could save and reload over 25 times and it still would not work. You could outnumber you opponent 1200-350 and have a 38% chance to win the fight for no reason. Worse of all, we you auto resolve and win, you kill also no men.

The archers in the game are SUPER inaccurate, And they don't even have a option to go into melee combat. So you just have to run them into some random units to have them fight. All of the factions Strengths and weaknesses are all the same. They ether have strong infantry and weak Cavalry or the opposite. the units in the game are very slow, and the Calvary are the same speed as the infantry.  Your forced to get out of your castle in order to defend it Witch makes no sense. If you lose your General, all your units give up, but if you kill your opponents General they get 0 Morale loss.

The diplomacy in the Game is Stupid, People are 100% open to you at the start, but if you do one thing they hate you and will refuse to do anything at all. The Turks and the Russians are attack by multiple massive army's in the game, making them very hard to play as. The pope makes Many people go to War with Egypt right away making it hard for them, And with everyone who is Christian, you can't declare War on anyone around you, without your towns going down Massively in Happiness. The Fact that this game does not have a workshop to fix these problems is maybe the worse part of all. 


I deeply hope I stop some of you from making a horrible decision.

I recall a specific example of the amazing campaign AI when one of my long-time allies thought they had a chance at some of my territory and decided to turn on me and try to cut my empire in half. I immediately decimated their armies and took a third of their territory. They were so terrified at being utterly destroyed that I convinced them to give me another third of their territory in exchange for a truce. The end result was that they lost the vast majority of their empire and nearly all of their military strength. I never had to park troops anywhere near my borders with them again. We made peace and went back to being allies with trading rights and they never even thought about expanding again. For over 100 years they were a lesser power that knew their place under my reign as the dominant European faction.

I could go on with further examples but I won't bore you. The battle AI isn't the best in the series but is as good as the base AI in Rome. The mod community is expansive and the base campaign is incredibly well balanced and fun. I have my complaints but overall the game has significantly more positives than negatives.

[b]Comment:[/b]
Just like RTW I finally bought this game here on Steam so I would have a digital copy of it as my discs are getting old. And it is worth purchasing because it is a phenomenal RTS game and a great addition to the Total War series. The graphics have aged a bit but the game still looks good. Multiplayer is fun but the single-player campaign is what takes the cake. A huge map with many factions to choose from initially, later each defeated nation is unlocked as playable in the campaign. The gameplay is divided into 3 parts just like in RTW - cities management, sea battles and land battles. The management is great but the land battles are what makes this a classic. Most of the units, even siege engines, are nicely done and serve a purpose. The fighting is tactical and fair, although sometimes rather difficult. The AI still has some problems but usually just minor issues. On top of all this are the mods, the INCREDIBLE mods. There are so many it would be hard to write all the good ones but MY personal favourites are Stainless Steel, Europa Babarorum 2 & Third Age Total War. This game is worth your money if you like RTS games and is a great successor to RTW!

31,31617358,english,"What a classic!

It's a great game that makes me reminisce about my childhood. All in all, for modern players who haven't got a PC that can't run a more modern TTW game, curious people who want to play an old TTW title, or people like me who like to reminisce. Plus there is an excellent mod called: The Third Age: Total War, which is basically a Lord of the Rings conversion, which has numerous expansions and an entire campaign, the amount of work gone into the mod is amazing and I highly, HIGHLY recommend it to any LOTR fans. Anyway, back to the base game...

GAMEPLAY:

So like any TTW game, there are two maps, the campaign and the battle map. On the campaign map, you can see all of the main settlements within view and other objects like armies, spies, merchants, diplomats etc... This is where you manage your faction, build structures within your settlements and recruit troops. You move your armies around the map and engage enemy armies or settlements. You can then choose whether to auto-run the battle, or play it yourself on the battle map, where you will move your troops around in real-time, either on an open map or in a siege battle depending on the circumstances. 

You have a family tree which evolves throughout the years, some may die from diesease, others in battles and most from old age. Is basically like Crusader Kings, but a lot less in depth. Your faction will have victory conditions which will need fulfilling to complete the game, which will unlock a lot more playable factions. 

So yeah, it's a classic TTW game.

GRAPHICS AND SOUND:

Well it's not a very demanding game, so you'll be able to run it on most low budget pc systems. But the graphics definitely aren't terrible! There are some graphic overhaul mods out there too for those of you who have better systems.
Sounds are great for the style and age of the game. 

PROS:
- Good in-depth strategy game
- Great battles
- Good amount of unique factions
- Good DLC
- Inexpensive
- Not very demanding in terms of system power
- Awesome mod

CONS:
- Outdated (but still worth playing!)

OVERALL:

It's the perfect game for people who desire a good strategy game for a low-budget system and for those who want to try a classic TTW game too, I also recommend Rome: Total War!",1494211054,1494211054,True,23,0,0.704420983791351318,0,True,False,False,76561198154269385,58,6,1476,0,1476,1487625106,,
32,31614529,english,"At over ten years old, this game has held up really, really well. It stands up to me as one of the best Total Wars of those I've played (Shogun, Rome I, Rome II, Medieval II, a few mods.) I have spent over 350 hours on it, and so I couldn't possibly not recommend it, certainly in terms of money spent to time played, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. 

Firstly, the good points: Medieval II builds on all the good ideas in Rome I: the gameplay is solid, and the AI is notably smarter than in Rome (not really saying much to be honest. In Rome II it's notably smarter than in Medi II.) The smaller battles generally feel fun and interesting - watching a cavalry charge send enemy peasants flying as the horses and men collide is satisfying on a basic gut level - and there is genuine satisfaction in causing a huge enemy force to rout and sending your men in to run them down. Your generals are fun to manage and it's great watching them develop traits that are influenced by the battles. (For example a general that gets hurt in combat will develop ""scarred"" traits, increasing his hit points, and one that executes prisoners and sacks cities will devleop ""dreaded"" traits making him scarier - maybe if he's a real psycho he'll get his own torturer!

Now the negatives: At times the game feels like a lot of good ideas that weren't tested properly. For example, the Pope will threaten you with excommunication (in game terms this translates to a public order penalty, making your cities more likely to rebel, and the worry that he may even ask other Catholic factions to send huge crusading armies to your cities.) The problem is that seemingly no matter what you do, the Pope is likely to threaten you with excommunication for any war against another Catholic factions. Very well, you may think. You'll only war with non-Catholic factions. However, unfortunately diplomacy in this game is totally broken. Thanks to an unfortunate unfixed bug even staunch allies are likely to stab you in the back. Even if you're the greatest power since the Roman Empire and their 'empire' is a loose collection of wooden castles they'll still eventually gather up a mob of peasants to send at your worst-defended city. And when you defend yourself, no matter how nice you are (releasing the prisoners instead of executing them as any Medieval ruler likely would for such blatant treachery) the Pope will tell you not to retaliate or face excommunication.

The alternative is to play as one of the non-Catholic factions, such as the Orthodox Russians and Byzantines, or the Muslim Turks, Egyptians or Moors. Sadly, this brings me to the second great but flawed idea: the Mongols. The Mongols attack with huge armies with amazing generals you are unlikely to be able to match and cannot hope to be better than. It's a great idea - give you a large and powerful enemy to battle as a real challenge, but while it is possible (albeit difficult) to beat them, it's just not very much fun. Usually it's the same endless slog of holding up in a castle, raining fire on them and then feeding them into the meat grinder of your spears. 

The final minor gripe is the unit selection. Unlike the Roman world where each culture felt quite distinct in terms of its army makeup, most factions, especially in the early game, feel very similar. In the West it's militia, knights and peasants with bows or crossbows, and in the East cavalry archers. Only Scotland and Denmark really feel unique to begin with. 

The Kingdoms expansion really adds more of the same, generally on a smaller and more intimate level. It's four new campaigns and really this is nothing to complain about. In my experience Britannia was a lot of fun to play, while the Crusades and Teutons campaigns were good for one playthrough each. The Americas discovery campaign wasn't great, but might be enjoyable if you want a challenge, either in city management (as the Spanish trying to convert the natives) or on the battlefield (the Aztecs / Mayans, trying to fight a much more advanced military force.)

As much as I've criticised in this review, these minor gripes really can't prevent me from recommending this as one of the best Total War games available, and a must for battlefield strategy fans. Buy this game, you won't regret it (except when you're exhausted at school or work because you stayed up until 3am conquering the Holy Land, because seriously, this game is  a time sink like you would not believe.) As an added bonus, it has a decent modding community who can add real variety to the game.",1494196305,1494196305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197997275379,73,2,46821,0,22128,1596915084,,

You can use this to your advantage as well against your enemies.
Attacking countries that are Roman Catholic - Byzantines and the Russians, you will not be penalized and the same goes for conquoring the middle east.
Playing as the countries with different religions is also something that gives this game added depth, playing Muslim countries like Egypt, Turkey, the Mongols, and the Moors. The variety in gameplay is fantastic.

49,31350684,english,"Alright, so I've played the Total War series from the original Shogun: Total War, Rome: Total War, the Barbarian Invasion and Alexander Expansions, and when this game came out, I let out a hardy war cry of joy (not really, because people would think I was a bloody lunatic). I even played Empire and Napoleon (but they didn't feel as good to me). But trying to be as unbiased and from a modern perspective, I'm going to make a stab at reviewing this game.

Graphics: The graphics of this game isn't all that bad, but doesn't hold up to more modern titles and can appear a bit dated. Even so the graphics have aged surprisingly well and while not as smooth as some newer titles, it's servicable and really isn't all that bad for a decade-old title. 

Sound Design: The sound effects in this game aren't bad. I thought that the sounds might not hold up all that well, but I was glad to find I was mistaken. Everything from the sounds in the menu to the sounds of a firing cannon, crossbowmen winding up their weapons, or the sounds of a pitched melee, the sound design is still very good.

Music: Perhaps one of the parts of the game that really holds up well. The rendition of Ailein Duinn for the Britannia expanion is very well done. Honestly the OST is something I occasionally listen to from time-to-time. The music is very well composed, even impressive for a game, many of the tracks feel truly timeless and manage to fit in well with the period without being cheesy or feeling jarring. The orchestral work here is well worth a listen.

Gameplay: Don't let the amount of time I played on Steam fool you. I've probably 'wasted' an entire year or so of my life in game-hours on this game's cd version. After I lost the box and CD for a while, I re-purchased the Steam version to get my fix... and it's all because of the gameplay, that beautiful, sweet, delicious gameplay. Controls may be a bit odd for newcomers to the series, but after you get used to them it's like second-nature. Controls in battle are smooth, intuitive, and engaging. This game features both a world-map for grand strategy, but then breaks down into a tactical battlefield map in which you control units attempting to win individual battles with your guile. It's a great mix and I really wish other grand strategy titles would take up a similar formula.

Factions: Holy s*** does this game (and the expansions) have a good selection of factions. The core game only centers around Europe and North-most Africa, but the expansions do include the Americas. 

Mods: A section in its own right. Some modders have done amazing work adding in China, Japan, and the Warhammer fantasy mod on mod DB is freaking fantastic when you consider that the game engine is over a decade old now. Honestly I really wish I knew how they did it.

Overall: I was surprised to find that this game, after all these years, is still a timeless classic that's fun and engaging. For me this game ranks higher for playability and fun-factor than other, more popular titles. While Starcraft 1 and Dark Reign are still solid games nowadays, they feel dated and old when I play them, somehow Medieval II: Total War is immune to being dated. This is the game (that at least for me) sold the series, and has been a cherished title I return to again-and-again after all these years, if that isn't the hallmark of a great game, I don't know what is.",1493093840,1493093876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198054460004,431,22,776,0,501,1599669175,,

Some factions have very similar colors so it can get confusing when the french and the portuguese go head to head on a battlefield. I know that's the reason why the banners are there but they dont really help when you're trying to watch the heat of battle and you dont know who's fighting.the campaign difficulty of the AI is great and is very challenging although when it comes to the battle difficulty it's lacking a little bit.It would also be great if the islamic factions would be buffed and the mongols and timurids would be playable factions because there are on 3 playable islamic factions in the game and they're all too similar.

This game is fantastic when it comes to gameplay.You can read a ton of positive reviews on here,but I can't recommend this game to you if you want to play multiplayer,because it's simply 0 fun.

The mechanics are there,you can play against players like you can against AI but the performance,to put it frankly,is DREADFUL.

Once you get 3000-4000 units on the battlefield the game shits itself.You can run it at good fps with whatever your specs are,but the units just move for 0.1sec then stop for 0,3 sec and you barely get anything done!

I had the displeasure of playing a siege battle 3vs2 and just destroying the walls and getting our men through took 1h30min , I'm not joking.The whole battlefield looked like a Win 98 trying to run CS GO.
By the time the walls of the Castle were destroyed all fun had crumbled with them and there was immense frustration on both parties,that soon turned into a chat war for the simplest of things .. the game started with friendly attidude and the frustration from the wasted time turned into toxicity in seconds.

As far as I know this is an issue with other Total War titles as well.

Get this game if you want the amazing single player experience.
Do NOT waste your money for this game's multiplayer,because its unplayable.

(It shows my hours for this game as low, but I purchased and played this game long before I ever used Steam. So this version on Steam is me purchasing and installing the game years later after I first played it. It's that good.)

This is the first Total War game I played, and what a title to break into the franchise with. I wish I could write a huge review about all the good things, but it's hard to describe a Total War game without taking too much time to do so. I'll just say that in my opinion it's the best Total War ever made, and it is as close to perfect as any title I have ever played for any game on any system. If you have played another Total War title and are thinking about trying out this one, DO IT! There are literally only two TINY, TINY things that I dislike about this game:

You cannot change the controls, so moving the map around is done by the arrow keys, instead of W A S D.
-0.1

You cannot change or choose heirs on the family tree. So lets say your faction leader has children, but are not of age, and he has adopted a general, that general will become the faction leader instead of following the bloodline. This has lead to lots of time and resources wasted in trying to get these adopted generals killed, so the family tree has to automatically change. Either that or I don't accept any Candidates for Adoption, which is a handicap agaisnt me. Or I suppose I could just let some outsider take over the Kingdom, but that isn't realistic at all.
-0.1

This game gets the most perfect score I have given a Total War game, with a 4.8/5

All 3 Total War games I have played are legendary to me. My rankings for them go Medieval II > Rome II > Shogun II.

The AI is atrocious, the units feel like empty sock puppets that never actually contact the enemy and just play their own dumb animations, they move so slowly that most of the time im playing it on 6X speed for any progress to be made. The AI, oh my. All your units have the IQ and memory span of a Dory fish, meaning they will obey your command for about 6 seconds, then abruptly stop for no apparent reason. I have to keep furiously clicking on an enemy unit for them to actually continue attacking/pursuing. 

The game, especially the combat just doesnt have a solid feel, its like playing with paper if you know what i mean. There are also stability issues, meaning it will freeze every few hours or so, this is very annoying. With more than 800 hours into the total war series (both on this computer and my old one), i cannot recommend this game. If you must, but it at 90% off. Thats all its worth.

If I had to pick my second favorite Total War game it would probably be this one. 

You play as ruler of a nation during the feudal era of Europe and parts of Western and Central Asia. As this ruler it is your job to spread the dominance of your culture and religion across the old world while trading, bartering, negotiating, and fighting with other nations who are more than likely just going to be more heads on the pikes at the end of your campaign. 

It is a time of great uncertainty. The powers of the world won't stop calling one another mean names and every now and then you have to send a priest out to deal with a heretic in what is essentially a bible fight. 
Like Rome, Shogun, Medieval I, and the games after it, Medieval II is split between a campaign map and a battle map that changes depending on what location on the campaign map the battle takes place in. 

You still have the usual things, you build your cities, do diplomacy, move your armies around on the map, command huge armies in battle, things like that. So lets talk about all the neat little things Medieval II adds to the formula.

One, there's an obvious graphical improvement. Medieval II looks miles better than Rome, and adds other improvements such as a change in unit models depending on their weapon and armor levels. If your peasant spearmen are equipped with chainmail then the chainmail will actually show on their models instead of it just being implied to be there. 

Second, the addition of religion and mercantilism adds another level of roleplaying to your campaign as you attempt to convert peoples of other faith or do battle with other merchants for economic resources and business rights. 

Third, new animations and battle damage are added to your armies. So sometimes you get to see a cool little animation where a soldier will beat up an an enemy and call him mean names. There's also blood, while not as gory as later Total War games, your units will get drenched in blood the longer they fight, indicating how long that individual  soldier has before biting it. 

And fourth, the soundtrack is probably the best Total War soundtrack to date. My personal opinion, but my opinion is great. 

There have been also a few events added to the campaign mode. Things such as the Mongol invasion, the black plague, discovering the new world, Crusades, Jihads, the Pope excommunicating you because you're too radical and he's tired of your skateboard phase. etc. 

Wow, all these cool things! So what's wrong?

A few things. 

First, the AI once again doesn't like to cooperate. They're ask for trade rights, map information, and an alliance one turn and then attack you the next. Broken armies of 50 or so people will gladly die to your thousands rather than end the war, and the Pope always seems to demand that you stop a war you're winning even though more than not you didn't start it. He's that kind of school principle. 

[h1]But should you play Medieval II: The one with the armies, not the one with the skeleton guy? [/h1]

When it comes to the mid 2000 Total War games I feel like it comes down to preference. Do you prefer antiquity to feudalism? Or do you like Knights over Legionarries and Hoplites? Either or you can't go wrong with Medieval II. 

The additions to campaign mode are welcomed and there's plenty of meat there if you treat the Total War games more like a roleplaying game than a strategy game. I have about as much time on the physical copy of this one as I do in Rome: total War. 
And if you want, you can still technically play as the Roman Empire in the form of the Byzantines. It's not really the same thing, but hey, they're there. 

Also, the modding scene is friggin astounding. Everything from gameplay tweaks to full out new games.
Two that stand out to me are ""Thera: Legacy of The Great Torment"" and ""Third Age: Total War"", the latter being a Lord of the Rings total conversion of the Kingdoms expansion pack.

Medieval II: Total War gets a big number out of a big number.

[h1]A MUST HAVE MEDIEVAL GENOCIDE SIMULATOR[/h1]

[h1]Personal Insights[/h1]
There's a myriad of sources out there that can cover the intricacies of gameplay far better than I could, so I'll try not to waste your time reading my review, when you could be in Medieval II fighting off 8 invading factions simultaneously, and outsmarting every enemy general on the battlefield.

[h1]The Good[/h1]
Outmaneuver enemy armies of better equipped knights and professional crossbowmen and win by epic, narrow margins with your  town militia and peasant archers in the early game, then laugh when you yourself raise armies of knights, and crush peasant armies with K/D ratios of 1:100 in the late game when you have so much excessive gold, you find yourself building Huge Cathedrals and Brothels in every corner of your empire just to drain your bloated treasury.
There is no better feeling than when you've crushed all other factions except Denmark, Russia, Turkey, and Egypt, who then decide to form a super-alliance to prevent you from conquering the 20 remaining territories on the map, which you then do anyway.
Unrest growing in a city? Raise taxes to Very High, move your entire garrison outside the city, and then wait. When the city rebels in 3-5 turns, besiege the city, kill the rebel soldiers, and then exterminate the populace to reestablish peace in your empire.
Tired of using battering rams? Send 5 spies into an enemy castle for guaranteed access to Didney Worl! Laugh as the gates open as your troops surge through, and kill the French King to punish them for their crime of daring to proclaim French cuisine as superior to Italian.
Artillery Elephants.
When your general kills enough prisoners of war and exterminates the populations of enough cities, he can earn the epithet, ""The Butcher"". With 10 stars of command and 10 skulls of dread, Bindello the Butcher held off the Mongol invaders with little more than armies of Spear Militia and Peasant Crossbowmen. Unfortunately for him, Bindello the Butcher eventually died in an earthquake when I sent him to retire on the Iberian Peninsula.

[h1]The Bad[/h1]
Vanilla AI sometimes fails to attack you with large enough armies. 
Vanilla AI sometimes lets you siege their capital for several turns, even though they have a full army nearby that could attack your besieging army, and break the siege.
Executing Prisoners makes your faction ""Untrustworthy"". Why should enforcing capital punishment have any effect on trust?
Vanilla AI will break a 50+ year old alliance to attack one of your lowest income villages, even though your army, wealth, and territories outnumber theirs by a ratio of 6:1.
Vanilla AI will declare war by blockading one of your ports, and then failing to attack or do anything else for the next 80 years.
Although Battle AI is mostly competent, if not brilliant, there have been a few scenarios in which opposing generals appear brain dead. If you siege a castle, and the AI has external reinforcements, the reinforcements have a decent chance of just camping outside the castle, and letting you slaughter its defenders without trying to aid their own faction.

[h1]Online[/h1]
Online experiences are limited to battles in the base game, although it appears you can run hotseat campaigns in the expansions. My experience with online multiplayer as been extremely limited, as my first online match was this year, more than a decade after this game was released. Nevertheless, I have been extremely satisfied with the handful of matches that I have had. Be warned though; in 2017 and beyond, it will be hard, if not impossible, to join an open match. Join some Medieval II groups, or tell your friends to buy this game if you want the most out of the online battles.

[h1]Mods[/h1]
My recommendations for modding the game? Play the game totally Vanilla for at least one long Grand Campaign, and then think carefully about what you would like changed. I put in over 200 hours in the Vanilla game before deciding to provide some tweaks to add some more options for gameplay. My current mods include Ultimate AI for the Campaign AI, and about 8 changes to the game files. Those changes are:
[olist]
[*]Movement Speed increase for agents (but not armies)
[*]Increasing Age limit for Generals, so my 10 Star Generals stop dying at age 60.
[*]Increased Garrisons (free upkeep slots) for Cities and Castles
[*]Trainable Generals
[*]Stronger Walls/Gates, to make sieges a bigger challenge.
[*]Added Schiltrom (defense formation) to more units
[*]Misc. Diplomacy Fixes (easier Military Access)
[*]Misc. Mission Fixes
[/olist]

[h1]Closing Thoughts[/h1]
My experience with the Total War series actually began with the original Medieval: Total War. Medieval II has proven to be an improvement over nearly every asset of that game, and is actually compatible with modern hardware. If you like any other of the games in the Total War series, fictional Medieval scenarios, RTS's, or Eurocentricism simulators, I strongly recommend this game.

[i]TL;DR[/i]
[b]As Milan, my faction was excommunicated for failing to stop annexing the territories of my Catholic neighbors. The Pope declared a Crusade to take back Rome, which I had annexed from the Papal States several turns earlier. Seeing as I controlled all of Europe except for England at that point, I decided to hunker down at Rome, and let the lone English Crusading army actually reach its intended destination. At Rome, I had a full garrison of high quality Milanese militia, led by three generals. Outside of Rome, I had placed another full army ouside the gates as reinforcements. When the English Crusaders arrived, I was somewhat worried, as the English had brought proper Knights and Armored Swordsmen, whereas I had Spear Militia and Cavalry Militia. Nevertheless, I waited for the English assault. Sure enough, the English began their assault on the walls of Rome with catapults and trebuchets. Yet, they never managed to see Rome's interior. My Cavalry Militia sallied out of the gates, and killed the artillery crew, while my reinforcements attacked the would-be Crusaders from the rear. The English Crusading army was destroyed, and as equal and just retaliation, I annexed the entire British Isles and exterminated their citizens for good measure.

What makes this game's campaigns the most enjoyable for me are the historic events that pop during the game. Events like the Mongol or Timurid Invasion, the invention of gun power and the introduction of guns and cannons in the late game or even the discovery of the Americas are what makes this game so unique among the other games of the series.

Also, if you own the addon, Medieval II has the best total conversion mods of any Total War game to offer, some of which more than equal the base game in quality and depth.

[h1]Positives:[/h1]

+ Nice music soundtrack which fits the Medieval theme of the game.
+ Great unit variety, with swordsmen, spearmen, archers, cavalry and siege engines like trebuchets and catapults available to use.
+ Many buildings to construct in your towns or castles, such as farms, roads, churches, leather tanneries and so on, each providing different benefits to your kingdom. 
+ Dated graphics but they are still acceptable. Units like templar knights are quite colourful.
+ A really cool religious system. Catholic countries in Europe have a reputation among the Pope which can be improved through completing religious missions or building churches. The higher your reputation the more sway you have with the holy leader, so you can order crusades in Muslim lands for honour and glory. If you play as an Islamic faction, you can order jihads lol.
+ Decent map size extending across Europe and the Middle East.
+ Expansion packs are huge and offer even more gameplay. 
+ Command thousands of troops on screen at once in epic battles.
+ Nice mix of agents on the campaign map, each with different purposes. Priests can convert regions to your religion and denounce witches or heretics, but if they are unsuccessful, could turn to a life of heresy themselves. Assassins are another key unit, skilled in the art of killing enemy generals or family members. Then there's merchants, which can capitalise on trade goods across the world map and send the profits back to your kingdom, but foreign merchants may try to drive you out of business! Diplomats are fairly self explanatory and royal princesses can visit other kingdoms to find a husband, while also acting as a diplomat too. 
+ Hundreds of hours of gameplay here.


[h1]Negatives:[/h1]

- Unit animations on the battlefield aren't very good. They're difficult to see and not that interesting. Later installments of the Total War series improved this. 
- Diplomacy is virtually useless, allies are unreliable and will attack for literally no reason, your relationship with them does not impact the likelihood of whether they will attack you. This is a major problem with the game, mods don't seem to fix anything (I've tried multiple ones.) 
- This game has constant warfare due to the broken diplomacy system. You never do get a break from conquering other kingdoms. Anyone who has played a total war game before knows that it can be quite overwhelming, tiresome and boring fighting turn after turn. It's nice to build your empire in peace sometimes. You don't really get that opportunity in Medieval II: Total War.
- Overpowered Mongol hordes that appear during the late-game can be very irritating. For some unknown reason, Creative Assembly (the developers) like to throw a curve ball at the players in almost every single total war title they release. Total War: Shogun 2 had realm divide, where every Japanese faction declared war on you after you became too powerful, Total War: Rome II had civil wars, where massive armies spawn in your territory to take over. Medieval II: Total War has....the Mongols. All I can say is good luck and be prepared for when they arrive.

Overall Score: 8/10

Even though Medieval II: Total War is an old game which struggles with diplomacy and realism, it has a lot of fun features and micro-management which the more modern total war games seem to neglect. The use of priests to remove witches and heretics, the inquisition trialling your family's characters for blasphemy, the crusades, merchants who fight over resources  - this is all good, interesting gameplay on top of the real time battles. It's an excellent if not exhausting game, due to the AI's constant affinity for wanting to attack you.",1392362887,1486620186,True,6,1,0.529760003089904785,3,True,False,False,76561198007211313,119,97,5989,0,5185.0,1431934327,,

Don't let the aged graphics fool you. Though the game may seem less polished or action packed than its newer cousins, I still think the combat system and the pace of the battles beat that of any of the newer games.

In Rome 2 (and Attila, to some extent) enemies charging each other sometimes seem to just 'melt together' to some degree. In an instant, a battlefield becomes a confusing, cluttered mess.
In Medieval 2, opposing armies really 'clash' while engaging each other: you can see the troops pushing and shoving with their shields, physically holding back their opponents. This hugely adds to a 'hold the line!'-element in battle experience:
It makes defending a battered gateway, or being outnumbered and squared up in an open field really fun.

You see, Med II is a very intersting girlfriend. I have never seen her before, but when I did see her I knew what I had to do. This girl was gorgeous!

She was great at first, but it was hard maintaining a relationship, mainly because she was a little old school in the graphics department, but she was happy at least. Then her A.I became very predictable, and despite numreous attempts at trying to make her a little bit more suprising I changed the difficulty and other settings that didn't help all to much.

If you didn't understand any of that, than here it is in different wording. Med II is fun at first but the A.I gets very predictable and eventually either to easy or way too hard.

The AI can be a bit weird at times, does the whole dancing unit thing occasionally, but it seems to do better at pressing an advantage or running away than the AI in more recent Total War games.(Warhammer really comes to mind) 

Once you get tired of the base game, there are numerous mods for this game that are either completed or in development. Third Age: Total War, The Elder Scrolls: Total War, and Hyrule: Total War will all have you sinking hundreds of hours into this game if you let them. Or you can enhance the base game with the Stainless Steel mod and really give yourself a challege.

The hours I have on Steam for this game don't do it justice, honestly. I've racked up nearly 4x the amount if I include the copy I bought from Gamestop years ago. Seriously, this game rocks.",1483738189,1483738189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198091726402,202,21,30503,0,11764.0,1600648215,,

76,29021772,english,"I'd heard about this game when I got into shogun 2 and I really wanted to like it but after playing shogun 2 it just isn't tolerable.

The camera is painfully clunky and hard to control. It's not intuitive in the slightest and I found myself constantly having to pause just to readjust the camera so I could see what was going on.

The units don't follow your commands very well, especially in seige battles, they won't form up they wander off, they go down ladders despite being set to stand guard. It's like trying to keep track of a small child in a zoo and it's just as frustrating.

In the deployment phase there are areas your men should be able to stand where they simply won't do it. no explanation they just refuse to be placed where you want them. It's especially irritating when one guy of an enemy troop gets past your front line and ALL of your archers in a unit stop shooting just to fight that one guy. Speaking of archers that hand red line from Shogun 2 that tells you when you are in range? yeah that's gone you have no way of knowing just how far archers can fire and I see them constantly shooting into walls and at things they can't hit wasting tons of their ammo and doing nothing.

The enemy AI is dumb as a rock, they ignore gates and funnel themselves into choke points making it really easy to win battles even when outnumbered.

Overall the game feels dated and clunky especially when compared to the newer titles. I really wanted to like this game but at this point I'm 90% sure that this game's reputation comes from a nostalgic fan base and not from any real quality of the game.

That, and hiring competent AI programmers so they can stop oversimplifying and removing basic game mechanics just so that AI has less things to fuck up.

Here's a short list of things M2TW does better than the later titles:

-To start, this is by far the most moddable Total War in the series. Everything from units to animations to the campaign and battle maps are completely moddable. Even the AI is moddable to a limited extent.

-Has by far the best recruitment system of any Total War game. Every unit has a limited pool to recruit from that replenishes at variable rates based on the building they're recruited from. Higher quality professional soldiers replenished slower than lower quality militia units, which prevents churning out stacks of elite units in quick order, atleast until you get to the point where you own half of Europe. I'm actually baffled as to why they moved away from this, but it was probably due to Creative Assembly being incapable of making the AI work with it.

-NO LIMITED BUILDING SLOT NONSENSE. And no idiotic food mechanics that further restricted your building choices either. In M2TW's cities/castles, you could pretty much build everything in every city/castle. BUT you can only build one building at a time, so to be optimal you still had to specialize each city/castle for a specific purpose early on. 

-Agents that actually served a strategic purpose, rather than just being a general nuisance or generic regional stat buff.

-Battles that last more than 5 minutes. This is again probably due to CA's AI short comings, as the battle AI throughout the years has yet to evolve beyond ""engage front line, flank with any extra cavaly, suicide general"". The shorter the battles the are the less this is a problem, but the longer battles go it becomes easier for the player to out manuver and smash the AI.

-Soldiers have actual mass. Heavier units will actually force weaker units backwards in melee. In the later Warscape plagued titles, a few dozen of the weakest unit imaginable can literally prevent hundreds of heavy infantry from moving forwards. 

-Sieges that were, at the very least, fun to defend and attack on. M2TW certainly has the most complicated siege battles, with the highest level castles having 3 sets of walls to overcome. The AI can have a tough time with it, but it usually does okay. Total War AI has always been a little extra special when it comes to siege battles, but other than Shogun 2 the AI has gotten significantly worse at them since M2TW, despite siege battles being significantly simplified.

As superior M2TW undoubtably is, there are a number of things later Total Wars do better:

-Graphics, an obvious one, though the graphics in M2TW still look pretty decent today.

-UI. M2TW's UI is big, ugly, and clunky, and scales poorly on widescreen resolutions. Definitely has not aged well.

-No fuckin diplomats. All diplomacy can be done instantly without the need of an agent running around all of Europe just to die of the plague right when you need him the most.",1482433490,1482655645,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561197970636254,325,18,898,0,31.0,1505602675,,

Seriously though, this game is still awesome, even after all these years later! In fact, M2:TW just celebrated its 10th birthday, this November 2016! And its still easily one of the best, if not the best, of the Total War series!
Improving upon, and outdoing most everything in the previous M:TW and Rome:TW (whose engine it uses) games, Medieval II was a triumph of RTS when it was first released. And a year later, it only got better with the best Total War expansion to date, Kingdoms. And thats not even considering all the many wonderful fan-made mods this title has available, thus extending its greatness even more so! Even fantasy lands are game! Want to wage war in Middle-Earth? There's a mod for that! Feel like fighting for The Elder Scrolls' Tamriel? There's a mod for that! How about waylaying the Warhammer world? Well, actually, that game was released earlier this year. But..there's still mods that predate that!

Caution: this game is a time consumer! You can EASILY spend 50+ hours on just one campaign alone, and given that there are 17 playable factions available (eventually) in just the base game alone, and that there is NO END DATE for any campaign (only an end to the campaign objectives, but the game still goes on, so you can play a medieval kingdom all the way into the 21st century and beyond, take that modernity! #ProgressIsForSuckers), you can rack up a kingdom's worth of time spent on this game! Rome wasn't built in a day, they say, but it sure was completed faster than this game is!

Whether it be conquering your back-stabbing neighbors (all the italian powers, always!!), managing your empire (where is the govenator when you need him?), retaking the Holy Land from the infidel (ya jerks!), converting the heathen (come on fellas, its ""A.D."" now, get with the program already!), or making a heroic last stand for all of Christendom against the rapacious onslaught of the Golden Horde (which is what you get when you don't tip the chinese food delivery guy on one too many occasions), yes sir, Medieval II has it all. 
Even the possibility of having one of your generals get so cuckholded by his nakedly adulterous wife, that he loses it, becomes the most shameless man on earth, and shacks up with a tranny, thus bringing eternal shame to your kingdom! As I said, Medieval II has it all. Even things the developers really should have just left alone...*ahem*.

If your a strategy gaming fan, there are certain games in the genre you just have to have played in your lifetime, like Age of Empires II: Age of Kings. This is that kind of game. Don't miss out. 
And here's to hoping that the developers go back on their ""we don't make games with the number '3' in their titles"" statement, and, once they are done with (the also fantastic, well-worth-your-time) Warhammer: Total War, they start developing Medieval III.

The vanilla game is enjoyable, but there are plenty of mods out there to change the vanilla experience from what could be considered comparitvely shallow to a game with great depth (Stainless Steel, and the upcomming Dominion of the Sword mod). To be honest, the game itself is sort of a mod of Rome I: Total War, it doesn't really contribute anything gamechanging to the series besides a few engine improvements. It is still definitely an improvement over Rome though, even if not by too much. The extra campaigns added in Kingdoms are good. I personally greatly enjoyed the Teutonic campaign (this is probably the best of the expansion campaigns) and Britannia campaign (both great hotseat campaign experiences with my brother). The Crusades and Americas campaigns being enjoyable (I didn't play too much of the Americas campaign myself). The only thing this game lacks is true online multiplayer campaigns like the most recent installments in the series, which at the time of this writing would be Shogun 2 and Rome II (I beleive Empire had a beta for multiplayer campaigns as well). The reason why that was such an improvement is that it adds the ability to resolve battles between the players using the battle map and not resorting to autoresolve to be fair. All in all I would recommend this game over Rome I, and definitely over all the successors in the series (I never played Medieval I or Shogun I). Of course buying the Kingdoms expansion is a must.

This is in no small part thanks to the modding opportunities this period offers, of which one of the best is Third Age total war (Lord of the Rings). I recommend this game to all fans of real time tactics and the medieval period, although realism is not one of this game's strong suits *cough cough* color coded peasant uniforms.

Pros
Fun real time battles
Good mods, Third age with Divide and Conquer in particular is great, long live pope Sauron.


Cons
Bland campaign, either takes up too much time for what is essentially setup for the battles or is underdevelopped.
No real effort to represent feudal politics or the way that troops are levied, the campiagn feels like a bad Civ clone with an emphasis on war.
Not many factions (fixed with Stainless Steel mod)
Shit ai, from the the campaign ai not making any logical decision to ai generals charging cav up steep cliffs into pikes to unit ai disobeying simple orders.

Rome Total War and Medieval II Total War are by far the best strategy games of history.
Gameplay is extremely fun and decently historically accurate, graphics are quite good even with literally a decade old.

Los juegos Rome: Total War y Medieval II: Total War son sin lugar a dudas los mejores juegos de estrategia de la historia y se han convertido en un clásico que ha resistido el paso del tiempo. Con más de una década en el mercado se mantiene frescos porque su jugabilidad es increíblemente buena, son entretenidos y divertidos además el juego representa miles de horas de juego distinto entre si.

La comunidad del juego también es excelente, con muchos foros en varios idiomas en los que se mantiene vivo el debate y se reunen amigos para jugar en linea. El juego tiene una inmensa y apabullante cantidad de mods disponibles de manera gratuita que son simplemente obras maestras y brindan miles de horas más de juego; arreglan bugs, mejoran los gráficos, mejoran la exactitud histórica o lo modifican por completo para jugar en universos como el del Señor de Los Anillos, Juego de Tronos o Star Wars. No puedes cansarte de jugarlo.

When it comes to the Total War series this is the one I always seem come back to. 
I believe it has the most balanced starts than the other older Total Wars.
What I don't like recently is that the spy, diplomat, and other types of those units tend to do the same thing in the recent Total Wars. They were more classified into own entities in older games. 
I also really miss the family trees and getting really attached to my generals. I just don't get that anymore with the newer games.

The units in this game matter, but its how you use them that makes for the most interesting battles. Clearly when the professional (late game) units go up against peasants and such, especially in an open field, we know who is ultimately going to lose (in most cases), but with right combination of units, including peasants, and the right kind of placement, you can easily defending a settlement against even the most advanced/elite units. This also depends on difficulty too as the AI can be vicious if given the chance.

I aslo enjoyed the religion system in this game, but mainly for the catholic factions. The Papal states are not a minor faction and they will wreck you with not only their own units (which are pretty powerful) but all of Christendom will come together to crusade your face in should you get excommunicated or if the pope doesn't favor your faction nearly as much as the others (meaning he'll look the other way for a bit). For what it is, it is a complex, but straightforward system that can either be used to your advantage or used against you. 

The modding community for this game is pretty awesome too. Hyrule: Total War and Stainless Steel are both mods I love and they work so well with this game that it gives me endless hours of entertainment even to this day. The game still has a rather active modding community for something of its age, which is great since it just makes a great game even better. 

Finally, the game is just all around fun. How you play this game can easily make for a great time or just a great way to waste time in general all the while being entertained. I wish Sega and the Total War series in general looked back to this game and Rome: Total War (the first one) to see what they got so right about their game series and just put that + whatever improvements and mechanics (like naval battles) into the game. If they were to make a modern day version of this game with everything that made this game great, I would buy it in a heartbeat. But in the meantime, there is this game, so if you are looking to pick it up, do so and enjoy!",1479978935,1479978935,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False,76561197992174054,694,21,24121,0,21071,1507667713,,

Are you ready to breach and butcher, my lord?  I know I am!  There are many games that allow you to wield a sword or axe or bow, but, really, why do that when you can wield thousands of them?  The beauty of Medieval II, like the rest of the Total War series, is that it does an out-standing job of capturing the tactical nuances of combat from pre-modern eras, as well as doing the strategic piece pretty well also, insofar as you can manage your cities in a variety of different ways as well as control agents.  This is definitely a game for those that like to think and who like a game that rewards them for thinking.  MTW2, like the rest of the TW series, has diplomacy, agents, merchants, assassins, and priests, and captures the dimensions that these bring to the strategy.  However, these elements, like all others, are there, ultimately, as an element related to combat, which is where this series shines.  It is called Total War, after all, not Total Diplomacy, or Total Economic and Cultural dominance.  Additionally, the game events throw at you some unique challenges of the period which really do quite a lot to keep the challenge and pressure on even as your empire becomes more and more mighty.  For the period, the graphics are incredible, and like other TW games, it's a lot of fun to just zoom in and watch your units work.  All in all, this series is unique and indispensible to the PC gaming world.",1475418457,1475418457,True,4,0,0.512562811374664307,0,True,False,False,76561198013945410,720,32,37429,0,29150,1523142684,,

I can tolerate Rome II and Attila and I understand they arent the greatest as people expected).

It's my grand wish that after perhaps at the writing of this review; the Creative Assembly will release a Total War: Medieval III after Warhammer, because now that like Warhammer's game engine, the developers will most likely use a 64 bit engine rather than a 32 bit for the optimisational parts.

The only pain in the ass part about this game in particular, but acceptable as is would be the cavalry smashes. In Rome: Total War, cavalry had a much bigger impact whereas Feudal Knights/Mailed Knights/Crusader Knights (etc.) give out a rather awkward form of charging and flanking force. I kind of wish they would fix it, but then again, heavily armored men on horses does add a sense of slow movement, and I do not care that one small percent of the game's aspect does not change the astounding 99% percent other than this.

I was also one of the most christian of all the christain kingdoms. I could've called a crusade on ANYONE i didn't like. All was good right. Then the Milanese attacked. See during my entire game these spaghetti eating fucks would constantly antagonize me. Whenever they attacked i would smash through their puny armies and march right up to Milan itself, sometimes taking it and forcing them  to relocate to Venice or Genoa. I've killed more Doges then i could count. But i've never been able to completly rid myself of them. See for some reason that litteraly god only knows, the pope would demand i end my war with them whenever i was about to finish them off. So for about 50 or so years we played this game of mudering each other until the pope forced us, mostly just me, to stop. 

Eventually i just had enough. My kingdom was begining to fall and i could not handle to pay my way out of another war i could have won. The plague was ravaging its way across europe and i feared the french Nobility might have been planing to rebel. So when Milan attacked like they always did i played the game right up to where it always ended. With their remaing forces cowering behind the walls of milan or Venice as my galliant Generals prepared to storm the city and fly the banner of the three Lions from its walls. Like always the pope decided that i had my fun and i should apologize to milan like usual. But not this time, no this time i said Fuck you Pope and took milan, Killing their doge and destroying their entire army. Now you'd think this is where the story would end right? The good guys defying the odds and finally defeating their age old rival right? sadly this isn't the end nor will the end be so Romantic.

See after taking Milan, the Pope excomunicated me for defying him. Which made me public enemy Number 1 to even my closets allies. On top of that the Milanese regrouped in venice and trapped my men in Milan. If they went to take venice then they would lose milan to a greater force but if they stayed in milan then the Milanese would have more the time to rebuild. I was prepared to counter this by sending more forces into italy. But right as my men begin to enter italy from southern france, i get invaded. See my age old ally and undisputed ruler of Iberia, Spain, Decides to launch a full scale invasion over the mountains. Destroying what little resistance remained.

So here i stand. Ruler of a heretical empire that's barely holding together and being betrayed by its closest allies hoping to carve out part of it before it collapses like vulchers circling a dying animal. All becuase the Pope refused to let me have justice.

Many alliances, trade agreements, and marriages flourished. But the Pope called a crusade against Jerusalem, and I raised an army for the cause. My noble swordsmen clad in plate embarked for a long voyage through the Bay of Biscay, along the Iberian Coast, and then followed the North African coastline to take Cairo as a staging ground to move armies against Jerusalem. We were successful; my army took Cairo in the name of the Pope. I raised a new army and sent them northeast, deciding to take more land for the Pope. But, to my dismay, I saw that no other nations were joining the crusade. Complicating matters further, the Mongols joined the Turkish and Egyptian cause, and a three nation army destroyed my own in the field. Left with my original crusading army, in Cairo, we withstood one assault after the other. My fleet had returned home, evacuation wouldn't be here in time. After many assaults, my army broke through their coalition lines and we took Alexandira, watching Cairo fall back into enemy hands. There, we raised a fleet and sailed away from our enemies. But they pursed my fleet, and shadowed and raided us at every opportunity. Going back the original way would be too long. France had declared war, so I made the decision to invade southern France. We landed and razed the fortress to the ground. My army was thin, we wouldn't be able to hold it. We burned our ships and pushed north. We fought off raiding Frenchmen several times, and were forced to raze another fortress to the ground. Finally, my army of crusaders, diminished to less than fifteen men per unit, bloodied, muddied, exhuasted from years of combat, arrived in Caen, part of our continental territory. I put them on ships, and sent them home.

Rome was the entire objective of the campaign to reclaim Rome for true Romans (not like the Holy 'Roman' Empire). My Veteran army in Bolonga attacks the HRE army but they are reinforced.

HRE - 4100 Troops

Byzantuim - 1050 Troops

This should of been the end of my Italian campaign but the 4100 strong HRE army was actually 3 armies the first army was quickly defeated and then the second came. My horse archers softened the second army up but soon ran out of ammo then the lines of infantry smash into each other my left flank had hidden troops that attacked the left of the HRE army. The HRE'S right broke and then the enemy army got outflanked they fled and we were so close to victory. And then another army came, this time roughly equal to the amount of men I had left but the last army had feudal knights, superior to my infantry who were also Exhausted. I sent every last man in... and then the HRE army completely shattered. After the defeats of the first 2 armies the 3rd army simply broke and ran. On that day 2000 HRE troops were captured and 1500 were killed but the Byzantine army took heavy casualties too. Nearly 50% of there army were killed but regardless they had won.

My western border with The Holy Roman Empire is secured and christianty is almost fully restored, we must restore our eastern front! Many of our greatest builders were sent to build churches, chapels and Abbeys, we trained our greatest priests to become bishops and cleanse our eastern territory from the heretical thought. Our eastern border wasn't protected though, so we had to make alliances, Georgia came to us in request to trade, it was a perfect moment to make a diplomatic action and propose an alliance, gladly they accepted. We both had a common enemy of course, the heretics who call them selves ""Byzantines"".

They are nothing but a dying empire, after we aided Georgia in their wars and the world was shown the true strengh of Mother Hungary, the Russian and Polish embassies embraced our relations and proposed an alliance. Of course we agreed, now that we have Georgia in the east, Kievan Rus' in the north east and Poland in the north, we can direct our forces to the west!

The Holy Roman Empire is in constant war with our polish allies, but my advisor said that it's best to build up our economy. So we did, in a matter of years Hungary became the richest country in Europe and maybe in the whole world, soon we started buying cities from Poland and Kievan Rus', our borders grew and my kingdom strenghened. Our Polish friends were also getting stronger and our relations were better than ever. But Poland was too concerned with wars than with their own faith! The church has excomunicated them, and I had to declare war on my closest friend. I hasitated but I shudder to think that I could ever betray them...

The church was unpleased with my actions, but I can't betray my own friend, I still think there is hope for him, I just need to meet him once more, have a drink and discuss his issues with the church. But alas I was too late, he has fallen in battle trying to defend his lands, his entire city butchered, women and children.

24,24906187,english,"    Europe stands as the heart of monarchy, since the fall of Rome and the establishment of the Kingdoms. The Church determines the fate of all and cries for war upon the Islamic Kingdoms to the east. The year is 1066 and the Duke of Normandy; William (the Conqueor) has been given consent from the Pope to invade England and overthrow the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom. After the victory at Hastings, the Kingdom of England has been born and a new chapter in Medieval Europe has begun. With the Islamic push stopped at the Frankish victory of Tours, the Christian faith now demands retaliation and cries for Muslim blood. With the age of the Crusades now beginning, the world will now watch the world become divided by two religions and the age of Chivarly, Faith, and Conquest has become the objective for any ruler who possess such power and nobility. Despite the church having united Europe to the power of the Pope, rivalries continue to plague Europe with war. Lords use the peasantry as fodder in order to gain both wealth and reputation to become the most powerful ruler Europe shall ever have. Chivarly, Faith, Wealth, Total War...

    This is by far my most favorite Total War game ever, with improved graphics, gameplay, animations, and new weaponry   when compared with Rome: Total War. Watching Knights clash in shiny armor make every soldier a spectacle on the battlefield, watch as massive armies butcher each other leaving literally mountains of dead. This game has captured the brutality and chaotic atomsphere of medieval combat, especially with the aftermath of a battle as you are left speechless at the sight of a sea of dead stretching all over the battlefield. Remember Braveheart? That first battle scene at Stirling Bridge? That is pretty much what you would witness with each battle, as the game captures a more realistic and brutal spectacle compared with the First Rome Total War. Defineitly a must-buy, especially with the Kingdoms DLC, so worth it. Stretching from the wars of independence that ravaged England, to the Crusades in the Holy Land, to the wars between the Christians and the remnants of the religion of Paganism in the Baltic region, to the jungles of Central America as the New World has been discovered.

32,12852817,english,"An excellent game, it surpasses its predecessors. That said it marks a fundamental change – Empire and onwards are significantly different. 

Crank the graphics up to max and it still looks good. The sound variation gets somewhat dull though.

As is par for the series, there are some issues: the AI has pathfinding problems, especially inside cities/castles. You’ll see units running back and forth over the same spot, refusing to move onto walls, or refusing to come down from walls, or getting stuck in between – if you need to move units and walls are involved, plan for the movement to take a long time to complete.

Siege/archers will ignore orders, even with fire at will off.

Units have a strong preference to chase routing units, may have to order them several times if you want them to stop. 

The difficulties can cause odd behaviour – on very hard combat difficulty, the auto resolve will almost never favour you, even when you have 10-1 or better numbers. On the campaign, very hard causes the AI to go mad on you – some nations will attack you out of the blue, others will ignore you entirely. 

The late game, due to the map spacing and timeline developments can be a bit of a letdown.
Editing the ini files to change things such as rebel frequency is recommended – it’s a shame there’s no easier way to do so. The vanilla concentrated mod is a fantastic way to keep the core of the game the same, but address some of these issues.

Combining a blend of economic advancement, diplomatic shenanigans and military conquest, you definetely have room to manouvre with how you play with your faction, whatever your playstyle.

Yes, there are some issues, such as ridiculously OP cavalry charges, scarily buggy battles on mountain terrain-style maps (some units are literally stuck and unreachable), and the AI's diplomatic nature completely unfathomable and changing (Always fun declaring war on the Papal States, conquering Rome then declaring a ceasefire by buying them off and then electing the new pope next turn with your legion of cardinals). 

However, these are miniscual when compared to how many hours you can plug away into this game and still really enjoy it, especially when you only begin to the tap into the mods that are available (Third age total war, Skyrim, Westeros e.t.c.).

To the simple Mods like stainless steal to something Like lord of the rings or warhammer this Game as it all. To the Ai attacking more then one stack and using its brain well if it had a Brain. Its the best Ai but it sure beats Rome II Ai by a long shot. Its not perfect game as everyone says but it sure allmost takes the cake. It has flaws like everygame.  The flaws being the Ai being too passive and making it hard or very hard does not change anything but so buffs for it, However mods do help but even then Ai is well not so smart. However Unlike most of the total wars theis one sure does take the take of trying to be human, but still fails. However Hotseat is a lot of fun with players with mods. The Game Also does a good job of showing you how to play unlike most total war games that i have played. I also love how you need to wait and slowly build you're army up to make the game more balance. So if I want to have Knights it takes a long time to make the buitings and a long time to make make them so its a late or med game if you want a whole army of them. Unlike Rome II. This of corse was the 2ed game of me geting into first being Rome 1 and Rome 1 to medieval II is the POP of units and if you dislike that then this is a far better system and the rome 1 players will surely beat the shit out of this system because its far more easy to get into. Because in rome 1 sometimes you would kill 1/2 you're nation and i mean using you're pop as meat shieds and bam you're nation is dead by war. I mean there are many reviews on this game and its fairly said that this game is realy good and say its worth the full price or get it at GTA for a good deal for like 5$ thats with the DLC too. Everything about this game is great with just a few flaws that any player can get used to without it being a big probem.

Simple list if you did not want to read the whole text which i can say is most of us.  
Not to self Edit more of this review the English is bad because I played to much Medeieval II Total war

Good Gameplay
Easy to get used too
Cheap
balance
Not Rome 2

I purchased Medieval II: Total War when it was on a sale a while back, but never 'opened' it. I bought it because I remember seeing a friend playing it when it first came out, and two things stuck in my mind:

1. WOW! 8 GB on my hard drive?! That's too much space!

2. Man, these battles are huge! And you have to manage the governance? That's insane!

I'm a big fan of the Age of Empires series, so I was very used to a simpler, more combat-focused game series. M2TW's size (legitimately, that wasn't just a joke) as well as the amount of managing you needed to do looked intimidating to me, so I never tried it.

How wrong I was.

This game is absolutely glorious. Managing your nation, commanding your armies, working through all the inner workings of medieval society: this game found a way to make it work together. 

Here's an example: In the short British campaign, you have to conquer both Scotland and France. Scotland has few allies, so they weren't difficult to invade. However, France was a whole different story. France was not only allied with many of my neighbours (The Holy Roman Empire and Milan), but they were highly regarded by the Pope of the Catholic Church. If I tried to invade France, not only did I have to also fight against their allies, but I risked becoming excommunicated. 

I went for the risk, becoming both excommunicated and enemies to nearly all Catholic nations, and that made my French conquest significantly harder. I had to stop playing that campaign because, while my nation was the strongest, my borders were constantly under attack every turn, and I'd rather start a new campaign and learn from my mistakes.

Albeit still a computer program and not reality, Medieval II feels like the closest thing to a simulator of Medieval combat. It's almost as if they intended to create a game series and engine to emulate that!

I have not checked out the other Total War games, but I am going to once I'm done with my campaign on this one. 

So, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Strategy games and haven't tried these games, go for it! It has quickly become one of my favourite games, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's looking for something new.

One of the best Total War titles with probably the best campaign.

Medieval II: Total War throws you into the Middle Ages.You can choose from a good number of states like the Holy Roman Empire,Byzantine Empire,France,England,Scotland and so on.The game has Single Player,Multiplayer,Historical Battles and Custom Battles.You can save replays of your battles.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

For a game released in 2006,it looks good even to this day.So don't be afraid of the game's age.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Each state has it's own victory conditions.Throughout the game,events like the Mongol Invasion or invention of powder will influence the way you play the game.Religion plays an important role in the game.The Pope can call a crusade while the Muslims can call a Jihad.Aside from generals and armies,you can recruit and use agents such as priests,spies,assassins,merchants and diplomats.Diplomacy in the game is decent,but doesn't have many options.

The Real Time Strategy part of the game is great but it has it's problems.The AI will do weird things sometimes,and the unit pathing in the game is not that great.

[h1]Mods and DLC[/h1]

You can enhance this game by buying the DLC which also offers great campaign stories and other factions.By buying the DLC,you can also install mods.The best and most famous mod is the Stainless Steel mod.It pushes the game to it's maximum capacity,updating graphics,adding more factions,improving AI and more.",1467654321,1467654480,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False,76561198034782339,2519,101,5224,0,1950,1559184784,,

-Being the last game on the old engine, collision detection actually works and units feel like they have actual mass to them. There is some genuine variety in the factions (although european ones do share lots of the same units) and the game has some surprisingly good rpg elements with your generals and faction leaders.

-The game's full of personality with outrageously stereotypical accents, an awesome soundtrack, and epic scale battles. While not as arcadey as more recent total wars, the game takes a more realistic approach (mostly) leading to slower gameplay (not necessarily a good or bad thing).

-The ridiculous squalor system from rome 1 is gone, and a ton of new features have been added to the main campaign (especially with the kingdoms expansion). These include crusades, the pope, mongol invasions, and so much more.

-And finally, last but not least the mods for this game are spectacular. Whether you want third age (best LOTR game out there imo) Broken crescent, hyrule total war, westereos or my favourite mod stainless steel. Stainless steel in particular solves many of the bugs and balance issues in vanilla (especially the slightly broken two-handed weapon and pikemen glitches)

59,23812552,english,"By far this is one of the best Total War games to date.

What is Total War? Total War is a game where you pick a kingdom to dominate the world with. On the campaign map you will move your agents, and armies, and build upgrades to cities. When two armies meet you will go into a battlefield with thousands of soldiers fighting each other at the same time in an RTS battle.

This game is severely tactics based, so if you aren't good at micromanaging you are going to have a tough time. People with better strategies can win battles that were severely in the opponents favor.

As the game progresses you build your own story. You might raise a huge army to go destroy your enemies in a fit of rage for them killing your favorite general. Or ally with the kingdoms around you and double-team your enemies.

The general's in the game are a part of your royal family. As time progresses, your family will expand and each of these new children will grow up and become generals that you can have govern a town or be at the head of an army.

In the game there are also smaller things that add on to the game such as Crusades, Jihads, the discovery of gunpowder, the discovery of the americas, the mongols, and so on. Those things make the world feel fleshed out and make it feel alive.

Along with diplomacy is The Pope. Now, the pope sort of plays favorites, if you are friends with the papal states and another catholic kingdom declares war on you, the pope may excommunicate them from the catholic church, allowing a crusade to be called against them. When the crusade is called against them, all of Christendom will declare war on said faction and march their armies against them.

Now on to the pros and cons of the game
PROS:
- A large amount of factions with their own culture, units. advisors, and strengths
- Detailed Diplomacy
- Rebellions
- Large Strategic battles
- Jihads
- Catholic church and the pope
- Crusades and world events
- Long Campaign
- Family Trees
- Upgrading Cities
- Personal Stories
- Active modding community
- Multiplayer
- Not many bugs or crashes

CONS:
- Old game, poor graphics
- Animations are wierd sometimes
- Broken tutorial
- Co-op campaigns are done poorly

Then i went and declared war on scotland, that war lasted all of about four turns.
Then, and I know I had this game for 63 hours but I actually did not ever complete the game.
I stuck to custom and multiplayer battles. But anyway I went and fought France. Now I did not
do it out of the blue. the French were always threatening to invade me unless I paid a tax, normally like
560 or something. So anyway that was really cool. Massive armies clashing against eachother. Choosing
the better ground, it was like a game of thrones war. I gave my characters backstories and named the battles. 
I will give an example of one at the end. But anyway I was playing a short campaign and when I finished it and 
toppled the final French castle with the Milan and Holy Roman Empire at my side I suddenly get this epic music in ears.
Next thing I know Im in a throne room, like, once again, game of thrones and the Narrator goes on about how epic the
""English Empire"" Is and how King Rufus, first of his name, protector of all of Christendom is the ""Best king that will ever be. So yeah that was epic. Do I recommend this game? @£$% yeah I would! But anyway onto the battle.

King Rufus looks over his men. Wearing their mail coifs and wielding swords of iron and steel. Infront of them stands an army of scots. It was led by a family member, he paused for a moment. He could not remember the mans name. He lined his spearmen in a straight line facing the highlanders and the rabble. Rufus saw the man Edenheart, he thought to himself Edenheart. Rufus ordered his men to fire upon the now charging highland horde. Two hundred arrows filled the sky, near blocking out the sun. Many casualties were theirs. Then the highlanders crashed into a line of iron spears. The line broke. He ordered his border horse to chase down the fleeing enemy. Then the young family member seeing the battle lost, rallied a small portion of men and charged down the hill in which his steed stood upon. Rufus stroked his horses mane. He then road through the line of men and crashed into the unsupecting scots. He met the young man, Edenheart. With one stroke of his blade he cut the man down. He looked at the young man that now lay in the mud, he had no remorse. He jumped down and cut the head of the man. He ordered one of the spear men to stab it unto their spear and march it around like a banner. Edenheart was brother to the king of the scots, the king that had killed his own father. He would have his vengenece no matter how many lives it took.

6,23501417,english,"One of the best RTS games ever made.

The Paper-Rock-Scissors-Gameplay works flawlessly, for example, it's very costly to send your cavallery against the enemy spearmen, but the spearmen take heavy losses from archers (if not in proximity) and the archers can't really hurt armored units like knights.
The Turn-Based gameplay between skirmishes is a bit dusted by the oldschool complexity style; but you can automate most of it.

The peak of the gameplay are of course defense of and attacking a castle. Therein, however, also lies the biggest flaw of the game: The AI.

I've won battles against an overwhelming amount of enemies, just by standing on the walls and waiting for the enemy chilling in the arrow fire to perish - nope, they didn't move a finger even though they stood right infront of their ladders which they had built up to seize the walls.

It's just astounding how much the AI can fuck up - for example, all units tend to jam gates and on the strategymap, the AI keeps declaring war and declaring peace every 5 or so turns.

It is to mention that you only have specific (historic) empires to play, which differ mainly on their starting position (duh), leading in significant disadvantages for some to join crusades (playing as England, an entire army deserted while being on a ship (however that works lol), because it took them too long to reach Jerusalem).

However, I've played many RTS games set in the medieval (fantasy) setting, none of which had such thrilling (and hard) combat. Every battle is a new challenge, and that makes this game great.

I haven't played any more recent Total War Games though, so maybe you'll be better off with some better graphics (they tend to tire your eyes quite quickly).

The campaign map is like an overall strategy game where you try to conquer the world, and the tactical battles are individual battles where you control an army. Although the graphics are outdated, the strategy in this game is priceless. Played a game as Portugal, and first killed Spain.

You'll find some truly creative stuff out there, and no other TW game has the extensive modding community after this one.

The multiple unit textures, the setting, visual armor upgrades, new world conquest, mods it all was great!

PROS
+Great soundtrack, it really lends to the battles
+End of Dark Ages to early Renaissance time period
+Great battle system
+Awesome/funny in game movies
+Beautiful 3D tactical map
+Lots of building depth
+Roughly 20 factions 
+Invasions
+Crusades/Jihads
+New world exploration
+Many units and unique units. New unit types unlock as years progress and some become outdated.
+Multiple textures for units, gone are the days of units filled with clones
+VIsible unit and settlement upgrades (on battlefield, armor/castle/wall upgrades)
+Realistically paced battles that allow you to plan your battles with tactics, so even if you are outnumbered say 1000-3000, you can still win if you take up a good defense (a hill) and perform flanking maneuvers all while pouring arrow hell down on the enemy. Battles don't last 10 minutes like in Shogun, so you have to make sure you have time for a battle!
+Available mods. Too many to name... I usually play Stainless Steel or Custom Campaign. Also, don't like every turn taking up 2 years? Change one line of code in the games notepad code to get 2 turns per year for 400+ turns!!
+Tons of cities to take
+Royal Lineage
+Diverse battle maps (generate from where you are on 3D tactical map)
+Kingdoms Expansion (Essential for some mods)

NEUTRAL
=The diplomacy isn't the greatest thing, heck, the newer Total Wars are probably worse, but it gets the job done for a game that is 10 years old.
=Trade, which can net you tons of extra income if used, is like a reworked version of the assassin mechanic
=Rebels could have had more depth, or even became new countries that would expand

CONS
-AI can be lacking. You can tweak the ai with mods though. Otherwise pump the battle AI to Very hard and put campaign AI to Hard, this will give you a good challenge without mods.
-The AI can sometimes spam massive amounts of units within a short amount of time, even if they have one city. Probably to compensate for AI being dumb at times. 
-Repetitive seige maps
-A couple of silly units (Sherwood archers....). Some mods get rid of them and make the game more realistic.
-No faction reemergences, like they had in Medieval 1, so when a faction is gone, its gone. This makes late game a slugging match between a few factions, instead of multiple factions duking it out still (Like in real life, Knights of Honor or Crusader Kings)
-Bridge battles are kind of one sided, towards you. The AI has a tendency to rush into small places sometimes, getting slaughtered in the process.

Overall Medieval 2 Total War is one of the best in the series and you'll have loads of fun charging cavalry into exposed infantry, seeing knights hack each other to pieces and unloading into Aztecs with gunpowder all while being enamored by the glorious soundtrack!

Medieval II follows the early portion of the Medieval period (~1080) all the way through the late Medieval period and the discovery of the new world (~1530), this RTS/Turn Based hybrid is a slow paced strategy geared towards domination through war and conquest. 
The game features a diplomacy system and incorporates a grand strategy map with RTS battles. The hybrid allows for players to enjoy one or the other or both systems in their path to ruling Medieval Europe. 
The initial stages of the game are slow going, and patience is a requirement unless one doesn't care about the grand campaign. Other than the grand campaign, one can partake in custom and quick RTS battles or historical RTS battles inspired by actual events. One can play a number of factions including France, England, the Holy Roman Empire, the Moors, the Byzantine Empire, the Danish, and many more, all complete with strengths and weaknesses. The only con is that only about five or six of the factions are playable from the beginning until one completes either the short or long campaign (the difference between those is the amount of regions one must own and the factions one must destroy. For example: England's short campaign requires 15 provinces and the destruction of France, while the Long Campaign requires 50 provinces, including Jerusalem, as well as the destruction of France and Scotland).

Biggest ruiner for this game is gunpowder, once this gets invented it becomes real easy mode as the AI is pretty stupid and decides anything that uses gunpowder must be better. There is no use for gunpowder apart from taking a city as soon as you arrive at the walls, 1 canon is needed for this, anymore is just stupid. The AI will create armies full of hand gunners, canons and other siege equipment which stand no chance against cavalery, an army without horse and spear is a dead army.

Sort of.
The stories are usually crafted by you, the player.
You can be a king. an emperor. a dictator, a peasant. or even a lowly lepor (you heard me.)
there really is no limit to the story you could craft from this game.
Of course, its main feature is the combat.
You play as a tactician giving commands to your armies and organizing them into different formations.
Your army is split into units compramised of 30-400 soldiers. These are usually all one type.
They include: Archers, Spearmen, Swordsmen, Calvary and heavy variants of each.
You then organize them into formations on a randomly generated map fighting against your enemies that are also setting up their formations.

The base game was fantastic and offered a great mix of intellectual organization and also the opprotunity for roleplay elements, the world map being large enough to keep you satisfied with whichever nation you choose as it will always provide a challenge to turn that map one colour.

  The DLC was also some of the best I've played in most likely any of the Total war Series. Each capturing a different period of medieval history while also providing a range of challenges. The America campaign being one of my favorites since it shifts the atmosphere of the game so radically.

  Now as if the base game and DLC wasn't enough. the community has picked every piece of meat from the bone in terms of mods for the game which allow you to play as a lord of the Seven kingdoms of Westeros, the Uruks of Isengard or even just mods that increase realism and immersion.

I could go on about the whole variety of units and how each faction has different specialities and playstyles depending on the type of units there best with.

I have spent over 800 hours into this game and im not even bored yet due to the epic battles,battle music  and just the intensity of it all. This game was made in what 2005 soemthing like that and i still rate it THE BEST game to ever of come in existence with 0 games even coming close to being better than this one is.

I would put this on the top of your wishlist and highley reccommend you should play this game

i have played many hours on all the total war games (bar rome 2 but meh) and i have to say this is probably the best of the bunch. it takes the foundations of rome and builds a castle of awesome on top, the units reasonably accurate the visuals are nice for this type of game and the gameplay is intuitive and easy to play in both short and long sessions.

the only downside to this game is it has a fault that is present in every total war game, irrational AI. most gamers will not notice this flaw, but if you are used to much more complicated AI decision making (ie from the paradox series HOI3 and EU IV etc) then the AI will start to bug you somewhat,
in terms of diplomacy just dont bother with anything other than map information, alliances will be broken on a whim (i gave up on aliances after the fith ally in a row attacked me) ceasfires are irrelavant as even if its suicide they will attack you before the ink is dry, these are just a few irrationalities there are many.
the battle AI is a little better but it tends to just go for the zerg rush approach and it doesnt have a  clue how to use reinforcements (it will never try to concentrate its forces the reinforcments will either sit at the map edge or wait till you have defeated the other army before attacking)

while that may seem like a huge issue, if your just looking for an arcady rts then  you most likely wont notice those minor flaws and it still gets my seal of aproval.

When you come back and play this after playing the other two its hard to say that the series has improved.

Ten years and I'm still playing better mods on ME2 than the vanilla and even some mods on the other 2 combined. 

As much as I want Total War Warhammer too it just doesnt look that good to pay full price for.......seems the only way to play Total War is wait for the sales a year later and as this shows they dont change much for the better over the years so why not wait.

As for ME2 in its day it was the Best and even now its still Great and you could easily argue as good as if not better than most of the recent Total War products...........and back in those days they used to release complete games with a worth while expansion pack.

- Well made
- Very enjoyable 
- Can give you hours of fun in one run conquering your enemies and trying to over rule all of the factions 
- Amazing map details 
- Can run on a decent computer
- Amazing AI
- Great land details
- Great GUI / Graphics 
- Wars are pretty fair and you cant predict what you're getting yourself into too
- Troops look and act amazingly to whats going on the battlefield 
- Great Agent Mechanics (E.g. Assassins will help you win battles by secretly attacking the enemy thats trying to or already attacking your settlement and with the wide ranged movement it can overturn any can overturn any seige) )Another example is even a diplomat for making with an alliance with another country or even a cease fire on a country)
- Alot of different places to overtake (E.g. France)

Cons
- Ai randomly get tired and we lose the battle Ex: I had 1000 people fighting 350 and 80% of them we're dead (Note: General wasn't dead) and we some how lose (Note:41% of my team was dead)

I've sunk a lot of hours into playing this game outside of steam, having actually broken the discs from overuse several times. The game is just good enough to buy a replacement!

As a turnbased strategy game based in medieval times from 1088 onward, you'll see your fledgling kingdom emerge from the dark ages, embark on (or defend against!) crusades, weather the ravages of the black death and finally settle into a bustling empire at about a 1500's level of technology, sailing to the new world. Depending on your proclivities, this could be to get some of that sweet aztec chocolate or to teach the natives all about christ or muhammad. Sadly, you can't possibly set sail without the proper late game ships so you'll see no vikings looting aztec gold outside of custom battles.

Holy wars in particular have their own feature, allowing catholics to petition the pope to claim non christian lands (if sufficiently worthy in his eyes) or if you're a muslim ruler, have an imam stir the ummah to march westward. In practice, this causes you and the AI factions of your religion (if they comply) to amass quick and cheap armies who move much faster on the campaign map to reach specific goals such as Jerusalem or hell, why not London? The Orthodox factions of the Byzantine empire and Russia lack this feature for understandable reasons and must simply endure the indignity of foreigners marching through their lands in a religious frenzy.

Religion isn't all about cheap conquests and disgruntled greeks, though. The pope can get very disgruntled on his own and a particulary bellicose, impious king can easily awaken his ire to call a crusade on your sorry royal backside. Muslim factions should consider this as the pope will always be pissed at you, all the time for being muslim. Even if you court the christian kingdoms with gold, pope AI is likely to randomly declare a massive war on his best muslim buddy! 

Furthermore, failing to maintain your particular religion in your far flung provinces will cause heresy to rise. Once that gets particularly bad, heretics units pop up, acting as priests of a new religion you'll have to squash to avoid rebellion. If catholic, sufficiently heretical provinces will have the papal states send inquisitors. These hardasses aren't particularly concerned if the agent spreading faith in the province is a heretic or your very own frickin' cardinal. Don't let divergent ways take root. Beware the heretic, the Emperor protects.

At the start, you only have a few factions unlocked. England in its freshly conquered Norman suit with its classic longbowmen, the French with their legendary knights, the holy roman empire (amusingly beset by heresy), Spain or rather a version of Castile at the onset of the reconquista and the republic of Venice (don't worry, you still get crowned emperor at the end). 

As you conquer other factions, you actually unlock them for future playthroughs with the exception of the timed event invasions of mongols and timurids so if you ache really badly to play Scots and don't want to mod the game, swallow your pride and march the English north for a quick, new faction. Pick your kingdom and get crackin' because destiny awaits!

Aside from the basic features, the developers put a lot of effort into the little things which adds a lot to the experience of your campaign. Sending a spy to peek on an enemy army or an assassin to deal with enemy nobles and even the pope(!) will trigger its own video sequence. In addition, as your nobles age and aquire various traits, it can and will, especially in the case of the English and French, cause their real time battle speeches to take on hints of their personalities. A noble leading an army tends to have entertainingly scathing remarks about the rival nations even if they aren't particularly awkward, alcoholic or frothing mad.

Furthermore, Jeff van Dyck contributes with some pretty breathtaking pieces of atmospheric music that'll set the mood for your battles. It's some pretty exceptional stuff that I've yet to see other total war games top almost 10 years later.

All's not sunshine, however and the game is plagued by the same basic empire management and faction flaws that hampered Rome: Total War. Specifically, squalor can and will cause unguarded cities to rebel and there's little to be done about it. On the plus side, a rebel city counts as heretical which allows you to call a crusade or jihad to claim it from the obviously ungodly rebels. 

As for other issues, given how the autoresolving of battles works with unit statistics, AI fighting AI will tumble easily to high hitpoint cavalry. In Rome it was chariots, in Medieval 2 it's the elephants. Where this meant Egypt would usually consume all of the middle east in Rome: Total War unless you personally stopped them, this now applies to the late game Timurid hordes. 

The problem with both mongol and timurid invasion is that these factions don't need to pay any upkeep for some of their units, allowing the situation to snowball fast and turning the late game into an endless slog. I've ended up fighting back a massive mongol empire that held all of russia and poland well into the 1700's using English longbowmen!

Additionally, the timescale of the base game runs on two years per turn while your royal family only ages one year. This is an oversight but is easily modded out by subtle edits to a file that even a modding halfwit like myself could figure out without breaking the game.

Overall, it's a nice, relatively polished game of compelling history and strategy. If this appeals, get it now.

Some of the things are fixed by mods but most aren't and mods bring an element of instability to the game. For me the game (when modded) tends to crash after large siege battles. Also, as usual, the AI is clueless leaving you with either playing against a really handicapped opponent (normal difficulty) or letting it ""cheat"" (hard mod and above). Also broken is diplomacy (unless modded and even so is extremely limited). I'm a long time total war player but this game is mostly frustrating and annoying.

As someone who loves the TW series, this game is pretty awesome as well.
I came into this game off play the original Rome:TW, and I quickly learned that the gamestyle is a lot different. Instead of having a big professional army, you have an army of peasants, and then expensive units of lords and knights. Instead of conquering the heck out of your neighbors, you need to (if you're playing a Christian kingdom) consider the political and spritual (i.e. if the Pope will like it or not) ramifications of starting a war, thanks to chivalry.
As a TW fan, I love this game. As a history buff, I love this game. As a person, I love this game.

Final Thoughts:
Did/do I have fun? Yes
Does it have issues? The AI seems a bit wonky at times. Units seems to push off against one another like there was a force-field around them. 
Should you buy it? Probably. I dunno, man. I don't know you.
Can you go on a Crusade against the enemies of Christendom? Yes. Papa bless.

Pros:
-Each faction has a greater variety for its playing style. (spain relies on cav, venice relies on militia...etc. whereas shogun 2, empire and napolean, the faction differences are basically moot and don't change too much).
-two types of towns that require strategic use of each in order to win. Castles produce good units, Cities produce income. Without cities you're broke but without castles you'll be overrun be stronger units
-Population growth system (one of the few things that I'm upset wasn't included in shogun 2)
-You MUST use the layout of the map strategically during a siege if you want to win
-MERCENARIES (I love this and I wish napoleon, empire, and shogun did it)
-ranged units on walls are balanced so they aren't op
-population growth adds an interesting twist. Populations in cities will always become a problem at some point and will threaten with throwing you out (aka squalor)

Cons:
-Most agents are worthless. The only agent you need are priests/imams to convert people to your religion. You only need one diplomat at the beginning to establish contact at the beginning of the game, after that they are uselss. Assissin's are kinda useless. Merchants are useless initially (because they always get bought out by the enemy).
-balancing problems. Missile cavalry are stupidly op (especially early on). Crossbows are better than archers even though peasants of both costs the same.
-It's super difficult to get morale boosting traits for generals
-like every total war game, once you get to a certain point, no matter which difficulty, the game stops being a challenge and you just steam roll everyone else

70,21348313,english,"This could have been a great game... indeed many contend that it is. I disagree however, because my criteria for a great game includes controls that are not broken.

Go on the internet and you will see legions of fanboys jumping through hoops to defend the obvious lazy programming and lack of anything even resembling QA testing that has resulted in controls so broken that even the simplest of maneuvers can reduce even normally patient gamers to shouting, fist-pounding emotional wrecks as they watch what should have been a gimme battle devolve into an embarrassing defeat simply due to the fact that it is next to impossible to get your troops to do as they are told.

Fanboys respond to this by saying ""you just have to learn how to micro it properly"", or ""maybe if you learned to do it properly..."" blah blah blah, ad nauseum. I call shenanigans. I'm not talking about advanced maneuvers. Not even the cavalry charges. I'm talking about ""you three units, go over here and stand in a line"". Ten minutes later, they are still milling around where they were before, apparently totally defeated by the entrance to a city street. And now you're out of position, and your strategy collapses as your longbowmen are outflanked by the cavalry your spearmen were supposed to be defending against. There is no excuse for this. And if it isn't getting stuck on each other and milling around, it's running *past* the spot where you told them to go, triggering a battle you're not ready for and resulting in units routing and strategies failing. No excuse. 

Cavalry is similarly broken. You cannot have more than one unit of cavalry at a time, because one unit requires constant micromanagement just to charge properly. They have to be lined up *just so*, the enemy has to be clicked on *just so*, they have to be watched all the way to their target lest they encounter a tree or a slight rise and begin milling around in confusion, and they have to be told to retreat the instant they hit, or even the lowliest of peasants will begin to bowl them over like ninepins.

95,21095286,english,"This is the only review I've ever written for a game on Steam. After playing Medieval 2, Rome, Empire, and Rome 2, I can safely say that Medieval is still my favorite in the series. Yes, the later iterations ARE prettier. This game was released in 2006 after all. However, in my opinion, you can't beat the game engine they used. The Warscape engine that is utilized by the newer games (empire onwards) has taken a loooooong time to reach the same level of melee combat satisfaction that I got from M2. Sure, there are no fancy one v one animations. BUT, those animations also wrecked havoc with how many battles played out. I don't think I ever saw two soldiers gang up on one soldier in any game other than M2 and Rome 1. Battles are played out more by training stats, upgrades, and tactics vs. a boat ton of special abilities and badas* animations. I know there are plenty of people who won't agree, but it's just my experience. 

The biggest reason why I always come back to this game is the modding community. I had the game running on a virtual version of windows on my mac (years before the mac version was released) JUST so I could play Third Age Total War. Not to mention all the unit mods, engine and animation tweaks, etc. This is still probably the most mod friendy total war game out there. I spent dozens of hours over the last 8-9 years compiling units and tweaks to get my game just right, enduring hundreds of coding errors and game re-installs. Little by little (and somehow without taking over my life) Medieval 2 became a near-perfect game. And this is a guy with little to no mod creation or coding experience whatsoever. 

All in all, it's a wonderful game that won't be surpassed until they potentialy do a new Total War in the Medieval setting. It's perfectly fine without mods, but if you're like me and discovered just how awesome the modding community is, it's the best Total War game to mod in my opinion.",1455084836,1455084836,True,4,0,0.5,0,True,False,False,76561198023126673,89,2,13336,0,10441,1545678191,,

What I am trying to say is:
+ Tactics are the core of this game, a smart commander can win with nearly any competent force composition as opposed to just buying top tier unit spam.
+ Great Political/Kingdom Management System outside of battles.
+ Ungodly 22 factions, each with their own nuances and tactics to master, but still realistic.
+Beautifully done melee and archery combat, the fights are fully animated with their own brutal kills and flying corpses, which is kind of a must for a medieval RTS

- Learning Curve is not for the faint of heart
- Games take a very long time, especially when good players can fight each other to a stand still
- Sometimes its unclear how quickly your units break, especially in some circumstances where they seem like they will win, but the AI is generally very good and this along with a few smattering of bugs (Not on Rome TW2 Level) make up a small portion of the Game Overall.

------------------

Ok I've now bought this game twice for Mac, one through the app store with no online (grrrrr) and now on here so that I can play with other people. The game runs really smooth and I have a 4 year old MacBook Pro so no issues there at all, even on huge battles.

The main issue is the ONLINE. What's going on? I can't connect with hardly anybody? I've only found one other person to play with and they're sharing my annoyance. Not sure if this is a version issue or a deeper problem but I really hope it gets fixed, only reason why I bought it again!

    [*]A wide variety of choices on how to grow your kingdom or empire. Through diplomacy, war, or even treachery.

There's so many campaigns and each one for each faction is differernt in its own way. Also, each faction has a few perks that none of the others have; for instamce: English, Longbowmen; French, Courageous Knights; HRE (Holy Roman Empire), has average everything; so on and so forth. There's so many different factions that if I wrote down all their strengths and weaknesses it would take me about an hour to do so! And even on the lowest graphics setting it still doesn't look half bad. It also has historical battles like Agincourt, Hastings, I think it has Stamford Bridge but not for sure.

Robert, the King of England, father of Leonard, was a just and righteous king. He made many allies among the rival nations and practiced chivalry and honor in times of war. History was forever changed one fateful day when England's closest ally (Milan), sent assassins to murder King Robert. The assassins were successful. Who knows what darkness lies in the hearts of man? King Leonard, the son of Robert ""The Honest"", vowed to avenge his beloved father and ushered in a new era of darkness and terror upon all of England's enemies and allies alike. Totally consumed by his vendetta, King Leonard hired and trained the best spies and assassins from all over world. From the green gardens of England to the harsh deserts of the Middle East, every dagger forged found it's target. The streets of Milan flowed with blood until all lands had been consumed by England. King Robert ""the Honest"", father of King Leonard ""The Killer"" had been avenged. But at what cost? Milan will forever know the answer.

83,20262952,english,"My honest opinion:

The AI is what really stands out. It's just as competent in battle as Attila's (the most recent TW title) is, and does well in the campaign, too.

The tactical (battle) part of the game has aged incredibly well, all things considered. The combat mechanics are robust, and abilities are important (though a bit 'busy' in terms of interface, and fire-at-will is not always enabled by default on units that are meant to only fight at range). The asymetry in rosters means that combat can really vary a good deal, yet the balance feels just right.

The strategic (campaign) part of the game aged less well. It's certainly playable, and it, too, feels balanced yet complex, but I'd be lying if I said the user-interface was all that good. As campaign UI goes, it's somewhat cluttered IMO, though I'd argue it's probably better than N:TW's was.

In technical stuff, it's really, really stable, something that inexplicably was not the case in Empire and N:TW... in those games, I seemed to get sound glitches on the campaign screen, crash during battles, and so forth pretty much every campaign, forcing constant saving to be ready. Here, though, the game never seems to glitch up or break down.

In artistic stuff, the game does quite well. For the era it was made in, the unit cards are good, and the unit models are surprisingly detailed when you zoom all the way in. The music is great, too. And the voice-over is, as always, the one mixed-bag (aside from the campaign UI, which was mentioned above). Voice-over work is terrible for units, but acceptable for in-game advisor and narration of pre-battle stuff (in historical battles, etc.).

Overall, is it worth it for $20.00? Well, without mods I could see arguements that $20.00 is too high... but bear in mind how long the game has existed and how many people made mods for it, and it becomes evident that there will be plenty of mods to wade through and try.

So, I marginally recommend it. A decade ago, I'd say to pick it up in a heart-beat... today, it's still just as good, but should really be a bit cheaper given that you will want to get the Kingdoms expansion as well and, hey, it's a pretty old title now (both it and the ex-pack).

On sale, though, it's a no-brainer: pick it up.",1451842039,1451842212,True,23,2,0.696125328540802002,0,True,False,False,76561197986775314,188,103,803,0,249,1453008297,,

There is no challenge short of the lazy, overwhelm the player situation. Which is still hard since I just fought one of my armys ( around 1k troops) againts three seperate armies with 2x my numbers. I wish I could say it was because I made some impossible move that won the day. (it WAS a tough fight, toughest I have seen so far) I didn't do anything smart. I did the only thing I could do to win. Pelted the A.I from far away until they gave me no choice but to engage them. once routed, I pulled my forces back, remorfed my lines and repeated. 2 other armys form into this and it becomes more of a timing game.

Right after this, I go to defend a castle under siege. The problem? EVERY TIME the computer attacks my castles, they just sit there. 100% of the time I had to go after them. At best, I can send out 1 calvalry unit to gode them into doing something, but that rarely works. They siege my castle, I have to leave the castle and go after them. yay...

I would sum up the Total War fanchise as follows: great ideas, HORRIBLE execution. NONE of it matters if the computer can't at least attack you during THEIR invasion of your territory. Everything else could be prefection, but with an A.I. that does little more then shuffle it's troops around, it wouldn't matter.

Total War is a long running franchise made by CA (Creative Assembly.) This franchise is known for the tactical and wide scale gameplay. For those who are not familiar with total war it works like this. The campaign plays like a grand strategy, you have build, recruit, run politics, diplomacy, and warfare each and every turn until you win. When your army engages an enemy are it is brought to more of an RTS setting where you control your army to either annhiliate, defend, or route your enemy. Multiplayer is all about the RTS setting, however, there are ways to play multiplayer campaigns, sadly they are hard to setup. 

Pros
 
-Realistic combat: There is friendly fire, moral levels (enemies, allys, and your army will route if moral is too low), and realistic counter units.

-In depth strategy both multiplayer and single player

-Many factions to choose from

-Looks great for being an older game

-Has historical battles that you can play

-Provides hours of entertainment

Cons

-Can be very difficult to understand

-Pathfinding bugs

-Lacks naval battles

-Units will sometimes ignore your orders, even if they don't have the bonus effect ""Will charge without order""

38,19738785,english,"I love this game, Medieval 2 Total War in my opinion is the best Total War game to date, Rome Total War polished, and I enjoy the medieval era more than the Roman era. Objectively speaking there is an undeniable quantity of value in this game, before I downloaded mods I had about 200 hours. The vanilla version of this game is excellent. I could even play the campaign mode of the vanilla version after playing the campaign mode of these mods. Battles in this game are the best it will ever be and with multiple medieval eras from early to high to late where you have musket men and cannons. I could have an army of Mongolian cavalry fight an army of French pikemen and musket men. Possibilities in the battles are endless! Also, battles require tactical positioning, flanking, planning and using your brain in general. If you don’t like to use your brain, than don’t buy this game. If you do, however, you will find very interesting and creative ways to defeat your enemies. When to attack the enemy or hold position and send spearmen to the front, when you should retreat or hold fast. There is just so much fun to have in battles. 
The Campaign mode has no story, like every other Total War game, based on the situation of your nation and other nations, plans and ambitions, you make your own story. Be the king of England and defeat the French once and for all, forge an empire of 2 land masses. Play as Byzantium and retake lost lands and lost lands of the Roman empire. When it comes to recruitment and construction it is balanced. Recruitment pools determine how many units you can recruit per turn and how long you must wait until you can recruit another one of the same unit. This prevents large and massive armies of heavy infantry running all over the place. Diplomacy feels real as in the medieval times there were no phones to call other leaders. Countries had to send a diplomat and wait for a response. Diplomacy is not as in depth as it could be, but this game is focused around war and military. Keep that in mind when you play the campaign mode. Trade, alliances, embargos, vassals, military access, the basics are all there. Events happen in the campaign mode throughout such as the Mongolian invasion, the discovery of gunpowder and the new world, and yes, this game includes the plague.
Overall, unless you are too stupid to use your brain in coordination and deep thought, you will enjoy this game and get your money’s worth without a doubt. Even at full retail price I would still find my money’s worth. Go buy it on sale if you are still sceptical, I did it, too.

40,19722957,english,"Second best Total War title to date, second only to Rome 1. Only thing that makes it worse is the Castle/City feature, where each settlement is divided into two categories: Castles and Cities. Castles are obviously hard to attack, having up to 3 layers of walls, and recruit much better units. They are poor for getting money or raising population, you can't even set taxes to the castles. Cities recruit worse units (though depending on your faction sometimes the city parts are better than their castle counterparts, Italian Spear Milita and Venetian/Genoean Crossbowmen being examples of this) but are so much better for economy. Most of the time your armies will be composed of units that can only be recruited in castles, but if you take a city with it and lose a lot of troops there is no way to replenish them unless you send them to another castle. 

That is literally my only gripe with this game. Graphics still kind of hold up, even 9 (holy shit this game is 9 years old?!?!) years later. Massive scale armies are often seen, the AI isn't entirely stupid and can be logical in their choices after you think hard enough. There is a stereotype (much like Civ V) that the AI will randomly attack you for no reason, but there are always logical reasons. Either they see you as weak and easy pickings, you are attacking (and beating) one of their allies, or you've taken lands that they wanted. If you really want to avoid war with a certain faction, just avoid those three things. 

The game can be challenging at times, often times you will think you've won a war and then suddenly they have a full army besieging your capital, that carefully hid in the forests so you couldn't see them. The economy isn't as challenging as I'd like it to be, you can simply raise taxes as high as you can without having the happiness go below 100% (Yea for some reason the happiness can go well over 100%, it's weird) and don't garrison your cities with expensive units. As long as you're using your armies to conquer cities you'll never go into the red. 

The game is challenging and interesting, no two campaigns will ever be the same. A lot of things are predictable, such as for me Milan always seems to be a huge power that gobbles up France and the Holy Roman Empire with ease, and Egypt always ends up winning in the east unless the Mongols decide to head that direction (they always beeline straight for Poland/Hungary/Russia in my games and get destroyed by knights). There are in game events such as the Mongol invasion, the Black Death, the Timurid invasion, Gunpowder being invented, and you can even travel to the New World late in the game. You will quickly learn to love and hate some factions, personally I hate fighting any italian faction just because their Italian Spear Militia are rediculous and their crossbowmen do waaay too much damage without taking much in return. 

Overall the game is a 9,9/10 for me. It's my second favorite strategy game of all time, and there is a still active modding community that can spice up your games should you ever get bored of the same map/factions. Definetly worth the 20$, but you'll often find it on sale for much less. The DLC is definetly worth at least a try, it adds 4 new campaigns (different maps and factions, it doesn't add anything to the main game they're basically 4 smaller standalone games) which are pretty fun but a tad bit small and limited, which is to be expected given how small the regions are.

If you can stand older graphics and a lot of annoyence getting used to the controls, then I would definatly recommend this game to anyone total war fan, and easily to any strategy gamer.

The only annoying parts of the game for me, is having to deal with the Pope and his contant demans and nagging, but you get used to it and just send your least favorite generals off to die in the crusandes and not conquor the world for a few turns because the French attacked me first and aparently god is against a counter attack.... that and of course the older controls from a while back like the arrow keys instead of WASD, setting your units into groups can sometimes end them up in awkward and strange formations, and a slight lack of detail has to why a settlement is pissed even though the public order is at 100%.

Highlights:
-Massive race/team diversity which i beleive for any strategy game is vital
-long very open campaign (you dont need to follow the rules 100% though following them may help) that has for me a very good replay value as each faction has a different goal set of units and starting position
-has  variety of difficulty as with the easy campaign i find it fun to sweep your oponents off the board 
-though you can be extremely overpowered in this there are also forces in play that will hold you back such as plague, public disorder, rebelions and the obvious other factions
-another thing to balance out the game is the religion factor which i felt deserves its own minor section to talk about due to the fact that it has enough elements to absorb the other factors such as the 5 religious groups ""Christianity, Orthadox, Islam, Pagan, Heretic"" you also much apease the pope as he will not favour a warmongerer and may excamunicate you if you are seen as an enemy of your fellow christians (i have yet to check out the islamic factions which only adds to the replay factor as i have only played 1/3rd of the factions in the game)
-unit background; each unit has its own description and amount per unit and they can receive better armour and experience
-i find it has a good level of complication as it isnt insanely all over the place leaving new players in the dust as they watch their whole faction tumbe but it gets more interesting as the game goes on so the player gets a chance to learn rather than be crushed under what they must know to even play


Downfalls:
-while i love the challenge added by the pope in this game he tends to become annoying and is very very biased against you, unless you play as a very religious lord, which can have you tearing out your hair due to the constant deterance of you making any progress at the threat of excommunication and in extremes a crusade upon one of your large cities/castles
-the relationships with other factions tends to become hostile at every turn with groups of 4 factions allying and all attacking you unprevoked even if you try to become friends with them, the best strategy i have for this is ally those far away for a long lasting aliance.

Overall: rating would be 10/10 because there were so many things that made me love this game which i'd say is easily the best total war game i own and the fact that i had to sit here and think before u could actualy find something tht was worth puttin as a downfall to this game i would gladly recomend this game to a friend and wish that they would make a third edition with multiplayer campaign.",1449450384,1449450384,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False,76561198055180114,364,3,26314,0,13354,1545875855,,

On a secondary level it's a diplomacy game, requiring careful decision making regarding allies and opponents as well as currying favour with the powers that be i.e. the Papacy and thirdly it still blends in the faster paced action of the tactical battles that allows one to actively witness and control sieges and battle upon the open field. 
As an older game the graphics are poor but not terrible, due to the usually zoomed out perspective, that doesn't show up poor unit models.

This is a fun game. Much better than the first one. I love the middle ages units (we need a Fantasy Total War game). There are only two things I dislike about this game: 1. The Pope always intervenes so you cannot wipe anyone out. 2. The Mongols are way too tough.

I still like the game. You can build up your cities, recruit troops and fight the battles on the battlefield where you can control all of the troops, and it is a cool empire building game. Europe, however, is getting really boring to me to fight in. Unlike Shogun the original Total War, it seems that the AI troops do not always run and hide when vastly outnumbered.

Its cheap , and the stories it creates through gameplay. All I have to do is write about a battle I had in my latest Campaign as France.

So I was fighting a battle against the English, these bastards had to gual to stab me in the back while I was off fighting the Moor's in Spain, they laid siege to Paris. What I did was raise a small army of elite soldiers coupled with peseants and drove back there full stack army. I chased them back towards there motherland, then they decided to send ANOTHER army to back them up that was roughly half a stack, I shrugged since the combined force I had gotten from Paris was about 1 and a half stacks of troops, not only that I had feudal knights and armored swordsmen.

So I started the battle and decimated the first enemy wave, not even the english Billmen could not stop my swordsmen charge, and my feudal knights broke whatever resistance was left. I had taken a decent amount of casualties, my feudal knights were a bit poorly managed and took alot of casualties and my peseants took a beating. So I reform and prepare to face the 2nd english army, the full one. What I had realized is that this full army was not a pushover, it was composed of fuedal knights, lowbowmen and even armoured swordsmen, AND EVEN ARTILLERY. I quickly matched his front line, charged and flanked with cavalry, his artillery killed over 100 men before I managed to hit it with one of my feudal knights, then I turn them unto the enemy flank just in the knick of time to prevent my men from routing, I have my general rally as well to make sure my men chase the enemy down. Once back on the campaign map, I ransom the men I captured back to england for 7,500 gold (which is alot at turn 45)

other things; Fuck the pope if you have more than 10 regions, unlike Crusader Kings 2 there is no official way to fight factions that are christian as a christian, even if enemies are the agressor they get a free pass to fuck shit up on you while you will get commands from the pope with threat of excommunication, which is pretty bad place to be in btw.

You create your own history instead of being pushed into following actual history.

The AI might be a bit dumb and it has its fair sure of bugs and glitches, but there's no DLC.

I lost my Disc and repurchased it again for 2 times. That is how much i like this game. The missions are great and you need tactics to win. You can literally use 20% of the amount of enemy troops and still win a heroic victory. I even have photos of the battles. 

For example I have a small group 800 which contains mostly archers and spearmen while the enemy has a army of 1600 or so with calvary and some other random troops.  i know i can't win so i try to kill as much as i can or else my castle might be in danger if they lay siege later on. I tell my archers to lay spikes in front of them to prevent a calvary charge and i place my spearmen on the flanks to protect my archers. The enemy WANTS to attack me so i pick a spot on the map which is hard for them to get to. On a high hill the enemy troops are slow and make easy targets for my archers ... one by one i shoot them down and at the end of the match i managed to win ... my castle is safe :) for now.

This is the pinnacle of the total war series. With the kingdoms expansion the game has hundreds of hours of replayability. With the extensive mod support, the game hundreds more hours of replayability. The Third Age Total war mod is by some considered the best Lord of the Rings game in existence - and it's only a mod.

This game had soul in a way later games did not always successfully recreate. The battles were longest in this iteration, really helping you get immersed in the bloody nature of medieval warfare. While not without flaws, most problems with medieval are problems that still exist with current iterations of total war, such as questionable AI capabilities and occasional frustrations with certain commands (such as people not climbing up ladders automatically in sieges, or cavalry stopping their charge at the last second).

Overall, this game is polished, deep, varied, highly replayable, highly moddable, and still looks quite nice with the graphics jerked up (considering it's been 9 years).

86,18397372,english,"Medieval II: Total War is one of the three best Total War games, the other two being the original Rome: Total War and Total War: Shogun 2. M2TW improved on the mechanics of its predeccesor RTW as well as introducing its own, slightly better visuals (2006), bigger battles, more complex diplomacy, improved siege battles, town management and religion.

The campaign starts in the year 1080 AD, and as in all Total War games you must expand and maintain the faction of your choice and build a mighty empire! There are only five factions to choose from though (England, Scotland, France, Holy Roman Empire, Venice, Spain) it might be possible to unlock more factions by completing the game, but I wouldn't know because i've never managed to complete a campaign, the shame...
Obviously it is wise to establish an alliance with one or more of your neighbours, before anyone starts eyeing up your lands.
The diplomacy in M2TW is much more complex than in previous games, if you have a bad reputation with a faction they won't give you the time of day. However, if you have built up relations with them then they will be highly unlikely to betray their most trusted ally (unlike RTW when your Gallic allies invade you on your 40th aniversary...)

Religon plays a larger role than it did it in RTW Barbarian Invasion, The Pope will keep an eye on all the factions, and you will receive missions from him like you do from the Senate in RTW (you also receive missions from the home team, the Council of Nobles). These missions range from build a chapel in X settlement, recruit a priest in Y settlement, to the pope launching a crusade, where you are required to send a crusading army to the specified settlement, usually somewhere near Jerusalem, or Jerusalem itself. Its quite jarring to be going along nice and easy expanding into eastern Europe to then suddenly have to sail an army to the other side of the known world not knowing what enemy forces await you there, and even if it is a successfull crusade, the Muslim forces might retaliate with a Jihad to retake the land. What ensues is basically the movie Kingdom Of Heaven.

New agents include the priest who converts the population of the settlement he is stationed in, to his religion, the Merchant who can be sent to resources on the map to trade them (Total War just became Monopoly), princesses who can be used as diplomats, or you can marry them off to a genaral to ensure his loyalty, or to someone in another faction to cement an alliance. Also assassination video's are back in this game (yay!).

It's also possible to be excommunicated from The Church if you upset The Pope too much, leaving you fair game for invasions from other factons. When The Pope dies however, the slate is wiped clean and you even have a chance to influence who the next pope is. Each christian faction has one or more cardinals who vote on who the next pope will be
so you can influence your cardinal's decision. In one play through were I played as England, I always did what The Pope asked (Conquer Egypt) I was awarded many cardinals, which means that whoever I chose was almost guaranteed to be elected. If you vote for a Pope who becomes elected you're in his good books before you start, choose poorly and The Pope will be most dissapointed with you. It makes you feel like you are part of a huge power struggle over the control of the Holy Land.

In addition to regular settlements you can convert a town into a castle, which is a lot easier to defend and allows you to train advanced infantry (Knights!!!). However, castles produce half the amount of income as regular settlements so you have to get the balance right so you are making enough money for your cities to support the armies being supplied by the castles.

Castle sieges are more difficult than regular city sieges, towards the latter half of the campagin castle defences are so high that more often than not it is literally impossible to get past a castles walls without losing half your army. Siege towers and the like are so easily reduced to matchwood that sending them up against anything but a wooden wall is a suicide mission. Meaning catapults aren't just optional, they are required while taking a citadel.

The acctual RTS side of the game is very similar to RTW, the Ai is slightly better than in RTW but will still regularly do something silly, espesially during siege battles (Units facing the wrong way while being hit by volley after volley of arrows, to name one of the more severe, though rare, cases). For some reason the cavalry charges in M2TW don't feel as powerfull as they did in RTW, neither do archers who do less damage and are less accurate than in the previous game (if you have about five units of archers firing at the same target they tend to eventually get the job done).

M2TW Isn't as glitchy as it could have been (certanly not as glitched as newer Total War titles) but occasionally bugs occur ranging from mild to severe, one time a unit from my reinforcements got stuck outside the map on a piece of scenery. Sometimes during sieges it can be extremely clunky to move units on walls, they completely stop responding when going into a tower. One time I broke through a gate with a Ram, ""once more into the breach"", I ordered my knights, and instead of using the gate (which was ajar and unguarded) they ran to a pair of ladders on the wall next to them and started to ascend while spear infantry positioned themselves in the gateway blocking the entrance. During the campaign I also managed to exploit a major mistake on the part of the Scottish Ai, they left their settlement
Inverness completley empty of soldiers. I just sailed round landed a small battalion and walked through the front door.
These major glitches were few and far between (for me at least). The most common problems in this game are path finding issues during siege battles. For the most part the AI is just fine, (you want to see some real messed up AI play Empire or Rome 2)

The reason why Medieval 2: Total War is so good is that it improves on everything that Rome: Total War did and introduces some of its own mechanics that add even more depth to an already deep strategy game. The Total War series is my favourite strategy series of all time and Medieval 2 Total War is one of the best of this series. I'm surprised that a game this old runs so well on a modern computer, it runs perfectly, (by contrast Total War: Shogun 2 crashes whenever I turn on V-Sync). If you like strategy games, or have never played strategy games and are looking to give them a try, this game is one of the best in RTS.

When this game performs at it's best, you'll feel like a midieval commander taunting banter at your foes while you cavalry tramples them to death.

Grand Campaign:
like most total war games, the grand campaign is pretty straight forward. you have the tactical turn based map with figures representing armies, moving arround doing what you command them to. the build menu isn't too diffrerent if you played Rome Total war.

what annoys me however is that there are a huge lack of political statistics. you never know who is on the edge to being agressive towards you because all you get is a welcomed enemy, or neutral. doesn't really tell you alot.

another problem is that once you begun building up the begining of your empire, you would have to deal with the fact that 60% of your neighbourghs will almost instantly be hostile towards you, either by sending a ton of agents or simply entering an all out war with you.

so now you are locked in a massive war that forces you to stay defensive for 50 turns and not expand in any way. if just one of your armies move the slightest amount towards an enemy stronghold, then they will just completely ignore the danger you put them in and attack you city. this will ultimately lead you in loop where you are stuck reclaiming and taking cities and using all of your Florins (the currecny ingame) to replenish your troops.

the worst part about these wars is that a lot of the times where you ahve the advantages in unit type, strenght and numbers it can still lead to some of the nastiest possibilities you can get. expect an army of 240 knights, 80 militia and 45 archers wot win against 400 spear militia, 100 knights and a bombard? NOPE

you have the stronger units that counters the enemy in every way, but for some reason that game won't allow you to have fun and win the battles in a fair way. the reason why is simply due to the fact that some of these engages magicly halves your army so instead of having an attacking army of 350-400 you suddenly only have 250. this happened regularly and the worst part was the aftermath. because a defending army in the city was joined in, i automaticly lost the city after. this wouldn't have been so bad if the amount of troops i lost was under half of my army, but yet for some reason half of the half that didn't die was mysteriesly dispanded instead of going into the castle again.

this wasn't just a one time fluke. it happened many times and not only for sieges. 

on top of these bullshit battles you also run in to the fact that the enemies tend to get high end units atleast 30 turns before you do. which means that when you just got longbowmen as the brits, you are already fighting feudal knights which absolutely wreck everything you can muster at this point.


now we get into multiplayer:
in short a huge dislike from me about the multiplayer battles you can have.

remember how broken a pike wall was in the first Rome total war? double that and you have a musket army or a crossbow army. unless you place your entire army furthest back you can, you will get attacked just after your spawn due to their overly high range. not only does crossbows have an incredible range (even outranging longbows) but also a decent firering speed, ammo capacity, accuracy and worst of all a cheap price. i made a high tech army of knights on foot and cavalry and a decent amount of cannon fodder and had almost 1000 more men that my friend (oponent) had.

what he had was unfortunately 4 squads of militia crossbows. all i could see the first 2 minutes was piles after piles of dead knights and cannon fodder whilst i desperately tried to rush his crossbows to minimize damage. but when my army was locked in melee with his entire army it was too late. his crossbows had done the job and weakened my squads immensely.

TL:DR
Don't ever invest in this game if you want a decent game to play with and against friends and can't handle rage inducing bullshit.


Authers note:
This game has done what is impossible for 99% of all my games. 
it made me utterly violent to my environment out of pure rage over it's bullshit.",1443363240,1443363294,False,1,2,0.422733455896377563,8,True,False,False,76561198010141992,386,9,536,0,442,1479454269,,

for those who want a challenge, get this game
for those who love Medieval times, get this game
for those who hate Rome II Total War, get this game
for those who love strategy, get this game
for those who love Total War..... GET THIS GAME!!!

ok, enough fuckin around, now this IS a near perfect game in my eyes so if this sounds biased... dont tear me up for it :/

Ok well for 1 in my opinion this is 10x better than Rome II even though the graphicas arent excellent. And as i usually say to friends when i recomend this that the BEST thing about this game are the Events! The Events are TOTALLY the best part of this game, they can be GAME CHANGING things at time like when the Black Death hits and it when it did for me i ALMOST lost the game by losing my entire family tree, and also i ended up with 1 family member alive with no wife... Or when the the New World is discovered where you fight HORDES of Natives that outnumber you 10-1

Now on to the thing EVERYONE does in MIITW, the battles, they are awesome, 9/10 because their are some glitches but its grandious Vs. say our latest Total War games... and also, heres something i know for a fact i might get shit for, THE DLC ACTUALLY ADDS TO THE ENTIRE GAME AND ITS NOT WHOREING LEVELS. Yeah... only 1 piece of DLC on this game.. and it adds a bunch of campaigns that are AWSOME and also it makes it possible for mods to change your game and make it look like a entirelly new one! For instence, i have Third Age Total War installed and i am IN LOVE with it! Now compared to newer mods for newer Total War's the MIITW mods actually CHANGE the game and add on instead of fixing it...

Well thats my review, my rating of this game, well ill borrow Angry Joe's rating system and give this a 9/10, a LEGENDARY status and a MUST own, and i bet if he did review this, he would put the Badass Seal of Approval on this!

but I mainly bought this game for the mods(i had it on mac before) and was sooooo disappointed: the support form CA is extremely low(e.g: some useres had the same problem as me, as CA made kingdoms not an extension but a dlc, which stopped all mods from working) why you would do that to a game that is 6 year old is beyong sane reasoning. it appeared that they found a working but complex solution to this problem, but then the link to the tutorial was deleted.by CA?) 
in the end i still cant play any mods, CA doesnt write me back and im a bit upset with all this, as the mods seem to be a great extension. after all I can proudly say this game is a masterpiece but I will never ever buy a game from creative assembly again, as in my opion they are trolling the community and being unfair to us overall.

I knew they would betray me later but I figured I could atleast conquer the British Isles before I had to deal with them. I conquered scotland and soon the British Isles were mine. I had built tons of markets mines and merchants and after a while my economy was booming. I spent my money on a huge invasion force and sent it to Denmark. It was going well until the HRE attacked me. I allied with Poland since they were also warring with the HRE and Denmark, and I was able to conquer Denmark and together we beat the HRE back to a few settlements in Italy. I had been expanding too fast though, and the war had put a signifigant strain on my economy. Since I couldn't keep my cities in Germany happy I gave them to Poland. Then Milan attacked me so I beat them back too, but that war was alot more costly and I lost tons of men and some of my best generals. I decided to send my new king back to London since his traits were really good and he just married his new wife (which was also his cousin, ew) and I wanted to make sure he didn't get killed before he had an heir. On his way back he was ambushed by my backstabbing French allies and killed. Then the Polish betrayed me, despite the fact that I had helped them build an empire for them.  With all my best generals dead, I lost all my territory in Europe, and I then deleted my save in a fit of rage.

63,17593028,english,"I want to preface this review by saying that this is my first total war game ever AND my first review ever. I was contemplating between entering the Total War franchise with Attila or this. I think I chose correctly. Now, onto the review.

Amazing game when it works. Utterly frusterating when it doesn't. 

First, The Bad: (Refering primarily to campaign but some things are applicable in Multiplayer too)
1. Ai can be utterly moronic at some times. Blatantly avoiding any sort of conflcit in open field battles if they dont outnumber you 2-1 or have a massive missle cav force.
2. Sieges are annoying as hell on bad days.
                                 1. Sallying  out breaks the Ai and they will just sit there letting you take pot shots at them.                   
                                 2. The Ai will try to destroy your entire city, making the city basically worthless, before charging in.
                                 3. Charging archers up ladders onto walls first. Need I say more?
                                 4. Archers are glitchy as hell on the walls. Refusing to move, refusing to fire, etc.
                                 5. Finally, any kind of combat inside the walls can get super fldgety and frustrating;
                                 6. Finally, the most annoying thing of all is, you can solve most of this using small unit sizes. Boring
3. If you make an ally or allies in campaign. Be prepared to get it thrown in your face no matter what is currently happening. Ive literally seen the Ai betray and mass attack my borders after I finally saved them from a massive military insurrection into their territory.  Marrying princessess into their faction will certainly help with this but there is no guarantee. 
4. Pathfinding, both inside and outside of sieges can screw you at any point. I've literally used 2 groups of knights to target a crossbow unit. Instead they pulled a complete 180 and charged straight into a pike unit. That basically lost me that battle as I didn't have much cav to begin with. 
5. Pope excommunicating cimulator. 10/10 (Although I will admit, it can be fucking hilarious.)
Warning: this is not a complete list, just things that I notice on a REGULAR basis. Other odd stuff does occur.

Now, The Good: 
EVERYTHING ELSE!! Despite everything annoying and wonky about this game. I cannot deny how much fun I've had. It's hilarious to watch as Christian factions eliminate each other while on crusade only to ultimately fail that crusade because they killed each other off. Combat (when its working properly and troops aren't refusing to take orders) gets FREAKING EPIC. Watching the carnage of a really good battle unfold in front of you gets your blood pumping. Despite all the grievances I have with this game, they also make this game hilariously funny. Being able to take out around 2000 men with a group of 80 knights leaves you feeling accomplished despite the fact that its primarily the fault of crappy Ai. Other times you'll be hiding behind the 1% of your walls that remain in a siege and be crapping your pants trying to cover all the breach points. Mongol and Timurid invasions add insane moments, especially if you are based in the middle east or Russia. I've had times where I took a city as a crusader and had to fortify insanely fast to prepare for a massive mongol invasion. Barely holding out against around 10,000 mongol cavalry with barely a handful of men as they pounded my walls with rockets and trebuchets.  Ultimately, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is willing to look past the (at times) terrible Ai and frusterating campaign moments. However, a word of caution to those who like strategy. This game will suck your life away. I've literally played for 6 hours straight some times. If you have the self control and the time. Buy this game immediately.

It was cool that the next time they actually cared more and brought more stuff. Yet peasents cant own teutonic soldiers <3

Once they came with 2 armies but 1 army was behind my castle and did not attacked (they weren't even able to cause of the mountain but they could have gone arround and support their main army) or did anything at all while the smaller army on the front attacked but failed. Those are some of the AI mistakes but really, they rarely happen and usually the AI does a good job at combat.

I take it now that the AI has small benefits (could be a little annoying at the start though) that balance their behavior in battle and I got over it.

Fast pace 9 years forward and low and behold, it was on a steam sale and so I bought it again. I wish I hadn't though!
My god I wish I hadn't! This game is broken in every way imaginable! I don't remember it being this bad. If I had a hard corpy I would break the cd and mail it to the developers with a note that said, fix me, I'm broken!

Pro's:
It was cheap
The strategy part is fun

Con's
Unit placement is impossible. I literally timed how long it took me to get one unit to accept the placement. I gave up!
Placing Archers unit on walls makes the archers shoot up into the air instead of down at the enemy.
Moving units down from the walls is impossible. See Unit placement issues above.
Moving units away from imcomming enemy units has to be done an hour in advance. It doesn't respond. Takes about 10 seconds before units move after given orders. 
Cavalry units that are discribed as ruling the battlefield gets owned by peasants.
Placing stakes in front of your own units to protect from enemy cavalry is great until you have to move your own cavalry. No matter how much space there is around the stakes. They go right through it I die.
The automated battle option is completely random.
Screen randomly decides to get stuck moving in one direction all the god danm time. unable to move the camera back save & load is what you'll be doing most of.

66,16933018,english,"Even though this version pales in comparison to the game-play of the original, there aren't many good choices out there for this particular type of turn-based/real-time strategy/tactics/builder game. There are some obvious weaknesses that one would think simply playing the game would have revealed to the developers, such as having to open three menus and then alphabetizing the final list to be able to check on various non-military “agents” such as merchants and assassins, then, depending on what you do seeing the the list close and having to start from the beginning to check on your next agent. And since these agents are often spread across the entirety of Europe, North Africa, and the Near East, this is a constant headache.
Additionally, your view of the action on the tactical level is VERY restricted, as zooming in does so on an arc, and there isn't any way to pan up or down. Additionally, you can't view very far away from your troops. I understand the need for “realism” to restrict your view, but with the arching zoom its very hard to point at a spot you want your troops to go to if there are trees or buildings in the way. The view in EVERY Total War game after the original “Shogun Total War” and “Medieval Total War” has been awful when compared to those original games. They had their issues, but were so much more enjoyable and easy to play then the versions that came after. 
There are “guides” that tell you little bits of advice, but no way to bring up previous instructions. This would only occasionally be helpful because most of the “help” is of the simplistic, “Protect your archers from cavalry with spearmen” type. So what was the button to push to make (whatever) happen?
There are also lists that seem to be simply text, with no indication you could click on a heading (such as a raised button) that are fairly disorganized without doing so. This is just lazy programing.
There is also no way to prioritize what gets built first, so if you have a project at one city or fortress that you want to make sure gets started, you have to delete every item from both queues (armies and structures) at every other city or fortress.  And if you have 15 or 20 other cities or fortresses this is very time consuming. Again, something that should have easily been noticed by the developers if they played the game for 15 or twenty hours.
But, unfortunately, this is still one of the best series available for this type of game. It's just so frustrating that with a little bit of effort it could have been so much better.",1436304685,1436304685,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198059236927,47,6,116529,781,6068,1601356888,,

It took me a few weeks to learns how to play, which is fine by me because I like my games to have a little bit of depth to them and this was my first total war (which is bittersweet, because that's like being a virgin and having sex with a pornstar, only to have the rest of your experiences wanting). Anyways, I loaded up the game and started a new campaign as Scotland on very hard difficulty. I managed to conquer the British Isles in the name of Mel Gibson, which was good because my economy was sky rocketing. After a few years in game I had built up five full stacked armies of knights, armoured footmen, and archers. It was time to invade Normandy to liberate France from the HRE. I studied Allied WWII invasion plans for a while before I actually comitted to my attack. So I declared war on the factions inhabiting the Italian penisula and invaded mainland Europe on two fronts. Whilst I was fighting battle after battle, I got Russia to ally with me and attack the countries to the east of HRE. After a while, Russia and I completely obliterated the mainland. However, Russia wanted more land. A few turns later Russia declared war on me and we fought tooth and nail to secure our newly conquered lands. Russia was winning for a while, but then everything changed when the Mongols attack. We were both weak from fighting a mock WWII so the Mongols just steamrolled Russia. I tried to ally with the mighty Khan, but he refused me. In my weakened state, the factions of Iberia declared war on me and invaded the British Isles while the Mogols savaged my holdings in the mainland. Despite my best effort, Spain, Portugal, and the Mongols defeated my glorious empire. In the end, I failed my people, my God, and most importantly Mel Gibson.

I'd say that it has a very high mass of building's that can be built leaving endless hours of fun. And if you are the Historical type they have multiple challenging Historical battles. This game also supports multiplayer which I found quite fun. Though like every game it has it's share of bugs and it's bad sides. The lack of update's and fixes to the game were rarely seen. (Seige does need abit of help.) You may encounter a bug or two at most but the rest of the game makes up for that factor.

Ignoring commands? Sure. Spontaneously cancelling orders? Of course. Long ant-lines when turning corners? Always. How about a unit splitting into two parts that move at different speeds? How about one bugged guy sprinting in place causing your entire unit to become tired? You didn't think of that did you? Play this game and you'll learn all about broken pathfinding.

23,16711607,english,"I am going to compare this game to Rome: Total War, an older entry of the series.

Improvements I instantly notice:

Naval combat feels very rewarding! It is still autocalculated, but 2 ships will go up against 1 and you will probably win. 6 ship can go against 5 enemy ships, and you might just win a heroic victory with 0 losses! 

Instead of the SPQR for Roman Factions, you have a Pope for the many different Catholic factions! This is a good addition in my opinion, as now more factions feel fleshed out. 

Graphics are better here and there, but the way my settings are, I don't really notice major differences. Not that the graphics hold anything back!

Pre-battle speeches feel nice and Medieval-like! Though they are slightly repetitive, they're still a joy to listen to. 

There is no balance issues that I can see, but the Byzantines/Turks and the Holy Roman Empire seem to have it easier early on when they're played by AI. 

Crusades are a nice new addition as well! 

For the most part, the Campaign map feels the same. However, a key difference is that you can swap a settlement between being a Castle or a Town. Castles offer military power, whilst Towns offer economic power. The choice is yours!

Agent system feels a lot more immersive.

There are tons of cinematics! It feels like an achievement just to have a Spy take a look at a few stray enemy units.

MP is still kicking, but Rome 1's MP is also alive. 

It is also only worth $20, with a very cheap DLC! That is a complete steal for a game like this. That said, Rome 1 is cheaper.

Probably one of the best things this game has is the fact that the map is more immersive! There was historical events in Rome 1 like volcanoes and floods, but now you can witness the spawn of the Mongols, or contact Aztecs when you have been confined to Europe all this time!

By then, I was having horrible money issues, due to poor upkeep, and an insane abundance of generals. I had an army far superior to the HRE's but they had immense numbers, I carved my way through atleast 3 armies before my own was reduced to less than a hundred and I was forced to retreat. But, with no cash to rebuild a defence I decided it was time to leave behind the dozen generals and the deadly enemy I had made for a much more peaceful living. My ally, Venice gladly traded Tripoli to me for all my cities. In no time, I was able to stablize myself with just 2 generals, all the rest died in a horrible accident with the English navy. However, I had no room to expand and was forced to battle Sicily. It was suprisingly easy after I had taken Tunis. But the Mongols had begun to capture every city they could. They wanted Tripoli too, so I easily gave it to them, their navies and armies scared me. But before I left, I renamed the city to Mongoliassholia. Now, in Tunis I built up my economy and made up enough money to get 3 Carracks to sail me to Sicily and Sardinia, which I easily conquered as the Sicilians somehow lost their entire forces defending Tunis. After much conquering, I had Corsica, Florence too, and was well on my way to finish off Sicily off east. When Portugal, and Milan decided I was in the way of their expansion. By then Germany, Egypt, and the Turks had been destroyed. Scotland reduced to Ireland, the Netherlands, and a city in the Baltics somehow. Portugal had made Spain and the Moors into vassals. Russia had been reduced to their original size, by the Timurids. The Mongols stretched out from Tripoli, to the Ukraine. Venice, once a power thanks to me had been too stretched out, and France, had managed to move all the way out to Poland, and Hungary, and were steadily taking out the rest of Venice in Europe, and eagerly awaiting to finish the ones off in Scandanavia. They wouldn't attack me though, we were in good standing. Now, as my eagar axemen, and sword-bearers are ready to invade Bologna, the Mongols come knocking again, and the max turns are reached.

Back to medieval, for a bit of an outdated game it still looks amazing, and it runs flawlessly, highest settings, even on my computer which only has 2 lousy GB of RAM. They campaign is fun, and it feels more in-depth, and more ""wholesome"" than the newer TW games like ROME 2. Just little things that you'll notice throughout the game that'll  make it just SO much more fun. The kingdoms expansion is even better!!! 90% of my logged game time is just the brittania campaign. I can't get enough of this game, I spend hours on end glued to my screen witnessing my armies conquer, and my ""light"" Ostmen slaughtering heavy Scottish Nobleman like they were pigs. And unlike ROME 2 where in melee combat, infantry just gets into a giant clusterf@#k and it takes forever for one side to win, melee combat in this game is so much better, each soldier in a unit has their own little fight and they're pals may jump in and help em out with a quick axe-to-the-head. I can go on and on about how amazing this game is, but then you'd be reading this for hours. Just buy the game. And see how amazing it is for yourselves. And you wont regret it. 10/10 one of the greatest games EVER made.

Settlements are divided between castles and cities which make the game more interesting and fun.There are a lot of little details that go a long way to making the game interesting and giving it some character. For example, after a battle, if you have prisoners you can decide whether you want to release them, execute them, or attempt to ransom them. When you hover the cursor over each choice, you will have one of the prisoners saying things depending on what you are looking at. If you hover over the ""release"" option, they'll praise you and say nice things, but if you hover over the ""execute"" option, they franticly beg for their lives. Enemy armies will also say things depending on your relations with them. If you are neutral, they'll have a respectful tone, but if you're enemies, they yell at and insult you. There are also these little videos for your spies and assassins when they act, though the  assassin videos are better, even when they fail. I had an assassin try to kill a guy, and he failed when his target hit him in the face with a door.

A stand out element is the music – I have been known to boot up into the main menu, just to savour the fantastic score, I believe entitled “Time And Again”, accompanied with the crashing of thunder and lightning, and watching the silhouetted troops march by.

Part of the reason Medieval II (and Kingdoms) is my favourite, is likely because I just have not invested the time in the newer incarnations (the following 2 just didn’t grab me), but undoubtedly the combat style of the era is much more to my taste.

I once played as the Byzantine Empire and transplanted the entire dynasty to sub-Saharan Africa, watching as the rest of the world was eclipsed by the Mongol tide.

Those are just a few things that you can do. Of course, that is if all goes as planned. Cities rioting, being besieged, angry rebels and neighbors, excommunication, the black death. In one game, I had the Holy Roman Empire get exiled four times, and even a crusade, to vanquish the heretics. My assassins almost never get a successful attempt on lives or buildings unless its something to do with religion. During crusades, men desert simply because you waited one turn so you could bring in reinforcements.

Wales I can never muster a big enough force, and if I do England seems to divert every soldier ever to come and challenge me. Had one where in two turns the whole of Scotland succumbed to riots and was eliminated. Crusades is alright, minus the fact everything is so far apart and thinly stretched. Americas is, well, awful. Haven't played as Apaches yet, but as both Mayans and Aztecs I managed to pull some stunning victories over Spain, until they got reinforcements and blasted me to oblivion. So I played as Spain and its too easy, even on hard. You can have 100 men and you will still have the upper hand over 500 natives. 

The game is amazing for when it was made and what not, just a few kinks in the rope, but its fun. Even when you get slaughtered. 9/10 would definitely send shirtless men with sticks to kill Spaniards in metal again and again.",1427482684,1427862991,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198071974334,231,43,23591,0,1583,1560150383,,

The size of the map makes the number of different areas one can battle in simply staggering (you're not progressing in your campaign the way you would in say... Warhammer: Mark of Chaos, you make it up as you go). The family trees and generals end up giving your factions a real personality and very distinctive features (woe betide you if madness or infertility strikes). Battles are stupidly fun, although they will lack the graphic detail of the later Total War titles. That being said, the units are pleasant to look at and have unique appearances and appeals between factions (something I found horribly sad about Rome II: variety? sure! accuracy? sure! horrifically ugly units and often without beards. It's like watching 5th graders stab each other). There is a staggering amount of variety in most of the factions recruiting pools which just makes for interesting viewing and battles.

First of all, the gameplay offers a massive choice of nations and units each with their own traits. 17 different factions on top of long and short campaigns give a lot of room for different story paths and immense replayability. The mix of battles, diplomacy, family traits and strategy AI create a truly realistic and immersive game that offers an infinate number of choices to your next move, although the turn-based elements often feel oversimplified. It does have a solid real time combat foundation, but the AI is either really good or really bad depending on the difficulty setting. There is no middle ground. If you are new to real time strategy games, this one has a pretty steep learning curve. Even seasoned players may feel overwhelmed.
One campaign can take days, even months of play time. However, sometimes the game can become a bit taxing to less motivated players (not that I'm complaining) and the AI during battles can often glitch. Whilst these glitches are mostly minor, they nevertheless break your immerson in the game and can be quite annoying when your soldiers glitch about instead of doing as they're told. Despite all its weaknesses, Med 2 is still a briliantly crafted game, its strategy mixed in with impressive graphics and cinematic music will keep you wound up in the Medieval age for thousands of hours.

It's one of CA's best (Total War) games. It beats Empire, it beats Napoleon (which was rather a pile of garbage so that wasn't hard) and it beats Shogun2.

Probably the last really well thought out Total War game, and one of the least buggy. There is no stupidly awkward city management system (Empire), most of the factions are reasonably well balanced (with the exception of the Italian States, who are crushingly overpowered in a player's hands - still better than pretty well all the other total war games out there), and things move at a pace that doesn't feel to relaxed or too rushed (shogun, napolean).

It's not a masterpiece by any means, but now that I revisit them, I don't think any of the Total War games really are. It is a pretty fun game though, and certainly worth getting if you've are looking to get into the series.

30,14144112,english,"A long time ago, I played the DVD version and loved it (particularly the Crusades and Teutonic expansions). Long lost so I picked up the Steam Medieval II: Total War package including all the expansions on sale. So far, I've played over 150 hours. Obviously, if I've committed so much of my spare time to playing a game I can hardly not recommend it. On sale, it's one heck of a value. However, overall, I find it a bit frustrating and though I have started many games, I've never finished a single one.

The really good news is that MTW II and all it's expansions are terrific at differentiating the factions. There are a lot of clever ideas and thought that's gone into making each faction unique and interesting.  Game graphics really hold up considering the age of the game. No complaints there. Lots of historic detail to revel in. Massive battles never really get old.

The bad news is the campaign AI is poorly balanced between factions. A few are easy to play (which can be corrected by upping the difficulty) but many are ridiculously difficult even in easy campaign mode. To make matters worse, the diplomacy is pretty much awful. Generally creating an alliance greatly increases the odds of being attacked by a faction a few turns down the road. The campaign script is pretty rote. After about 25 turns the first faction attacks. Make any headway and the 2nd attacks. Keep up your progress and the 3rd one attacks. Of course, the attackers diplomacy remains ""mixed"" or ""reliable"" while the victim of attacks - that'd be the only human in the room - drops to ""despicable."" Really?

To give the AI a fighting chance, the human player starts off in the basement of development. It takes a very, very, very long time to build an interesting fighting force. Meanwhile, getting pounded by an increasing number of factions who seem capable of pumping out better, larger armies delays development even longer. Money management requires applying every penny each turn to development and maintaining troops. Losing just 1 city while getting piled on by the AI factions and my house of cards can quickly collapse. 

There are a lot of interesting side characters: priests, assassins, spies, merchants, and diplomats. Unfortunately, they're spoiled by the aforementioned issues. Diplomats are important but crippled by poor diplomacy AI. Merchants are horribly balanced. There may be a way to strengthen them I'm missing but mine tend to get killed quickly by rival merchants. I can count on 1 hand (with fingers left over) the number of times my merchant survived an attack. Newly created assassins, by contrast, are equally pathetic but can be slowly built up over time by killing, for example, rebel captains. Priests similarly are weak in killing heretics with no way of building them up I can see so I tend to use assassins for this task. Still, priests are useful to build up religion in a region I control though their ability to foment rebellion in regions held by rival factions is a lot weaker than I expected. With rare exception, priests are about useless to this task.

With the game being so old I have little hope for a patch to rebalance or improve the AI. So MTW II is what it is. A game that's fun to fiddle with but never really finish, IMHO.

I give MTW II 6.5 out of 10. Above average but I'm really disappointed in the Steam version. There's so much potential to a great concept being lost. I recall the DVD versions being a lot more fun. Strange.

Resource management is the devil. I've believed that for a long time, because it's a ball and chain wrapped around RTSs that basically dictates ""he who micromanages faster, wins.""

What sets the Total War series apart is that all preparation for battle is done in the turn based stage. If you get caught off-guard or overwhelmed, it's based on your shortcomings as a strategic and tactical player, not who can mine vespene gas faster. 

That being said, Medieval II is still probably the strongest out of all the Total War titles. There is a huge pool of traits that give your generals character (whereas Empire had like, what, 10?), very diverse countries and units, and probably the most satisfying of the Total War battlescapes.

Of course, this also comes with the things Total War is notorious for: suicidal AI (i have one province and your army outnumbers mine 20:1, I DECLARE WAR) and backstabbing-for-no-reason AI (I'm going to break the alliance we signed one turn ago).

Castles and Cities develop in two separate ways, and produce different units.

If playing a Catholic nation, you have to deal with the Pope. He can make or break your nation, so keep an eye on your approval rating with him. After a victory, most of the factions are then unlocked. They are also unlocked individually if you happen to be the one to land the killing blow.

Side note: If you do unlock all the nations, three are the Moors, Egypt, and the Turks. Do take care of your volume at that time, because when you click a unit, move them, or attack with them, they do have a slight vocalization. Which at times could make people nervous (about killing infidels and the like).

I became immediately immersed in this game.  I actually care about the characters and how they develop and grow, it feels more real.  RTW2 is a terrible game.  Playing this game made me realize just how bad RTW2 really is.  It looks pretty but it has no guts.  It's amazing how older games are so much better than these new ones. Just mindblasting.

This game is damn well near perfect. Sure it has a few bugs, but the game has been out since 2006 you can easily find a mod to fix any unresolved bugs or gameplay issues. And speaking of mods, Medieval II: Total War has the best overhaul mods I've ever seen, let alone played. Sadly buying the game on Steam complicates modding since there is no Steam Workshop for the game. For instance my favorite overhaul mod, Third Age: Total War (a Tolkien-inspired mod), refuses to launch no matter what I do.

As for the game itself, I cannot praise it enough. While not eye-candy like Shogun II or Rome II, the gameplay (both in campaign and in battle) was the best of the original Total War games. After Medieval II, Creative Assembly begins a gameplay transformation that peaks in Rome II. Essentially this game perfects what CA started in their previous games (Rome, Shogun and Medieval).

The question is ultimately: Should I buy it? Well there's a free demo, but the Gold Edition (or rather the Medieval II: Total War Collection) is worth full price.

It seems that everything sega touches is either buggy or broken. The game has serious pathfinding problems, and the units respond strangely on the battlefield. All-in-all the battles aren't worth it, its just very predictable or downright broken.

All the other aspects are ok, the graphics the sound, the presentation, its a big brand game, but it doesn't deliver really. The game pretends to be big, but its actually really, really small. And there aren't that many countries to play with, even if you count the entire map. 
It reminds me of Lords of the Realm 3 and how that sucked big time, but maybe I'm just spoiled by Paradox Interactive. 
The campain map is limiting in most ways, and the gameplay its self either has things that dont realy work for it, or that you can simply completely ignore.
Maybe if this was all there was to it, ok, it could have been good... But we have Civilization 4, Europa Universalis 4 and many other real grand strategy games out there.

72,13101384,english,"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!     

so yeah i'm sure by my title you can guess where i stand on my opinion of the game. Now before i begin i will say that i have played many games of this category. for instance there is nearly all the total war titles and europa univeralis 4, hearts of iron 3. So i am not unfamiliar with this (and for those who are you will find it is VERY easy to get into). Pretty much everything about this game is perfect i mean the gameplay when you command your troops in battle is so immersive and spotless it is hard to find a complaint. Not to mention this game is weirdly more advanced and realistic compared to later total war game, like empire total war and napoleon or even the newest rome 2.


 I mean you actually have to have your diplomats move and not just be lazy and click a button and open up the diplomatic menu. Not to mention the soldiers actually act like people! now if you haven't noticed the troops from shogun 2 and rome 2 DESPERATLEY need to take notes from this MASTERPIECE of a game. the troops in Medieval 2 move so fluently it is unreal, in rome 2 they feel like bricks with legs, shogun 2 (and empire and napoleon) are slightly better with this which adds to my earlier topic of how earlier games are better than the new ones. empire and napoleon makes more sense with how they soldiers move though because of the timeline, shogun 2 kinda does because it does have a couple gun regiments. but rome 2 i have no idea.


And another thing is that Medieval 2 is not arcady like rome 2 and empire napoleon and shogun 2. in rome 2 there is a timer in the fortress in a siege so if you just have one dude step in that stupid circle you will win in 2min it is crazy, now i know there is one in Medieval 2 but considering it is in they WAY back of the fortress it is not even there. another thing is the maps are very different and unique and are just generally much better than what i've seen in rome 2. (by the way if you are wondering why i am comparing so much to rome 2 it is because it is the newest game of the total war series and this just goes to show that pretty graphics can only take you so far, because that is all rome 2 is to me) 


Also the gameplay in the battles in Medieval 2 are so much more stratigic and are just generally perfect in everyway possible, unlike rome 2. Now the whole point of the total war games is to have an easy political view game and a very complicated and stratigic battling system in between. THAT IS WHAT A TOTAL WAR GAME IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. (which is why Medieval 2 is so amazing) in rome 2 the battling system is so horride and awful it makes me want to puke, and the diplomatic gameplay just.....i can't even describe my disgust with that, in Medieval 2 it is just so perfect and amazing that my only explanation for how good it is, is probably that a god crafted Medival 2. 


Now i could go on and on about how Medieval 2 is the best total war game i've played. Like the music is so amazing and inspiring and immersive. Medieval 2 also is SUPER IMMERSIVE AND PERFECT IN NEARLY EVERY WAY POSSIBLE! now i could talk for the rest of my life on how good this game is, but i am pretty sure that whoever read this long probably got the idea already, so yeah Medieval 2 is 10/10 in my book",1417072532,1417072532,True,6,0,0.547111332416534424,0,True,False,False,76561198081840760,132,12,2341,0,947,1546971145,,

Still, there are problems with the game. It's pretty old, and while I have few complaints about the graphics (kinda unfair to rag on those), I did have some problems making it run on Windows 8.1 - so keep that in mind. There are also quite a few things that could improved; the campaign goals are a bit ridiculous, though that doesn't mean that it's all that hard to beat the campaign. The AI - while it has moments of brilliance - is pretty bad in general: on the battlefield it'll often charge forward with little thought (though this seems to happen less late game, for some reason), and on the campaign map in can be incredibly stubborn (unless you have an enourmous advantage), attack you for no discernable reason (sometimes accepting peace the turn after with no battles fought) and in general it's just incredibly hit and miss. The ship battles are also basically non-existent, and there's an annoying lack of control, but who ever liked ship battles anyway, so that's a minor point. 

The unit variety is also somewhat lacking, though it isn't all that bad - the selection is okay, but your armies will often look alike, and you'll find yourself just building the same army again and again. Of course as you grow larger, you'll encounter enemies with completely different units, but it happens fairly late in the campaign. It's sad because the game actually includes quite a few more units, but they're only ""unlocked"" very late game where you're already totally dominating. Talking about selection, you have a choice of annoyingly few factions when first starting the campaign - you have to beat it to unlock minor factions.

I have more minor complaints, but the good news is that mostly everything can be fixed with the huge number of mods made for this game. 

Overall, I'd love a MD III: TW - where they don't fuck up as they did with Rome II - where they incorporate the good stuff they made for the new games (tech tree, mini settlements), but drop the stuff like mo-cap and whatnot. I could talk for awhile about what shouldn't be included, but anyhow: I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and you should buy it even if it isn't on sale. It's probably the game I've had the most fun with. It's easy to get into, and it's entertaining throughtout - I have a few nitpicks, but yeah, there's nothing majorly wrong with this game in my opinion.

Medieval II Total war shows a mix from the past to the Present day, and I think THIS game was the gateway from old Total War to the new.

40,12448578,english,"After playing 25 hours of Medieval II Total War I decided to write a review. My comments may be a little lengthy so for those not inclined to read further I will say “ Buy this great game now! “ . 

If you are reading onward I ought to say I’m a relative noob when it comes to Total War games. I bought Napoleon TW about 2.5 years ago and Empire TW roughly 2 years ago and have clocked 80 hours in Napoleon TW and about 220 hours in Empire TW. Completely enjoyed my hours playing each of these games, having led the 95th Rifles successfully across Spain in Napoleon TW and captured all of North America 1st as the Brits and then again as the French in Empire TW. Lots of great battles along the way too! 

So when I saw the Medieval II TW Collection on sale for 75% off I decided I would buy it and see what it was like. Had read several good reviews of it and really couldn’t beat the price anyways. Once it installed I was off and running, err galloping into the game. Very quickly I began to really enjoy the experience. One really can’t tell it’s an 8 year old game. It runs well, plays great, and the battles are the usual TW standard I am used too.  If I had of known it was this good I would have bought it long before now. But as stated above I’m fairly new to the world of TW gaming. I keep meaning to take screenshots during battles but keep forgetting to snap the pics once the action starts. Have to work on that!

My recommendation for this game is 9/10. More than one review I read about Medieval II Total War called it the best Total War game of all time. I’m not able to state that myself but with 25 hours into the game so far I will say for anyone who likes Medieval period warfare this is the game for you. Nothing like making the right command, having your archers switch to fire arrows, only to see your enemy’s attacking siege tower go up in flames a few min later after some concentrated archery. Or standing on the walls of Rennes after a French attack with the battlements covered by bodies of both the attackers and my defenders. There is a pic of that in my content posts. The full price for the Collection of this game is $25 US. Well worth it if you want some great gaming now. If you feel like waiting, this game will be on sale in both the Steam Thanksgiving Sale and the Christmas / NY’s Sales happening in the next 3 months. Hit the right days and you’ll be able to get a fantastic deal. Hope you have found my comments useful and they have helped you decide to buy this ever interesting game!",1413033865,1413092602,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561197968411681,90,7,12764,0,1949,1473676692,,

60,12317638,english,"Probably the hardest and most fun Total War Game I've played. Medieval II does a great job with preserving a lot of the the really unique, interesting aspects of the original, such as the interplay with the Pope and your own world conquest initiative, a very complex and intense economic system, along with unique and important characters and agents (such as the new ""merchant"" unit who can buy out rival merchants or just make you money per turn, depending on the resource they are stationed on. This allows for both ""attacking"" economies and ""defensive"" economies!)

My problem is there are a couple of things that, while accurate, aren't really that fun to be on the receiving end of (inquistors... oh my god screw you,) and some of the base options of the game suck unless you fix it (trust me, do not have settlements go under auto-manage if you don't have a general stationed there. It makes the game way harder but also kills a lot of the fun!) Plus, while the myriad of units are really cool, and by really cool I mean incredibly awesome, early combat is extremely static (spearman stand in front of archers, archers shoot, cavalry flank, repeat for victory.)

Besides these minor pitfalls, the dozens of amazing parts of this game completely dominate and make this easily a must-have in your library if you love any of the Civilization style games, any RTS game such as Age of Empires, or if you liked any of the other Total War games, you need to play Medieval II.

This game is a massive improvement on Rome 1 that was before this and of course is far better with the amount of mods that are availiable for it. Especially if you have the Kingdoms Expansion which I recomend you should get as well. Vanilla is very good and holds its own but like most Total Wargames it is improved further with mods. To improve historical accuracy and provide total overhauls. I recomend you have a look on twcenter.net for what modders have made availiable. 

This game covers 300 years of history from just after the Norman invasion of Britain, the Crusades, the Mongol invasion, the discovery of gun powder to the exploring of the Americas.

And it didn't work.

Steam has done a great job legitimicing piracy.

The classical argument for buying the games instead of downloading them is the guarantee that they will work and you'll support the developers.

With pirated games it's not unusual that you have to deal with bugs and errors, googling for hours just to make the game work. With good reason, if you've stolen something, you don't have the privilege to use it.

So why the FUCK, valve? Why do I have to have these problems when I trust you to sell me a functional product? I paid you for this game. It's your legal responsibility that you've sold me a product which has the functionality you've marketed it with.

Again, the graphics here are great, and very detailed in the city/castle making. Another big plus is the inclusion of the Family Tree, later removed, which is great for viewing whom is within an ever growing family, and who should be king(a great plus over having to kill off the un-desired heir in the previous Medieval: Total War XD).

We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
This day shall gentle his condition:
And gentlemen in England now a-bed
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.

56,9860598,english,"Let me start by saying I am [i]not[/i] easily impressed. I think my several ""Not Recommended"" reviews are a testament to that. That being said, Medieval II: Total War is one of those games that really knocks my socks off.

What sticks out first to me is the level of detail put into the battle system. The idea of different units having morale levels that go up and down depending on events going on around them is amazing. It seems apparent that someone on the dev team thumbed through a military strategy guide too. Leaving a route for an enemy to escape to encourage them to flee rather than fight to the death is something touched on in the opening sections of [i]De Re Militari[/i], and such a tactic is encouraged in the game as surrounded enemies who try routing will instead fight to the death or until they manage to break through the encirclement.

Another thing I like is the level of detail put into unit animations. Considering the time this was developed I find it rather impressive. I knocked a guy off a wall with an explosive cannon shot and could hear him scream while he fell to his death. That was a couple days ago and it's still stuck in my head.

The music is great. It can get repetitive, but it's got that blood-pumping feel to it that mimics the gameplay perfectly. I don't know what more I can say about it. If you haven't heard it, go check it out on Youtube or something, assuming the copyright Jews haven't taken it down yet.

Like I said, I'm not easily impressed. If Medieval II: Total War can elicit a positive response from me, that's a pretty good indicator that its creators did something right.

What makes the Total War games so interesting is that you get to fight your battles on the battle map. You can give orders, putting your units into strategical positions to give you the best advantage of winning. Real life events that actually happened also appear in this game.

The main menu music and background instantly give you a taste of the grand scale and epic setting. Even compared to Rome 2 it is visually stunning and will run great on most newer systems, although I remember when it first came out it was brutally demanding of graphics power. One aspect that sets this game out from the others in the series is the religion factor. Yes, the other games have it also, but not to the lenghts of this game. Sending a massive crusading army across Europe and into the Middle East, and than being met by an opposing Jihad force is simply stunning. Than depending on the outcome of the crusade you will either be greatly rewarded by the church for victory, or for failure you may be excommunicated and cast as an enemy to the Christiandom! Another unique feature is the guilds. While their effects and purpose are hard to see at first, they will progressively become more helpful to your nation and will lead to some awesome and elite troops specific to different factions. For example, England can develop a woodsmen guild in Nottingham and once it reaches a certain level, you can recruit Sherwood archers that can camoflauge in the woods and have tremendous range. The powerful Knights Templar are another guild specific to Christian Nations, while eastern nations have the Hashassins guild. If there is one thing that frustrates me during combat, it is that sometimes archers don't fire directly at the enemy when there on walls, but it just takes some practice mastering their line of sight and taking advantage of their range. I also wish there were more historical battles as they provide some awesome scenerios and challenging battles. I recommend going through atleat one play through as the vanilla game, and than trying out the VAST amounts of full and partial mods that have been made for this game. You can even try your own costumizations to the script and combinations of different modification until you find the perfect balance for you. All in all, this a game for the ages and is better than 99% of the garbage that comes out nowadays.

My only General left was maried into the royal family and was still loyal, but both he and his army where killed when a large rebel force attacked London. The rebels won and while sacking the large city, a traitor told the rebels where the royal Family was. Every single family member was killed and the entire blood line was eradicated. 

All that happened about 24 turns into the game.

43,10366457,english,"A very fun game which can be about as challenging as you want it to be.

The strategy on the world map is very important, and logistics are by far the deepest part of it. Not hard to get into, mind you, but it takes some time to master. The battle tactics are much more difficult to become skilled at, but the game gives you incentives to do so, and it feels rewarding and exhillarating when you do. And if over-arching strategy is more your thing, and you find the battles themselves either not to your liking or too difficult, you can always just auto-resolve, and this game has an auto-resolve that actually favors the player rather than the AI like in most games. 

Excellent replayability, as there is a wide variance in unit type and viable playstyles between factions, not to mention you begin in different situations, with different neighbors, regions, and money.

If I had to mention a few cons, the diplomacy is broken. If you favor expansion, expect all of your neighbors to very quickly declare war on you, and they will very rarely make peace for anything. And even if they do, it won't last. Allies do not function properly (at all, really), and the Pope imposes debilitating penalties to your nation by demanding you not fight any other Catholic nation, even if those nations are the aggressors against you. The pathfinding for units is very bad, the enemy's battle AI, while efficient and skilled at what it is meant to do, is not overly intelligent, and understanding how to get infantry to attack properly is a nightmare.

Overall, though, it is a very good game that was quite lovingly made, with attention to detail and good voice-acting and music, even if there isn't that MUCH of those.

Lol Don't know if that one is taken yet, if not... Trade mark it. 

Let's start off gameplay, the gameplay is the best i've seen in the Total War series, you can battle with over 15+ factions. (More if you use mods or edit the games programming). And a wonderful gameplay experience. You can use a variety of units based on real life units. (Ex. Highland Pikemen...My favorite Scotland unit.) and not just the Campaign or Custom battling experience, you have a chance to face off with Historical battles, battles that are designed and developed to show the real life experience.

Multiplayer - I don't like how it's setup, wishing it was more like Empire Total Wars where you can just set a username and start playing, but on here you have to make an account at some site... (Reply it, forgot the name) and then tons of other junk, so the Online experience from my view is un-known. Heard it was good!

Campaign - The campaign at first you get 5 factions. There is a Short and Long campaign mode, and you can play and do certain objectives, depending the faction. Certain factions have to take over certain regions, and certain factions have to have a certain amount of regions. For newer players to the Campaign area, you can adjust the settings of AI managing. For example you can set it to AI manage the entire game where you can only move and command troops...take over cities..etc Or you can manage only recruitment or building or both and let the computer handle taxes. My first run at campaign I managed everything and succeeded until I got to a certain amount of Regions then I lost control. But it's easier to let the computer do it first, then watch and see what it builds and recruits..etc. Also if you are non-patient and like to get through the movements of the AI you can switch the + type thing off and skip the AI movements. If you are a hardcore gamer, I do suggest you try the campaign.


Single Player - Custom Battles... My least favorite kinda... I like the idea of playing from each faction and free battling, but I really don't like not being able to have seige battles or having scenarios in that field. Otherwise it's self-explanitory really you just pick out certain units for each and every team, then you battle. Only a handful of maps, all the factions already unlocked, and tons of units. 

The overall review, the game is great and addicting. I don't play a lot but if I'm already at 10 hours it's addicting. Some other players played for over 1000+ hours. Pretty sad right? No hell nah!

I have not covered  multiplayer in this review as I have no idea if any of the public servers work as I have never tried any of them,  but the single player,  oh boy i can tell you,  that it is good.

First off the game gives you a custom battle mode. So, if you ever wondered what it would be like to have an army of nothing but peasants charge a fully equipped renaissance castle filled to the brim with archers with flaming arows, now you can find out!

Then there's the campaign which might be confusing to some, but I suggest either looking up some hints and tips on the forums or replaying the tutorial. The campaign also has diplomacy, and very good diplomacy at that. And the best part is, the A.I does make deals with you that are in your favour, such as giving you gold or line of sight to where they live if you ally with them. As well as that there are spies for taking a peek at what your foes are doing and how big a force they have, as well as assasins for when you just need to go all stabby, stabby on that certain duke or king.

Even though the graphics are not up to date whith what todays graphics are, they still look good even if you zoom right in on people's faces.
That, and the way a castle looks when you bring its walls down with everyone on top falling through the new hole you just made, is awsome.

The game also involves a lot of strategy. I can tell. And even if you sort of suck at it, like I do, you can still have a lot of fun witth this game. Basic tactics (allthough not as good) can still win you the game, at least against the medium A.I. as charging your entire hourse-back army down a hill to smash into your foe's unprotected rear is a tactic.

Also, this game handles flaming projectiles really well, as hitting your enemy's peasants feels really satisfying, as well as making you really glad that you are not one of  those poor fools. This goes for catapults and trebuchets as well, exept bigger and much more deadly ones. You can also make enemy siege weapons burn down, which makes you feel like such a troll to the stupid A.I.  As you say ""nope!"" as your archers burn down an entire siege tower and the men who were just using it are forced to use ladders, only to be poked to death by your spear-men, now waiting at the top for them.

So, all in all, I give it a 9/10 as there are some things that bug me a little, such as 1 guy with a leather shield blocking 10 arrows at once or a knight in full plate-mail bursting into flames at the first fire arrow.",1396275054,1396275054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198042441420,843,16,3380,0,2747,1573488908,,

This latter piece of the puzzle matters because some of the community dating back to when the game originallly released went to a lot of trouble to make mods, such as Stainless Steel and the total conversion for Lord of the Rings: Third Age.

For me, the charm of Medieval 2 though is really centered around the game itself, the time period is so well suited for the style of game play that CA makes with the turn based stragegy map combined with the real time tactical battles that the result is just endless amounts of fantastic game play.

Like all Total War games, Medieval II features a turn-based strategy map where the player manages their armies and cities, and a real-time tactical battlefield where they play out combat against opponents' armies. Medieval II covers the medieval period of Europe (and includes northern Africa and portions of the Middle East), allowing your faction to attempt to conquer the entirety of the western world of the time.

It's fantastic and an enormous timesink. The graphics hold up surprisingly well for a game that was almost released a decade ago, in large part because the spectacle is so based on the massive numbers in the armies instead of incredible detail on the individual units.

49,9127557,english,"Following the huge success that was Rome, developers Creative Assembly turned their talents to a 'remake' of Medieval: Total War. All that made Rome TW great was included in this one: a detailed campaign map, zooming in close to your troops during battle, generals with personalilty and characteristics (which makes for amusing pre-battle speeches!), vast, credibly sized cities....

Furthermore, a couple of differences helped put Medieval 2 on par and, at times, above Rome. A new graphics engine replaced the 'technicolor' effect of Rome, doing justice to the metallic effect of armour and ever sharpening detail; Medieval 2 appears darker, gritty, alongside a menacing atmosphere. Whilst Diplomats play their usual role, Assassin's also return - and, true to the feedback of TW fans, those enjoyable 'mission' videos (sadly lacking in Rome) have reappeared so you can follow their success or failure. 

This is a world of religious beliefs; Priests are instrumental in spreading the godly influence of your faction: use them to either assauge dissident elements in your own provinces, or send them into rival lands and provoke rebellions! However, beware of pushing your luck when attacking 'fellow' Christian factions - dismissing the Pope's (a new gameplay mechanic) warning to cease hostilities will eventually excommunicate you, declaring your people heretical, thus making you fair game for rival factions. Death of a Pope and voting in a new one will have profound effect upon your fortunes - so hope you haven't too many 'unfriendly' rivals in the College of Cardinals. You will also be given the opportunity to prove your piety when requested to take part in a Crusade (Christian) or Jihad (Muslim). Embarking for a heretical target earns you gratitude from the Pope (always handy) and you can share in the loot of a successful venture.  

Gunpowder also found its niche in warfare during this period. As you progress and develop building tech trees, more powerful cannon can be recruited and utilized to deadly effect - especially during sieges. Crude types of 'handgun' first appeared during the high stage of medieval times, introducing a new infantry unit. As before, certain buildings can help cities expand, recruit quality units, maintain populace contentment, and improve on trade. 

Many nobles and wealthy knights captured by a victorious foe were seen as worthy ransoms. In victory, you'll also be presented the option of either 'releasing', 'slaughtering', or 'ransoming' captured enemy units. Your choice will affect the 'chivalry' or 'dread' aspects of the general who won the battle, whilst moulding the attitude of rival factions: carefully weigh decisions in face of considering peace negotiations with that faction in the future. 

There are some fascinating 'events' - such as inventions, scientific discoveries, the arts, newfound philosophies, and political incidents - marking your progress through the ever developing Medieval 2. Gunpowder is one, while another key moment is much more terrible: the Black Death! As population levels drastically drop, so too does trade and industrial output, affecting finances, reducing city garrisons to a literally skeleton force. If you manage to survive the plague's deathly scourge, then it's time for rebirth and rebuild. Indeed, it makes you wonder how our ancestors did it in reality. One other key moment is discovering the New World - although a much more elaborate  and longer campaign in this idea unfolds in the Kingdoms expansion - but in the main game you'll have to be content with conquering a few areas which represent the Americas. Although one of very few negative points, it's still fun taking an army across the vast Atlantic in a mad race to be the first to make a landfall! 

Medieval 2: Total War is often regarded one of the best in the series, capitalizing on Rome's design and success, whilst presenting some excellent new gameplay features alongside a revamped engine. Certainly, I've made several returns (each time starting a campaign from scratch with a different faction) and saw it through to the bitter end...hours of scheming and battling fun to be had here!",1392498072,1392498072,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198039889823,153,19,35489,36,1824,1601391457,,

One thing that anoys me is the enemy campaign AI and the diplomacy, the AI doesn't raise balanced armies and is usually just lots of the same unit type. The differences that set apart all of the factions really make a difference when playing, for exapmle using the English you want to be building armies that are focused on using Longbowmen but other factions don't have that option.

21,8275469,english,"One of the finest RTS games I have played and probably my only real favourite in the Total War series.  

Within this game you start off as one of the monarchies of the medieval era, England, France, Spain etc, inhabiting the West with the Turks, Egyptians, the Moors etc controlling most of the Eastern regions.  And I use control loosely, for this game is about constant strife, border control and damning your so called allies to your own religious hierarchies.  

The gameplay itself is split into two halves.  One half is the typical RTS strategic combat, where two armies with varied units, face each other on the battlefield to determine a victor!  In this part of the game, there is a Rock Paper Scissors style of strategy, with Spears besting Knights, Knights besting Archers and Archers besting Spears, though as your own technology expands and your coffers grow larger, more diverse units will be available to you.
The AI can be a little stupid at times, often forgetting your commands or taking an insanely longer route than it needs to travel to reach it's destination.  So some micromanagement is needed there.  


The second part of the gameplay is entirely Turn-Based.  
You begin with a selection of territories relevant to your faction's Monarchy, you also have your own Royal Family who each have their own needs and quirks which affect your overall strategy.  And in this phase of the game you'll be charged with building your resources, exploring the world, and interacting with your neighbours.  

Honestly I find this part of the game to actually be rather interesting, it's always fun to approach your neighbours with peace offerings and treaties, only to plan treachery for when the time is right.  And there are numerous and inventive ways you can attempt to accomplish this through, in a very Game of Thrones style of diplomacy if you're familiar with the subject matter.

I found this to be the better of the Total War series.  Others will have their preferences to Rome, Shogun or maybe even the Napoleonic Wars, but if you have any doubts of either, just do your research.  I hope my review will help contribute to that.

Medieval 2 definitely satisfies more than one of the gaming tastebuds, with great gameplay whilst also being a rather pretty game to look at, with its rather impressive graphics. I would reccomend this game to anyone interested in the franchise, who loves strategy games and also to anyone who loves a certain aura of historical accuracy in terms of certain events and being able to play key historical battles. ALSO this game has some pretty nifty mods and expansion packs available so although the story will end. It will take a bloody long time to get there so you can be sattisfied for hours on end. 
Personally i reccomend getting hold of the Kingdoms expansion and then downloading the Third Age Total War mod, because it is bloody epic!

54,7976123,english,"Put simply, Medieval II: Total War is, while not perfect, one of the best strategy games available for PC. Medieval 2 combines large-scale battles with an overarching grand strategy-esque campaign map. It's complete with a large number of factions, an evolving campaign map, diplomacy, and intrigue.


The campaign can best be described as Grand strategy lite (This isn't a knock on the game, as I'll explain). Expanding your state and managing your cities, economy, diplomacy, agents, family members and armies is an involving process and ultimatly more important than the battles themselves, but is also accesable enough for almost anyone to get into. If you have even glancing knowledge of games like Civilization, you will be able to jump right in with little trouble. The campaign (at most difficulties) thus comes off as well balanced, as its easy to get into but requires some serious time to master. 

Religion also plays a big part in the campaign, as Catholic factions have to deal with the tremendous power of the church and the pope, who can direct policy with almost every action he takes, and even call crusades and excommunicate factions. Islamic factions can call Jihads to rapidly conquer problem locations. Religion adds an interesting dynamic to the game, as a settlement bordering a nation of a different religion might start to experience unrest as competing ideologies debate in the streets. Religion gives an interesting interconnecting feeling to factions who, politically and millitarily might be at odds with one another but share the same faith, or might share competing faiths but similar goals. 

The large battles are likley to be what drives most people to try out the game though, and for good reason. They are absolutly massive and very entartaining to watch (though, up close, some of the animations can look a bit silly) and require skill to win. After building up forces on the campain map and moving them into position, 2 (or more armies) clash, zooming in the camera from the tactical campaign view to the ground to command the action. The map for the battle, however, is not pre made- it's generated from the terrain on the campaign map. Every building, farm, and mountain is present. When in battle you have to take into account unit type, terrain, exhaustion and even weather.

However, the battle map puts into sharp vision one of the games biggest problems: the AI. Its by no means an issue that makes the game unlpayable, but when the gods of randomness decide for the problem to rear its ugly head, it can be pretty unnerving. Sometimes in battle the AI can be outright genious, only to become completly idiotic in the next battle. On the Campaign map, factions sometimes will try to assault heavily guarded fortresses with armies composesed of 2 archers. Like I stated before, its not always the case, but its common enough for it to be a problem worth noting. 

However, the game is insanley moddable, which can fix the problem outright in itself. Have another problem with the game? think its not tolkein-esque enough? download the Third Age: Total War mod. Hate the AI or think the campain map is too small? (Which, spoiler alert: its pretty fucking huge to begin with) Download Stainless Steel. The moddability is another contributing factor to another huge plus in the games favor: Its almost infinite replayability. Outside of mods, no two campaigns will be the same.

In the end, this is a fantastic game that almost any fan of strategy will adore.

TL;DR: Buy it, its pretty fantastic.",1386545230,1386545794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False,76561198056765082,110,7,43482,0,17086.0,1592914484,,

I'm speaking from a strictly SP POV though. The game is pretty old now but it still looks quite nice with the settings turned up.

I've never been able to figure out diplomacy in this game so I always just end up making a lot of enemies and crushing them by brute force. I'm not sure if that's my play style or a flaw in the game's diplomacy system though.

The AI is decently intelligent both on the campaign map and on the battlefield.

I absolutely hate and despise naval battles in all TW games after this one. It's one of the main reasons I haven't been able to enjoy any newer TW titles. Naval battles in Medieval 2 are simple. You build a fleet and all battles are auto resolved. Easy, fast and out of the way so you can concentrate on the really fun stuff - land battles and expansion. I don't know if I'm alone in thinking that naval battles are trash and have ruined the newer TW games, but you definitely don't have to worry about that in this game.

There are a lot of factions you can play and they all have small differences but you can generalize all of them into 4 super factions that share a lot of similar traits and units: western Europe, eastern Europe, north Africa and middle east.

1,7745836,english,If you love the time period and liked Rome Total War then this game is for you.  I was not that happy with the game until I learned how to effectively charge knights. In Rome Total War you simply double clicked on what you wanted dead. In Medieval ll  you have to keep your formation in line before attacking. This is accomplished be judging the ground between you and the enemy unit you want to decimate.  When you are at a run with your knights and they are formed up in line hit the attack order (Double click).  Hitting them head on is a must (unless they are pike men then hit them from the back) spearmen don't stand a chance when a formed charge hits them. The diplomacy in  this game is involved and steeped in history. The different agents can help you do things like cement alliances with marriage or steal money from other nations with merchants.  The pope has impact on your decisions when you are a catholic nation. The crusades are very fun and a good mini quest which will help you groom princes to become better kings. The family tree adds a personnel touch which makes you actually care about your generals. The availability of mods also makes this a great game for instance if you get tired of the same old game then you can download something like Stainless steel mod which overhauls the entire game.,1385411553,1385411914,True,84,0,0.845945656299591064,3,True,False,False,76561198026329509,189,4,29783,172,11375.0,1601398834,,

3,175187,english,"Medieval II Total War is a good game, a fun game. But when put beside it's predecessors, it's also a very small game. I am not talking about size here, or even the scope of the game but more it's advancement over the previous installment. It's that same question you always have to ask yourself every time a franchise you enjoy comes out with a new installment.

Should I get the new one or just replay the old one? In the case of Medieval II the answer is, you might as well go play another campaign in Rome.

While Medieval by itself is a great game that promises hours of entertainment it doesn't really do anything that you couldn't already do in Rome. Most of the new features are minor in nature or simply cosmetic the lack of advancement is instantly noticeable when you realize that Medieval even managed to bring over a few bugs from Rome that were never quite fixed.

For the newcomers to the series, Medieval II Total War is a mix between a real time strategy game and a turn based grand strategy game. The turn based aspect focuses mainly on empire management, improving your cities, raising and moving armies and conducting diplomacy with other factions. This area has traditionally been the weak spot of Total War games and Medieval makes no changes there. The system is clunky and bugged, the AI is completely worthless and the diplomacy might as well not have been included. Anything the grand strategy aspect of Total War tries to do has already been done a thousand times better in pretty much every other grand strategy game.

But then again, you don't buy a Total War game for the cerebral strategy. You buy it for the guts and glory of the the real time battles where armies clash and legion perish all for the hope of victory and while the satisfaction you get from a successful maneuver is still present so is the complete lack of any sort of intelligence on the part of your opponents. As with all other Total War games, the AI is incapable of doing anything beyond the classic attack move with no concern for formation, flanking or skirmishing leading to almost every battle being a cakewalk unless you are terribly outnumbered.

Graphically the series still impress although the uniformity with your units is beginning to show, the sounds work well enough that you are never taken out of the action and the soundtrack is acceptable most of the time.

All in all Medieval II is a good and fun game that you can spend hundreds of hours in easily. Should you buy it still comes down to that same question however. If you have never played a Total War game I would always recommend you get the newest in the series. Medieval II is still an advancement over Rome, albeit a very minor one. If you already own Rome however then there is little new for you here and you would probably be better off saving your money for further down the line when another installment in the series comes along with a more profound leap in mechanics and technology.",1370121039,1385409516,True,11,0,0.632545888423919678,0,True,False,False,76561197964153663,2307,246,17346,0,10837.0,1415224660,,

24,549616,english,"My personal favorite in the Total War series. Medieval 2 gains a lot by being set in a time and place that is more or less easily recognizable to westerners. 

Assuming you start the game as the default English or French, you'll be mostly battling accross Europe with late game forays into northern Africa, western Russia, and the Middle East. Your units will, for the most part, also be familiar and easily understood. Even a casual student of medieval European history will understand why charging a spear wall with calvary is a bad idea, or why you don't use tight formations to advance into arrow or catapult fire. The game's medieval atmosphere is further boosted by a provocative musical score, accurate sound effects, and nation-themed voice dialogue. 

Gamplay in Medieval II, like any Total War game, is dividied between the strategic global campaign map and tactical maps where battles are played out. 

The strategic gameplay is solid, and players will be required to juggle tax income, religion, unrest, noble desires, and public health with the logistical demands of supporting your armies between battles. While the game lacks the research tech tree introduced in Empire, technology pacing is present through city building. As you build and upgrade your stables, archery ranges, and barracks you'll gain access to new troop types while smithies, jousting fields, and swordsmen guilds will enhance the equipment and quality of troops. 

Tactical gameplay is fantastic with players having strong control over formations, positioning, and abilities. Complexity is added in with morale and stamina mechanics, both of which are easily understood and implemented in a way that makes sense. 

The few faults that do exist in the tactical gameplay only emerge when directly comparing the game to more recent Total Wars, like Shogun 2 or Rome 2. Combat and unit cohesion in Medieval 2 can feel more rigid and unresponsive than its successors, but never enough to seriously impede gameplay.

The original games look horrifically primitive in comparison to the more modern ones, and the new ones have some weird limitations. I like  the eccentricities of this version, like if you're playing one of the Catholic factions you're subject to the whims of the AI pope. If you defy him, your king gets excommunicated leading to unruly towns and potential disaster. However, if you've trained a coterie of assassins on bandit leaders... well it's a completely different story. Then you can send these assassins to kill pope after pope and automatically get reconciled... I'm going straight to Hull. Or maybe just Grimsby. At least it's fun solo without the online Scunthorpes

Then there's all the guilds, and the two story ... well they're not twists exactly but when the Mongols and then the Timurids turn up in the East you had better be ready, and have very large amies guarding every bridge choke point in Asia Minor, plus gunpowder turrets on all your cities. Actually you're going to get spanked and spend quite a while pushing them back...

There is the element where a quick burst of conquest at the beginning sets you up wonderfully to steamroll your neighbours, but the faction balance plus the religious faction element makes it much more challenging

I think I have to try and win as the Russians & Byzantnes on the highest difficulty...
