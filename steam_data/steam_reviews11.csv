2018-04-06,0,0,456,False,Recommended,Overall this is a fun and family friendly game It could have some improvements however everygame could.. I think that the game is improving with the updates and in the future could become one of the best it features many different cars for different perferences and is one of the most competetive games i've partaken in recently.I think that the game is addictive (which is negative) however it features fully flexible game play and has great mechanics to the cars youre playing with The game is cross compatible with MOST consoles I have heared it's easier to play on controller because there is 360 degree turning capacity and on keyboard you are only offered 2 turning options.. Left and right. (a and d)Overall the game isn't pay to win and is cheap and great fun for the price you pay it features fun crates you can unbox with chances to win expensive items to make your car look way better and overall give a better playing experience.Personally I would recommend this game for all ages.,Rocket League®

A car soccer game and superior sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars.Reviewed on i5 3230 CPU 8GM RAMPlay it on 2GHZ dual core CPU Nvidia 8800 or ATI 2900 2GB HDDAlternatively Trackmania Sensible SoccerPrice 15 / $20Release date Out now Developer PsyonixPublisher PsyonixMultiplayer YesLet s not waste energy exploring why soccer should replace its paper chain of squalid billionaires with cars and accept it as fact. A fact which Rocket League proves with simple and immediate ease.I ve never played a game that needed a tutorial less. Association football soccer wendyball whatever you want to call it it s that but on wheels. Drive car at giant ball hit ball into net score points. Rocket League s competitive core has existed for centuries and this helps make a preposterous concept feel primal. This in turn is a laughable way of describing a game which would be called moto carball if it actually existed.Like dry martinis and scribbled in an unattended notebooks Rocket League is a celebration of simplicity. Driving is delicious. Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan but always feel under your control. You accumulate boost by driving over markers on the arena floor and unleash it is a thunderous rush that fires you across over and around the pitch. Because matches take place in smooth enclosed spaces you can drive up walls and across ceilings. Cars can also jump and dodge both of which can be used defensively and offensively. The weight of the cars as well as your ability to apply unruly boost to jumps adds a pleasingly haphazard element like athletic footballers leaping to header high balls but with less shirt pulling and zero chance of flattening a 2000 hairdo.Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan but always feel under your control.Vehicles feel light and buzzy somewhere between Micro Machines and those swift slidey remote controlled cars which only seem to appear on Christmas Day. This contrasts nicely with the fat beefy bounce of the ball which gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin. And that s it. I feel almost guilty reducing a review to ball and car but there are only ever those two things in the field of play and crucially they both feel great. It s helped by a crisp intuitive camera. You can focus on the ball effortlessly whizzing around with it always in view or switch to the standard camera very useful for rushing back to defend your goal or smashing into other vehicles. There are no weapons but certain markers fill your boost and let you obliterate other players. Mercifully it s the generous instantly respawning type of obliteration. Destruction is the only conspicuous deviation from clean business of driving around and scoring goals but in most of the games I played it was a rarity certainly never frequent enough to be irritating.Destroying other vehicles is one of many actions which accumulates points imagine Burnout but with awards for skill not speed. You receive points for things like clearing the ball from your goal line spectacular saves and overhead bicycle kicks named so because the more literal quadracycle wheel nudge is a senseless stew of words. Giving everything a points value means it s about more than scoring goals. The most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the the flanks crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.Except of course when it s not such as when you re duelling against a single opponent. Alternatively you can set teams of four against each other in matches which become so frantic that they re less like footy more like a lost confused beach ball bashed between bumper cars. Playlists of duels doubles standard 3v3 matches and the appropriately named Chaos 4v4 mode are all available online with ranked playlists limited to duels doubles and 3v3. There s a reason why online play is the first option on the menu Rocket League is designed to be played with actual people and this is absolutely where it thrives. My experience was marvellously robust. I rarely had to wait long for a game and if players dropped out mid session they were immediately replaced by AI bots. Best of all it s refreshingly simple to get back into another game so very little time is spent lingering in lobbies.If playing online isn t your thing there are exhibition matches and full seasons you can solo. The length and difficulty can be altered and while it doesn t offer much in the way of depth cars and football remember? I still found myself bonding with pretend teammates. Whether online or offline playing games randomly unlocks new cars and upgrades. These range from simple things like fresh coats of paint and shiny wheels to pointy hats for your wizardmobile. Upgrades are purely cosmetic but volume variety and the promise of driving around with bubbles frothing from your exhaust should be enough to keep you coming back.The offline modes do reveal the game s minor inadequacies however team AI can be flaccid and unreliable especially against tougher opponents and the same simplicity which makes Rocket League immediately playable can cause things to get repetitive when played alone a criticism that only becomes apparent precisely because it s so damn addictive. It s a simple thing done brilliantly well kept interesting by the thrill of competition.,Rocket League®

2018-04-04,0,0,179,False,Recommended,What I liked about this game Great in' game dude multiplayer fun and fast paced action. Maps don't matter since they're all the same and building skill in this game is not too hard since there are always new players to grow with. Matchmaking has it's flaws but it does it's job right. Everyone has a role they have to fill out as this is a team based game. Rarely any toxic players in my experience. What I think this game can improve on A few glitches but out of all the hours I've played I've only seen one that hurt my gameplay my HUD just dissapeared out of nowhere other than that everything's alright. Most of the problems I have are with players since a lot of them are ball hogs who just run for the ball and think that just hitting it would make them win players who leave before they lose as well. Ah well no games are safe from these kinds of people. Overall Fun if you have friends. It's pretty okay without friends as well just hope you get matched with the good parts of the community. 10/10 Footnotes 05.08.18 As of lately the servers feel like constant lag and all that stuff. Nothing too bad but can get extremely annoying at times.,Rocket League®

It's cross platform meaning you can play with the 3 main consoles (as of now).It's actually more in depth than meets the eye with a thriving community not to mentio the devs are EXTREMELY active updating it on a regular basis and pushing out various events here and there. I myself got it on a steam sale but I highly reccomend it as it will grow on you and you will sink some hours into the game.(as a little extra the achievements are pretty neat too!),Rocket League®

2018-06-14,0,0,201,False,Recommended,I've been playing this game off and on for years and I can say that it's awesome. I convinced a few of my buddies to pick the game up when it first came out and honestly it was some of the most fun I've ever had with a video game messing around with them in custom games. Years later now I still play the ranked mode with one of them and we still love it. This comes from the games easy to learn but HARD to master mechanics that are overall extremely solid. I have about 200 hours now and it feels amazing controlling my car though I still have a lot to master. There is lots of capacity for hilarious and silly things to happen for beginners and awesome stunts to pull off for experienced players. The music is perfect and pairs well with the bright and colorful art style of the game which is beautiful and makes customizing your car and making it your own very satisfying because there are so many options. Frequent updates and content additions top it off as a great example of how to be a great developer. An absolutley awesome value for $20 and I can recommend this game to literally anyone.,Rocket League®

The graphics are great Psyonix clearly cares for the game and it's really addicting.The only downside in my opinion are the toxic people (compared to other multiplayer games people are actually really nice here). Also I wish you could be able to get more items by just playing for long enough instead of paying for crates and keys. The servers can also be laggy sometimes but it honestly happens rarely.In conclusion this game is definitely worth its price.,Rocket League®

2015-12-03,0,0,120,False,Recommended,This game is ridiculously addicting. I've lost plenty of sleep playing it. It's the perfect game if you want to just pick it up and play for 5 10 minutes or for the whole night. The choice of being able to play with random players AI or with friends makes the game play interesting in many ways. This game is great to play with a keyboard or a controller. I highly recommend you to use a controller due to the fine control ability but if you use a keyboard that doesn't mean you are useless in the game.One downside of the game is the 8 person max to a party. I wish you could have more than 8 people to join a party. 8 people play and the rest spectates. This is pretty much my only gripe with the game. But overall it's nearly a perfect game for me in my eyes and I highly recommend it.,Rocket League®

I love how my cars looks and how bright and vibrant the game can be gameplay is fair simple and easy to learn/ master after a few games if anyone new is reading this just keep playing your skill will increase as you go obviously. I'm usually diamond but i can never keep my rank because I don't have a mic and use text chat. which leads to me getting BANNED because the community is filled with people who honestly don't know what a god damn swear word is. I swear towards my teammate who is my friend(I never play with randoms unless I'm warming up) then the next day I play it says I have been BANNED for OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE??? I don't understand how having a good time with your friend offends others. maybe I should just use team chat and not share my excitement. the reporting system in this game is too strict and doesn't make it fun for me whatsoever. I don't even think I deserve to be banned this many times (about my 97th time so far) just for this very specific reason. I would recommend this game if you're into winning LMAO only because this game had probably one of the most satisfying feeling once than and even better feeling when you win. but once again if you swear a lot in text chat let this be a warning to you. stop swearing. you'll thank me later since all the nine year olds who play this think your swears are as equivalent to them getting punched in the face by their parent or whatever. k pce,Rocket League®

2015-12-04,0,0,210,False,Recommended,"This game is the game. Let's start with the review.So why is Rocket League good? Is it good because it's about cars and soccer?No I mean yes but we'll get there. The game is about winning matche and ""get competitive"" against other players.But that's not all about it. You choose a car from the beginning (well you'll have some cars already unlocked) and that car will be pretty basic at the start of the game and when you'll start getting points and advancing levels you'll start to have more customizable options about the car for example you can put an hat that you unlocked on it and stuff like that.With those ideas in mind you'll dive into your first match of Rocket League what to expect?You won't be scoring many goals in the beginning and you aren't going to make such a difference in your team (like me for example) but as you start playing more and more you'll get the feel for the game and you'll play the game better day by day. After you played for like one week with your keyboard I hope you've already switched to a controller because playing with it it's much smoother. You'll start doing aerials (these are what flying goals are called) goals in every way possible and then you will feel like a pro.Then you will do ranked and you will win those matches and you'll feel happy. You'll have the funniest moments in your life with this trust me it's a gem!",Rocket League®

Only reason is because it always lags on Neo Tokyo and Sandy Shores no matter what computer you have imo. And also I get demoted on Competitive after I won a few.

2015-12-08,0,0,344,False,Not Recommended,Great game easy to learn hard to master. It's simple fun but the player community is horrible. Players constantly leave game at the first enemy score even if it's in the first couple seconds. Very few teams work together. Most will shove a teammate out of the way just to hit the ball in a random direction! And the team who keeps a goalie is usually the team that wins. UPDATE Don't connect to cross platform play. The PS.net community is nothing but bots running 2+ 'players' of the same name doing nothing. But once you lose the PS.net network there aren't enough PC players so you wait 10min for a single game.In other words Rocket League is dead.,Rocket League®

2015-12-15,0,0,332,False,Recommended,Rocket League is exactly what it sounds like... mostly. League! Sports! Rocket! Fast! It's fun. Good fast and enjoyable.Plethora of modes available (1v1 2v2 3v3 'Chaos' 4v4 and ranked variants of the first 3 formats IN ADDITION to some rotated 'special' playlists) a whole lot of customisation (purely aesthetic though some cars have larger/smaller hitboxes and varying turning circles).It's a pretty game and beautiful in its simplicity. Hit the ball don't let the ball get hit into your goal and try and be a nuisance to the other team in either a defensive or offensive capacity.There is a chat system in game voice and text with a variety of pre written responses but PC cannot communicate with PS4 players (outside of the aforementioned preset phrases) and as a result this produces some of the most sarcastic trash talk you will see. Botch a save? Be prepared for a spam of 'What a save!'.Rocket League is in a nutshell 'wtf how did that work' the videogame. Thoroughly recommended. Great with friends great solo. Controller is strongly recommended though it is playable with a mouse and keyboard.,Rocket League®

2017-11-27,0,0,44,False,Recommended,I like this game because it is like football but with cars and there are no throwings free kicks or penalties so you can move the ball anywhere you want and foul any opposing player and sometimes make them have to respawn. While I was playing only with my cousin who has a much bigger play time on this game than me he suggested Rumble mode which is a mode with weapons to use a bit like in Mario Kart which makes it even more fun to foul other players. This Rumble mode of Rocket League has since become my favourite mode of the game and I continue to play it with my cousin whenever I play online with him. If you like Mario Kart or any similar game to it I think you should also try this mode out too.,Rocket League®

2018-03-27,0,0,45,False,Recommended,I have played this game for some hours now and i have to say it is very much what you would expect from the game just by reading or looking at trailers. Although it might seem like a game you would play for a couple of hours and then find it repedetive and it might be for some people but honestly im not bored of it and it might be the same thing but there is many things that are challenging to both learn and discover. Some things could be annoying at the biggining but its easy to learn.When i started out and played it for the first time i played with a keyboard and mouse and it is very difficult and takes alot of practice. Personally i use a controller and it is easier to play and manuever the car aswell.If you really want to get in to the game and play it farely well in the beggining i would recommend using a controller to 100%There are some things that could be added for example a race game mode or a mode without a ball or a puck.I really recommend the game and price whise it is a good price for the content youre getting.,Rocket League®

2018-04-30,0,0,10,False,Recommended,What can you say about this game that has not been said before? Rocket League is probably one of the most fun multiplayer games in existence. It's football / soccer with cars. IT'S AMAZING.On my main Account I have played Rocket League for over 500 hours. Including time on my console I probably have about 580 600 hours of total playtime. I love this game and I can only recommend it to anyone who still hasn't bought it.,Rocket League®
2018-04-30,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Well I would say that Rocket league is one of the best games I personaly have played it takes the great parts of a sports game and the great parts of a racing game and makes a hole new game. I waited untill the game was on sale to buy it Rocket League is usally 20.00 dollars but it goes on sale a lot and it s price can go down to 10.00 dollars.In all I think that Rocket League is great to play with or without friends of course if you play with people you know then you can win more because you talk to each other useing things like discord sky and the in game chat.,Rocket League®

2018-01-11,0,0,522,False,Recommended,When it first launched I wasn't really interested because the game looked simple. I bought it on a whim because of the good reviews. Rocket league is bar World of Warcraft probably one of the game's I have gotten the most enjoyment out of.The concept is simple but the skill ceiling is astronomical. However the (ranked) matchmaking is spot on in 9 out of 10 games giving you ample room to grow at your own pace.Controller is definitely recommended but me (controller) and my 2v2 partner (mouse &amp keyboard) play about the same skill level. Controller definitely gives you an edge in the air tough.Latency is rarely if ever an issue and matchmaking is fast.,Rocket League®

2017-04-01,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,"In my opinion this game is fun.But when it comes to the competetive games it is really bad.What I don't like in this competitive system is that they always have to reset your rank for a new season. I don't care about my rank by the way I just want to have some FUN. And I can only have fun when I play with/against people that are my skill level. Not to easy and not to hard.I think that a good competetive system helps you to play against players in your skill level in order for you to get better step by step.But when they reset the ranks all the time you most likely you see a guy who has these champion wheels equipped and you prospect/challenger scrub just think yourself ""well GG I will lose that one too"" and then he will just wreck your team 7 1.This disorders everyplayers rank with their own skill level and you will never have players everytime in your skill level for you to be better and have the most fun.And after months when it slowly starts to be in order again they just start reseting it again just to give you a new fancy decal or some other crap.I really disagree that they always have to reset your rank for a new season and I hope that they stop doing that in order to be a better competetive system that helps you to get better and have the most fun.",Rocket League®
2017-10-07,0,0,195,False,Recommended,Yo ok so here's the scoopWhen I was... 12 13 I played this game a garbage ton on my PS4 along with some other games but I played this game the most. I was really good at this game but then my PS4 membership ran out and I couldn't get a new one so I stopped playing. It wasn't til recently that I got it on PC and started playing it again but it wasn't as fun anymore so once again I didn't play it and instead I played Overwatch. I loved Overwatch so much but my friends stopped playing it and started playing Rocket League. I eventually stopped playing Overwatch for some time and wanted to give Rocket League a try again. When I started playing again I was trash and I didn't want to play but I kept going and now I'm slowly getting better! I love Rocket League now and it's honestly so fun to mess around with my friends and rek sum scruba dub lords. I find myself playing Rocket League a lot more than I do most of my games so this is a game I highly recommend playing!,Rocket League®

2018-07-27,0,0,68,False,Recommended,Some of the most high velocity gameplay with a very comepitive scene. Beautiful in game audio and very cool soundtrack. The crowd will react to the play on the field perfectly. Game is very well optimized and runs very well. Has a large skill gap but also very fun to play casually with friends! The ranking system is not bad better than most. The controls are very accurate and perfectly responsive. Allows you to be very creative and I would highly recommend using the steam workshop to download some very creative game modes and maps. In conclusion I see it to be quite close to a masterpiece. 9/10,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,766,False,Recommended,General Rating E (Everyone)Price $19.99Genre Sports/CompetitiveTime Played 520 hours (PC) 500 to 1000 (PS4)This game is soccer with rocket cars. You can drive on the ceiling and walls. The whole point is to get the ball into the other teams goal by any means necessary. This can be done in single player vs A.I. bots local multiplayer with friends/enemies or online multiplayer. Gameplay 10 Rocket League is a competitive sports game. Your team versus another team the team can be 1 to 4 players. Matches are 5 minutes long though you can change it in the Mutator settings to make the match last up to 10 minutes. The game is easy to start playing and with only 5 minute matches it s easy to play a few games if you don t have much time.There s a training menu to teach the basics and customized training that other players or the people from Rocket League have created that will help with the advanced mechanics.You can unlock a plethora of accessories and items for your cars. None affect gameplay they just let you customize your car. There are crates that cost money to open. However there is an option to trade for items you want as well. Story N/AThere s not a story you can play a season mode and take your team to victory against A.I. bots. The game doesn t need a story. Graphics 9 Not a complex game at first glance but the graphics are pretty solid. When you demo another car you can see the smoke and explosion from that. The various trails goal explosions rocket boosts and accessories for your cars are a nice treat to allow customization to your vehicles. Cinematics N/ANone. Controls 9(Controller)You have the option of playing with keyboard and mouse or controller. I used the controller because it felt more natural any of the keys can be remapped to allow more control. In the options menu you can change various settings that affect the camera the vibration and the controller deadzone and sensitivity. I played with the default settings and haven t changed them as of yet. I tried the controls on keyboard once. I wouldn t recommend it. Replayability/Repeatability 9With matches only taking 5 minutes you re able to play games pretty often. Only have a few minutes? You could get in 1 or 2 matches easily. Online play can take a few moments longer depending on what you re playing and how many people are online playing that specific type of match. Music 8.5Most of the music is electronic/dubstep it s not bad and due to playing the game so much i ve started listening to more dubstep. However this is just the menu music. In game usually there isn t much music besides the cheering of the crowds and the sound of the various rocket boosts as people speed towards the ball. There s several tracks in the game but you won t spent too much time in the menu unless you re customizing your car in the garage. Edit There s now an option to listen to the music while playing the game. Which I ve turned on and love. Difficulty ???Difficulty is hard to judge in this game. When starting out the A.I. on easy might seem difficult to you but if you put them on Pro or Unfair things can get a little hairy. After a time the bots seem rather stupid and unable to challenge you. Move on to the online multiplayer in the causal mode you ll play against people from all the various rankings. In the league/ranked mode you ll be matched up against people who are close to your skill level well sometimes.Driving the car isn t difficult but knowing how much speed to use and the angle to score can take a bit to get used to boosting around at full speed isn t always the answer. Then there s also the various game modes that present their own challenges. Solo Duel is different than playing Doubles which are both different from playing the Standard 3v3. And Chaos 4v4 forget it. Then there s some of the mechanics like the Aerial and shooting from the walls or ceilings. The game doesn t really pace those or introduce them. There are training exercises and they have added in the ability for people to create their own training exercises. I haven t tried any of them so I can t say one way or another if they are any good. Multiplayer 7.5The multiplayer is either local or online play. All modes are available on or offline although I think some of the rocket labs stuff has to be played online. Like any competitive game you ve got toxic players you also have friendly players. With the quick chat features people can easily spam various phrases sometimes sarcastic sometimes not. There is an option to disable chats from anyone and voice chat or to disable just the other team. This is a helpful feature as the community can be pretty toxic especially if you mess up something someone else considers easy . Very few people (in my experience) offer help or advice for newer players. Mostly derogatory comments about the play or lack of a play. Note this was mostly in Casual play. While playing the ranked matches there was still some hate/derision there but usually not as much. Now with that being said the only place to really challenge yourself is in online multiplayer. Yes you ll meet some toxic people but again it s just part of online gaming. Ignore the haters learn what you can and practice practice practice. Soma Says Frustration.. How the hell are people getting these aerial goals? How are they so much faster than me what am I doing wrong? Skip forward a year. Hate mail coming in after each match. People get very angry when losing. There is nothing quite like hitting Platinum at the end of your 10 ranking matches! Such a great feeling. However I ended at Gold 3 and didn t get the Platinum rewards. (I definitely recommend this game. Just remember no one is great the first time they play. It takes lots and lots of practice.,Rocket League®

2015-08-27,0,0,47,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the perfect multiplayer game. Regardless of which platform you play it on it's fantastic. I picked it up for free on my PS4 but decided to buy it at full price on Steam when my brother did. I have to play with the graphics on their lowest settings and even though it looks like a silly cartoon version compared to normal it still plays extremely well.Using a controller is the easiest way to play though that's simply my opinion. It definitely takes some practice to understand how your vehicle moves and teamwork is a huge aspect of the game if you're in it to win it. Still it's very possible to have a good time in online games by yourself whether you're playing 1v1 or team games.Overall it plays well the controls make sense and you'll find yourself occasionally cheering as a teammate gets that goal or makes that epic save.10/10 better than FIFA!,Rocket League®

2018-05-04,0,0,1186,False,Recommended,I try to be briefly.Past three month I searched for all kind of coop split screen games to play it with my gf. Probably checked several hundred games. She was not a gamer so I had to find something catchy. And as you probably noticed I said she WAS not a gamer. Once we tried this game I knew that this car rocket race soccer flying game gonna kill bunch of hours from our lives. What can I say #no regret.The best way to describe the game easy to learn hard to master. And that sum ups everything you need to know before buying the game. It's easy to jump in the game and start enjoying it from the very beginning. When time goes by you will see that your skills are getting better and better. Even after few hours of gameplay you will notice how lame you were at the beginning. But then you will go to Youtube and watch some pros playing. And only then you will understand how lame you are. And probably that's why this game drives so much (pun intended). The endless possibilities of improving.Wow I could go more and more. But there is no time for long reviews when the game is waiting for me. To put it simply it's the most competitive balanced game I've ever played. And especially if you have friends to play with (on PS Xbox or PC) this is the game. Trust me I'm a doctor.,Rocket League®

Graphics 9Though a arcade like game the graphics are pretty nice and gloomy.The paint glistens and the grass looks realisticSound 9From ball sounds to the boom! that you hear when you blow up your advesary Sound seems well polished along with a pretty decent soundtrackGameplay 9Blowing up foes and barrel roll goals feel so rewarding and addictive. Realistic ball physics help set up amazing shots. Difficult at times but never to the point where you want to quit. Such a rewarding gameOverall 9 You'll get on for a few games and end up playing for hours on end. A great game to play with friends or alone. From friendly games against/with friends to fun ranked play. Rocket league is a must add to any steam owners game list. I mean combining soccer and RC cars? What a genius idea for a game right!?,Rocket League®

2017-10-27,0,0,298,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a very good game especially with friends on LAN or online.What's Rocket League? It very simple you toss in your blender a bunch of toy cars and a soccer ball and you turn it ON!So yes you will play soccer while driving your favorite car and make it fly jump and even power attack to score the winning goal!!You can play symetric or asymetric games from 1v1 to the crazy 4v4.The graphics are really nice and even if in game it is not your priority you will love them since they are back up by the fact that you can custom your car.Custom your car like a kind of GTA V or Need for Speed (Underground) gives a unlimited lifetime to the game with the crates the loots and the trade system.It has multiple levels of skills required to reach the top in the competitive league.I'm not a talented player (I'm a small Silver ranked and I don't play that much!)The only downside of Rocket League is probably the frustration it can create if you play in competitive league and you have a ""ok connection"". I play few games (L4D2 GR WildLands GTA V...) and I have to admit it Rocket League is the less forgiving with your connection especially wifi. Be wired with fiber optic if you want to reach the top of the competitive league!!Bottom line GO GET IT! It will be fun it will be hard it will be trilling! JUST GO GET IT!",Rocket League®

Explosions and flying cars and everyone is trying to push the sacred enormous pokeball into the force field to watch it explode. The gameplay is balanced.The mechanics is great the control is smooth even on keyboard and mouse and the graphic is amazing.A situational game 3v3 4v4 objective is to score the most goals.What i love the most about this game? Oh boy the skins you can change the color spray some art change the wheels design place some hats hang some flags. Personalize your vehicle I expect the DEV to create more skins! What can be improved?5v5? Bigger map maybe? Unfortunately the lag is something I cannot stand everyone is suddenly teleporting ball goes missing lose position. I understand it happens with online game but it is too often for me. Maybe it is my location I am in South East Asia Singapore and maybe if they fix their servers I will definitely buy their game.The big question!It is worth it to buy this game?

But the game is not necessarily competitive anyone can pick it up and enjoy it casually for hours. Sadly a controller is almost mandatory to play for newcomers but some long time players also manage/are better with a keyboard. So I highly recommend picking up a controller for this title and I am sure you won't regret your purchase!,Rocket League®
2017-05-13,0,0,1506,False,Recommended,Even though there are a few problems with the game (main ones being the servers and the community) I find myself playing this game for hours each day. The thing I like most about this game is that Psyonix (the game's creator) has taken an idea so simple and has made it so great. In this game you can do almost anything given enough time. Tired of just hitting the ball into the goal? Try something like dribbling aerials etc. There's so many things you can do in this game! At the start it may be hard to get a grasp of but once you get the hang of it you most likely won't let go. This game is one of the most fun games that i've ever played and hopefully it will be one of yours too.,Rocket League®

I become two PS Players who were Veteran and Expert (I am Master) and have to play against a team of PC Players who were Legend Legend and Master or (only with luck) Expert.But so with all Rocket League is a nice game.

2018-05-10,0,0,45,False,Recommended,There's no reason to not own this game. It's a good game to jump into when you're not feeling anything else. You don't need to own any special cars (although some may have d ifferent hitboxes) to be good at the game. I haven't figured out how to fly around like the pros but I can still score some good points. It's an active game meaning it's easy to find matches. The only issue I have is that some of the players will drop early on a game if they think they're losing. Otherwise this is a solid game that will go well in anyone's steam library.,Rocket League®

2017-05-06,0,0,776,False,Recommended,First of all... I LOVE this game.I started playing when you could download it for free on the Playstation 4. I immediately fell in love with this game. I had about a thousand or so hours on it on Playstation 4 before I started playing on PC. If you like football and you like cars start playing Rocket League. Psyonix is one of the smaller companies but sure has grown a lot in the last couple of years due to the amazing work they put into this game. As a player in this game you can constantly improve. People keep on coming up with new methods to use. Rocket League is definetely one of those games where you get better by practicing A LOT. If you put the time into practicing you will definetely see a difference in your gameplay and your overall skill. Sure Rocket League has its flaws but what game doesn't? I admit I don't really like the ranking system in this game. But its doable for me. And thats just my opinion ofcourse. Rocket League is only 20 I find this perfect since thats all you have to pay for. Sure you can buy keys cars and crates (Christmas crates Halloween crates) using real life money. But you don't need those to properly play this game. So its a one time purchase.Also I do recommend to play this game with a controller. I have used keyboard and abselutely suck with it. I hate the controls and if I change them I still don't like the way keyboard and mouse work on Rocket League. One of the main reasons is I played on PS4 for a long time so I am used to a controller. But this is just my personal opinion ofcourse if you like playing with mouse and keyboard im not saying you shouldnt do it. I just think its easier with a controller.Overall I think Rocket League is an AMAZING game and I recommend it to everyone!,Rocket League®

The latest update convinced me that this game is not for me anymore since the physics seem to be completely broken. I have a really good internet connection (ping is about 20 30ms) and somehow I manage to go through the ball many times in a row. Asked my teammates if they were seeing the same thing on their screens and they were (tl dr everyone in 3 different games saw me go through the ball whilst trying to hit it multiple times).I would give this game a 8/10 Great would be perfect if it actually had updates that mean something other than just adding a new crate or fixing 2 3 bugs.",Rocket League®

2017-09-07,0,0,2243,False,Recommended,Honestly this game deserves 5 stars but it's point system is terrible. It doesn't accurately describe how a person is doing. Like if you give your team mate an open net shot but you had to dribble two people to pass to them they get 110 points 100 for scoring 10 for a shot and then you get 50 points for assist and sometimes 20 points for centering. It either needs to be broadcasted to people that the point system doesn't exactly determine skill or the point system has to be reworked. But the gameplay in the game is great I have like 1000 games in (most of my time is because i left it on for weeks on end on vacations or something) and my only problem is people being too egotistical but that happens in any game once you hit a certain point,Rocket League®

2018-09-04,0,0,369,False,Recommended,I honestly love this game it's a great way to be a to your friends and (hopefully) not loose the friendship because of it. Crates don't completely scam you so you get actually decent stuff in the crates. The Learning Curve of this game is really steep and you'll always be learning new things to improve but the beginning curve is steep. If you played SARPBC then you should be fine. Its a beautiful game with graphics that even on the lowest settings still make it look decent and it doesn't lag. It's really hard to get decals and such at first but I think that with the Rocket Pass that comes out tomorrow (which btw I'm so excited for) that it will fix that problem and allow some of the newer players who can't buy keys and such to get someone decent decals with the Dycrptors. Overall the game is amazing and if you're starting out I'd buy a Rocket League tutor to help you out.,Rocket League®

Play two on two or three vs three. You have a vehicle and you basically play soccer but with cars. It's a fun game with newly added game modes and a competitive mode which shows your rank and skills. You can customize your favorite car with new wheels paint job turbo colors and a lot more!!!

I'm a bit disappointed with the introduction of the crates (Do not buy them they are a waste of money!) but I can look past those and still call this an amazing game.

Makes single player unplayable sometimes as there is nothing more frustrating. But besides this definitely buy especially if on sale. With multiplayer and the different modes like hockey or basketball or Dropshot (my favorite) it will be an easy game to keep returing to.

Rocket League is one of the best games on the steam market to this day.Now I could go on for hours and hours and hours about how great the game is but instead I m just going to simply explain that this game is beautiful and will never get boring no matter how much you play. That s the thing about Rocket League. At this point I ve logged about 105 hours and I still haven t gotten bored of this game. I constantly play online with friends or in offline season mode which is a great addition to the game. And if you get really bored of the gameplay mechanics (which you shouldn t) consider making your own gamemode under the exhibition tab. This game is great and overall I would rate it 10/10 just like a hundred thousand other people would.,Rocket League®

2015-08-11,0,0,50,False,Recommended,Short review +Simple satisfying and hard to master gameplay+Great artstyle and graphics+Amazing community+Original concept+Supports cross platform and 4 player splitscreen+Competititve capabilities Hard for players with lesser computers to play multiplayer matchesLong review This game is great to start off. I love the kinda futuristic artstyle great performance and extremely satisfying gameplay. The concept is great and a fresh look on multiplayer sports type games. One of my favorite things about Rocket League was the fact that it was really easy to pick up but took time to master. I do not like it when games seem somewhat intimidating to players by throwing a bunch of mechanics options and gameplay elements around to the point where you have no idea what to do when you start out. You can also customize your car in this game and I think other games should take notes the customization in this game is phenominal. There is none of that customization DLC t you unlock everything just by playing the game. You earn one customization item per round to be specific. However even after say 100 hours you will still not have everything unlocked as there are just so many items to get. I would like to see the devs add a trading system to trade items I think that would be cool.The community is great. Unlike a lot of games with competitive capabilities you never see anyone harassing you for not being perfect at the game. There is a massive amount of people who love to play the game both casually and competitively. Rocket League also supports cross platform gameplay so say goodbye to not being able to find a match. Plus 4 player splitscreen. I did have a couple of issues though. The game has a system where if you do not load into a match in under somewhere around 15 seconds you were automatically timed out. This isolates a lot of people who do not have as powerful of computers. Also the game is pretty much exactly the same as its predecessor SARPBC. They really should have called this a remaster not a sequel.EDIT Wow. The day I write this review and say there is no DLC customizations they add some.,Rocket League®

2018-07-06,0,0,19,False,Recommended,I do not like games about sports. I do not like games about cars. I love this game.If you look and see I don't have many hours on this game it's because I hardly played it up until now. I recieved it as a gift from a friend and I thought I wouldn't like it a whole lote because it is about sports. I played a match got off and never touched it again. Until now. I got back on to play with the same friend a couple days ago and I have been much more active now. It has quickly become one of my favorite games even though I have many more hours in G Mod or Terraria and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.Although this has been mostly an opinion so far. I should actually tell you about the game in case you are choosing whether or not to buy it. Let's go over the positives first. There is plenty of customization from the paint on your car to the explosion that happens when you make a goal. Oh yeah by the way when you make a goal there is an explosion. The default controls are good and you can really feel the movement of your vehicle. There are lots of different modes to choose from and you can trade items with your friends! Don't like your hat but your friend doesn't like theirs either? Trade the hats/antenna/literally anything. You can also turn in 5 of the common items you have earned to get a better rarer item. You receive an item after every match. (Or at least I think you do.) The music is great. The menus are easy to navigate. The graphics are good. There are lots of cars. There are lots of maps. Lots and lots of good things!But there are also bad things. Sometimes you get connection issues. People are toxic pretty often and will often try to steal your goal (Not all the time though.) This next part is usually an honest mistake but people tend to hit it in to their own goal often. Great when the enemies do it. Not so much when your team does it. Rare items are rare therefore hard to find unless of course you spend money on keys for crates and buy yourself some shiny exotic items. Items do not help you play however they just give you bragging rights to having the coolest car.That is basically it. Great game. You don't have to like sports or cars to like this game. Go buy it and have some fun! ),Rocket League®

For as long as I played this game now i haven't found a single bug. The graphics are not too bad just all looking totally fine. The price $20 not too expencive and totally worth it. Really.

We ve rolled out our free Rumble update www.rocketleaguegame.com released Rocket League on Mac and SteamOS introduced a brand new Crates and Keys system and taken additional steps to ensure that you get the best possible experience on all supported platforms.It s with those new features and added content in mind that we ve decided to post these updated player behavior guidelines and our policies surrounding them NO HARASSMENT TROLLING OR OTHER JERK BEHAVIORWe don t like toxic players and neither does our community. If someone out there targets you with abusive language makes threats or does any of the other bad things we ve listed in our EULA www.rocketleaguegame.com or Terms of Service www.rocketleaguegame.com then it s a bannable offense. We aren t going to ban someone for using a Quick Chat sarcastically but using racist sexist or otherwise hateful language is grounds for a ban.To help us ensure that disruptive players are dealt with appropriately please remember to use our Mute/ Report Player feature that allows you to block communications from someone who is bothering you and/ or report them to our team. We revised the in game UI so that player bans are more obvious to the individuals receiving them in the Rumble update. We believe that this small but important change will serve as a more effective deterrent going forward.SELLING IN GAME ITEMS IS NOT PERMITTEDNow that Crates and Keys are out in the wild many of you have been spending a lot of time trading with your friends. Trading is a fantastic way to complete collections in Rocket League be it for Toppers Antennas or Decals but it s important to remember the rules that come along with it.Outside trading puts you at risk for scams and other illegal activity which is why trying to sell in game items outside of Rocket League is against our EULA www.rocketleaguegame.com or TOS www.rocketleaguegame.com . More specifically Crates Keys and other in game items may only be traded for other in game items Crates or Keys to ensure a safer and healthier ecosystemOUR BANNING POLICYEncouraging a healthy environment in Rocket League comes with enforcing our aforementioned player bans. If you re reporting another player in game you can select from among these categories Verbal Text Harassment (which includes offensive language flooding etc.)Unsportsmanlike conduct (which includes intentional disruption of the game AFK ers. etc.)Cheating (which includes smurfing opponent collusion etc.)Psyonix has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to harassment of any kind and we will ban reported offenders at our discretion. The length of player bans for any valid reason is also at our discretion and could include permanent bans if appropriate. Furthermore the more often you are banned the longer each subsequent ban will be including an eventual permanent ban.With the addition of our new Crates and Keys system it should also be noted that Crate Farming (i.e. players who join matches with no intention of playing with teammates) is not allowed because it takes away from both the flow and the action of a game. If you see someone crate farming during a match please report them under the Unsportsmanlike Conduct category and we ll take it from there.FRIENDLY REMINDERLast but not least? Be nice everyone! Rocket League is a game that brings people together from all over the world. We want our game to be a fantastic and healthy experience for everyone who enters a stadium regardless of their skill rank or experience. The nicer we are the more fun our community can have and having fun is what s all about!on my 6th 24 hour ban!!! fku!!!!,Rocket League®

2017-08-05,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,"What can one say about Rocket League?It s all fun and entertaining in the Free Games when you play with your friends and stuff.The mechanics are at the beginning new and you have to learn how to handle them. And nonetheless you will make mistakes or just dont know the right action to bump the ball out of the danger zone.And here beginns the problem with Rocket League &gt its ing toxic in the competitive games through all leagues when you make a mistake or something is against the believing of a other.There is a steady flow of insults threats and other really unwelcoming things. There are rarely players who stepp in against this written abuse of others not to think about that RL would do something against. The best thing would to be to block all non standardised communication. Sadly there are also rarely player who enjoy the competition and appreciate the fun factor behind no you have to verbally smash your enemies or teammates.Competitive is a mode which should be fun but sometimes its unbearabe and therefore is a huge part of the game ""bad"" so no recommendation for the whole game.

I introduced this to my friend a couple months after release and he has been addicted ever since. It's quite ridiculous really. This game is literally tearing him apart he is actually dying on the inside. You do not understand the amount of anguish this has caused him. He has become more ""toxic"" and easily ""tilted"". The toxicity has gotten to the point where he was banned for 24 hours for ""language"". He has come to the point where he believes Psyonix itself is out for him. I've never seen such mental anguish appear due to ""car soccer"". I once joined the discord call to see three thousand gg's in the discord chat and a very worrying suicide message. I have been in the call for the whole progression of my friend's ""experience"" and can say that this only got worse the closer he got to Grand Champion. Some games have caused him to question his existence and others have left him so angery the Hulk himself would be scared.If you truly want to play for fun like a game should be then get it.

They only problem I see is that the servers turn to absolute rubbsih at peak times during the week you will most likely not be able to find a smooth game Monday through Friday from about 3pm to 10pm. However this game is not what you think it is. It is played off as being a competitive fun game it is evertything but that. If you are playing with friends then you are good but competitive might as well be a roll of a dice to decide if you win the game. My advice is either buy the game knowing that 50% is up to luck either your side or the oponents or play just with friends and not any compeitive game modes because they are truely a 100% waste of time. I cant stress enough why they should take the word ""competitive"" out of the ""competitive playlist"" because it is honestly just who ever can hit the ball second.",Rocket League®

I like the fact that new content is regularly added witout change.This game is also great for the fact that it does split scren multiplayer very well along with good online play.

2017-12-30,0,0,107,False,Recommended,I got this game in the Summer and have a lot to say about it. So my friend had been telling me how good it was and all that. One day after my birthday I used a steam gift card to buy it. I played it for five hours with my brother and friend and I loved it. After a while I got bored of it and started to regret I got it. But one day I got on on and loved it again. I garrentee (don't care about the mistake) this will happen to you if you dont like the game. But if you get to the part where you are decent you will make no mistake play every day. If you really like it get it whith a friend it improves the expierence.,Rocket League®

2017-12-30,0,0,152,False,Recommended,Very good game!I see it as a game just for entertainment but it can also be a game where you test your skills. Starting off the game is very easy to learn but extremely hard to master. I would love if they merged their trading with steam instead of having an ingame trading system. I also recommend you using a controller. While it's not a big deal to use keyboard and mouse it is definitely easier and better to use a control even if you usually don't.,Rocket League®
2017-12-23,0,0,35,False,Recommended,I was looking for a fun multiplayer game at winter sale and i decided to buy Rocket League. At first i thought it's not that hard to play this game and then i realized it's pretty hard. It has some technique which are not easy to learn and take a great amount of time to master.I think is the dark souls of mp games especially for keyboard user like me.Some people said it's better to play this game with a controller but i'm natural keyboard user. Finally after some hours i got a pretty good grip at this game. Even though i'm still very bad. One game is around 5 minutes long so it's good for short time break and isn't a time killer game. Unless you click that play button again and again XD Overall it's really really fun as long as you don't care about competitive. Enjoy wrecking enemy car mash the keyboard for that one goal and mess up XD 11/10,Rocket League®

2016-04-21,0,0,29,False,Recommended,EDIT Years later I still can't listen to the music while playing the game / It only plays in the menu.This game is 2 things hard and fun although I would make the argument that it's only hard because the controls are weird. It definitively takes some getting used to re binding keys until you are comfy with all of them (defaults suck). You really should do some goalie or striker training in addition to the tutorials before you go online.Customizations on cars are nice keeps you playing even when you get frustrated.My only wish is that there was some variety to the layout of the maps instead of just re skins of the same map.EDIT Well a year later we got maps with new layouts and gamemodes with crazy powerups. Looks like the devs know what's up.,Rocket League®
2017-12-28,0,0,99,False,Recommended,As someone who hates sports games and racing games someone whose competitiveness far outstrips his skill and someone who finds losing and failure quite distasteful I have to say that I am pretty mediocre at Rocket League. And I still love the game regardless.I honestly can't even begin to identify why Rocket League is so fun. The concept of playing soccer with rocket powered cars is simply genius but I think the secret sauce is how Psyonix has polished everything to museum quality. The controls art style menus sounds network code are all expertly crafted to seamlessly guide you to the fun at the games core. Rocket League is a good idea executed flawlessly.,Rocket League®

On the surface it looks a lot like soccer but with cars when in reality it acts like an entirely new sport. Go it alone or with friends in both competitive and casual this game promises a lot of fun. If you'rer up to it there's even a crate system which you can access completely free and through trading even if you aren't lucky yourself you can eventually trade to something you really want. If you're not up to it you can still make your car look cool without using crates. There's tons of items to choose from. It's really fun to improve your skills while playing rocket league and it's just an all round amazing game with easter eggs hidden around everywhere. Rocket League is truly a work of art Psyonix really outdid theirselves making this game.,Rocket League®
2017-12-30,0,0,1082,False,Recommended,If you are looking for a game you can only get better at and if you want to drive super sonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars then this is the game for you. I have played over 700 hours and I can say I still have a lot to learn and I have fun doing it. There is a competitive side to the game if you want to get serious with the game or you can collect all the hats in the game and wear your pidgeon topper with pride. but I seriously would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun. It is difficult at first and you wont like it if you don't stick with it and practice but once you hit your first arial goal it really shows how your practice has paid off and you feel good. 10/10 would buy again,Rocket League®
2018-05-21,0,0,844,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a game I feel like I'm not allowed to dislike. Rocket League is a game equivalent of an abusive spouse. ""I've spent so much time with you I can't imagine being with anyone else"" Then boom you get dunked on in your last Diamond reward placement match and suddenly all the hours you've put in so far become torture instead of fun.However the next day you come back and you're back to enjoying it again before the vicious cycle repeats itself. I'm not even a very competative person by nature and I still absolutely love doing comp matches in this game. Again I almost want to dislike this game but I just can't do it. You get mad at your own lack of skill you get mad at everyone else being better than you (They obviously don't try as hard as you why should they deserve to win?) But still there's something great about this game that just refuses to go away. Maybe it's just how good it feels to pull of a good goal or a nutty save knowing you did it by your own skill alone (Unless the other team does then it's luck). Maybe it's the visable and very real progression from going up ranks. Hey maybe it's just being able to make other people amazingly angry from nothing more than having an anime girl profile picture.

But this is different hahaha and exciting. And it only works with friends there is so many options in terms of how you want to play to compete. You can go the easy way and the hard way. This game in fact is very hard you really need to practice to become somewhat a decent player. I believe many will give up because it takes awhile for some to get it going. Overall i do expect the developer to keep on polishing the game and coming up with new ideas.GG's everyone!!!ps i was going to write pros and cons but i cant think of it right now. So far so good cant complain and for its price i think its fair enough VS games that cost around 60 bucks.,Rocket League®

2018-04-09,0,0,156,False,Recommended,"Alright here is why you should pick up Rocket League.Firstly we have the customization I do disagree with the lootbox system but the point is it's only cosmetics. Unless you have money to burn opening crates is very unnecessary.Secondly we have the community. When starting new you will suck learning the game (unless your a God). People will leave and talk trash but everyone starts somewhere they also forget that the mode thats probably being played is casual. Unless its ranked what they say DOES NOT matter. Although when your a new player why would you play competitive in the first placeNext is ""PC SPECS???"" Okay this game might be intimidating to run on low end hardware BUT if your alright ""rough"" graphics its no problem. On an Intel hd 410 I got 30fps on all low settings but going into the game code (Check out the Low Spec Gamers video on lowering internal resolution) i lowered internal resolution to around 40% and I got a fairly consistent 60fps.Next is Online presence. This game has a healthy amount of players (unlike speedrunners Sorry) although in casual I find most players playing for ""soccar"" so finding people to play other modes may be an issue.Next is STRATEGY. Suprisingly this game has alot of depth in strategies and as time goes by strategies will improve.",Rocket League®

2018-06-04,0,0,61,False,Recommended,"Growing up my brothers and I would play various sports titles for soccer hockey basketball and football can't even remember their names (I know FIFA though!) haha but mostly loved screwing around like trying to hit the refs with the hockey puck. Outside of doing dumb stuff I never really enjoyed the sports games because the mechanics just felt clunky and not inherently fun especially as I never enjoyed sports IRL. Rocket League though... It's like the sports game for people who don't like sports games or even IRL sports. My brothers and I now in our 20's don't even care about winning. The game itself is just so dang fun to play and it's the perfect example of a game that's easy to learn and hard to master. And learning to master the game (i.e flying through the air to score sick goals and manage epic saves) is INCREDIBLY fun but its absolutely not necessary to enjoy the game. Want casual play?** play unranked and turn off chat check out some of the arcade y game modes (like ""hoops"" a basketball esque twist) Want that good ol' LAN party feel? grab some controllers and play splitscreen and/or invite friends to play online Love the thrill of domination? climb the ranked ladder and bust your butt in the official training modes and community made Workshop trainers E sports? Find Rocket League on Twitch and realize just how unimaginably insane the game gets at the highest skill levels Love collecting items? Or spending hours designing your character with unlocked loot? you can win one or more cosmetics at the end of nearly every game win or lose ranked or unranked! Unlock special cosmetics for climbing the ranked ladder! Browse a variety of free out of the box cars paint textures and various ornaments! Also lootboxes DLC and more!**I should note that apparently a lot of other people playing the game get really salty tilted and toxic. Are they the majority? I don't know because I turn off all chat from the enemy team and only play with friends/family on my team. If you want to just enjoy the game turn off enemy (and even allied if you want) chat and just have fun.",Rocket League®

I dont use a controller myself but I hear a lot of people recommending it.Overall its just a really fun game especially with friends but even without friends its still quite enjoyable in my opinion.Definately recommended.,Rocket League®

Once you've played about 5 hours you'll get the hang of it. So you'll end up playing about 20 more hours and realize you can fly. Flying is really a game changer and you should probably try and learn how to do it when you have ranked up to pro (Level 20 29). Once you can fly you instantly have an advantage over other players. But what happens when other players can fly? Learn rotations of course. Learning how to stay about a half field a way from your teammates on defense and then rotating forward will also be a necessity in the game if you wish to be very good. Finally after all of this you will pear to wall hit. Personally I'm not very good at these I hit about had of them. You you look up a tutorial you can practice it from there. I have a friend who is good at them and it helps a lot in all gamemodes. In the end I recommend this game to all. It has perfect playability w place to practice and even a great community. I've actually made 3 friends in 1 hour.,Rocket League®

2016-04-25,0,0,691,False,Not Recommended,HelloI have played the game over 600 hours and I will not give you the basic review that everyone seem to give because I am done with this game for a reason.Now I'll start off by saying that the progress system(moreso learning curve) is extremely fun and rewarding especially if you learn a bunch of stuff in normal play and then hop to competitive play and find yourself being better than your opponents.Although as much as I can go on for hours and hours about how much I LOVED the game it is completely sad that the game is turning to the way that it is.Updates in the past(played the game since basically release ish) were all about optimization getting rid of bugs and useless stuff that hurt the game and listening to the community(for example Hoops mode.) Nevertheless the devs seem to really like the amount of money that they were able to produce out of the game despite the huge amounts of sales going and the community loving it and turning into a CSGO Like every update is based around a new crate/new DLC the only new content seems to be around DLCs and more money milking from the game and it is sad to see the game going that way because it was a wonderful creation and it turned into a money milking. game similar to how many companies are ruining their games nowdays.I was very supportive of the devs and purchased many of the DLCs plus a bunch of copies to my friends to support the devs in their indie experience but it is almost disgusting to see how far they've come and how little their attention to the game and new features has gotten.Fantastic game just try your best to retain from emptying your wallet on the dumb cosmetics or you'll fall into a huge bottomless pit.Putting the review on Negative mainly to try and warn as many people as possible from getting into the DLC/In game purchases fest.,Rocket League®

2018-01-01,0,0,770,False,Recommended,I've been playing this game consistently for almost as long as it's been out. I originally played well over 1000 hours on PS4 (just a guesstimate there's no way to check on PS4). Making the switch to PC just made it that much better. Whether if you're just starting to play or you've played enough to be able to pull off ceilling shots this game is fun. You know a game is good when there's hundreds of knockoff versions of it in the App Store. This game is very much worth the price sale or no sale. Another plus is that the loot crate system is ONLY cosmetics. There's no boosts or other certain advantages. You win matches based on your personal skills.,Rocket League®
2018-01-01,0,0,4,False,Recommended,I was addicted to this game on the xbox my friend recently got himself a PC and bought Rocket League and asked me to do the same.I am enjoying playing on the PC however the controls can be a bit annoying I suppose I could plug a controller in but I prefer using the keyboard and mouse.Regardless the game is exactly the same so I can praise it here aswell as on the Xbox store. P(Oh and thanks for letting me trade keys on PC.),Rocket League®
2016-04-28,0,0,84,False,Recommended,I was skeptical about the $15 (now $20) pricetag for a game with essentially one gamemode. It recently had a free weekend and I tried it. Until then I had only heard glowing reviews but was still unsure about a high price for a small amount of content.Needless to say I played seven hours in two days and then bought it full price as soon as it wasn't free. I'm a stickler for one dollar one hour and I can easily see myself spending 20+ hours playing this game. The controls are damn tight the game is simple and incredibly fun to play.It might also help that the first 20ish games I played I won 7+ to 0 because apparently I'm godlike at this. And then I got matched with other godlike players and now any win I get is usually by one point.WORTH,Rocket League®

(With the dlc's which cost like two euro's a piece you can even collect more! and unlcok new cars instantly) If you dont feel like playing seriously try one of the minigames (like the basketbal one that just came out) or go into casual and fly over the map with your boost. i would rate this game 8/10 since its a really cool game but sometimes you get screwed and can make you tilt.

It is also awesome to just progress and see yourself become better (although in my case still not particularly good) at various aspects of the game. For me it would specifically be aerials. I always thought it was pretty cool when I would watch on YouTube people playing RL and seeing them fly with their boost for extensive periods of time. Now I can do it (albeit not as well). This game is very fun especially with friends and it is worth every penny even at full price I would recommend it!,Rocket League®

RL offers so much in a tiny package and the game is old but you it has new updates with small additions over time to keep people interested. Lost of modes and ways to play with only a few if any rules. Sometimes it can be a pain when you don't quite like your teammates but you gotta remember little kids will play this too and heck there is always 1v1.

You start out thinking its an easy concept and a fun stupid little game then somebody does something that you didnt know was possible and you fight to learn the mechanics to pull that off and the cycle continues of learning new mechanics ranking up getting on and so on and so on.I love this game if you are competitive and like a balanced game this is for you. There are 'loot boxes' but they're all cosmetic so no items give you an unfair advantage. This game is a really good value at this point its cost me $0.02 per hour of playtime so i've definitley got my moneys worth,Rocket League®

2017-12-27,0,0,968,False,Not Recommended,"Rocket League was massive and endless fun. It is very easy get into the game even if you never used a controller before.I have 800 hours in it so why do I not recommend?I have been playing on PC since 1989 (!). Tried many many games online since the mid 90's and believe me RL have the worst community I have ever experienced. I am not playing to be the best but to have fun with friends or alone. RL is a brilliant and simple game but the tons of 9 13 years old IQless children just ruins it at least for me.Games are meant to have fun and enjoy the time you spend playing. When a game turns out not to be fun anymore you should let it go. ( Similar reason why I stopped playing CS after 11 years )I don't recommend it maybe I just got too old for this kind of ""fun"".Originally I bought RL to have the ""couch playing"" in split screen mode with my wife and father in law. That was so much fun and laugh. Even when I started to play with my steam friends turned out to be fun too. The good moral and fun started to disappear when I / we became a bit skilled and started to play against mid skilled players who were so frustrated and stressed to win. If you missed a hit you got ""Nice shot!"" got a goal got ""What a save!"" in the quick chat. Sometimes these kids went even further and explained in how they shagged your mother last night. Yeah well we all can get this in other games but my many years of experience tells that this community is the worst.The fact that the game is so simple and a 9 years old can easily jump on it and start playing brings down the level to theirs. And how can I prove it? You not gonna have the same problem in a chess community. (Yes I played competitive chess for 2 years online)Only exception when I can recommend this is when you play it with your friends only on a low skilled level. There you gonna have so much fun for sure.",Rocket League®

It is definitely worth the 20 dollars.It takes a lot of time and practice to play well but that is sort of what follows with every game.Using a controller is best for this game though the type (Xbox/PS4) is your preference.A dislike is that you cannot filter swearing so you may occasionally meet toxic people who use foul language and you cannot block it. You can Mute/Report the player but you can't erase the chat box either.Although to do that you can disable the chat box you can't really do that in the heat of a match.Overall a great game!

2017-12-23,0,0,476,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that keeps you in the edge of your seat and slamming your fists on your desk. This is one of the reasons that I also own FPS games as a backup for many rage moments. This game can be played hours at a time depending on the tolerance you have for clutch saves and across field goals (I m assume you know what Rocket League is).However as I do not have a large tolerance for closely missed saves and goal posts as I mentioned before I keep backups. I play Rocket League usually between 1 2 hour periods.But The reason I really play Rocket League is because it s a sport. You have control of the ball you make passes with teammates and you make the Amazon saves. You re not telling the player to save the ball or to shoot it s physically you controlling your car.The only issue I have is the toxicity in the community. Many people I have played with have relied purely on insulting and making the other player so off that they can t focus. I have also had people that just cuss me out for beating them and then rage quit having lost.,Rocket League®

Essentially soccer with cars except that the cars have nitro and can proppel themselves into the air using said nitro.Other than that there is nothing much else to say other than the concept makes for a fun pick up &amp play game there is a huge difference between pros and newcomers however one doesn't need to be a veteran or even to have played the first game to enjoy Rocket League.A pretty good game play it with friends don't get the DLC it will wreck your wallet for cosmetics...or do I'm not forcing you.,Rocket League®

2017-07-30,0,0,19,False,Recommended,REVIEW #18Rocket League When it comes to sports games nothing is much flashier than soccer played with rocket powered cars. Thankfully Rocket League is much more than a game simply based on a gimmicky sounding concept. The game is a perfect balance of arcade style accessibility and simulation style strategy. Almost anyone can pick up this game and score a goal with a nitrous burning speed machine but Rocket League also allows players to learn to master it and become near unstoppable online pros.All around the game is very polished. It features excellent audio and graphics spot on controls solid online matchmaking capibilities (as well as offline play) and multiple gameplay modes including hockey and basketball variations. There's also tons of ways to customize your vehicle even allowing for two different variations of your vehicle that switch depending on which team you play on. There's also a good helping of DLC available including noteworthy options such as the Batmobile and the Delorean from Back to the Future.The only negative that I can give is that the game's AI is known for being very poor (to the point where it has been seen scoring a goal for the opposing team on rare occasions.) It does appear that the AI has been worked on and strengthened as the game has been updated but I unfortunately have no proof that this has actually occurred. However if you play online you won't be playing with the AI a great deal.Even if you don't enjoy sports games (like myself) it's still worth looking into this top notch title. It's easy to pick up and play for the first time and once you first feel the rush of scoring and claiming victory I guarantee that you'll come back for more.,Rocket League®

2016-06-20,0,0,367,False,Recommended,"Almost 300 hours has provided me a pretty decent idea of what the game entails so I shall share.1. You are the operator of a vehicle. These vehicles are reminiscent of our real world cars.2. These ""cars"" (as I shall henceforth describe them as) also have the otherworldly ability to jump and fly via rocket capabilities (I believe this may have impacted the naming convention of the vehicle simulator)3. These cars are engaged in a sporting competition vaguely resembling soccer where the objective is to place a sphere into a rectangular receptacle. 4. Rounds are set to a 5 minute limitation unless time elapses and there is still a tied score then the game goes into ""overtime"" and will play until a team has scored a final and conclusive goal.My overall impressions of this game are it's fun.I like it. If you fancy a competitive sporting match where you yourself do not exert actual physical efforts and also mimics a human sport but is instead played by car like vehicles with aerial capabilities (fictional to be sure) I cannot myself think of a better title than this ""Rocket League.""",Rocket League®

It's 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 football (soccer for the Americans) using RC cars in an arena with an exploding ball. Matches last 5 minutes (and extra time if tied) and that makes for really frantic and intense gameplay and the match length is just right.Great graphics and excellent soundtrack!Addictive game but finding matches on peculiar times can be hard.

BUT there are issues with the most important feature of the game multiplayer. you can rarely join a match (if you dont get in within a minute you may as well restart the game and try again) and when you do get into a match the game is loaded with people who have terrible pings causing the entire team to lag for example when we were up 2 0 they came back and won 4 2 in the last 20 seconds because we couldnt see a THING until it already happened. the replays didnt help either. just a ball randomly shooting into the goal at 120 kph while everyone was lagging across the feild. i had a ping of 30 so it was caused by someone else. intentionally done or not this was angering.i would assume private matches are better because you can control who joins but as of now none of my freinds own the game. overall this game gets an 8/10 im knocking off 2 points for all the various issues with online if those get fixed consider this a 10/10.,Rocket League®

2015-08-27,0,0,352,False,Recommended,This game is the essence of skill vs skill. You've already read all the reviews about how it's basically Soccer (Futbol) with cars. Yes it is. However it's about the gameplay with this one. The finely tuned controls and percision that this game gives you to actual do whatever creative idea you have in your head is possible. Sure there is a learning curve with the percision aspect of this game however it is for the most part a small one. If you are at all into competetive games you will more than likely enjoy this game.If you enjoy doing insane stuff in games that baffle people you will more than likely enjoy this gameIf you enjoy fast paced action and destroying other people y ou will more than likely enjoy this gameIf you remember your childhood ( or are in your childhood) where everything was just fun and awesome get this game.Con I will say this as a current issue that I have with this game. As of now (8/27/2015) There is no way you can party play between the PC and PS4 version. You can play with your friends on cross play through their private game setup however it's not the same as being in a party and playing ranked or with other online players. With that said Psyonix said that they are working on a way to bridge this gap. There currently isn't any word on when that will be out yet but they did say it was indeed a sought after priority.Buy this game.,Rocket League®

You take five minutes to get to hit the ball most of the time 2 hours to get it in the general direction you want it 4 to score some awesome goals 10 to get your first proper aerial 20 to get the idea of dribbling and forever to master any of those.You always have your good and bad days but this game never gets old and is pure fun to play with friends or alone!,Rocket League®

2016-03-29,0,0,107,False,Recommended,The thought of using rocket cars to play soccer is beyond the imagination of many of us. The game is rather simple in that all you do is score and try to prevent the opposing team/player from scoring so that you have more points than the other team/player by the end of the time limit so that you win! While it is a simple and repeatitive the game still hasn't gotten old even after the 70ish hours I've put in this game at the time of writing this review. 20$ is worth it but I would probably wait for a sale if you're into having money to buy food.,Rocket League®

2017-12-23,0,0,3,False,Recommended,I want to start off by saying that Rocket League is a fun game and although challenging with its steep learning curve can be a very epic experience as a whole. I haven't played for long though me and my friend being new players we had come into contact with a pretty big problem the matchmaking. This game is very foreign to us altogether so we would hope to run into players in a similar situation as us who had just bought the game and began playing to accustom themselves to the concept pace and overall feel of the game. However instead of a fair challenge we were faced with players who have clearly been playing for leagues longer than we have and we stood no chance. This happend about five or six times until we gave up out of frustration and closed the game. We feel we haven't given it a fair amount of time playing so we urge you to take this with a grain of salt. I recommend this game for its great gameplay astounding visuals novel concept and overall execution however I do not recommend it for its flaws with its matchmaking system (at least for casual). Despite the abunance of pros for this game I feel that the matchmaking issues cancel all of them out simply because you'll never be able to learn or enjoy them without either practicing on your own or entering games with those whom had just purchased the game as well. Part of me feels as though we just got an unlucky break so that's why I still tilt in favor or overall recommendation for now. I love the idea of this game though I want to be able to play it in an environment where everyone else I'm playing with is close to if not just as experienced as me. That way learning becomes easier and you don't get pelted with overkilling failure as a result of faultless inexperience.,Rocket League®

2015-11-26,0,0,868,False,Recommended,Crazy fun with friends and good community with only few salty fishes gives you good chances to have decent time even by yourself. Re playability is massive. Every game has it's ''Close One!'' and ''What a Play!'' I mean where else can you drive cars into a massive ball ( or a cube) and other cars and boost your way through the skies and get praised by your teammates and be hated by your enemies. Game has quite a few DLC's and more seem to be coming but they are not necessary in any way to enjoy the game. Game is not P2W or P2P in any way which is great and a huge bonus of course. Game is also priced reasonably and atlest I can say that I think I've had (and will) my moneys worth. Definitely recommend the game for all ages. At least give it a shot with friends or by yourself. Steams refund system is perfect for this and you can almost say that you have nothing to loose. Just give it a go or a shot whatever floats your boat.,Rocket League®

2018-05-29,0,0,252,False,Recommended,"Overall great game. It's the type of game that you can sit down and veg out while playing. Short 5 min matches and a causal match setting which is great if you don't feel like being super competitive while playing. It's a great game to play with friends especially if you have a discord server where you can all communicate together. Competitive play is decent but better if you have designated partners to play with instead of pairing up with random people. The game can be aggravating at times and the community of players can go from suprisingly wholesome to toxic as hell in a heartbeat but that can probably be said about any game. I will say if you want to get good at the game it takes A LOT of practice. I myself have played roughly 85 hours and i am a average player at best. The only true cons i have with the game are 1. horrible servers that constanly disconnect or fail to pair you up with an actual partner and instead give you an AI partner.2. The matchmaking system is trash. In casual play there is no ""matching players up by skill or play time"" rookie players with virtually no play time get matched up with seasoned veteran players who basically slaughter them. It can be annoying starting off.3. The competitive ranking system isn't much better at giving appropriate ranks or matchmaking. I could go into greater detail but im sure someone else has already covered it in a comment or video.Like I said at the beginning of this comment I do think this is a great game and I'd definitely recommend it to a friend. I'd give rocket league a 7/10.",Rocket League®

2017-07-26,0,0,771,False,Recommended,Whether it s online casual or ranked matches no pressure exhibitions split screen local co op with up to four players or an intense 36 week season mode Rocket League is all about getting into the next throttle pounding match as fast as possible. Unfortunately servers are still struggling which means your mileage may vary day to day when it comes to online features. But the silver lining is the mostly formidable AI can make even offline matches interesting and tense. The execution of this simple idea is so strong and so engaging that it keeps bringing me back time and time again for just one more match. (Read the archived original Rocket League review.)Now nearly three years later and with all the additional updates features and new platforms (including the newly launched Nintendo Switch version) Psyonix s insane formula of rocket powered cars playing sports has only gotten better with age.The great news is that the key ingredient in Rocket League hasn t changed a bit. The rules are simple two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement.,Rocket League®

Unfortunately that was not the case. The only way to play ""Cross Platform"" is for the game to randomly match you up with someone on the PS4 which sucks because the only reason I bought it was to play it online with my brother and friends from their PS4s.

It's a good solid game and is great to play with friends especially as I personally find it quite boring playing by myself but you can still play all the gamemodes solo. It runs really well but sometimes connection to the servers and others connection in the game can affect the gameplay. The only thing I would say about this game is sometimes the servers are a little unresponsive and the trash talkers. The new competitive seasons and rewards do keep things interesting and personally I have the most enjoyment while playing those gamemodes.,Rocket League®

2015-10-24,0,0,397,False,Recommended,I don't do reviews for many games... But I just had to for this one... I'll go to greater depths but the TL DR is that this is a fu***ng masterpiece.Scores Sound 10/10Gameplay 10/10Online experience 8/10Overall 9.5/10Sound Not much to say... The whole soundtrack and in game sound effects are amazing wouldn't change a thing.Gameplay Easy to play very very hard to master... Anyone can pick this up and in five minutes learn how to play it by themselves even though the tutorials are very good and helpful. But the best part is that the more you play the more you perfect your technique and gameplay... let's just say I'm closing in on the 100 hours and I still have much to learn. Amazing job by the developers.Online experience Okay this is where I have something important to say the only reason why this game isn't a perfect 10 in my opinion is that there are some things that need to get fixed of tweaked... First of all servers some servers are great others are just laggy and some can't even start a match properly... Once I was even kicked out because I lost connection while my 10+Mb glass fiber internet connection was working fine and got banned for 15 minutes because reasons... Should not happen on official servers... And my second big complain is the lack of a mute button... We all know it is essential for any online game and if there is one here it must be taunting me because I can't see my cursor while playing even when I press Tab... The rest are just minor tweaks and things that I personally would like to see changed but that's just my opinion which is not always right.Overall Rocket League is an amazing fun game that should be enjoyed by everyone. While there are some things that need to be fixed or tweaked those don't even come anywhere close to damaging the experience you'll have on this amazing one of a kind game... Weather you are looking for fun with your friends hardcore blood rushing action or simply entertainment this is the game you're looking for... It's one of those that bring some hope to the gaming industry when dark times arrive... A masterpiece.,Rocket League®

2018-10-25,0,0,1187,False,Recommended,When I first saw rocket league back when it came out I though it looked ridiculous Soccer using cars? Really who wants to play this. Then a couple of year ago some friends of mine started playing and I thought why not. So I started too. I immidiately got hooked. This game is fun on so many levels. It easy to pick up but so hard to master which only makes it so much more rewarding as you constantly progress your skills. Which you will. You will always get better and better. If you think it's something for you it probably is. I can only recommend it. PS. If you do play it just ignore all the toxic teammates you get. Don't flame back it'll only make them do it more. Don't answer and play your game. Enjoy.,Rocket League®

2018-10-03,0,0,13,False,Recommended,Rocket League was fun but not anymore. It takes me 10 30 min to find a match online. I can't play on other server otherwise i get 200+ ping. The South African servers takes so long just to get a match for me to play. The 4v4 is bad. What i mean is in the South African the 4v4 are these weird club members that have these the same name but diffrent number behind. I have reported them but they are still there. they are afk they have 320 ping and the lobby is full. There is one bot but thats it. Plz go and fix it. It's a problem because we(South Africans) can't play on it. my country does not want to report this problem because it's too much effort to even try to fix it. So here i am alone trying to fix it. Thats my only complaint. The sound and music of this game is beautiful and graphics are superb. The bots are nice to fight and the offline is a blast with intense matches. I would reccommend this game to other players from other countrys to get this game if it is your style. The game for it's price is not bad. I see many complain about the skins and content that must be paid but it does not bother me. The skins are a minor complaint. I say if you fix the servers and get these guys out my 4v4 servers on the South African server then we and I would appreciate it. I know that South Africa is not a massive gaming community and that we may not be 1 world class like europe but some of us do love videogames and would give it a try. If the game is good and the communty can stop being toxic to each other then there can be a solid experiance. Sorry for the long text. This is from me and what i have experianced.

Expect to play 200+ and still learn new mechanics tactics and earn some free crates that you can sell for a wheel you tried getting from crates and spending 20+ dollars and still not getting it.

2017-10-17,0,0,868,False,Recommended,This is one of my favorite games of all time! I've been playing for about 2.5 years and am a pretty experienced player. Rocket League demonstrates how a dirt simple game that is immediately understandable can have a sky high skill ceiling. Each game you play is different and is packed with hard decisions that must be made quickly and mechanics that must be mastered in order to move the ball the way you want. There is very little RNG and most goals can be prevented with better play. Fair warning the game is difficult and it will take a long time to be able to competently execute most of the core mechanics. Much of the lower ranks consist of players flailing wildly around the ball.The game looks and runs well I've not had any major gripes with performance or settings.The game has a ton of content in the form of cars and cosmetics and the gameplay is deep enough that I don't really want more than a few modes to play. There's tons of training options to improve your mechanics.Matchmaking and ranking can be frustrating but I don't really know how they could improve it. At higher ranks especially playing alone against parties can feel like a big disadvantage. Smurfing and boosting does occur as well. The issue is that play becomes faster and faster and smaller mistakes are punished more and more often. So if you're playing alone and two people go for the same ball it will often lead to a goal against. Again I don't really have a recommendation on how to fix this but it is an observation that if you want to reliably win games in the mid to high champ ranks in team playlists you will need to either be incredibly good mechanically or have a team. I regularly bounce between low Champ 1 and low Champ 3 in Standard (which I play without a party) despite changing very little about my own play.The first few months that I played this game though I was a casual player who played mostly with friends. Still I loved it. The physics and gameplay just feel so good so satisfying and so rewarding to improve at. Getting that close save scoring the big goal or even passing to teammates is always a great feeling. You should buy this cheap and deeply fun game.,Rocket League®

2018-11-05,0,0,948,False,Recommended,To me this is the ultimate Video Game.This game is beautifully crafted and combines two things I love completely Soccer and Video Games. The level of detail put into this game is astounding. You can find something new on every map every time you play the game even if you're like me and have put over 700 hours into it.This game is the epitome of skill hard work and determination. Every decision you make is up to YOU and YOUR decisions can make or break a match.The community is extremely active and it's also one of the nicest fanbases I've ever been a part of. Sure there may be a few toxic player but that's just the loud minority.This is also the Ultimate eSport as the skill ceiling keeps raising higher and higher. The only limit to what shots and plays you can pull up is your imagination. The professional players astound everyone with their level of on and off ball efficieny positioning and decision making. Anyone can go on to twitch.tv/rlesports and watch the pros and get better because of it.All in all this is my favorite game ever and I think it will stay that way for a long time. This game can be a starting point for someone wanting to get into video games or can be a challenge for elite players. I've missed a lot of other great things about this game in this review but I think this is really all that needs to be said about what a masterpiece Psyonix has produced.,Rocket League®

The loot crate system is bad as you can't do anything with 90% of them except look at what they contain seeing as decriptors are rare. In 50% of the ranked games someone leaves after 1 min and with no real repurcussion for them but Oh you had to play 2vs3 and ranked and lost? Too bad you demote. Oh you actually won 2vs3 no promotion for you. So until this game actually improves the ranking system its fustrating as hell and it infuriates me to get stuck on a bad rank when searching solo because a teammate leaves or is toxic and throws the game.Solution Increase the penalty for abandoning and for toxic behaviour and don't penalise the team if 1 player leaves in ranked.,Rocket League®

2018-12-09,0,0,319,False,Not Recommended,Absolutely love this game but ever since the last update I can't play the game. The game menu is impossible to navigate as it loads incredibly slow. I quite literally can't do anything in the menu screen because it is so slow. It's as if the frame rate is 1 2 FPS. I haven't been able to find a solution to this problem and verified the game's files and reinstalled the game and even ran the game in administrator mode. I also tried deleting the temporary and local files still nothing.Granted this might be an extremely isolated issue but I wouldn't want someone else to deal with this unless the fix is rather easy and I have yet to find it.,Rocket League®

2018-09-25,0,0,985,False,Recommended,This game used to be a 10/10 for me now days I can't give it an honest rating above 7/10. And here is why...1. A very toxic player base that is nice and friendly while they are ahead in matches then flip out at ANY mistakes made when losing.2. Broken match making that pairs you with literal anchors that can't even rack up 100 points in 5 minutes leading to heavily one sided games. Don't believe me? Try solo competitive 3v3.3. Servers are slowly getting worse. No matter what your settings/hardware are you WILL get stutters that are random and tend to happen in the least opportunistic of situitions.4. RL's current business model. YOU NOW HAVE TO PAY WITH KEYS TO BUY THE SEASON PASS TO EARN REWARDS IN RANKED PLAY... WTF! I can honestly see this game going free to play within a year.Comparing this game to what it use to be I have to sadly say to recommending this game!Update October 2018 You can no longer redeem special event points for keys to unlock crates (you have to buy keys with real money we use to be able to buy up to five keys with special event points).

2018-03-20,0,0,164,False,Recommended,Psyonix drowns this wonderful game in loot boxes ugly novelty cosmetics and pushy e sports nonsense. Every update means more disk space used for trinkets. Customization lacks even rudimentary features because why select a color for something when each color of each item can be a special individual drop (that you'll probably never see)?Still the greatness of the game shines through. It's a true gem of the action side of video gaming.Fantastic game play and skill depth. I can't agree with the devs' choice to make car hitboxes completely rectangular and not at all follow the shapes of the cars and I feel flying has a larger than ideal role but aside from that and some occasional wonky edge/corner physics the system is solid and let's you play and enjoy the game at many levels.The soccer basketball and volleyball modes add a ton to the game. The hockey mode is cute for variety. The soccer+powerups mode is quite poorly designed but serviceable for some wacky fun.You get four way local split screen with or against bots (AI could be a lot better but you at least have several levels) and you also have full local online with group online play. Every game should be so complete. It's a perfect couch game as far as that. It does not however lend itself well to widely disparate skill levels playing together.There's also a rudimentary training mode with workshop support. That has some potential but we'll have to see if anything really good comes of it.,Rocket League®

2017-11-28,0,0,1321,False,Not Recommended,Ahhhh what a shame.1200 hours in and the developer Psyonix has abandoned any veneer that they're not purely interested in cash and have repeatedly ignored feature requests from the community only to spend all of their time creating new lootboxes to encourage the kids to gamble and now a seasonal pass.I was still having fun in the game after turning crates off (a laudable feature) but now that the fun casual modes Rumble Hoops and Snowday are competitive ONLY in the latest update they've replaced the fun with pain.I'll be back if they change it back and make it fun again but for now the game has lost all apeal to me. I'm nearly 900 hours in. I don't think I need to point out that I like the game but perhaps I can explain why it's fun to an outsider thinking about trying it with a few simple bullet points Not time demanding games are 5 minutes long with goal replays and kickoffs that usually takes it to 7. Overtime happens if your tied and then you can take it to 10. No punishment no grind if you dont like a game you're playing leave. It might hurt your team so think if you want to help them out or hinder them before doing so but there is no impact to leaving. Fast matchmaking as an Aussie I'm accustomed to match finding sometimes taking 10 minutes or more. Was very pleasantly surprised to see how many people still played this game even 2 years after launch. A game can usually be found within 1 minute often within seconds. Casual and competitive somehow this game is both Fun you drive and fly a rocket car in a soccer match. With explosions. And hats,Rocket League®

You truly find yourself playing this game a lot because you have the urge to improve and the ranking system helps boost that drive for victory. The community is generaly not very toxic and you can play with your friend that is say on the switch or ps4 ect. This game is amazing with new additions such as the rocket pass and everything in the december update the game only gets more entertaining. There seems to be two sides to this game trading and playing. I like to mix them together trade n play but with both sides means if you start finding say trading boring you can just play and try to rank up same way the other way around.

2016-03-12,0,0,51,False,Recommended,10/10.For a long time games have been one and the same nothing new nothing fun or challenging this game is different. When i saw it it reminded me of my childhood and a lot of fun games in it that were a lot like this. The game it self is a great example of new mixed with old and football and cars. When you start this game it's very hard for you to learn how the game works how the cars work and so on. My advice is start looking for tutorials and make sure that you follow them.The DLC of the game are not exactly cosmetic but they have some advantages and some of them are worth it. I'm recommending it to everybody who wants to have fun. If you have played back in the day games like Re Volt and Twisted Metal you should buy it.The Game is fun and definitely worth the buy.,Rocket League®

Really shines the most when you have a few buddies to make a team with you git gud and wreck on some salty 12 year olds. I got the game on sale both times and overall it has brought me at least a 1000 hours of pure fun.P.S. Has loot boxes but it's purely for cosmetics and doesn't affect gameplay whatsoever and besides you can just save up your loot crates and trade them to people for items you want anyway totally free.Review update 11/21/18 It's still the best multiplayer game ever made.,Rocket League®

2018-04-30,0,0,2170,False,Not Recommended,Was a great game when it was free once they started charging money and added season passes for extra income and cases on top of that it all went downhill. Less good content more item focus ALOT more money they earned this way but no upgrade of servers. This game doesnt even have servers closer than Netherlands for anyone playing in Scandinavia. Its a disgrace and on top of that the servers they have are A$$. Can hardly call itself competative as the edge one gets with to much ping or an inconsistent server often results in wierd results.

2018-10-24,0,0,183,False,Not Recommended,I love this game. I absolutely adore the physics and the detail. Do you know why I gave it a bad review? Because it has been monetized so extremely that even though I don't mind taking the free path in a game and not recieving skins and bodies at the same speed as paid players I believe that the game has gone too far. The events don't even give out the free keys that would give you UNTRADABLE items like they used to. Each time the game was monetized more I felt a kick in the gut and now I can't even endorse the game. The game is clearly predatory with its market design and focus on keys to open LOOT BOXES which are illegal in some countries and more people are understanding is unfair to the consumer.Want to bring Rocket League fans back?

2018-12-09,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Probably the weirdest game I've played in a long time. You're literally a car chasing a ball. I love it! The reason why this game is such a gem in my steam library is partly because of the grind and addiction or in my case blood sweat &amp tears. It's one of those games you just put your heart into just to learn that specifik trick. Not only that there's a whole other community in this game other than the actual players. The trading community is huge in this game! There are not many games I can think of that has this big of a community market. It even makes this game better. If you're looking for a new game to main with your friends like CSGO this is recommended.,Rocket League®
2018-12-14,0,0,293,False,Not Recommended,This game makes money not only from selling the product itself but also from lootboxes and dlc. I'm not against it if that money is used to mantain the servers but that doesn't seem to be the case. Instead of fixing the damn servers they keep focusing in RLCS.,Rocket League®
2016-04-25,0,0,786,False,Recommended,I used to love this game but now i feel like its taking the path that CSGO took and let me explain why.1. Ranked The ranked system is completely ed. any rank player can play with anyone. at its extreme an unranked player can que with a Grand Champion (highest tier rank) with no problems. Every other game has some sort of rank restrictions. whether its only in the same tier (bronze silver gold etc.) within the same 3 divisions (silver 3/Gold 3) or some others but not rocket league! This gives way to MASSIVE BOOSTING problems. now im not saying you come across god tier players often. It's more of the opposite. I cannot tell you how many trash players there are in the upper ranks with no idea how to play. It seems like they care more about releasing more crates than a fix to their ranked system. More on that later.2. Development The old school rocket league would come out with MAJOR UPDATES new maps new modes whole new everything. Now its just oh lets add another crate with some t items that people will only want the black markets out of but no one will ever get them.3. The Crate system When the crate system first launched players were ACTIVELY getting black markets colored exotics etc but now the odds of getting those are so low its comparable to a CSGO knife. Which leads me to the point of them focussing on crates. It seems like since RL got to be an official ESPORT they focus soley on sales of keys which is why it seems like they lowered the drop rates and push out a ton of new crates left and right but dont really do anything else.Conclusion Rocket League is an incredibly fun game to play especially with friends. However their ranked system is ed they dont develop content like they used to and it seems like they focus solely on cashgrabbing with keys. I would hate to see a beloved game like Rocket League sell out to cash grabbing but it appears thats what we are getting nowadays. If you dont care about a broken ranked system or dont care about development then this is your game. If you care about ranked systems and development steer clear. I will still play this game as it is my favorite game despite my review. However i will not play NEARLY as much as i used to. At the time of writing this i played 3.5 hours in 2 weeks which is down from my usual 2 hours or so a day i used to play. The ranked system just makes the game unenjoyable and pointless to even play.,Rocket League®

2017-12-24,0,0,1053,False,Not Recommended,I love this game and I have invested Mega Hours into it. However huge downside is all the creates and trading bulshit. I bearly tolerated all the DLC's now if you want a new car you need to unlock a ing crate.... kinda gay.(edit) The main reason Im changing this from recommended to Not recommended is if your a new coming into the game... Prepare for disapointment (... unless you buy all the DLC's invest in trading and Get good quick... your life is going to be tough to start off. All the stock cars are The DLC cars are pretty good However crate cars are generally the best. If you intend to get good quick.... Draggs three top noob things to learn is 1 Hitting the ball consisantly (not ariels... just on the ground dribbling and hitting)2 Rotation (where you should be on the feild at the given moment)3 Goal Tending (Yip dont be afraid of the goalie spot as in rotation you need to know when you should be in here)Why not.... Basic rotation defence one in goal two out... If goalie leaves be prepared to become goalie....(important Goalie does not leave untill ball is past half way going away from you.)Attack Two forward One mid feild or further back.... Its really hard but the two on attack should not both be in a corner trying to cross the ball... as there will be noone to cross too.... If one of the attackers s up the attack pull out to top up on Nos and Mid feilder goes in.There is no baby mode so expect to come up against seasoned veterans pretty fast. this is why I dont recommend this game its alot to learn and your never going to look as fancy as everyone else.Anyway no game is ever the same and its an action packed 5 mins per round,Rocket League®

Are you more of a long term planner one who watches your cohorts fight over a ball in a corner with the confidence that the ball will inevitably escape. When this happens are you ready at the top of the penalty arc with the hope that the loose ball will roll between you and the goal?,Rocket League®

You realise how unfun that makes it for the players in that actual elo? And if it werent bad enough that that goes noticed but uncared about you can que ranked with any diffence of rank and mmr. Im a plat 3 and i frequently get smashed in duos to high diamond low master players boosting their little silver friend who sits in the goal while big bro carries him. Maybe im hoping psyonix will read this and figure some out you are making competitive ingenuine with the LACK of guidelines and allow boosting to run rampant.

However the facts that the cross platform grouping keeps getting delayed and Fortnite style season passes were added to a pay to play game tarnish its previously stellar reputation a bit in my mind. I used to open crates as a show of support because I thought the game was worth more than I paid for it but I just can't do it anymore.

2018-10-21,0,0,931,False,Recommended,In my experience with this game I would recommend just to try it.GAMEPLAY Gameplay is very original. It has many mechanics you can play with and try something new and many mechanics that had not been discovered yet. The playstyles in this game are infinite. You can combine the mechanics to make some crazy plays.It is fun for many people at once. You can play in 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4. Some modes are also ranked.There are also additional gamemodes to look at and make for some amazing time. The problem is the bots who are almost useless and ruin gameplay.COMMUNITY I would say that this community is pretty toxic. From my point of view atleast. Almost every game someone disconnects from your game and it makes it unfair. Ofcourse the player gets replaced by a bot but the bots have bad AI. But not all people are so bad. I have met many friends in this game and play with them until today.DESIGN Lets start with the turorial...The tutorial makes you learn just basic things like jumping and how to drive. It is not that in depth tutorial and you will have to look up most mechanics online to understand them.Then there are training packs made by players or the devs. Here you can try some training packs which increase your skill in your games. You have a very big selection of them and can even create your own one for FREE.Then you have the car selection and customization...You have a very big selection of cars to choose from so find the one that suites your playstyle the best. You have the basic cars which require no currency to unlock. These you have unlock by playing the game and getting them as rewards form matches. There are only few but will do the job. Then you also have the paid cars. DLC cars and microtransaction cars from Crates. They are not that expensive but almost noone uses them.You can customize every car except the Batmobile. From the decals to antenas and motor sounds.In conclusion this game is good to try but gets old just after 100 hours. The ranking system is weird with many bugs like dropping 3 divisions after a lost gmae for which you had to play 10 games. It also has many RNG like 50/50s and pinches.I would recommend this game.,Rocket League®

2018-02-02,0,0,134,False,Not Recommended,So I deleted my review so I could redo this and maybe point out to people the they do is a bannable offense.https //www.rocketleague.com/news/code of conduct and banning policy/ If you scroll down on the CoC smurfing is a bannable offense. I have run into more smurfs lately on here than I have actual players and it's stupid. Psyonix needs to enforce their ban policies I've reported over the past year probably close to 50 to 100 smurfs that have been on (IE Level 1 and Level 2 steam accounts with little to no hours on RL have their profile hidden or partly hidden and are pulling air tricks off in Bronze to low Silver.)I don't care who you ing are play at your own ing level rather than coming down to the lower ranks where people are actively trying to get up and ruin the game completely for them. If I could get a refund right now I'd sure as hell get one since Psyonix doesn't seem to care for this issue even if reports are filed using the ingame report system.Edit To add another update RL servers are still extremely unstable ping wise for me as of late I'll most likely be uninstalling the game as issues from smurfs being on constantly to lag issues with the server on wired and non wired connection I think I've had enough of the issues now.,Rocket League®

It's one of those games that you just have to try.The downsides come and go and there is still lots of room for improvement. The company doesn't seem keen on moving real fast with game fixes and enhancements but they do happen eventually. Their strongest suit is just adding content to the game.Bottom line is there are downsides but it's well worth trying.

2018-02-22,0,0,148,False,Recommended,Wish I had gotten this game sooner. For those considering getting it. It's a very simple game. You play ball with cars and try to score goals while keeping your opponents from doing the same. The controls are very responsivel both on keyboard and mouse. And the game is just plain fun. I don't even typically like sports outside of watching it with a boyfriend usually and furthermore I don't much like to race cars either haha. So for me the fact that I ended up having so much fun here was quite interesting!The game features several games modes but I have only played 3 of them. The simplest ones in fact. 1v1 2v2 and 3v3. You can party up with friends from steam. The game features cross platform gameplay but I do not believe you can team up with friends on PSN I am unsure I don't have friends who play it on PSN. I never have to wait more than 30 40 seconds to enter a match no matter what mode I have tried. You can compete in competative gameplay in 2v2 and 3v3..and maybe even 1v1 but I'm not certain as I've never tried 1v1 competatively.The games soundtrack is among one of the best I have heard in a long time absolutely great soundtrack and sound quality. The DLC cars are pretty cheap cosmetics. But the game gives you a metric ton of cosmetics for free as you progress just for playing the game. As well as loot boxes which you could purchase keys for at I believe 1$ per key. Loot boxes offer random loot ranging from really useless to really awesome. Typical as far as that goes.You can trade loot boxes with people you meet in steam for keys and such so you essentially will never have to pay a dime if you don't want to. The community is fairly hit and miss as with any competative game just don't let the salty people get to you and you will be fine. The game does seem easy enough that anybody can get in and have fun but despite this it can get pretty hard to beat good players and it rewards learning how to do some pretty cool tricks using the rockets and angles of your car to hit the ball just right. All in all I really have no complaints about this game. Perhaps the only complaint is that it doesn't seem to punish the rage quitters but I am unsure since I am not one if that is true or not. You will see plenty of them in competative. Sometimes after the first few moments after the first score isn't your teams score. It usually snowballs from there into a total forfiet match. But when that does not happen the games go smooth and run fine and are really fun.Lastly getting back to the cosmetics..its really fun just messing around with your cars looks after unlocking new cool stuff to use. A fairly decent amount of customization is in the game based on what cosmetics you get ranging from paint jobs wheels antenna's rocket boost exhausts goal explosions toppers (cute little ornaments you can put on the top of your car like a witch or wizard hat for instance just to be silly) The sound of the engine..etc. For it's simplicity and plug and play ability I give the game a 10/10. I went into it expecting to hate it. But it exceeded my expectations by a huge margin and I really don't have any complaints about the game itself.,Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,514,False,Recommended,To me Rocket League is one of the few modern competitive games I feel is actually worth investing time into due to its focus on pure balanced gameplay. Keeping everything on an even playing field with no classes gear or ability systems throwing off the balance. If you win you earned it.Even with the relatively straight forward mechanics of the game there is still an insane skill ceiling built around an ever growing range of community discovered moves and techniques. It is up to you to decide where to put your time train and learn techniques you find interesting build a play style that works for you. If you ever manage to master every technique and feel like you have nothing left to learn you ll probably find you got your money s worth.,Rocket League®

Is it for my time that I can spend on game? No because I could easily rise up on the ranked but for some things i can't reach diamond.""Why? You suck bro you can't play it's not other one's fault""... that's not the problem...PSYONIX I SPENT 10 FOR BUYING THAT DAMN SEASON PASS MORE THAN 50 IN KEYS OR DLCS AFTER A MONTH I'M ONLY AT LEVEL 4 BECAUSE YOU YES I MEAN YOU A BAD DEVELOPERS TEAM WHO DON'T READ AT YOUR FANS REVIEW OR TIPS DON'T UPDATE AND TRY TO FIX THOSE POTATO SERVERS.Until the last update I could play with my slow connection but at least I could play at 80ms of ping not the best but HEY! i could play and rise up from gold to platinum 3.Here comes the last update I spent over 100 to get a better connection in my house with my money that sould go on my guitar teacher but no I wasted to trying to play to what WAS a nice game then I tried to play but no that's not playing... this is not a game anymore. A game is where you can rage have fun with friends having fun choosing the best car modifications a game where also with a low keys car you could hear from the enemies that it wasn't so bad the beautiful feeling of seeing a white octane and screaming for the happiness... This is NOT a game ANYMOREAnd now this is what Rocket league was really for me a few month before the update i recommended this game now not at all...After 488 hours on this game i tought about to review my experience on this game.I bought this game one month after the releasing of the game on steam.I started with my pink controller but it get broken (chinese plastic if you know what i mean) so i started playing on keyboard + mouse. My first 2 weeks got really bad i couldn't understand the keybindings so i decided to make my own keyboard configuration no mouse support. I totally got into the commands in almost 2 years and 450 hours learning to dribble (a bit) and air ball control.Do I recommend this game?Absolutely yes! You will find a lot of nice people you will make new friends even if you are not a toxic person.I got friends from all over the world playing this game from Brasil to Holland from here in Italy to Turkey from Germany to Japan keeping with em contact and talking about everything like irl friends.Oh yeah and mostly you will have a lot of fun playing this game",Rocket League®

2016-07-02,0,0,2471,False,Recommended,Rocket League is my #1 favorite game of all time. The game masterfully balances the crazy fast paced action with the slower methodical strategizing which is essential for success.When I first got this game I was s*** but as I played more and more I had a strong feeling of progression. Soon I became a pro veteran and now an expert. After becoming more and more obsessed with this game I started soaring through the sky to hit the ball into the goal.The only thing that is negative is that when you first start playing it's relatively hard to play but the matchmaking is usually good and you'll get better in no time anyways.11/10P.S. The all new trade in system adds an all new motivation to play. Receive uncommon items that you can keep or trade in to get rares. Trade in rares to get very rares. Look forward to Psyonix adding in more rare and very rare items.*Nominated this game for an award*,Rocket League®

Harder than you think at first.Won't be dying anytime soon. Never heard of a game that can replace this Esport title. This is NOT an arcade cheap title.Cons To play with dualshock format joypads you have to get an emulator x360ce . Not too hard to setup but still.Might get grindy grindy as in practicing shots over and over again in training after around 150 hours No other cons to my eyes.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,463,False,Recommended,I really love this game. It is easy for newcomers to join in can be easily played as a single player has a large online player base (at least for all of 2016 as of this post) plays in short bursts (5 minute games). I really don't play much online multiplayer for games but this is a lot of fun. The soccer with cars is actually done really well. The controls are great. Give it a chance. Personally I love the 2 on 2 matches but I also play 3 on 3 as well. Ranked matches are best because people stick with them and don't drop in &amp out but unranked can be fun too.At first you can just stay on the ground and can probably do a decent job getting an opportunity here and there to slam into the ball score or make lucky passes. But keep playing and you'll start to get better as you learn to use the jump and boost a bit better. But this is a game where you don't just get killed like a newcomer to some FPSs.More than a year later and I still really enjoy this game. The new rewards systems are nice too like the holiday themed play money to get items as a reward for play time during special events.,Rocket League®

Goal stealing and spectacular saves are more fun than ever! Hoops Update An absolutely fantastic addition to the game. Sure it's odd to start with but it's something different! I've heard complaints that the arena is too small but I think that adds to it. It means a lot more goals and a lot more skill needed to defend and score. 100% top addition to Rocket League.This game is the love child of Micro Machines and FIFA. Genuinely one of the best games I've played in a while. Such a vast amount of customisation options local and online multiplayer make this a great experience all round and the short games keep it short and sweet. A well thought through game!The addition of the Supersonic Fury DLC and free update is very much welcomed! Two extra cars with unique decals two new sets of tyres new flags and new arenas are amazing to play with. I can only hope for more arenas to play in with new themes and hopefully more decals for all the current cars!A game I will be playing for a long time to come!,Rocket League®

2018-11-24,0,0,625,False,Not Recommended,Game was great until recently. Psyonix has been for the most part great at responding to community feedback but recently has been faltering. The rocket pass seems like another money grab from Psyonix in addition to the lootcrates they are influencing the gambling aspect of the game. And just recently my steam name has been censored on this game after being totally fine since I've purchased it many years ago. I believe their new algorithm detects alcoholic terms and because my name contains 'pub' I was censored. There are many others who have reported this issue and Psyonix has failed to fix it after months.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,248,False,Recommended,10/10Dynamika gry muzyka piękna grafika proste zasady szybkie samochody i piłka nożna. To jest to co faceci lubią. Rozgrywki są szybkie dynamiczne i uzależniają. Na początek podchodziłem do tego tytułu sceptycznie jednak wraz z jej odpaleniem wszystko to przestało mieć znaczenie. Pierwsza rzecz jaka pierwsza wpada w ucho po odpaleniu to świetny soundtrack nadający specyficzny klimat. Po odpaleniu pierwszej gry mamy styczność z powalającą grafiką (każde źdźbło murawy można policzyć) prostotą w sterowaniu i niesamowitymi emocjami jakie niesie kopanie piłki samochodami wykonując niesamowite akrobacje w powietrzu i dokonując demolki na samochodach przeciwników. Akrobacje to bardzo mocna strona tej gry. Sterowanie jest proste a same akrobacje nie są rzeczą jaką uświadczymy tylko u zaawansowanych graczy gdyż nawet początkujący potrafią zachwycić strzelonymi bramkami z wykonaniem niesamowitych manewrów.Gra oferuje także modyfikacje wizualne pojazdów dodając kolorów i tak już pięknej i kolorowej rozgrywce nie oferując żadnych wspomagaczy dla graczy co wszystko sprowadza się do umiejętności indywidualnych i zgrania drużyny.Tryby dla graczy oferują rozgrywkę od 1 na 1 aż po rozgrywki drużynowe 4 na 4. W dodatku posiadają prosty i przejrzysty samouczek oraz trening w akrobacjach strzelaniu do bramki i rozgrywek z botami.Całkiem niespodziewanym gadżetem tej gry jest możliwość grania na podzielonym ekranie na wszystkich platformach PS4 XBOX i PC co zadowoli graczy chcących zmierzyć się ze znajomymi czy rodzeństwem na jednej platformie.Tej gry nie da się nie lubić. Jeden z niespodziewanych i najlepszych tytułów 2015 roku!!,Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,1733,False,Recommended,An amazingly simple simple concept for a game that does everything right for itself. It is simple to play and yet challenging to 'master' requires no prior knowledge of sports or cars to play and rewards teamplay and singular effort alike. IMO its true value is that the game is centered soley on skill and that the ranking/matchmaking system ensures you play with people as 'skilled' or as 'casual' as you are. Recieving items leveling up and gaining new titles is entirely cosmetic. Each game is dynamically different as you'd expect with any sport match irl and makes for a new experience every match. Highly recommended!,Rocket League®

2016-11-28,0,0,1779,False,Recommended,There's not that much to say about this game.It's a dead simple concept. Rocket powered cars hit a ball hopefully into the goal of your opponents. That's it.You are going to hatelove this game with a passion.Simple concept but so challenging to be actually good at.You'll never be as good as you think you are. Even the best players make mistakes.But you'll come back for more. Every match is different from the one before. And you'll get better.Solid advice Turn off ingame voice chat right from the start. Just trust me on this one.Solid advice #2 If you are prone to rage and anger stay away from the Solo Standard competitive queue and play the other lists with people you know. Playing that list can help you reflect your own personality and be a better human but only if you are able to survive in a toxic cesspool of nuclear waste that is the rage of your teammates. As I said you'll make mistakes others will make mistakes. Every time you do they will tell you in unspeakable ways of anger no matter how bad they are themselves. I've played years of League of Legends before. This list is worse. Be prepared.,Rocket League®

2018-12-01,0,0,98,False,Recommended,"Between xbox ps4 switch and pc I have over 200+ hours in this game. For the money probably one of the best bargains i've gotten ever. That being said I would only reccommend purchase if you have friends or know a community who play. The ranked system is IMO extremely flawed. Games are 1v1 2v2 3v3 and solo3v3(no parties). Once you catch on to gameplay and get gold/ platinum rank the game has a system of weeding players out of legibility for higher ranking groups by sticking them with players who match your rank but are drastically different experience and skill levels. In layman's terms when you ""git gud"" you're going to be matched with ""trash"" players. I've played almost 10 games today highest scorer in each lobby and I don't think I won one game. OH AND RANKED IS BASED SOLELY ON WINS. So if you score 1000 points and lose you still go down in rank.. Love the game although the ranking system is not pragmatic in fixing its issues. Some may call this review and attitude toxic I believe the ranking system enables toxicity by its poor matchmaking system. 7/10 as of now 9/10 if they make a change to matchmaking system.",Rocket League®

2018-12-01,0,0,170,False,Recommended,This is my first review. Why? Because this game is that much fun! You should know! I play online multi player games exclusively like Overwatch Smite LoL Faeria Hearthstone Battlerite. But Rocket League is the easiest pick of all my games when I don't know which one to choose. I think I've had the most fun with Rocket League aswell. Sure when you get to Gold from silver standards there's Aerials all over the place and it's way more competitive. It can become frustrating if you play too much. But you'll always come back to it with a smile. Make sure you read atleast some other reviews here. This game is on a league of its own. It also helps there's way over 150 thousand people online huge tournaments ect. Unlike faeria which is the best card game but has like 250 people... 150 thousand means you'll always find people of your skill level. Easily!This game is like a sport on steroids. With all kinds of different tricks you can pull off with boost more boost! I'll only score the gameplay. 9.9/10 compared to todays standard. Have fun playing rocket league! Because you will!,Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,534,False,Recommended,"I have played this game for 1000+ hours across many platforms and I can say that it is incredible. It's one of my favourite games to this day. The community is quite diverse between the toxic players that aim to demo you every 5 seconds and the nice players that help you and don't mouth off if you do something wrong. It's a great game to play with friends and can really help build great teamwork and communication skills between you and your friends. The game itself is very diverse with its game modes and maps supplying interesting scenarios to try. The community practice levels are brilliant and really help with building your gameplay mechanics alongside being able to make your own to pratice the shots you always seem to miss. There is a fair learning curve if you want to get really good but I find most people will develop at their own pace and will get good after playing long enough. If you want to get better you don't have to change your controls and start playing ""claw"" either just choose what feels good for you I use basically default controls and I get around just fine. There are a fair few customization options for your cars. Some people might hate me for this and I am well aware they have made more colours for the teams that you can choose from. But in my personal opinion I think it would be great to have a wider variety of colours to choose from to customise your car. But that's just my thoughts/opinion. The servers can be buggy and laggy at times but overall I find them to be fine. I can't wait for when you can party up with other platforms. Great game 10/10 would be called a ""fat nerd"" again for dunking on a solo during my placement matches.",Rocket League®

Rocket league is a game where the skill ceiling is always going up or if somebody has already reached the peak of this game those people are just a handfull. This game requires you to spend time finding out how the game works and how you should play the game properly its just football but with cars that can fly jump and dodge through the arena.This game is really fun and is always my go to game when I have nothing to doA solid 8.5/10,Rocket League®

Psyonix adds updates just at the right time when the game gets a little bit stale.This game is very addictive and entertaining as well. Rocket League also has plenty of customisation options for your car and I hope there will be many more features that Psyonix will add in the future. Although sometimes teammates are bad most of the game is good. Overall this is a very good game and I definitely recommend it!,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,1664,False,Recommended,"""Car Soccar"" may sound like an unbelievable concept. Once you play it though you see how this simple idea of driving combined with a giant ball is turned in to an addictive and wonderful game. The car and ball physics takes a while to learn and forever to master. No matter your skill level you will see people better than you making awesome skill shots and blowing easy plays.It is fast paced. Matches take about 5 minutes to play. You will often find yourself going to play a game and sticking around for a few more. Once you get a good team and a set of opponents it is easy to ask for a rematch.This is one of those games I keep going back to. There is always something to learn or get better at.The dev team has done a great job keeping the game updated as well as adding new content. The collectables in the game are a great incetive to keep playing. It adds something that can be earned and is not pay to win or microtransaction based. Yes there are added stuff that you can pay for like Keys to open Crates. Most items can be earned just by playing and ranking up.",Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,668,False,Recommended,Addictive and super fun game which turns out to be extremely competitive and challenging once you pass a certain level. You'll be so happy when you score your first goal. When you hit your first aerial. When you learn how to half flip and dribble and control the ball in the air. Oh god when you hit your first backboard double touch. Or ceiling shot. Then 500 hours in a typical Friday night you smash your desk because you just got demoted from Champ 3 by some ballchasing goober who wanted to forfeit after going 0 1 with over 3 minutes remaining. Next game you have a Squishy wannabe who doesn't understand the concept of a play that doesn't revolve around a ceiling shot (in which he sports an impressive 0% goals. Keep trying though bud any day now). You disable all chat and put your teammates on quick chat only because you can't handle the toxicity. The simple things that gave you joy in the past means nothing now. You suck at this game. You've peaked you hit your skill ceiling. You're washed up. You're never getting GC you'll always be stuck in Champ. Forever. This game is the best of times. This game is the worst of times.,Rocket League®

While I've now spent a lot more money on the game then that I've never regretted a single dollar spent because Psyonix has consistently provided new content and a ton of support for this game.The learning curve is steep if you really want to get into it but it's honestly fun at all levels if you can get some friends together to blow each other up and run into the ball. 100/10,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,1304,False,Recommended,"Probably the most fun football/soccer game since Nintendo World Cup for the NES at least as far as I am concerned. I have never been the kind of person who likes to compete or cares about winning but for some reason this game makes me want to win a whole lot. It's one of my favorite games ever.Each player gets to drive one car and do whatever it takes to score goals be it drive on walls jump fly or what have you. You can customize your car's appearance with paint jobs ""hats"" antennas wheels and more and as you play you get more customization items to use for this purpose. You can trade these items with other players who are in your party though it is not obvious how to do it (you have to select the player at the bottom of your screen when you are both in the same party and on a menu screen or something).Unranked play has 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 modes. Unranked matches can have bots fill in for missing players.Ranked play has 1v1 2v2 3v3 and a 3v3 solo queue mode. There are no bots in ranked play.There are also some special modes where the stages and gameplay are somewhat different.I would recommend a controller for this game as there are some things that are more tricky to pull off at the same time in the keyboard+mouse configuration. The region selector is your friend as it's not very fun to play in distant regions where you get 200 ish ping. I usually just pick my own region plus one region west of me and one region east of me which keeps pings in the 30 100 range most of the time.",Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,19,False,Recommended,So I originally bought this game a while ago near when it first came out... I was excited for the gameplay however I really didn't enjoy the way it felt after a few games. I returned it with the let down of having a fun game to play with friends. Innevitably the game went on sale again and there I was a click away from making the same mistake. However this time the Steam Gods were in my favor and the second time around I actually took the time to learn how to play! Oh my gosh go figure learn how to play a game properly and it can be entertaining and fun! Seriously try it. Try thinking about the buttons you're pressing on your controller for a change. That one's for all the veteran keyboard playing button mashers out there. Do it give Rocket League another chance at love and smash some kids dreams and balls in their face with an epic match of back to back goals and immaginary air high fives with strangers you PUG with. Get your game face on and get into the game ... and face it? ... Do it. Do it now.,Rocket League®

2018-06-29,0,0,1026,False,Recommended,I suppose the time has come for me to finally write the verdict of this game.Even after such a long time has passed since release this game has been an amazing experience from start to end. Every singular movement and decision you take can make or break the game and having that notion engraved into your head makes the competitive drive only rise higher.Progressing further into becoming a better player can go from learning how to drive your car into the ball all the way to doing some weird flip business that'll drop everyone's jaws. It all becomes so natural at some point that you just accept the fact that gravity is constantly being defied in every way possible. What's better is that every month a new technique is discovered for your leisure. Now you can enjoy flying about in the most impossible of ways.With constant additions to the game (and regular updates) I've had a hard time becoming bored of it. Sure a break is necessary every once in a while. After all grinding those ranked games can turn out to be quite exhausting. However you're bound to come back for more. Psyonix and it's community have made a wonderful piece that'll hopefully stand the test of time.,Rocket League®

I think this game can be improved by adding more awards when winning a level because now you can only obtain some junk if you manage to level up however I hope that you can add a self managing system that if you won a lot of matches during that level you could earn an even greater award.

2018-11-21,0,0,169,False,Recommended,Really exotic propposal from the developers on this game. Fortunately they have executed it very well. It lacks a better implementation of cross platform games and more integration with steam community market. The controls are a bit skecthy if you are using a keyboard and mouse players using a controller have a good advantage over you. The lobby system leaves a lot of room for improvements you can't add a player to your friends list at the lobby you have to look for him on the Steam Community. The party sistem is a bit weird mainly at the invitation part. Overall really good game very fun and different from what we are used to see on Steam.,Rocket League®

Its impossible to play any sort of tournament there are about 3 4 teams that are really good and they make smurf accounts to play in low ranking tourneys so they can seal club the rest.Basically its that one server the game doesnt pay attention to anything happens and it either stays like that or it lasts for days,Rocket League®

Pray you don t get one while joining a match.Also prepare for random rocket league servers lag for days until fixed. Then after a while you get lag period again.Also if you are into keys/crates just don't buy them for this game. 99% chance of a _s i t t y_ decal no one will ever use. They give you the chance to exchange 5 items for one of the next level but all 5 need to be ""compatible"" (belong to the same series) which is unlikely and you will end up with a stuffed inventory that takes years to load the thumbnails.Good game but unstable matchmaking and performance issues on PC will frustrate you enough.",Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,90,False,Recommended,This game is meals on wheels...in terms of gameplay. You have the base mode which is basically a balls to the wall soccer match that you and two other friends/players team up against another fellow team and simply try to score a goal. Easier said than done but there's also hockey basketball dropshot and what Mario Kart ends up being with your closest friends Rumble. The mode names should be pretty self explanatory but imagine them instead with Rocket Cars. Rumble being a favorite of mine and is basically the same as a normal mode but you get power ups and boy howdy can the game get chaotic. Speaking of which there's also Chaos but you're gonna have to buy the game to learn what that is. It is your fate. It is your future pain and you won't regret it...probably. *This game is just as fun for casuals as it is for Rankers. Though I think their souls get sucked out of their body.,Rocket League®

That way when you get AFK's in your match and you don't want to play with someone who is sitting there you leave but YOU get penalized because its a ranked match. Then when you are in a match and someone chooses to leave whether it be an emergency or not you don't get bots to fill in their place nor can other players join because its ranked since it has to be ranked. Also when you find a really good match with players and you want to face them again because it was fun you can't select ""rematch"" because its ranked. Great new mechanics. Did I mention the entire game is nothing but ranked matches now? Used to enjoy the game. Thats why I am voting no until they change it back to appease the casual players.",Rocket League®

2018-08-30,0,0,238,False,Recommended,"IMHO (still) the perfect review for this game is to quote Rekt (https //steamcommunity.com/id/Wrekkt)...Originally posted by Rekt Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie You can't hit You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still Pro You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah time to get a controller head.Veteran You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend The most badass looking title you can have. Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer You can now 720 freestyle backflip reverse backwards aerial air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag. But if you didn't still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA).Think about it this way You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.",Rocket League®
2017-11-24,0,0,1379,False,Recommended,So very addictive. It seems so simple at first but as you keep playing and getting better you'll see there is sooo much more to master.Game is very well supported by the developers too.

It is however even better when played with friends.Would love to see a crazy massive level for 11v11 that would be hilarious.,Rocket League®

The beauty in this game is how easy it is to see your progression and most of it happens through playing the game not through keeping up with some changing meta or reading online guides. Just play compete and get better. This progression is what will keep you playing in my opinion. 10/10,Rocket League®
2018-10-07,0,0,51,False,Recommended,Do you like football? Well do you like cars? If you still answered in the negative to those you're A) a sissy or B) someone who shouldn't be here. But no worries! This game might still be of interest to you. I bought this game when it originally came out and I'm happy to say that they actually haven't really screwed the game up once since release. It has a nice balance on whether you would like to play casually or competitively. It does have casual and regular ranked but it also features other cool gamemodes like basketball ice hockey or football with superpowers essentially.

2018-11-24,0,0,638,False,Recommended,+ There's nothing pay to win in the entire game. It's entirely about individual skill and team effort.+ Easy enough to learn the basics.+ Tough but fulfilling to master.+ You can play alone in 1v1 2v2 3v3 or even 4v4 whichever is your preference.+ Fun is more than doubled when playing with friends.+ You're being rewarded regularly for just playing the game.+ You can customize your vehicle quite a bit.+ There are special events with unique rewards quite often.+ There are also alternative game modes for you to choose from if you get tired with normal play modes.+ If you're into esports Rocket League esports scene rapidly growing. If you party up with more than four people you can't really play together unless you play custom matches which can be a bit boring. Queue times can be a bit long although ranked 2v2 and 3v3 queues usually pop pretty fast. Matchmaking can be a bit weird sometimes. It is a popular game with diverse international player base so naturally there are some server stability and connectivity issues. Sometimes the in game chat can be pretty toxic but you can disable text chat and use just the quick chat or no chat at all if that's your preference.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,120,False,Recommended,I'm pretty sure everyone has heard of Rocket League by now. A simple concept that was even already adapted to certain degree to some gameshows Playing football (soccer) with cars.I'ver been playing Rocket League every now and then during the last few months but only really got into it quite recently. This game is literally for everyone. It does not matter whether you are a pro performing air dribbles and ceiling shots or you are a beginner who can hardly hit the ball. You'll have fun with the game nonetheless (as long as you dont take the online community too serious). The skill cap in this game is insane. If you are looking for a game where you constantly can improve yourself and/or never be finished with learning new stuff then look no further because this is for you. I'm always suprised how such a simple game concept manages to be so technically demanding of players. The reason for this is the exceptionally good physics system that the game utilizes which almost never fails its purpose (except for some minor hickups during connectivity issues)The graphics are also nicely done and completely suited for this game. It probably will not blow your mind which does not mean that it is not pretty to look at because it absolutely is. All in all I can recommend this game to anyone. Especially if there's currently a sale on steam you can get this gem quite cheaply this days. You'll get many hours of fun out of it be it by training your skills or simply fooling around with friens and/or online.,Rocket League®

I also wonder what happens with all the money they earn through those microtransactions since they do not seem to invest it in improving their server infrastructure. That's poor for an game which is meant to be primarly being played online. Server performance / Netcode is poor and getting worse the bigger this game grows FPS drops which didn't exist back in 2015 having constant high FPS ingame doesn't lead to a smooth online gameplay experience at all input lag player has no control to tweak configuration filesCan't recommend to new players in 2018.

This is one of those game like Minecraft that no matter what I always come back to it just to have a little fun. The maps are really good and have beautiful scenery (though I wish Aquadome didn't lag for me) and trying to get some goals with your teammates is always really fun especially when it get chaotic with everyone trying to get the ball. You still reading this review? Then go buy it. Now. $20 you will certainly not regret.November 2017 update The game is so good I'll be buying it again for Nintendo Switch.

2018-11-27,0,0,514,False,Recommended,Constantly updating content easy to rank up in MMR once you're pretty good. The ranked MMR feels really balanced lower tiers will almost always have lower tier players which helps ALOT with learning curve. The only complaint though it's also a balancing thing is when I play with higher level friends we match against a team of their level but again that really helps with balancing so that someone doesn't just get carried into higher levels. Tbh I think the rank system is one of the best out there and even though it's not the most important thing in this game it definitely shows how well made it is.,Rocket League®

This is the basic fun enjoyable game to come back to when every other game you own starts seeming boring. This game never gets boring to me and there isnt much to complain about with this one. Sometimes the community can be toxic but you can easily mute the chat and your problem is solved. Plus with the training packages offered new players can jump right into training and start getting better right away. Great game 9/10.,Rocket League®
2018-01-28,0,0,107,False,Recommended,I have played numerous multiplayer games over the years yet no game has been as compelling as Rocket League. Rocket League is uncompromising in its difficulty but those who grit it out and develop the skillset required to be proficient in controlling the offered vehicles will experience a degree of satisfaction that few modern games can rival. Dribbling wallshots aerials etc. all feel precise due to the tremendous physics engine provided by Psyonix. The gameplay in and of itself encourages you to become better and experience everything the game has to offer. Hence for those on the fence about purchasing this game don't be. Rocket League is as fun as it is addicting.Edit The community has grown far too toxic for my taste. I replayed this game after a six month hiatus and despite the gameplay being rock solid there are far too many players willing to criticize and/or mock you for a variety of reasons ranging from your username to your dribbling skills. I want to play a game where I can devote my attention to the gameplay and actually enjoy my time as opposed to reading the distasteful comments of toxic players.Edit 2 The in game toxicity once prevalent in Rocket League has been reduced significantly by the devs therefore I am changing my review back to positive.,Rocket League®

It requiers sometime to get good at the game. like doing air shots and wall hit's. but with more practice you will make it.

2018-11-12,0,0,554,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games that you can pick up at any point and just have a blast. All matches take about 5 minutes (Unless you end up in a Sudden death situation where nobody can score a goal) and each match you play takes skill and teamwork to win. There is a very high skill ceiling in this game with plenty of skill and teamwork to develop as you play but the game is very welcoming to casual players. Definitely plan on playing this game with others! I normally play in groups of three with friends and find myself shouting enthusiastically/laughing when we do things right or get lucky on a goal or save it's just a really rewarding experience.The only con I can think of is the in game voice chat. I rarely hear people use it and it normally sounds quiet/laggy when they do. It seems like in a team game this would be considered a serious issue but is one that is avoided by using the quick chat commands and discord. Otherwise this game is well worth.,Rocket League®

That aspect of the game makes Rocket League very unique. It is a Game that stresses team work even tho the majority of people that play it don't exactly understand what team work even is. The developers do some wierd things but all in all they are good about keeping the game as bug free as possible. The things I hate about the game. Mostly the community. There are some great people don't get me wrong but for the most part the immaturity level is very very low. The amount of rage you are capapble of seeing in just a few games is astounding. Sadly that does not just happen from the community. You can also see it when watching the pros stream. Basically if you love the idea of hitting a soccer ball with a car and making that car fly. This game is right up your alley. But if you get angered quick you might want to think about this purchase. Over all i give Rocket League a B+.,Rocket League®

2016-11-23,0,0,546,False,Not Recommended,"TLDR With the introduction of numerous cash grabbing tactics (i.e. Rocket pass and crates) the severe lack of ""new content"" (i.e. new stages gamemodes and other main features other than adding new paid or dlc items) and the exponentially increasing amount of bugs that surfaced in the past few months I feel that I cannot recommend Rocket League anymore... It is truly a shame that a game I would wholeheartedly recommend two years ago quickly turned into a game meant to squeeze money out of you left and right. Now don't get me wrong Rocket League is still extremely fun to play solo or with friends but with Psyonix's change of focus on paid customization items (that you can unlock by paying for 'keys' to open up 'crates' buying the dlc or paying for Rocket Pass) in newer updates I just really feel disgusted with these greedy developers...If you can get to ignore these annoyances then I am sure you will enjoy Rocket League either way. With its fun quirky controls and its simplistic hectic playstyle this game is easiy to pick up yet comprehensive to the core. At the same time you can play it in quicky bursts or even long play sessions without getting bored or fatigued. There is even casual or competitive gamemodes which allow the game to be played by any type of player.In the long run everyone has their own tastes. Even if I find paid customization items and various other things as a headache someone else might really like it. So by no means let this review steer you away from the game but rather give you some insight about the game so that you know what you are getting into. Since I've started playing two years ago the game has changed dramatically from monthly content updates (like new stages gamemodes and other quality of life improvements) to semiperiodic dull 'content updates' (like new crates paid dlc and the very rare occurance of a new stage or gamemode). So although the 'core' of the game still exists it is simply being sprinkled with bland updates that I feel are slowly ruining the game.",Rocket League®
2018-11-21,0,0,27,False,Recommended,Took awhile for me to really get a hang of the controls and to be honest I'm still not very good but the game is highly enjoyable especially when played with friends.

I hate sports games.I hate cars.I hate football/soccer.I'm in love with Rocket League. Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...Rookie You can't hit You are a disgrace to your team and the game.Semi Pro You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still Pro You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah time to get a controller head.Veteran You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!Expert You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.Master You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam ""Sorry!"" every time they do something wrong to you.Legend The most badass looking title you can have. Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Legend!""Rocketeer You can now 720 freestyle backflip reverse backwards aerial air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag but if you didn't Still prepare for another endless stream of ""You're not good enough for Rocketeer!""But in all seriousness I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). Think about it this way You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one. The game is incredible in every aspect!Wow!Wow!Wow!Chat has been disabled for 3 seconds. I love Carball Space Program This is my experience after playing the game for the first time with a friend got game made party got into a casual 2v2 match 2 a.m. window wide open forgot start match 30 minutes of rage/joy/fun/screaming someone starts bashing on my front door figure it's downstairs neighbour go silent ignore still bashing still silent/ignore almost breaks down my door have to open see who it is see cops jail imminent panic open door act nice cop says he heard me down on the street in his car with his windows closed start tting him I say the neighbour usually warns me first before calling the cops cop says it wasn't the downstairs neighbour who called but the one in the BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET almost start laughing cop asks WTF was I doing start tting him again he asks why I have the window open say I totally forgot he asks ""What game are you playing?"" he knows. I ask ""Is that a serious question?"" he says ""Don't t me I've been a gamer for 15 years what game?"" I say ""Rocket League."" he gives me a slight smile/nod of approval/understanding HE KNOWS. gives me back my ID ""Keep the noise down goodnight.""911/10 would be arrested again. If you like to be toxic and blame your teamies for your own mistake this is a must buy. 10/10 would blame my friends again. Like FIFA but more realistic In the 80s and 90s this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future rocket cars playing virtual sports TRONxSpeed Racer with the international appeal of soccer.You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy but when you're jacked in you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun no Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.Stay on target stay on target... click blarp. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!!Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made. In this game everyone just like a puppy running for a ball. After 1200 hours I consider that I haven't played long enough to post a solid review about this game yet.UPDATE After 1300 hours I'm starting to feel this game might be just a little addictive. I consider I'm now prepared to stop playing offline with bots and head to the online modes to see what they can offer.Thanks for all the support I'll keep you updated. I bought the Oculus Rift July 7th. I bought this game the 9th. I haven't touched my Oculus.10/10 would waste savings again Exactly like school nobody ever passes to me everyone pushes me around.... most fun i'd ever had playing with balls mind you. i spend a lot of time playing with balls. 11/10 best soccer car game ever! buy it !!too many modes and too many updates !",Rocket League®

2018-07-09,0,0,4234,False,Not Recommended,"Love the game but something still 3 years later makes the game very hard if not impossible to play at times. The turning is so inconsistant from day to day. Some days I cant seem to get my car to turn at all and other days I cant keep the car straight because it turns so fast. With over 3500 hrs of play time I can assure this is not in my head and Ive tried just about everything I can think of and followed every user created video to get this to go away and just be a consistant game. But sadly I cant seem to find a fix for this. I also realize not everyone has this issue but for those of us that do it makes the game very frustrating at times. I would say that I get 2 5 days a month were the game runs like I feel it should run. I feel like im turning correctly things LOOK right and the game is so enjoyable. The other 25 to 28 days out of the month its completely impossible to play.Update after Rocket Pass Update.....This game is pretty much no longer playable for me after the Rocket Pass update. Car is harder to turn more than ever. I can rule out Drivers WIndows updates IE updates Internet connection 200MB Down 50 Up controllers as I've made sure all are new and or updated. It's almost like there is a 2 3 second delay from what I do with the controller to what is shown on the screen. Deadzone at .05 and sensitivity at 2.0 and car will not turn. Devs were also no help. I feel I can no longer recommend this game if it doesnt work the same for each user. To add I willno longer be spending any money on services crates Keys updates cars Rocket Passes or anything else that has to so with this game if they can't get it working for everyone equally. I hate to let this game go but I feel I'm getting closer and closer to this point. Sadly the only people that will understand this issue are the ones that have this issue. Also I would love for the so called ""Pros"" of Rocket League to come play on one of our machines so the rest of the players and Devs of this game could see that there really is an issue.Update 10 30 18 Sadly game is still unplayable for me. I guess its time to finally uninstall this game for good! Car still turns like an 18 wheeler....Long and slow!",Rocket League®

2018-10-27,0,0,28,False,Recommended,9/10In short Rocket League is really fun. It brings back memories of playing Mario Kart 64 with my brother and sister growing up yet it manages to make its own mark as a gaming titan in the racing genre. The basics of the game are simple you and a team of fully tricked out cars battle together in a massive soccer arena to score a giant ball. Sounds weird but this game just works... really well. The mechanics are flawless and directly reflect every move you make on your controller. This makes lining up shots very helpful and takes out uncontrollable factors such as relying on an animation to complete your moves. The tutorial is really all you need to know to play and there are different games like basketabll and hockey that add variety to suit your play style. Overtime your skills will improve and the matchmaking system will automatically pair you together with teammates and opponents to keep the game challenging. At any given time there are always enough people online to play with though I found from personal eperience that anytime after 2am (CST) and before 8am you will usually find a few AFKers (almost always an opponent) and will get matched against the same people every few games. This game also offers split screen and cross platform gameplay which for me is a HUGE plus and playing with family and friends makes this game even better. However the only major downside I found for this game is its Loot Crate system. Just from playing the game you will level up and earn XP to unlock new items to trick out your car but sometimes you will earn crates that have to be opened with keys you buy with real world money from the store. However buying a key doesn't guarantuee you will unlock a specific item because the loot crates are randomly generated like a lottery ticket and when you use a key the game randomly selects one item that is usually mediocre. Thankfully in the settings menu there is an option to turn loot crates off which I highly recommend. If you do want exclusive loot I recommend linking your account with the Rocket League Twitch channel to earn free stuff from watching tournaments or just buying DLC items you know you will use. There are also plently of events throughout the year to play new game modes and earn exclusive loot free of charge. Overall this is a really fun game to play solo or can be enhanced with family and friends as the controls are easy enough for anyone to learn. The ability to customize your car adds an extra layer of depth to game to express your personality and make the game your own. There are plently of modes to keep gameplay interesting and you will always be matched with players at your level. Rocket League is good clean fun and even when you put it down to play a new game you'll usually find yourself playing a few rounds every now and again.,Rocket League®

2018-10-30,0,0,245,False,Recommended,It's pretty fun except for the few people that have to be toxic in each game but i do have a problem with the matchmaking and servers. sometimes the matchmaking is off by a lot and i get absolutely destroyed or my teammate is terrible compared to the rest of the players in that game. sometimes it's the other way around. the servers kind of suck. I get timed out from 1/5 games because the server died and it's really frustrating especially when your winning 3 to 1 with 1 minute left. those are basically the only problems though. the rocket pass is not bad and the gamemodes are pretty fun. overall not a terrible game and worth a buy,Rocket League®

You have the mecanics of a sport which are constantly involving you have the mental aspect which you have to train yourself for it. This game is at it's peak today yes there are toxic players in the game but you get that in most games yes at first it is hard but you get a feeling of achievement when you progress through the levels. This game is so much more than it used to be customizablility wise Now you can get banners frames engine sounds and such to customize your car with.There is a playerbase for everyone want to be a trader all your Rocket League life? Do it. Want to be the flashy guy all your Rocket League life? Do it. Want to trtyhard your whole Rocket League life? Do it. Want to chill/freestyle all your Rocket League life? Do it.

2018-11-21,0,0,1672,False,Recommended,Product received for free. At first glance it may seem like a simple arcadey title without much depth. But what Rocket League does have it does better than anything else out there. Psyonix absolutely nailed the game's physics... something I wish more developers would pay more attention to. The gravity the recoil from a collision the punch of the ball off the hood of your car... it feels natural and satisfying every time.Graphically everything from the cars to the background objects you don't even interact with look cutting edge. It includes a perfect level of car customizability from custom paint jobs to antenna toppers while maintaining distinctive elements that allow you to quickly identify teammates versus opponents during fast paced gameplay.And from a gameplay perspective it's perfect for this reason It's simple to pick up quite difficult to master but fun no matter your skill level. I like the fact that the team with the player with the most overall skill often doesn't win. This game rewards teamplay and strategy over all else. This is great news for someone like me who likes to fill the need of the team versus chasing the ball around like a 4 year old on the soccer field. It's interesting how I gel with certain people so much more than others. When you're truly synchronized with someone that symbiosis can make your team nearly unstoppable.Between work and family I often don't have much time to play and Rocket League offers the perfect opportunity to have a satisfying gaming experience in short period of time. With regular content releases it just gets better and better.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,1545,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a game in which you use rocket powered super cars to play fotball/soccer in a dome like arena.It's incredibly fun and I have spent many hours playing.The game gets updated frequently with free content and playmodes aswell as new DLC cars.All cars have minimal differences between each other this goes for the DLC cars aswell.However the differences are not impactful enough for anyone to call it pay to win.All Cars can be outfitted with decals boosts antennas and of course HATS!Cars usually has 5 7 starting decals you can get more from crafting crates and drops.Crates randomly drop after a match and you need keys to unlock them for a random item keys cost real money if you don't want crates you can turn of their visibility in options.The gameplay may seem pretty simple at first but the maneuvers you can pull of in air and on the ground makes for some incredible plays. Positioning adds quite a bit of depth in team matches just getting into the game it might not seem that difficult.Players whom have played the game for many hours can pull of quite incredible manuevers like precise dribbling and flying up in the air to meet the ball for an ""aerial hit"".For me this game is worth every penny and hour i have spent on it.I am sure that if you give it a try you will enjoy it immensely.",Rocket League®

2015-12-17,0,0,1675,False,Not Recommended,"Update Fall '18 (Updated) Not much has changed in RL. The community is so very toxic. Psyonix thinks their report system is supposed to fix this but I don't even think it does anything. You can report people but I never see a decrease in the number of people that call you names or go AFK to intentionally lose a match. The UI hasn't been updated to something that makes sense. ...It's just not being improved other than more crates the new rocket pass system (just a different type of crate) and did I mention crates? Still no marketpalce integration. Just a lousy experience.... the only thing good about the game is the core gameplay. but don't queue without a premade team you'll regret it.Psyonix needs to implement a system where you can ban players from being queued with you... it shouldn't be permenent but if someone intenionally loses a match or calls you names because your team mate is a giant douchenozzle you should be able to select a temporary ban from being teamed with such people. ....but this won't happen. I mean they haven't even optimized the UI and the bugs they introduce never get fixed. So I donno. GL having a good eperience...but I doubt it if you're not queuing with a premade team.Update Spring '18 Within the last couple days Psyonix has announced their spring event where they're allowing us to buy more crates and keys from them... yippee. They haven't touched the UI the community is as toxic as ever...if you want to win a competitive match all you have to do is score first. If you get scored on (even sometimes when you're tied with minutes left in the game) your team mates will vote for FF then either intentially lose on purpose or abandon the match if you don't go along with them. Casual games are filled with YouTube highlight farmers and there is a problem with smurfs and derankers in competitive play.Announced recently was the Season 7 rewards No longer will your season rewards be meaningfull to your skill rank. in all previous season you were rewarded for your gameplay with your rank's rewards.... now you will no longer get a reward associated with your ""rank."" You will get a ""tier'd"" reward. So no more blue rewards for Diamond Purple for Champ... random meaningless rewards... If I wanted random crap I'd open crates.Oh did I mention they're coming out with some IRL cars? Because I can't wait to send more money to Psyonix for multiple times what similarly priced items in the market are sold for. (like the last set of cars they produced... $10 per car... the type of car you might get out of one of those $0.25 gumball machines at the local grocery store)BTW I hope you like spending multiple times what the game is worth in keys to get any kind of decent in game item because the rarity is set so high that you'll never get what you want without spending 100s of dollars. ...to get any new items when trading expect $30 50 for any of the new items... $100+ for any rare colors. Oh and good luck getting rid of all the crap items you'll get... because there's not steam marketplace integration...so you get to keep the crap they're going to give you. You will never trade them away due to the fact that you can't sell stuff for what it's worth through a marketpalce. You have to advertise you want to trtade something on an independent site and what you're willing to accept for it then add each other to your friends liest both be online at the same time then make the trade... you know instead of having steam marketplace integration where you could just buy the item you are looking for in 1 step. Oh did I mention that 99% of the time the only way you'll be able to trade for things is if you use a key? So if you're item is worth less than a key (the vast majority of crap items found in crates) good luck.The core game is still good... the above frustration is not to say that the game is a bad game. It's not. The core game is still fantastic. ...It's just that issues with the game are not being addressed and it seems that Psyonx seems to only put R&amp D into the next crate and not the game. Why can't I select to find a new match at the end of a non comp game? Why do I have to exit to the main menu EVERY TIME if I want to search for a new non comp game? Why do I have to tab through like 4 or 5 menus to get to the same training module I go into inbetween games 99% of the time? Why not have a couple user definable training modules in the FIRST menue? Why do I have to choose between playlists that includes songs I never want to hear again or no music at all? Why do I come across Champion and Silver teamed opponents in competitive play?But hey we're getting new crates.Update Fall '17 I still play this game on a weekly basis and have (going on) 1500 hours &amp I just made it to Diamond level this season. There have been some bugs along the way...and there are some issues with the UI for people who play the game alot. But the core game is still fantastic...and even with over 1K hours into the game there's still more to learn and achieve. I still very much recommend the game.Original review This game is TONS of FUN! There's a slight learning curve but once you get the basics you're good to go. From getting the basics down you can spend as much time as you want increasing your skills in the game. There is casual and competitive servers so there's a lot of room for growth of the player in the game.I have been a nearly exclusively FPS gamer for a long time. I'm not sure I can say I've had more fun playing with family and friends with this game than with any of my FPS games. If you pick up this game and you should pick up a controller for the PC. This game is a good one to play with a controller over the keyboard and mouse. Even at the full $20 if not found on sale it's definitely worth the price particularly if you have a couple friends to play with. If you don't get a 4 pack and share with your friends.",Rocket League®

Just like real soccer it takes a while to get the hang of it and master. Its got a very high skill ceiling and I played for a good amount of time to make the conclusion that if you are willing to put time and effort into this game to get good you will enjoy this game a ton. This game becomes even more fun with friends if you have those. When you first start out the game and community may seem intimidating but once you start to get good you might just get addicted. Rocket League currently costs around $20 and if you are willing to put the time into this game it is worth it. In conclusion rocket league is an insanely fun game (if you put time into it) with a great community. I rate Rocket League an 8.4/10,Rocket League®

Every single match I have to play with bunch of toxic and arrogant people treating me like a dumbass or something. So here is my advice. Get a friend which is determined to play with you. If you won't find anybody prepare yourself for huge pain in your brain (maybe caused by brain cells committing suicide). Psyonix you should propably do something about toxicity in your game.

2018-11-08,0,0,2662,False,Not Recommended,"This game really has turned the corner to poopsville population 2 (PUBG sitting right next to it). The servers have not been maintenanced in a year maybe longer based on the lag and server performance when it comes to player v player or player v ball contact. This game used to be a go to game when other games just wouldn't do but sadly this is not the case anymore. The issue with alternate accounts appears to have also dwindled as there seem to not be as many high level players even attempting to play this game in any aspect other than scrims or LAN parties. Very unfortunate that Psyonix would allow this to happen because this is truly a game that everyone can grow to love. I personally have over 2500 hours in this game and did Love the game at one time playing for hours at a time but the love has faded and thus I can only manage a handful of games before the server issues and lack of any consistency of ball movement forces me to turn it off. I hope everyday that Psyonix finds a way to fix these issues and would come out to the ""community"" announcing actual fixes but I honestly don't hold my breath. At this point Rocket League should either be free to play or forgotten and make Rocket League 2 with completely new servers and doubling to tripling the amount of them.",Rocket League®

It's okay to just hit the ball away from the net but to angle your car the way that it lands right in front of your teammate after a good pinch to do casual ceiling shots with flip resets in it or rotating perfectly for like 2mins in front of your goal without much boost and keeping the enemy from scoring a goal is the real deal in rocket league.

2018-11-25,0,0,610,False,Recommended,No matter how many toxic players exist in the community this game is the most addicting sports game i have ever played. It is only and again only dependant on the skills of the player. Of course sometimes kick offs get very unlucky but a good player can always compensate. I always have fun while playing this game. Better with friends. You get even more pleasure once you start rising in the ranked system. Pros Supports mods and workshop items so this is a very big pro Very fun with friends Ranking system is pretty accurate so you (mostly) encounter same skill leveled players A ranked match lasts around 5mins so it is quite time efficient if you are busy throughout the day. Unless you are the unluckiest player in the world skill is the determiner on who's winning the match. Casual game modes make it even better you can just exit when you feel like it. Game gets updated often Nothing can give any advantage to any player other than their skills. Gets insanely enjoyable when you rise in the ranking system. Doesn't affect gameplay untill 100ms ping(if stable).CONS Slightly cancerous community(mostly kids spamming What a Save! in chat) you can disable chat so its okay. Sometimes opponents tend to demo you all the time which can be annoying.(it is a part of the game but still annoying) You will get addicted if you really like the game There will always be players who are better than you It requires immense amount of time to master game mechanics(this actually isn't a con but still),Rocket League®
2015-08-23,0,0,747,False,Recommended,One of the greatest games I have purchased to date. The game is complete and unexpectedly polished it looks and feels like a game that has been out for a lot longer than it has. Admittedly when first released the developers were not prepared for the success it had and the servers occasionally suffered due to such a high population. That is fixed now and unlike other Devs they have acknowledged and apologised for the problems fixing them almost straight away.Great game. 11/10 would buy again.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,143,False,Recommended,What is there to say about rocket league? It's fun fluid and fast paced. The matchmaking system is fair to all players and with a high skill ceiling this title will apeal to anyone with a competitive streak. Peformance is great even on low end machines and cross platform compatibility is a bonus. However the DLC model for the game can be seen as pointless and the introduction of a battle pass style event meant hours of grinding for little reward.Overall recommended especially with friends.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,243,False,Recommended,This is a great game in general. Despite it sort of requiring a somewhat powerful computer to see the game in beautiful quality the gameplay is amazing as it has gameplay not normally seen in other games due to all the mechanics revolving around the car the ball and the enivronment. This game definitely has a learning curve as it does teach the basics of the game but to truly be able to be skillful you have to practice a lot see a lot of self made mistakes and errors and learn from them to become a more skilled player. This game definitely is a blast when playing with a friend too but it still holds up really well just for solo play.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,1858,False,Recommended,Saw this on Doomsy's twitch stream 3 years ago and thought it looked fun. Rounded up some friends and we've been playing ever since. I've put 2K+ hours into this and despite there being no leveling gearing or advancement it has kept my attention as my main game for all these years a sign of a truley great fun game. You don't need an advancement treadmill to lure you into playing it is just fun. The advantage of that is that it doesn't matter if you take break or introduce a friend that has never played before he won't have to spend days weeks months trying to gear/level up so he can play with you. Everything is based on your skill. The community for Rocket League has been great (plenty of toxic players just like anywhere online) but easy enough features to ignore them or turn off all chat if you like. The game runs great even on older hardware and looks fantastic. The controls and feel are top notch. The esports scene is flourishing and super fun to watch. Best game to play with friends by far. The devs have done a great job of listening to their fans and adding new cosmetic gear maps game modes and being responsives to fixing issues. Servers are stable and low latency even when playing from around the world. My top game for the several years and possibly best ever.,Rocket League®

That being said the punishment system is very out of whack. I am by my own admission a ""toxic"" person and use profanity and racist slurs on a regular basis and do not apologize for that in any way. That also being said the punishment system is quite odd sometimes youll never get banned even if you know someone reported you and on the other end you can be banned multiple times for the same text in a game regardless of whether or not youve already been punished for it. All in all 10/10 would tell someone whats up again. As a sidenote the new update makes it so much better for people that dont like to have to filter themselves. Now you dont actually get banned from playing only from typing custom messages and spamming quick chat.Thanksgiving edit I'm finally decent. It only took like 400 hours but im decent.

2015-11-05,0,0,209,False,Recommended,Rocket League is just a lot of fun.Very simple game with a simple objective and I find it's a very nice casual game to play with friends when we just want to have a good time. Of course though you can take this game very seriously and play competitvely and really test your skills against everyone else.Teamwork is a huge part of this game if you're not playing 1v1 so I strongly recommend playing with people you can communicate well with and strategize with in order to make good plays and score awesome goals.The only real critizism I have is that some people who play this way too seriously like to be a holes and be stupid on the mic or in chat so be wary of that and play nice &lt 3Overall I really enjoy this game and would definitely recommend it to pretty much anyone. Whether you want a new competitive challenge or if you just want a nice casual pastime you can't go wrong with Rocket League.,Rocket League®

2018-11-26,0,0,235,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is a fun game for players of all skill levels. The simple concept of ""put the ball in the net"" gives the game an incredibly low skill floor meaning virtually anybody can pick up this game and have a good time with it regardless of their level of talent. The game also boasts an absurdly high skill ceiling thanks to the ability to launch your vehicle into the air and maneuver yourself in a wide variety of ways allowing for kinds of crazy plays from all kinds of crazy angles.The community can be kind of garbage at times but honestly the same could be said about most other communites as well.

It might take a while to start getting really good at the game but it's not that hard to learn the game does have training simulators and tries to match you up in a game with players that have simular skill level as you.

Rocket League has the perfect skill gap and learning curve out of any competitive game I've ever played. Learning in this game is fun and rewarding and because of that moments are memorable. Maybe it's first time you make contact with the ball on an aerial maybe it's the first time you score an aerial goal or maybe it's that time you pulled off the perfect flick after crossing up 2 defenders in over time. My point is if you put the time into RL you will be met with one of the best gaming experiences ever. Period.,Rocket League®

And I won't play this stupid Game!""I think some Days later after he asked me the second Time i forced myself to buy it for 19 99 .I can't do anything wrong with 19 99 thats what I've told myself.I started the Game and set all the Options i need to feel good to go.I chosed a Car...""Breakout"" maybe and started my first Match with a random Guy.The Controls of the Car were kinda good and the graphics and sound were satisfying and there wasn't anything to complain about.I rarely hit the ball and I drove like a maniac and tried everything to ""kick"" the ball into the opponents goal.After some time I managed to score and felt like a unbeatable badass!!! I played Rocket League for 2 3 Days and everything went good so far and I ranked a little bit up ( Silver I ? ) I really can't tell.I reached Silver !!! What a great feeling to rank up and now they can eat my virtual dust!

It was frustrating.I stopped playing Rocket League after some days of total devastation.I couldn't believe it and I stopped playing for some months.After this Time I could start the game again and I promised myself to get better!Now after 1000 Hours of playing the Game you can clearly see that I diddn't gave up and trained to became better!Pro's &amp Con'sI really don't want to go deep into the driving mechanics and differences between the Cars.There are a lot of Guides out there!Pro's + NO Pay 2 Win+ Cars have the same speed+ even without DLC Cars you have a good amount of Cars to choose from+ Cars can be customized ( Paint Wheels Decals Trails Boosts Topper &amp Antennas )+ different Modes to play ( Standard Competitive Dropshot Basketball Hockey &amp Rumble )+ Training Mode !+ Many Arenas ( 10 Standard 1 Seasonal 5 alternative and 6 Rocket Labs arenas )+ Good Soundtrack for the Game and from Time to Time more songs has been added through an update + Season Rewards after a Season Ends+ You get random rewards after a Match has ended+ Ranking System ( Global Rank from 1 to 74/75 and from Unranked to Grand Champion )+ You can trade your Items with other players Worldwide+ Updates after Updates with bugfixes new Content and Events !+ Rocket League has a huge community+ Fair matchmaking + Many options ( Controls Graphics Sound and misc. )+ Items from a Crate won't give you ingame advantages and you only get cosmetic stuff for you or for other CarsNeutral +/ Crates can only be opned with Keys which can be obtained by buying them through the Game.The Prices for some Keys are fair and some money will fill up the Price Pool for upcoming Tournaments.Buying Keys CAN be addictive and you might buy more Keys as you really want! So be warned !+/ High Learning Curve You are going to need a lot of Time to get better ! Don't give up!Con's Can be frustrating sometimes but that doesn't count. )Servers are sometimes unstableConclusionShort and simple...You planned to buy Rocket League to have some Fun without playing ranked / competitive? Then buy It!You planned to get good in Rocket League and have some Fun and play ranked / competitive as well ? Buy it as well but be aware of the learning curve! This won't be a smooth ride but you will get rewarded with a lot of Fun great matches solid graphics good sound and harder opponents ).Maybe im going to edit some small things later on but it won't be anything Important.Feel free to ask me down below in the comment section!See you online!",Rocket League®

2016-07-28,0,0,1598,False,Recommended,This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. When I first heard about it I was like 'a football game with cars how would that be good or fun in any way?'Here I am with almost 1000 hours on that same game I thought would be terrible.Multiple times I have stopped playing this game as I wasn't winning was bored of it and wanted something new. Each and everytime I took a break I found myself always coming back to it again and again. I also always seem to find something new to focus on everytime I play whether that be aerials dribbling defence passing etc. There is nearly always something that I found myself wanting to improve or gaining a higher rank than where I was previously.Even after 900+ hours I still find this game fun and enjoyable to play.,Rocket League®

Not much has changed to the gameplay since the beginning but new mechanics and tricks are still discovered. Lots of potential. And best thing is all the mechanics are doable with practice/effort. Although some are harder to grasp. Basically theres always room for improvement and new things to learn. While this is true for every game its more prominent in this game as the skill sets are very specific and you can almost tick off boxes of what you can and cannot do in stages. Theres also freedom of how to use these skills in different situations.Tip tho at first it may be frustrating that you cannot comprehend the game physics but trust me its worth it once you do.",Rocket League®

But the sense of satisfaction you get for winning in a ranked game is brilliant. It is definitely something you want to play with a friend if possible because as you would expect from any competitive game the community is very hostile again being competitive emotions are always high so this is to be expected.,Rocket League®

2017-10-25,0,0,722,False,Recommended,TLDR Fun to play hard to master. Tons of items to collect and deck your car out with. One of the best games I have ever played. Got it free on PlayStation Plus and loved it so much that I decided to purchase a PC copy. This game is easy to pickup and hard to master. The only issue I have is the crate and key system but that seems to be an industry standard at this point '(. Recently they did an update to let the players earn keys through playing the game which is a great idea from my standpoint. Just hoping people don't abuse it.Edit Crate / Key system not that big of a deal they implemented it well enough. The addition of Rocket Pass allows you to know what you are getting as long as you are willing to put in the time for it. Over 500 hours played and am still getting better everyday,Rocket League®

It seems pretty straight forward but you have to learn how to control a rocket. I have 1 400 hours and I am about to get champ. If you watch videos and practice and really focus you can get good.

2018-05-04,0,0,918,False,Recommended,OK so i have a good basis of they game now to finally give it a review and overall i would certainly give it a thumbs up. the game play is awesome there is always something new to learn and when you hit those nutty shots your happy meter gets a mega boost. i have yet to find this game boring and it always gets me to come back. however there are a few down falls to the game. one is the people who play mostly in rank can get really toxic and after reading other reviews i can see that its a pretty well known problem. the other huge problem with this game is the servers.i have never played a full rocket league game where i did not lag at least once and usually it does it at the worst time. with the recent update i was happy cause i thought they fixed this problem and had addressed the issue BUT NOPE instead they made the problem worse. and rocket league lag is probably the most frustrating lag in the universe because even if it lags a little you will miss the ball for sure. so at the moment its got a few issues that is does need to adress but it has given me countless hours of fun and the skill ceiling is endless so its worth it in my eyes.,Rocket League®

2016-08-05,0,0,1336,False,Recommended,vrrrrrr vrrrrr vrrrrrrrr VROOOOOM BOOOM aaaaaaaaaaRocket League is a simple game at first but has so much hidden depth once you keep playing. It's all in the gameplay. Rocket League's gameplay is unbelievably satisfying and lacks any obligatory message that many games are pay to win circa 2017 . Each match starts off relatively the same depending on if you're playing singles doubles or triples but each game will unfold differently requiring the player to adapt. As you keep playing you learn more about the game's tactics and flow and seeing yourself gain new skills and progress in gameplay is undeniably fun.,Rocket League®

2017-09-26,0,0,182,False,Recommended,To start things off if you don't want to read through this review buy it. Ah where do I begin. Graphics If you have a medium to high end PC this game is gonna be fkn beautiful. I love staring at my car with the graphics on high. Now my buddy who has integrated graphics is not getting the best visuals for obvious reasons. The game looks very colorful which I like especially in a game with an atmosphere like this one. Controls Well from what I know the controls on keyboard and mouse are weird but I think you can rebind them so not much of a problem but I play on my Xbox One controller because I prefer controllers on racing games and such. The controls feel meant to be with a controller and I have no complaints. Gameplay There are casual and competitive gamemodes so don't be too intimidated you filthy casuals. I personally have fun with both gamemodes but it can be very rage inducing when you derank in comp. But overall the gameplay and everything you can do with scoring and saving goals is always fun and doesn't get stale for me. The replay value in this game is incredible and I have over 100 hours if i'm including my ps4 hours and I still have no signs of stopping. The car customization in this game actually makes me want to trade and open crates. I love how this game isn't pay to win with their crates making it only cosmetics you get in them. Audience This game attracts pro and casual players kids and adults I feel like everyone can enjoy some part in this game. Difficulty You can make this game as difficult as you want with ranked it's gonna be hard but with some casual modes. like rumble you can just mess around and sit back. This game is what you make it. Overall the visuals are stunning the default controls are weird on keyboard and mouse but if you change it it will be fine and the controls on controller are meant to be. The audience is anyone really and there are a variety of modes to appeal to everyone. This is a great game 8.5/10,Rocket League®

It is the most addictive game I have ever played and brings me back to my days as a kid playing mario kart and leaning side to side to try to make my car turn or move faster. Especially with some of the planned updates in the next few months I think this game is going to enter the new mainstream and become one of the most popular games on the market especially when the battle royal fad dies off.

Climbing the skill ladder every season is challenging and with the addition of Rocket pass very rewarding. Can suffer in play quality if you do not have a stable internet connection and the servers can be a bit flaky when player counts are high but all around a very enjoyable experience best played with a couple friends.,Rocket League®

Product recieved with purchase of Zotac GTX 1060 6GB GPU in August 2017.I LOVE THIS GAME!I am not much of a soccer fan but this twist on soccer is amazing. The multitude of vehicles available and the many ways in which to customize them is unbelievable and more items are obtained during gameplay. Use the training areas. Play have fun meet other like minded individuals. This game is great for socializing with friends playing solo in a 1v1 match or as a solo player on a team of other solo players 2v2 3v3 it is all fun enjoyable and frustrating.You will lose but you will also win. The aerial aspect is something I have not figured out yet but it is fun trying. This game incorporates flying driving and soccer all into one.Edit 20181124 The aerial aspect still eludes me but I am working on it. This game is quite fun without aerial stunts but they do add an additional variation on the game that when done properly look quite impressive.,Rocket League®

2017-11-22,0,0,101,False,Recommended,Long Review This is a really great game to play with friends and family just hook up some controllers or go online and play some crazy matches. There are at least 3 basic game modes ranked and un ranked classic matches (soccer) hoops (basketball) snowy day (hockey) as well as rumble for some chaotic fun. The game constantly gets new maps new game modes and the DLC content is mostly aesthetic. However it is true that some cars (each car has a different hitbox) are DLC content and these automobile will come in different sizes therefore changing the area in which they can hit the ball/puck. In short Overall this is a great game with tons of game modes/ maps/ loot updated regularly. It is one of the rare cross platform multiplayer games with the Nintendo switch being one of them. Who knows maybe you can randomly match up with some of your friends playing on other consoles.,Rocket League®

There's a somewhat steep learning curve where you're just happy you made contact with the ball but once you get the hang of things it's very addictive. There's a large skill gap and now a bunch of different modes to play. I like that matches take less than 10 minutes (5 minute rounds plus replays goal kicks and possible overtime). I also like that the DLC is only cosmetics I haven't bought any of them and it hasn't affected the gameplay at all.I'm editing this review for the Steam Awards stuff. D,Rocket League®

After I was trying to learn how to do ""Jump Reset"". Jump reset is thing what u have to learn when u are in Gold or Plat... It's very popular and effective trick!

2018-11-29,0,0,130,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a wonderful multiplayer game and is great for anybody who wants more than to simply complete a game. Rocket League can be played with friends online making the game much more fun. I don't have too many bad things to say about the game but here are a few. Keys which are very important to the game are extremely hard to obtain especially for any beginners. The only way to get a key is by buying them with real money or looking in trading groups and even then keys are hard to trade for. The game can cause quite a lot of lag especially for slower computers.Other than that the game is quite enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who has read this review.,Rocket League®

Learning mechanics and constantly practicing them is probably the best way to improve and climb in the ranks. I can tell you right now that playing fast with a controller will probably bring in the most wins. Be weary of the toxic and stupid community though most people on this game aren't fun to talk to.

2016-04-20,0,0,2172,False,Recommended,"Original review here at top. FIX THE BAN SYSTEM BY REMOVING AUTO BAN BOTS AND ADD A FREAKING CENSOR FILTER. UNTIL THEN I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS TITLE.New review below this line.So it appears the auto ban system is fixed. A certain level of toxicity as the community would call it is and should always be acceptable. It is called trash talking and getting into the game. It is another way to get into your opponents head. It is not always a bad thing. In fact it is much enjoyable. However... There are too many whiny brats that can't handle a little trash talk. That should never be a bannable offense not when the option to MUTE is readily available both in text and voice there is a mute option. Now that that seems to be addressed I do have some small gripes with the ban system still. When you have a team mate that knows not how to play as a team mate and can't take a suggestion like please stop ramming me or please stop chasing the ball the team mate throws a tantrum and ultimately the game. Those jerks should have a time out. 15 minutes would be great that way you don't get stuck back in game or on the same team with them. If you report them for unsportsman like behavior it seems there is no ban in effect for it. I would much appreciate the ability to not have to play with someone that is simply going to throw games because they don't like suggestions. On that same topic of people throwing I have a lot of people throw simply because they don't like my names or support of OUR President Mr Donald J Trump. When they throw because they don't like my names they should be held accountable for their actions and appropriate bans applied. All that ban system talk out of the way.... Where do I begin. Well you could start by looking at my time played. You could start by buying the game or trying it during the free weekend events that they have. You could start by playing it at a friends house on a console system. Or you could just start by reading this review. The bots in the game for solo play do a lot of nothing for giving you a challenge but they do offer beginners the opportunity to learn the basics and skills necessary before jumping in online matches against real opponents. The season mode is fun for just that purpose but after you beat it once there really is no more fun in it. The training mode IMHO is absolutely a necessity before playing online. Learning how to hit the ball at any and all angles. Learning how to utilize your boost and get serious air to get to the ball that would otherwise fly right over your head. It is fantastic and really well put together. Other games that have ""Training modes"" don't typically offer or benefit the end user as much as this does. You simply need give it 15 or 20 minutes training and get the fundamentals down and you will be high flying and knocking those goals left and right. If after you do training and are looking to hone you skills to diamond rank or above the Steam Workshop offers hundreds of great training tools. They will get your defense to be unbreakable your offense unmatched and your ball handling better than Michael Jordans ever was guiding the ball through the air and into the opponents goal with nothing but net. It has become an addiction of mine to collect at least one of every item type in this game and in that this game has become outrageously expensive for me. I don't try to get every painted or certification for every item but I have accomplished several painted sets for standard items. What I am talking about are the cosmetics you can acquire either by playing the game and earning them or receiving loot crates and paying 5 dollars for 5 keys to open the crates. It's a standard system that seems like it is going to somewhat go away in favor of a 10 dollar season pass. It should be starting fairly soon. If they do stick with the season pass model and go away from loot boxes I can see myself saving a tad of money unless of course.... the items you earn only come from leveling up.. And I believe..... they stated that you could buy levels as well once the season pass is launched. I am not sure how I feel about this or if it will make me stop playing or play even more. One thing I do simply disagree with is the items not being able to be sold on the steam market place. As it stands many people have paid a lot of money acquiring this items and the Black Market Decals go for as much as 70 keys. BMD's and certain Painted Cars and items go for big bucks. Some of the items I would rather sell/cash out on so I could continue buying more crates or other goodies on steam or pocketing cold hard cash. It is that way for many of the other big titles on steam that have their own market place so it seems like that should be a logical next step. As for the game modes. Unranked games offer a huge range of different modes like hockey basketball and a tile breaking mode (name has slipped my mind..) The ice hockey uses a flat puck and is on ice completely changing the dynamics of how you play. Though playing the hockey is considerably easier than normal modes in that the puck unlike a ball typically stays on the ground. It gives you a chance to learn the controls and cars a lot before you go trying to chase a ball down. Basketball was the hardest mode for me to adapt to in that you have to pop the ball into the air to score. Once you get the hang of it though rank games become a lot more fun because you have learned how to control the ball both of the ground and in the air. The tile smashing game is choatic and down right hard in the beginning. It is special though and rewarding once you get your first win you will probably put a good 50 hours into it. I want to see the rocket league community grow. The rank system seems to be off because I have been stuck in gold this season but as long as my team mate isn't throwing... I dominate everyone I play. My last game before writing this was 9 2. I had 8 goals and two of them I made using my keyboard though I don't recommend the keyboard but sometimes my controller (which is a pos) acts all funny on me and I have to unplug it and replug it in and hope it wants to work. I hope more of you considering the game stop considering and make the dam purchase already. You will lose yourself to Rocket League. You will also lose any friends job significant others and family in the process but I promise you it is sooooooooo worth it. Even if you don't get the game on sale and it does go on sale a lot it is worth every penny you end up paying for it. One last mention... The music in this game is TOP TIER. It seems in almost every major update another huge album worth of original music is added. With only a handful of songs not to my liking one really can't help but be impressed with just how much there is. Though I must admit.... Infinte Power by The Fat Rat is a guilty pleasure of mine and I crank that shiit up when I need to get into the spirit and score some goals.. I thank you for taking the time to briefly go through this short review. You will love this game otherwise you need to lock yourself in your basement with all your filthy hentai and waifu games and never ever speak to civilized gamers again.. Thanks I'm out!DAM IT!! I am addicted",Rocket League®

Simply makes the people don't wanna play i just uninstalled the game and probably will leave it there its a shame because this got me many hours of struggle and fun but it's over.(Not mentioning the lag problems because of servers many experiencie)Anyways you can't really make much whit the toxic community problem and i understand that it's still a pretty good game recommended if you want to have some fun whit friends not recommended to dedicate to competitive (at least in SA).Thanks for the fun you gived me Psyonix but it's enough.gg.,Rocket League®

2018-12-01,0,0,816,False,Recommended,No matter how good you get you'll always feel like trash. It's not like Fortnite where if you've played for long enough you can go ham on a couple of defualts/bots. No in this game you're always matched up against playes with similair skill to yours. Although according to Rocketleague I'm pretty high up in rank (Champ II in 3v3) I still feel like I'm at this game. This game gives you some insight on what it's like having a unloving father. No matter how hard you try no matter how many hours no matter how much effort you put into this game you'll never feel like you're enough.So if you've always had a loving and supporting father (figure) in your life definitely worth checking this game out! All in all fun game don't bother with trading and lootboxes though. Every item you own eventually gets boring so much so that I'm currently rocking default set up with a ton of keys worth of items in my inventory.Am looking for some folk to play with and a doubles partner atm (Diamond III 2v2 EU servers).

2018-12-01,0,0,226,False,Recommended,I KONGRESSEN 4 juli 1776Den enhälliga deklarationen av Amerikas tretton förenta staterNär det under den mänskliga historiens gång blir nödvändigt för ett folk att upplösa de politiska band som har förbundit dem med ett annat folk för att bland världens makter inta den självständiga och jämbördiga ställning som både naturliga och gudomliga lagar berättigar dem till krävs av respekt för världsopinionen att de redogör för orsakerna bakom separationen.Vi ser dessa sanningar som självklara att alla människor är skapade jämlika att de av sin skapare har tilldelats vissa oförytterliga rättigheter och att rätten till liv frihet och strävan efter lycka finns bland dessa att regeringar har inrättats bland människorna för att säkra dessa rättigheter och att regeringarna erhåller sina befogenheter genom de styrdas samtycke att närhelst någon styrelseform motverkar dessa mål så är det folkets rättighet att förändra eller upphäva denna styrelseform och att inrätta en ny enligt de principer som för folket framstår som de mest troliga att påverka deras trygghet och lycka. Klokheten påbjuder att styrelseformer som inrättats sedan lång tid tillbaka inte bör ändras av alltför lättvindiga eller flyktiga skäl och likaledes har all erfarenhet visat att människor är mer benägna att lida om det onda är uthärdligt än att avskaffa de styrelseformer vid vilka de har vant sig. Men när en lång kedja av missbruk och övergrepp uppenbarar en medveten plan att försätta dem under total despotism så är det folkets rättighet det är deras plikt att avskaffa en sådan styrelseform och att skapa nytt skydd för sin framtida säkerhet. Sådant har dessa koloniers tålmodiga lidande varit och sådan är nu nödvändigheten av att förändra dessa koloniers tidigare styrelseformer. Den nuvarande kungen av Storbritanniens historia är en historia om upprepade oförrätter och övergrepp vilka alla haft som direkt syfte att upprätta ett oinskränkt tyranni över dessa stater. För att styrka detta låt fakta framläggas inför en öppen värld.Han har vägrat att godkänna lagar som är synnerligen viktiga och betydelsefulla för det allmännas bästa.Han har förbjudit sina guvernörer att anta lagar som varit av omedelbar och tvingande betydelse såtillvida inte redan stiftade lagar har upphävts till dess att hans godkännande har inhämtats och när de så har inhämtats så har han fullständigt struntat i att behandla dem.Han har vägrat att godkänna andra lagar för inkvartering av stora delar av befolkningen såtillvida dessa människor inte avsäger sig rätten till representation i den lagstiftande församlingen en rättighet som för dem är ovärderlig och som endast av tyranner kan ses som mindre betydelsefull.Han har sammankallat lagstiftande församlingar till udda och obekväma platser långt ifrån förvaringsstället för offentliga handlingar med det enda syftet att trötta ut dem så att de tillmötesgår hans åtgärder.Han har upprepade gånger upplöst folkrepresentationen för att den med oförfärad fasthet motsatt sig hans övergrepp mot folkets rättigheter.Han har under lång tid efter sådana upplösningar hindrat nya församlingar från att bli valda varefter den lagstiftande makten som aldrig kan försvinna återgått till folket som helhet alltmedan staten under tiden har varit utsatt för alla farorna vid en invasion utifrån och inre omvälvningar.Han har ansträngt sig för att hindra bosättning i dessa stater och med detta i åtanke har han obstruerat lagar för utlänningars möjlighet till medborgarskap vägrat att anta andra lagar för att stimulera migration till dessa stater samt skärpt kraven för överlåtelse av markområden.Han har obstruerat rättsapparaten genom att vägra ge sitt godkännande till lagar om domstolars inrättande.Han har gjort domare beroende av sin egen goda vilja avseende deras ämbetsperiod samt beloppet på och utbetalningen av deras löner.Han har inrättat en mängd nya ämbeten och sänt hit svärmar av tjänstemän för att plåga vårt folk och tära på dess välstånd.Han har i fredstid haft stående arméer stationerade hos oss utan samtycke från våra lagstiftande församlingar.Han har avsett att göra militären oberoende av och överordnad den civila makten.Han har gått samman med andra för att ställa oss under en lagstiftning som är främmande för vår konstitution och ej i enlighet med våra lagar genom att ge sitt bifall till deras påstådda lagar För att inkvartera stora grupper av väpnade truppstyrkor hos oss För att skydda dem genom skenrättegångar från straff för mord som de skulle begå mot dessa staters invånare För att skära av vår handel med alla världens delar För att pålägga oss skatter utan vårt medgivande För att i många fall beröva oss fördelarna med en juryrättegång För att transportera oss bortom haven för att döma oss för påstådda lagöverträdelser För att avskaffa det fria systemet av engelska lagar i en grannprovins och där tillsätta en maktfullkomlig regering och utvidga dess gränser så att den på en gång blir till ett mönster och passande redskap för införandet av samma oinskränkta styre i dessa kolonier För att beröva oss våra frihetsbrev upphäva våra mest värdefulla lagar och i grunden ändra vårt styrelsesätt För att upplösa våra egna lagstiftande församlingar och ikläda sig själva makten att lagstifta över oss i vilka fall som helst.Han har frånsagt sig styret här genom att förklara oss utanför hans beskydd och genom att föra krig mot oss.Han har plundrat våra hav skövlat våra kuster bränt våra städer och ödelagt vårt folks liv.Han håller i detta ögonblick på att överföra stora arméer av utländska legosoldater för att slutföra dödens förödelsens och tyranniets förehavanden som redan har påbörjats med en grymhet och falskhet som knappast har något motstycke ens i de mest barbariska tider och som är fullständigt ovärdigt ledaren för en civiliserad nation.Han har tvingat de av våra medborgare som tillfångatagits på de öppna haven att bära vapen mot sitt land till att bli deras vänners och bröders bödlar eller till att själva falla för dessas händer.Han har anstiftat till inbördes uppror oss emellan samt ansträngt sig för att uppvigla invånarna i våra gränsområden de skoningslösa vilda indianerna vilkas välkända krigföring innebär ett obönhörligt dödande av alla människor oavsett ålder kön och tillstånd.Vi har vid varje övergrepp i allra ödmjukaste ordalag bett om upprättelse. Våra upprepade skrivelser har besvarats endast med upprepade kränkningar. En furste vars karaktärsdrag sålunda vid varje handling motsvarar en tyranns är olämplig att regera över ett fritt folk.Inte heller har vi undlåtit att uppmärksamma våra brittiska bröder på förhållandena. Vi har från tid till otid varnat dem för försök från deras parlament att utsträcka en oberättigad lagstiftning över oss. Vi har påmint dem om omständigheterna kring vår emigration och bosättning här. Vi har vädjat till deras inneboende rättsmedvetenhet och storsinthet och vi har besvärjat till våra gemensamma släktband för att de ska ta avstånd från dessa övergrepp som oundvikligen skulle störa våra förbindelser och vår korrespondens. Även de har varit döva inför rättfärdighetens och blodsförvantskapets röst. Vi måste därför slå oss till tåls med den nödvändighet som påbjuder vår separation och se på dem på samma sätt som vi ser på resten av mänskligheten fiender i krig i fred vänner.Vi representanterna för Amerikas förenta stater församlade till allmän kongress och vädjande till den högsta domsmakten i världen att se det berättigade i vårt uppsåt kungör och örklarar högtidligt i namn av och med bemyndigande av folket i dessa kolonier att dessa förenade kolonier är och med rättighet bör vara fria och självständiga sater att de är lösta från alla trohetsförbindelser till den brittiska kronan och att alla politiska förbindelser mellan dem och Storbritannien är och bör vara fullständigt upplösta och att de som fria och självständiga stater att de är lösta från all XD,Rocket League®

The physx of the game are perfect (obviously since its the whole point) and tbh its really rare to find bad netcode in respect with my 40 hrs ingame so far. Multiplayer offers a wide variety of different game modes which also reduce the chance of u getting bored as they can all match different playing styles of various players... Lastly the training in rocket league ACTUALLY works as in you will see amazing differences in your gameplay unlike many other games.,Rocket League®

However the community is the crapiest I have ever seen full of scammers (and I mean FULL of them!) full of the most toxic people you will find on Earth and it even has appalling support features like if you get scammed and report the scammer psyonix litterally wont give two ! Unfortunatly due to this the game is packed with these dip every 1 in 10 games I play I find a trash talker every 1 in 5 trades I do is a ing scam (Stay away from trades with more than 24 items these are probably 90% a scam). Apart from the 1 in a thousand gleaming good hearted people that are trustable and nice you will find that literally everyone in this game are toxic no for good scamming ! (Excuse the language) Now I have spent 10 minutes tying this so you can probably tell I am I suggest if you are to buy this game stay away from the trading aspects as this game has one of the worst you have ever seen.

2018-12-17,0,0,175,False,Recommended,"I don't like playing sports games a whole lot the sports games that I do like were the old NFL and NBA Street games. Unfortunately I wasn't much into this game when it first came out since I found the hype of it super annoying. I got over myself recently thankfully so I could enjoy this fun game.In this game you'll find a diversely themed map selection many different maps and modes that don't follow the 'classic' layout or themes that can shake things up when you're frustrated or bored with the classic layouts or modes. Mechanics of the cars are pretty solid and the ball hit detection is always accurate which is one thing I was worried about. Graphics are good it runs well you don't need to worry about performance issues.Overall the game is super fun but I do have criticisms.I suppose to sell the game for $20 the developers decided to go the lootbox route for cosmetics. While this is the best and non intrusive way of introducing extra paid content for the game I would personally much rather pay for the items that I want rather than this artificially applied rare status with lootbox RNG. For example if there is a paintjob that I really want but is considered very rare I most likely will not get that from the myriad of lootboxes that they have in this game you only get one item from each lootbox and they don't all have the same items within them. You can indeed see which lootboxes have which items but it's rather frustrating to not get what you want and the item that you do receive you cannot use since it is for a specific car that you may or may not have or don't like to begin with.I will add though that I think Rocket Pass is a good idea I guess they took cues from Fortnite. I can work toward certain cosmetics every Rocket Pass season and through leveling up I can attain ""seasonal"" items. Great idea I like this better than lootboxes.One other criticism that I have is the what it seems anyways lack of player control on who they play with. I come across many many toxic players (even on your own team) who want to spam chat with ""What a save!"" multiple times when you miss a block but when you do the same in return only once you are met with them typing into chat how much of a &lt pick a derrogatory term&gt you are and that you should quit the game.You are able to report people in this game for chat abuse harassment or unsportsman like conduct but I don't have any insight on how this affects matchmaking. I would rather the people who constantly get reported for that type of thing to get matched up together rather than matching up toxic people with people who are just playing casual (not ranked) and aren't worried about winning or losing.I would say that 30% of the time I get matched up with toxic players who think of themselves as Rocket League gods and everyone else is beneath them. When I don't get matched up with these types of players though the game is very enjoyable and fun to play inbetween workout sets.",Rocket League®

It's obviously better to play with friends but just like most players above Platinum I play this game solo most of the time. It can be frustrating if you have bad teammates in a ranked game and the community is toxic in game for no reason sometimes but that's only one part of it. The game itself is very fun and has a steep learning curve that makes it rewarding to progress. The only downside and feature I would like to see implemented would be a way to transfer items from PS4 to PC.,Rocket League®

2018-11-15,0,0,10,False,Recommended,Great fun game. This can be counted as a pro or a con but the game is borderline addicting especcially when holidays or events come around and you can play to get points and buy items.Demolitions are broken and need to be fixed (or at least feel broken)I absolutely hate that you cannot add a person from PS4 to your party if you are playing on PC but can play with them if you creat a private match and have them join.This game is not something you dabble in if you want to become good it requires a lot of time and practice as it has an extremely high skill cap and is difficult for beginners. This though is not necesarilly a bad thing but simply something to take note of if you wish to play well/If I could rate this 1 10 I would give it an eight.Also I boughy the game then the next day it went on sale so I'm sad about that.,Rocket League®
2018-11-16,0,0,661,False,Not Recommended,Was really into the game when I first saw it. Played alot and got some friends to play with. But as time went on psyonix kept adding more and more customisations crates etc. Being the person that I am I am used to buying some cosmetics and when they added the rocket pass I took it as a sign that Psyonix just needs money and the sistem is the same as in fortnite. And this is just the money bragging side that I don't like there's also matchmaking. But I won't baby rage about it.All in all its a great game and very addictive.I would recommend it but i have too much hatred towards this game.

You practice grasping the physics in the game (gravity boosting speed and turning speeds) then you start to really have fun. Even a simple hop before u hit the ball changes the height the ball bounces and that is enough to have me laughing when it gets passed opponents. No headaches in this game except from own mistakes with timing jumps but there is so much action soon after that the kicks and joys overwhelm a few mistakes. Even my terrible defense caught on slow mo replays from accidental own goals make me laugh. Enjoy the game it is often on sale.

I played it as a casual player for about a year bc the matches are fast to get and are done in about 5 min. always fun to play better with friends whether your screwing around or trying to go into competitive games and win. all in all the community is ok ( can be toxic at times ) the player base is very high skill level ( if you are trying to learn and become a great player ) and is always showing you something you can do differently and effectivly in game thats what makes the most fun in my opinion having to just figure something new out that does or doesnt make sense but just works. 9/10 on a bad day.,Rocket League®

It's a game dunno why some people take it so seriously lol.Well whats the problem? The problem is that Snow and Hoops were both casual modes and both had really friendly player bases. Now it's ranked ONLY. No more casual option which means it's just full of toxic players.For the people that say ""just hide ranking on snow"".......your missing the point. When it was casual I could just jump out if I didn't gel with my teammates (read as get fed up of watching teammates ball chase to only end up missing 95% of the time). Now I'm stuck usually with players that won't forfit even if you were 100 0 down. Turns a 5min fun game into a 15min torture round.Hardly as much fun anymore I'll play a couple of rounds and end up turning it off.",Rocket League®

2019-01-05,0,0,122,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of those games you really don't expect to be as good as it is.In Rocket League you take on your opponents in an exciting match of car soccer reminding you of those few Top Gear episodes. Where it differs from reality is the ability to jump boost and combo your way into the enemy's goalpost. While the central theme is teamwork and cooperation you might just choose to play duels 1v1 style if that's what you prefer.The most exciting thing about this game is the amount of customization making each car feel unique with hundreds of decals hats boosts goal explosions and much more.Gameplay wise there's around three dozen maps to play on each with its own feel and visuals such as background explosions when scoring goals. The only cons would be the community itself which has the classic sportsmanship salt that comes with it and the amount of DLC most of which useless since the best car at least the one most used in pro play is the one you start with.Would definitely recommend buying especially during the sale in which the price is just 10 .,Rocket League®

It's very hard for me to find cons to this game but i'd say the lack of options for singleplayer could be considered one even more so since the AI in this game is dumb af.

2019-01-06,0,0,799,False,Recommended,"This game is awesome!Rocket League is the result of a really dope concept combined with a masterful execution and is one of the main esports games out there due to its high skill ceiling as well as being so fun that you can enjoy it regardless of your skill level.The initial difficulty curve is quite high though but learning the controls comes naturally and the phrase ""Practice makes perfect"" becomes crucial. This means that in order to become great at it you need to put in a lot of time and effort. This isn't neccesarily a bad thing but something important to note for most people. Either way it can still be quite a lot of fun even if you aren't skilled at it!The thing is with this game though you have to be careful not to take it too seriously. This is both a casual and competetive game and one can easily slip into a negative mindset rather easily if things don't go too well. (See Tilting) Despite this however taking a break and trying to look at this with a mindset of playing for fun can really make a difference in whether or not you'll keep playing the game.I love this game but the players can sometimes be straight up asses. Don't worry though that's with every mutliplayer game. Just remember that this is meant to be fun and what other people say doesn't make a difference in the end and you'll be fine!I have a lot of hours in this game and for good reason too.

2018-10-27,0,0,1815,False,Recommended,"This is my favorite multiplayer game by hours played (1700 at this writing). This game has very few mechanical quirks at this point other than the beloved physics which have been unchanged since the beginning. The game very rarely crashes and the performance is fairly consistent which gives me great confidence in the engine when playing. I love opening the crates and I am happy to support the game in order to open them. This game is one where your skill ""solidifies"" as you take breaks from the game. I feel as if my ability is completely second nature and effortless but when I first started I was a mess. I really love how in awe of the skill this game made me feel. I felt motivated to achieve greater levels of skill in ways I had never enjoyed in a game. I typically am a casual gamer but I love playing competitive Rocket League.This game is a steal at any price because you rightly should put thousands of hours into it.",Rocket League®
2018-09-01,0,0,538,False,Recommended,Gotta get this going before the pass comes out and a bunch of new players come in.

Team based and sucks you in for hours at a time.,Rocket League®

2018-10-28,0,0,250,False,Recommended,This game is overall fun though I am a bit sad that you can not add people you end up paired with randomly in matches as friends. Also I am not entirely a fan of the cross platform play between consoles and PC's as sometimes harrassment happens. There is also some issues with lag as the game is not ultimately optimized if you do not have a spectacularly high graphics rigged computer. Either way though it is an amazing game that I still love playing and will continue to play despite the lag.,Rocket League®

2016-01-24,0,0,140,False,Recommended,Great gameplay lots of competitive players and lots of moments that make you inch forward in your seat toward the screen. Requires a fair amount of skill if you want to rank up to higher levels. Use the training mode in the menu to practice goalie shots striker shots and aerials. I personally find it easier using a controller. The customizability of cars gives everyone their unique personality. Diversity of maps make the game look nicer so it isn't so bland with the same map every game. Different modes allow for uncalled for moments and goals which is definitely seen in modes like Rumble and Dropshot. Other modes include 1v1 through 4v4 so you can play with or against friends. Crate system is okay I'm not into that type of stuff because it doesn't seem worth it to pay money for in game items. The only thing I dislike is the community. Whether the other team wins or loses they will always throw salty hate comments at you and leave the game. Other teams harass players and some are rarely seen sabotaging the match on purpose. Some players do actually say 'gg' and leave quietly without saying anything harsh. There's also the occasional chance you can play with or against Rocket League developers which is fun. Great price choice of $20 costs less if you want to buy some copies for your friends.TL DRAmazing game with diversity customizability and fun. Toxic community. Skill required.9/10.,Rocket League®
2018-10-31,0,0,639,False,Recommended,Rocket League is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It's playable by a variety of age groups. There is room for both casual players looking for fun and laughs and there is also a very competitive scene for people looking to grind through the ranks.

2015-11-16,0,0,1163,False,Not Recommended,This is the most flawed toxic game you could ever have the misfortune of playing. Unless you are amazingly talented at it or have a team of friends instead of random team mates. Otherwise you will never be able to progress due to the appalling matchmaking. It ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime one minute someone is carrying you with air dribbles the next your team mate can hardly judge the ball. Once the crates came in well that was the end of it as there is seemingly an endless number of people only worried about items rather than actually playing the game. In a nutshell this game has made me hate gaming hate society and my life. Do yourself a favour and avoid it at all costs.,Rocket League®

I played as a Silver then i started playing Rocket League on Ps4 but then when I got my new PC I bought Rocket League and started to learn from there by looking on tutorials and by watching the pros play in tournaments and in the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS). My favorite team in RLCS is C9C9 is a trong team and i like their formation that are standing Gimmick SquishyMuffinz and Torment. They have a great chemistry and a good defence of play they rotate good and their passes are insane. I like Squishy most because he has great talent that inspiring every player on the field he creates opportunity and he have learned his skills all by himself.I rate this game 10/10 and I recommend this game because it is really fun when you are good as a champ ),Rocket League®

2017-12-12,0,0,233,False,Recommended,"(skip to the bottom of the page for an actual review)10 rare octane decals (that I already have) from crates out of 10 would get ranked against players significantly better than me for no reason whatsoever again. It's such a good game I wrote a short and descriptive essay just now about the game.So you're gonna get this cool game you saw on the internet because your favorite youtuber made a video about it in 2014. I'd like to give you a quick all you need to know in one guide to this magnificent game Casual is pretty casual when you're not getting cussed out by the enemy team or getting a 7 game losing streak. When I first started playing competetive I was like ""Wow cool! A bunch of players that are better than me and oh my teammate left after they scored once cool."" And then it got better so that my teammates wouldn't randomly leave and I was like ""Wow cool! A teammate that is ranked in silver doubles like me! Maybe he'll be really good and oh he own goaled again cool. It's 2 7 now and we have 14 seconds left awesome!"" So I stopped playing competetive as much unless if I felt really freakin amazing at the game after warming up. Then I'd go down 4 divisions in 30 minitues and write this review. But the graphics and gameplay are pretty cool. The devs are dilligent and are always adding cool new crap creating awesome special events to get limited stuff that literally everyone else has ignoring the ranking system issues and giving you free useless crates which costs 149 beautiful priceless pennies to open a singular box of poo instead of that one cool hat or boost effect you've been wanting. But it's OK because I have a bunch of friends that get me $20 steam gift cards and crap for my birthday. Here's some detailed instructions on how to open a crate Buy some keys in a pack so they're cheaper open the crate and say ""WOW! I got another octane ZSR or whatever decal to add to my collection of untradable garbage rare items!"" Then you repeat this exact same process with every key you have left until the $20 Steam gift card your friend gave you have has gone to complete waste but hey there's a chance you might get that cool octane ZSR or whatever that looks exactly like the default octane from afar and then you'll be able to use all the cool decals that look like abstract art from any more than 10 feet away. So you got maybe let's say one cool import car from the 37 crates you opened. Awesome! There's really no downside to that exept if you suck once and your teammate cusses you out for ""having cool stuff but acting like a noob"" but it's fine because it only says you're a pro on your rank. That means the only people you'll get ranked against are noobs like masters legends and freaking rocketeers so there's really nothing to worry about. The trading system is pretty cool. You can take 5 priceless uncommon hats to get a freaking fedora or you can trade in the 5 rare octane ZSR or whatever decals to get a very rare one and oh what's this? ""Trading in this object will result in a non tradable even crappier object!"" Hmm... That seems fine to me guess I'll just oh you can't trade decals from different collections? Well I'll just go play some games to earn more XP that literally does nothing but give you harder opponents that do ariels faster and better than you and useless crates that promise cool stuff but end up giving you wheels which are significantly worse than your current set.In all seriousness this is a truly mouthwatering salad with chicken. I would recommend this appetizing cheese quesadilla to literally anyone as it is my all time favorite luscious ham and cheddar sandwich and that's coming from a guy who has hardly even played this savory steak meal compared to most people. The gameplay is tasty the physics are delicious the graphics are scrumptious the devs are very well done and they release flavorful patches and new spicy events pretty quickly. If this game were a beverage it would be banned because it's so freaking addicting and overall exquisitely pleasing to the taste buds. Just buy the game already it's worth more than a turkey dinner at your grandma's house.",Rocket League®

2017-10-04,0,0,140,False,Recommended,The ranking system is so bad. At the start of every season u can't win. Let's say you're just a beginner with a bronze rank in the previous season when the new season comes for the first many days you can't play ranked because of everyone being the same rank. It's just awful. You can literally play against someone that was platinum in the previous season and get beaten every time. I don't see the point of a a completely new rank after every season. The game is good and fun to play with friends but 1v1 is too imposibble to play in ranked if you have recently just started.P.S. If you are gonna be saying that ''Then don't play 1v1'' playing 2v2 with a random player is just as bad. If you have friends to play it with great. If not then good luck and try to play as much training as you can but I hope the ranking system could change a little to help the new guys.,Rocket League®

Yes even though rocket league is soccer with bumper cars a lot of people who tell me they aren't into sports games say they love rocket league. Some mechanics take a little bit of time to learn and even longer to master especially as you progress towards higher ranks. But most can agree that no matter how many hours you play nothing is most satisfying than sinking a complex or calculated goal. This game has a great single player option but I'd highly recommend playing with friends. Also kudos to Psyonix for cross platform gameplay.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,94,False,Recommended,"Easily my favourite esports game. Tight responsive controls limitless technical creativity satisfying gameplay.It's like playing soccer when you're a kid you start off being able to barely think of anything besides ""MUST HIT BALL"". You can barely shoot. Nobody wants to defend. Passing? lol.But then you learn. You realize that not every touch is a good idea. Your coordination improves. You get better at hitting the ball and even eventually aiming it. You realize that you can influence the game without touching the ball stealing boost from your opponents and demoing them. You start being able to control the ball. You pass the ball to create a better chance. You get in a posistion to score instead of chasing the ball. You've finally mastered the fundementals.You improve your advanced mechanics and you climb. It's wonderful. There is no better feeling in the world.

Ive played it on PS4 for about a year and i can say within the 2 days ive owned it on PC due to steam sale i can say its a better feel and control on PC then Console. Locked at 30 FPS on PS4 kinda sucks but you get use to it. The only real downside is that you CANNOT transfer stuff between them currently hopefully they change that in the future. But you can play against Console which is a plus but its almost like cheating i guess. Overall PC wins again. Great game good community.,Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,90,False,Recommended,2016 A thoroughly enjoyable game that makes time melt away when you play it. For a game to play with your friends it is one of the best out there. All items can be dropped and there's never any need to spend money for skins or such things as even the low rarity ones are cool. Never crashes and always runs smooth.2018 edit I exclusively play this with friends otherwise it really isn't as fun. Same thing with drops and grinding the events is fun to get those items you really want. Only issue now is that the servers can be iffy sometimes as is well known within the community. Doesn't take away from the game too much though. Still worth it to play.,Rocket League®

It's a paid game that uses randomness to prey into people to spend more. Because they don't give advantage in game does not mean they have not used all the tricks in the books to entice you to spend money. So honestly boycott the game. We can we should have better games.

It's the type of game where you realize how bad you were when you started and are proud of how far you've come over the time you've played.

My only gripe is that they promised cross platform parties and it was originally supposed to release back in september but they've pushed it back multiple times with the current ETA being sometime next year.,Rocket League®

2018-10-27,0,0,909,False,Recommended,How do i say it? The game good depends on where you live and what style play. If your in the EU gl hf because the servers are dead trash. I (live in england) have better ping in na around 70 than eu (at least 140) . Im not so domb to say oh yeah this games trash cause servers are bad or all . Neither would i say that you need to put all your team on servers as not everyone knows how to format network code. But seriously me and my friend have played this game for ages (me 800+ hours and my friend near 2000) and when we started (season 3) this game had no network problem. I think personally that the implement of items has put a load on the servers as they have to exchange more data to keep track of the cars visuals. Eu servers need a fix.

2017-03-15,0,0,317,False,Recommended,"This is one of those rare games that I have 100% loved from my very first game to my most recent. Rocket League has always been a very consistent game with developers that listen to the community and continue to provide updates on a regular basis. I played Rocket League on PS4 back when it first released and loved it so much I had to buy it again when I switched to PC gaming. The newest Rocket Pass has added a fun sidebar to the game although I think they could improve it by adding daily or weekly challenges. Right now it's just a matter of playing enough matches and earning enough XP to level up your Rocket Pass. I think adding ""challenges"" like ""Score 3 goals"" or ""Center 5 balls"" would add more incentive for players to grind for the next Rocket Pass tier.",Rocket League®

Absolute amazingi would go so far to call it the best E sport game ever.Pros absolutely no pay to win incredible amount of car design possibilities smooth gameplay unlimited skill ceiling awesome E sport tournaments very active devs awesome player base ( most of the time ) and many more . too much to list rn. ( and believe it or not the support is incredibly fast ) Cons??? there are not really any downsides but there are some things that are pretty annoyingthings like unreliable servers ( you get a bad server around every 30 50 games ) you have to have a good ping to play normal and a minority of salty players . Also you can get pretty angry if you loose. i once even smashed my controller at my wall .Rocket league is truly a masterpiece. I have around 3000h on Pc and Ps4 and it never gets boring. if you have a bad day at RL or think ur bad just dont let yourself down and keep calm its calculated .THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE,Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,4,False,Recommended,OverviewRocket League is the perfect example of a simple idea executed the correct way. It doesn t need complex progression or diverse player choices to keep it fun it s just fun as it is. You ve got fast rocket powered cars that can jump or fly around and you use them to knock a ball into your opponent s goal. That s all there is to the core gamemode. It is so rare these days that a game with an idea this basic actually ends up being a fully fledged successful title. Rocket League is a great change of pace and it has earned a lot of respect from me. Rocket League s main gamemode Soccar as Psyonix likes to call it is certainly a simple idea that anyone can get into but it is in no way easy. The controls in this game are easy to learn they work well and are fluid but learning how to properly maneuver your vehicle in order to hit a moving ball at the right angle to get it to go where you want is another story entirely. If you re playing Rocket League you ve likely played other racing games and understand the basics but controlling a car in this manner is an incredibly unique experience. Even people who have hundreds of hours in ranked played still fail to properly control their car as they re flying through the air. It is definitely a game that encompasses the idea of easy to learn hard to master. While the standard Soccar gamemode is certainly the most well known and commonly played it isn t actually the only thing Rocket League has to offer. First I should note that Soccar does have some slight variants including 1v1 2v2 3v3 as well as ranked versions of each. The game has always had a solid competitive scene so if that s your thing this is a good place for it. There are sorts of other less serious gamemodes as well. As Psyonix comes up with more fun things to do with rocket cars I m sure we ll see even more added or rotated in. Currently there are Hockey and Basketball modes which play much like how you d imagine they would with fast cars. There is also a chaotic 4v4 Soccar mode a mode revolving around cooldown based powerups that can do crazy things like teleport switching with an enemy or summoning a tornado to toss the ball and other cars around. GameplayRocket League is a fast paced sports/racing game where quick reactions and planning are essential. Personally I am not a big fan of most racing games and practically no sports games however Rocket League really earns its own different place around those genres. I would highly recommend just checking out a video or two from professional Rocket League tournaments it should be quick to notice how some people are so passionate about playing and watching this game. If you re not the competitive type Rocket League still certainly has plenty to offer you. Either playing with friends in casual matches or privates matches against one another is an immense amount of fun. That can be said about many games but you aren t going to find another game like this out there right now. It should also be noted that this is one of the very few games out there that supports cross platform matchmaking and parties. It doesn t work between every possible combination of platforms but it does with most of the following PC PS4 Xbox One and the Switch. GraphicsThe arenas in which you play in are all relatively small this is not an open world game. For this reason they are able to implement absolutely gorgeous arenas and backdrops while still maintaining very good performance across most computers. As time goes on Psyonix continues to add more beautifully themed maps all of which essentially play out the same but add some pleasant variety that make each match just that much more interesting. The maps aren t the only beautiful thing they certainly didn t want their rocket cars to get jealous of their environment. All the different cars perform practically the same with only some slight difference in hitbox and handling. However there are such a wide amount of options that most anyone should be able to find one that they love to look at. There are many free or paid cosmetic options for car bodies wheels cute hats or even things like boost trails or goal explosions!User InterfaceThe UI is as sleek and sexy as the rest of the game. Psyonix continues to make improvements to it but it has always been very well designed. It s easy and fast to get into whichever kind of match you d like. You can see news and patch notes ingame and also easily see which song the ingame playlist is currently on. ControlsI believe most people would prefer to play this with a controller and that s surely what it s mainly designed for. However I have always played on Mouse and Keyboard and I ve never felt the controls to be awkward or difficult. Everything is easily rebindable as well on either control scheme. AudioCar engines roaring crowds cheering goal horns blaring what s not to love? All of the expected sound effects of a rocket powered soccer game are here and they are quite satisfying. There are even some options for different engine or boost sounds for your car. Most of the music of Rocket League consists of EDM and other fast paced electronic style music which is of course very fitting for the aesthetic of the game. The game has some solid original songs as well as an increasingly large amount of options for other indie groups that fit into the game equally as well. In 2017 Monstercat also partnered with Psyonix allowing Rocket League to feature their new songs ingame via their very convenient Rocket League Radio .Final ThoughtsRocket League is a game as much as it is a show. The style and implementation of the game allows for it to be a very strong esport due to the high skill ceiling and the excitement of watching it. As competitive as it gets it also has plenty of fun to be had for even the most casual gamers out there. It s an incredibly unique game and really stands alone outside of games from the same genres. This is the type of game that really will just come to someone s personal preference of whether they will play it or not. It isn t held back in any way by performance or catering to only a specific audience it s truly a game I believe that anybody can love.If you have the time please consider checking out my Patreon!,Rocket League®

2018-11-25,0,0,291,False,Recommended,TL DR Great game! Overall 8.5/10 Community 7/10 Graphics 8/10 Customization 9/10 Easy to learn hard to master You'll start getting basic mechanics after 10 20 hours of play but then soon realize that you know absolutely nothing when you see people flying in the air doing trick shots. This is either a huge plus or minus for people. If you have the dedication required to get good than you won't find yourself lacking. If you want to immediatelly have the game mastered then this isn't for you. At the same time if you don't want the pressure of playing online with others than you can always hit up the singleplayer against AI. Though I will say the AI is lacking severely in my opinion and is only good if you don't care much about a competitive experience. Generally play on easy for other games? Singleplayer is for you. Community is hit or miss when it comes to either trolls or kind fellows. One game your teamates and fellow competitive enemies are great the next both are constantly flaming or simply insulting you for the car that you use. Having a friend to play with offers the best experience and is really how the game is meant to be played. While I have found a few gems when it comes to online friends that's exactly what they are. Gems. Don't expect fantastic or easy going people every match. If this is your attitude than you'll get along with most just fine. All in all a 7/10 community so far for me. Graphics are on point for this style of game. While it's nothing to write home about when compared to AAA titles it's fantastic for the what the game actually is. Each map is a very small arena so performance wise it doesn't take a super computer to run this thing which is a plus regardless of your hardware. Most of the time you won't notice it since you're so focused on the gameplay but the backgrounds to each of the maps are well thought out and sometimes even funny. Watching little blobs jumping up and down cheering you on is always a plus xD. Each map is diversified enough that it keeps it interesting. You'll see anything from a Japanese sci fi to a California beach theme. The cars and customization options for them are also well designed. 8/10 overall. Customization is the real end game to Rocket League (don't me). There are tons and when I say tons I mean TONS of options here. Cars trails boost wheels paint jobs colors antennas engine sounds and more. Each of these categories has hundreds of things to choose from and makes every player you meet that much more interesting. A lot of times you can tell who you're playing with without even having to see their name. Only downside is a lot of the really cool things are locked behind a crate system. Luckily this is only for high rarity cosmetics and even then if you play long enough you can still get it through trading in game. I'd give it a 9/10,Rocket League®

2018-11-19,0,0,121,False,Recommended,Rocket League is fun and very addicting. The gameplay is simple and straightforward you are a car with the ability to jump fly and flip towards a ball or puck that you must put into the opposing team's goal. This seems simple enough but once other players are added to the game (teammates included) there is a high potential for chaos. Communication is key and because of that I recommend playing with a few friends over Discord. If you have to play with random players learn your quick chat hot keys and be flexible.,Rocket League®

2018-11-21,0,0,972,False,Recommended,One of the funnest games I have played in a long while. The cars are designed to be close enough to one another balance wise that you can do well with any car if you put the time in. The gameplay is smooth animation is clean sounds are distinct and the arenas are all unique visually.Extra gamemodes like Hoops and Snow Day allow for a bit of added flavor to the regular soccar gamemode. Hoops is basketball with a smaller arena and slightly heavier ball weight and Snow Day is regular Rocket League but it's hockey.Psyonix has special events during the year allowing players to get exclusive items using tokens gained by playing matches. The lifespan of tokens lasts longer than the actual event which is nice if you have a ton of tokens left to use.The game is easy to pick up hard to master. It looks simple enough to hit the ball with your car until you're actually behind the wheel. But it becomes easier as you play more and more. And as you play more and more you gain skills that you either find by accident or by watching higher skilled players perform.Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who is still on the fence. It's an amazing game for a good price compared to other titles. $20 normally $10 when on sale when some other games can charge upwards of $40 normally.Seriously though buy this game.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,343,False,Recommended,Fun game but to matchmaking is horrible. People with really high ranks buy new cheap accounts to play with friends of low levels just to throttle others and carry their friends. This is done because the highest ranked player dictates the level difficulty of a match rather than the average of the players involved. Its a broken system but there are moments of fun that can be had still. However if you aren't reporting at least 1 person every 10 matches or less then you aren't experiencing the true toxic nature of the player base. Foturnately there are many ways to report this although the punishments seem minimal. Even with these issues it remains a fun game especially with family and friends.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,889,False,Recommended,If you've stayed away from Rocket League all this time because you don't like sports games you are making a mistake. Although the main gameplay revolves around hitting a ball into a goalpost the sheer amount of variety possible in accomplishing that the skill required and of course the fact that you are a rocket car puts the game in its own genre. You may have seen videos of top tier plays which may be intimidating but the presence of ranked games helps to ensure that all players can go against others at a similar skill level. Even back when I just started and could barely pull off basic moves I still felt this game was a blast the entire time. Do yourself a favour and play this game.,Rocket League®

2018-11-25,0,0,632,False,Recommended,Ball. Cars. Try to score a goal.At it's core that's what the majority of Rocket League is about. The game has several game modes that each have their own quirks and enjoyment from the classic Soccar to the tactical Dropshot. Really funny game if you want to just play casually simply chasing the ball around and blowing up other cars is very enjoyable even against bots. Customization is a definite plus as there is a ton of items to choose from.Competitively it's all about raw skill and situational awareness though mostly because everything you can equip on the cars is purely cosmetic and so the only thing that makes a slight difference is the car's Frame that will have a differently sized hitbox. This results in a game with a very high skill cap and steep learning curve. Some of the pros are able to pull insane moves that make it seem like they are playing an entirely different game. The good news is that they are more than willing to share explanations and strategies on how to improve at the game so there is always something new to learn even after hundreds of hours of playtime. Unfortunately not everyone has that same attitude so you better prepare yourself for some of the saltiest game sessions you could experience. Most of the vocal part of the community is little kids angry at the developers because they won't tailor to their every whim and having petty disputes with each other but thankfully you can simply disable chat through the Options menu. Trust me it's a healthy choice.There are also locked loot crates that you can buy Keys for with real currency and also a Tiered reward system called Rocket Pass that you can get into by spending Keys after which you unlock exclusive items as you level up during the period it is active. All of it is entirely cosmetic for the looks of your car and therefore it is completely optional to the point that the system can also be hidden through the options if that's not your cup of tea.Overall definitely recommend this game.,Rocket League®
2018-11-25,0,0,7,False,Recommended,Cool game if you like soccer driving and using a controller. i'm honestly not a fan of the game but its a great game to try. Learning how to appropriately control the car has a learning curve. Once you get that down it can be pretty fun,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,261,False,Recommended,Been playing this game on and off since it came out.I'm not really a fan of soccer games but I quickly found this game's concept to be original fun &amp creative with great multiplayer (for playing local/online co op with friends or just online).I also really like the fact that you can hop in and out of a game easily which is great if you only have a few minutes to squeeze in a round or 2 of gameplay since each game only lasts about 5 min. In regards to skill level this may be off putting for some but I like a good challenge and really feel that I've improved dramatically since I first started which you'll quickly find encouraging as time goes on.Just be be warned that many people take this game way too seriously and the community is really toxic as a result. Finally if you're looking to get serious with this game be aware that solo queueing in competitive matchmaking is also really bad so make sure you have a reliable friend(s) on your side if you want to build up your rank.,Rocket League®

2017-11-26,0,0,127,False,Recommended,Rocket League didn't grab me right at the start. I found the learning curve just that too steep to be anything other than embarrassingly horrendous in any form of multiplayer game. Own goals would be scored teammates would be side swiped and my desire would be to log out and forget this game ever appeared in my backlog.But then it happened. Everything just clicked. Yes it took a good few hours to really get to grips with (in my incredibly low level way anyway) how my vehicle maneuvers and how each little prod of the throttle and tweak of the steering wheel will push that oversized ball in a direction of my choosing but I got there. Soon I was creating chances for my team(s) every thirty seconds or so judging how the ball will fly if I hit it exactly just right and how it'll rebound off that angled wall. I even started to prejudge how one of my teammates will attack the ball in a few seconds time allowing me to get myself set up for a hopeful attempt on goal.Helpfully getting through the hours of that learning slog is made more pleasant by a surprisingly decent community. Well if you avoid Ranked mode when you're anything below 'Pro' level anyway. Wander in as a Rookie or Semi Pro and the abuse will begin as soon as the first goal is conceded. A well taken goal will be praised as such and a perfectly judged assist will be called out too. Even amazing saves will tend to get a 'Well Done' as opposed to accusations of cheating that permeate through the likes of FIFA. Obviously your millage may vary and I've certainly not entirely missed any suggestions of a toxic community but now you can quickly and easily report and block the worst offenders life is a whole lot more pleasant.Rocket League even manages to be an entirely surprisingly attractive game. Hook up a 4K screen and things really do look absolutely stunning. And move at a cracking frame rate with everything turned to max on a somewhat aging desktop. My old i5 2500k/1070 combo was enough for 4k gaming and it's made my gaming world only that little bit even sweeter.Even though I continue to be pretty rubbish and I still can't get the handle of using my boost to reach balls that are out of reach of a standard leap I bloody love playing Rocket League. Whether it be just one 5 minute game or a handful of hours spent blitzing my way to glory even the most frustrating moments have handed over some kind of joy. Way more than any standard sporting game has over the last half a decade at least.,Rocket League®

The game's main method of defending against the Octane drones are to play car soccer and score into their net. You may blow up your opponents but they will respawn after a few seconds. You may sometimes play against other opponents who are not Octanes but these are quite uncommon due to the influence of the Octane drones and their abilities to flood matchmaking. Aside from the story mode involving Octane drones the gameplay of this game is pretty good. 10/10 would hit the rim again.",Rocket League®

2018-05-31,0,0,1317,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is an addictive game. When playing with ball cam on (this means the ball is always in the center of the screen despite driving anywhere AND the ball moving anywhere) the player has to deal with any situation from all angles. On top of that the controls for flight allow the player to move in a similar sort of way rotating to any angle to hit the ball. That's not easy.But Rocket League is not a perfect game nor is it close to being perfect. Matchmaking is generally unfair some players are very unpleasant and they will totally let you know that people are reporting players left right and center for being too bad or too good or just because they feel like it there's a good chunk of luck never mind bullsh it in generally whatever happens leaving the game thinking ""WTF was that"" and ""I need to quit this game""Overall I rate this game as a waste of time as there's an infinite learning curve.",Rocket League®

This game is great for casual players with friends looking for fun but also great for competitive gamers wanting a challenge. Ranked is the worst thing known to man if you actually start to care about it. I wouldn't advise that. Just focus on improving your own game and enjoying yourself that's how I eventually managed to hit champion. Probably a solid 9/10 runs well (recommend lowering settings for higher FPS) looks and feels great most of the time and can be such a chilled out or equally intense game to participate in.

The matches usually have 5 minutes (to around 6 minutes if you go overtime) so if you want to play quick matches between some other activity I find Rocket League one of the best options around (quitting a casual match isn't as punishing as other games as well it's not even punished here).

I can't because someone always has random high ping. Sometimes it's me. Sometimes it's my team mate. Sometimes it the opponent. When it's the opponent it's an instant win and I apologize. But when it's a roulette spin that often rolls onto me I feel like it's hopeless... all of it.... not just getting to rising star... but getting to my ultimate dream of being the best there ever was. I've got the game on Steam and PS4. I've bought keys. Psyonix has made enough money to invest in halfway decent servers.

2018-11-27,0,0,507,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a really great game for both casuals and hardcores. With its simple goals get the ball to the opponents goal being the core meaning of this rocket fueled football experience. The game also features a massive skill ceiling I observe no players being close to reaching yet even the very best. They still find new tricks and new ways to speed up and improve their gameplay.The game features a very great matchmaking system which feels like it actually has enough ranks to get people where they belong. In the top 2 ranks there is only about 0.5% of the player count. So you actually must be a great player to get the best ranks.,Rocket League®

2016-05-24,0,0,523,False,Not Recommended,Below you will read my initial review....However I have cahnged my viewpoint from a positive to a negative... I would say 60 70% of games run like this....Game eventually starts 1 team scores 1 member from other team leaves. That makes it 2v3.... It quickly turns to 1v3 and bam game is lost.The only punishment for quitting appears to be being unable to matchmake for 15 minutes....For a game that thinks it is competition class.... it falls far short of this and you end up wasting more time trying to find a full game to completion than actually playing a good game.3/10 old review sceptical at first but the game has grown on me once I have fiddled with the various viewpoint options to take it away form looking like an oversized console game.This is fun frantic and with the dubstep music playing throughout will have you wanting more.My only gripe with it is the match making which can take up to 5 minutes to get a game plus in ranked more often than not there is a quitter an also no boost from someone leaving which can see you winning the game 3v3 to losing 2v3....Overall its demolition derby mixed with football and rc cars.8/10,Rocket League®

Very solid physics model that feels intuitive (most of the time) and isn't too hard on your system. Also if the standard game modes aren't enough there are plenty of community made maps/gamemodes to satisfy your hunger for something out of the ordinary.

It's an okay 1 vs 1 game but really shines when you have a friend so you can join 2 vs 2 matches or 3 vs 3. 4 vs 4 is crazy and the other players are usually very cutthroat. You really have to be a very good player to enjoy those matches. You are awarded different car bodies and accessories so you can customize your vehicle in a host of different ways. You need too earn a minimum of 50 pointx in a match to earn XP and advance to higher levels. Overall a lot of fun.,Rocket League®

2019-01-03,0,0,282,False,Recommended,Rocket league is an amazing game for many reasons. They combine a driving game with soccer which is something you would never think of. Rocket League is a great game to either relax after a long day or go full competitive if that's how you like it. The game physics are done very well and the game is optimized nicely for lower end computers. I could get lost in Rocket League for hours and not get bored at all. Many people say that the game gets repetitive and it does at some point but as you climb the rank ladder you discover more skills and playstyles. The game has seasons which pushes you to keep the grind along with special events that allow you to unlock special items. In game items on rocket league are amazing and most of the are well priced in the trading community. One issue I found with the trading community is nobody does it for fun everyone trades to profit which means it can be frustrating to look for the item you want at market price. Using a controller is strongly reccomended but I know many people who are good at the game who use a keyboard and mouse. Overall the game is 100% worth it and most of you will be satisfied which your purchase.,Rocket League®

2018-11-22,0,0,147,False,Recommended,"A simple challenge from Top Gear might have been the inspiration of this game but the game developed into something more than just ramming a ball to a goalie. The easy to pick up hard to master mechanics is one of the main keys to create a competitive game with a high skill ceiling. However this game did not only captured the eyes of many because how complex the game is. It established a successful e sport scene with the help of the developers in three years and it is still going strong. By 2018 the game had six seasons of their championship under the name ""Rocket League Championship Series"" and the recent event had a prize pool of a million dollar. As a comparison it took four years for CSGO to make a six figure prize pool for their tournament and CSGO was arguably more popular than rocket league in 2016.This game is not without problems from the developers and the community themselves however. Some of the veterans had probably encounter some game breaking glitches over the past few years and the servers have not been entirely stable since it came out (although numbers of fixes has been made). While it is true that the community is deemed to be toxic by many there are always a bad side in every competitive games out there. So if people are looking for a great game with a mechanic so complex that makes them intrigued to keep on learning as well as trying to compete for their championship yet able ignore the toxicity and some hiccups from Psyonix this game is a must have.",Rocket League®

2019-01-02,0,0,120,False,Recommended,Rocket league is a fun and fast paced driving game that combines vehicles and sports in an odd but extremly satisfying way. The game is easy to learn but it can be a challenge to become good at. Rocket League combines elements of sillyness and competivness in one package making it extremly fun to play with friends or even online with random players. Online players tend to have great sportsmanship unlike alot of other competitive games. The game features great and fitting soundtracks that will pump you up for the next game of Soccar (Football) Snow day (Hockey) Rumble and hoops which is much like basketball.,Rocket League®
2019-01-02,0,0,9,False,Recommended,"Good support goes a long way and the guys at Psyonix seem to be following through on that. Consistent updates keeps players looking forward to the next grab. Good amount of focus on pro level and us regulars. The gameplay is extremely fun and fast paced. It is easy to get into the game but INCREDIBLY difficult to master which leads to a very satisfying progression in skill as you play. Rocket Leagues ranking system is one of the better ones. Rarely do I find teamed up with people who feel like they don't belong though it does happen it is a lot more rare than I have experienced in other games. The gameplay is unbelievably polished though there is a caveat and that is the vehicles. Truthfully Psyonix is trying to work on this problem and I think they may have it figured out soon but at the current time there are only a few vehicles that people actually use despite the vast amount of selection. Not to say that there are any complete garbage vehicles just the best ones are played by everyone at the higher tiers.The above is a minor issue and really one of the few ""problems"" I can think of about the game. The rest is golden. If you like fast paced gaming then this is a good bet for you especially if you have a bent toward racing games. Warning it has a high skill cap so you're rank placement games will probably feel like your getting pummeled. Once your rank is determined this shouldn't occur (unless of course you get carried by someone better than you through your matches in which case then you will drop in rank for a bit before stabilizing).",Rocket League®

2016-11-24,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Do you like cars? Do you like Football? Well it doesn't matter what your answer is you will probably love this game. The refreshing silly gameplay of Rocket League breaks away from most modern games trying to be extremely competitive or realistic and just offers fun in a simple form of remote controlled toy cars hitting a relatively giant ball. In addition to the usual chaos that may be expected from just playing a normal round with some friends or stranger there is also a competitive edge to the game. There is a ranking system that allows one to feel a sense of pride while ascending the ranks of Rocket League. Overall the game is enjoyable as a relaxing game where you laugh at how terrible your friends are or can be played with intent to be the very best remote controlled car football player ever.Did I mention you can also unlock different cars and customise them...Rating 8/10,Rocket League®

2018-11-25,0,0,185,False,Recommended,I would like to start by saying that I discovered Rocket League this year but it quickly became one of my favourite game. It's such a good game to play with friends ( I can't really recommend it without them). The mechanics are not the easiest to learn and there will be times when a team comes and just destroys you but believe me it makes the game more fun.The soundtrack of is good and it gives rhythm to the game and even though I usually don't listen to this type of games I can enjoy it while playing.The graphics of the game are good normal I would say they are not jaw dropping but neither unplayable.The microtransactions are there but they don't really influence the game maybe there are a few cars with better hit boxes but the difference won't mean much on a lower level.I can't really find any cons so I'm going to give a 9/10 ( it just needs a little bit more to become a perfect Game).,Rocket League®

2018-11-24,0,0,65,False,Recommended,Rocket League has to be one of the most oddly addicting games for me. I personally am not a fan of competitive games I play most for fun. But theres a competitive itch and this game definitely scratches it! Definitely more fun with friends (good ones) but matchmaking will do a good job at matching you with same skill players. I am currently a low level and un ranked and get matched with other players with terrible aim and depth perception. The Cross play capability in this game is the best I've experienced matchmaking takes seconds. The tutorials are great for practice and the Steam Workshop allows for custom maps to be instantly enjoyed. This is a perfect game through and through. I can't believe I put off buying it for so long.I have terrible depth perception.,Rocket League®

It's great for both the competitive and casual gamer as anybody can pick this game up and have a great time and at the same time there is a huge skill scale for this game. I am very happy that Psyonix have stuck with this game and kept the community happy with new updates and content regulary!,Rocket League®
2018-12-20,0,0,496,False,Recommended,"My playtime says it all but I have some very important remarks to makeThis game has some fantastic physics letting you pull off some incredible tricks and making it a great multiplayer matchmaking online experience. I spent hours playing four seasons of Rocket League and I had a lot of fun with the Competitive and Casual modes.However I am going to criticize some choices regarding the matchmaking and the crate unlocking systems. The matchmaking system is very inconsistent. I spent the majority of my playtime in Standard Gold III and oh boy I played in lots of crazy matches with own goals left right and everywhere and unimaginable whiffs. Granted I'm not the pinnacle of Rocket League skills but I at least learned how to rotate and rotation was what made me reach Gold III and ironically made me get stuck in Gold III. If you want to be promoted further I give you two choices find a party to play with or start grinding skills like a madman. I highly recommend the former option because the latter is only recommended for those who want to go for e sports and I am pretty sure you have lots more games than Rocket League.The Crate unlocking system is pretty inconsistent as well. You see It doesn't matter if you buy keys or earn decryptors for free the roulette will have always the same random chances of giving you items. The difference between keys and decryptors is that the items you get with decryptors you can't trade with other players. My question is Why? The guy who bought the key is already having an instant opportunity to get an item while the guy who goes for decryptors have to sporadically get one through playtime. I think this kind of design choice discourage trading.And now let's address the big elephant in the room the in game online community. When I was being promoted from Bronze I until Silver III I had very few instances of toxic people and I was also able to do some friends. Heck there was this guy who gently recommended me to learn about rotation it was wonderful time. However starting from Gold I things got very chaotic and I became toxic myself through ironic ""Nice Shot!"" and ""What a Save!"" Quick chat messages. I am very ashamed of what I have done. So again if you are going to play Competitive I highly recommend finding friends to play with. Unfortunately you can't make crossplatforms parties which Psyonix is supposedly working through Rocket ID (which is being delayed constantly don't count on it) only Steam parties are possible.In conclusion wonderful game questionable matchmaking system and crate unlocking toxic community proportional to rank. If you want to experience it I also recommend starting with Casual before going to Competitive.",Rocket League®

2018-08-19,0,0,724,False,Not Recommended,This game taught me to not trust random people even the ones that are carrying you. Taught me how not to pass it to the middle because ain't nobody got time to be there for you they always behind you because they always assuming you gonna miss so he will be the recovery. Taught me to the best way to win is to be a and use strategies depriving opponent from their boosts chasing them so you can destroy them and never giving them a chance to defend. Taught me to be ready to hear a lot of when you miss once or make a tiny mistakes because you are not up to your partner's expectations.I like the idea of the game simple controls are a bit difficult with keyboard but it's not the worst the keys to unlock crates are cheap you can get some items even if you are a ftp.

In rumble for example you get a power up every 10 seconds with the boot power up you can kick a player away... It is a great game it is not pay to win but you can buy some cars that are from famous movies other games... Personally I bought the batman car because it has a large surface so there is more chance that you hit the ball. There is also trading so you can buy wheels cars decals... The main currency are keys which can be bought or you can trade items to get them. I recommend this game 10/10. You may want to wait for a sale and purchase another car.,Rocket League®

I'm old af (41) so I don't learn as quick as the kids but there's custom training packs created by others who have the same mechanics problems as me and it's possible to learn and get better through practice. Natural ability and youth seems to be the way to go but there's still a chance for us adults lol. As a casual the game can be frustrating meaning you'll miss the ball a LOT at first but keep at it and you'll start making easy hits on the ground. Then on the wall. Then in the air. Then off the ceiling. 3k+ hours and still so many things to figure out...Only issue I have is sometimes the servers are terrible. They'll lag random people there will be stutters in game play and of course WHERE'S MY DANG CROSS PLATFORM PARTY SYSTEM SONY?????

It even demonstrated that I can use those tests of patience and practice to hone other crafts like learning instruments I've had sitting in my closet for years.I only have two gripes some members of the community (as in most games) are really toxic and the 'report' feature feels really futile. Also the servers are trash. I've never played a game with such inconsistency in lag and rubberbanding (for such a high precision endeavor).

2018-12-20,0,0,214,False,Recommended,"Hot Wheels is a brand of 1 64 1 43 1 18 and 1 50 scale die cast toy cars introduced by American toy maker Mattel in 1968. It was the primary competitor of Matchbox until 1997 when Mattel bought Tyco Toys then owner of Matchbox.Many automobile manufacturers have since licensed Hot Wheels to make scale models of their cars allowing the use of original design blueprints and detailing. Although Hot Wheels were originally intended for children and young adults they have become popular with adult collectors for whom limited edition models are now made available.A picture of the rear of Hot Wheels toy car packaging from 2018. This toy car has been packaged in a ""Short Card"" style which is used by grocery stores and other retailers who do not usually stock toys and do not have large toy display areas. This particular packaging is produced for sale outside of the United States (""International"") because it has multiple languages printed on the back rather than only English. Thus it is said to be packaged in ""International Short Card packaging"".The toy car itself is a model of a real life motor vehicle in this case a 1955 Corvette Convertible.

2018-12-23,0,0,355,False,Recommended,"TL DR RL is an excellent game but it has shoddy servers that can ruin the experience unexpectedly.I've been playing RL for quite a long time and I really freaking love this game. It's just so simple clean and refined while at the same time being incredibly complex and nuanced. There is so much to love about this game but there is also so much to hate. Specifically the state of the RL servers. Sometimes the game plays perfectly without any sort of lag or issues but there are times there are many many times where the servers are all just bad. And the connection issues aren't client side. For reference my gaming rig has a GTX 1070 and an AMD FX 8350 so it's not a slow rig. It can run practically any game at max graphics with a smooth 60 144fps. And my internet averages at about 20 ping 130Mbps download when on wifi and &lt 5 ping 210Mbps download on ethernet. Even with these specs and on medium low traffic days on RL (less than 100 000 online) I still have consequetive matches with constant lag rubber banding ghosting etc. The game should not look like this https //www.youtube.com/watch?v n4LeReKlpTs (Thanks to Dragonking_Gaming who put an example on youtube so when I searched ""rocket league bad connection"" I got exactly what i wanted).And I'm a relatively patient person. I realise there are all kinds of ridiculous stuff that developers and tech teams deal with. I'm certainly not one to rage at a single mistake. It's more that I've been playing this game for a few years and especially recently everything seems to be getting worse not better. In recent months and several past updates I've more consistently had very poor experiences with RL due to poor connection. It shouldn't be this way and it's almost strictly up to luck whether or not I will enjoy playing RL every time I launch it. Bad servers aside I still love this game. I have a few nitpicks with the garbage AI and the unbalanced matchmaking but the game itself is amazing. There are very few games these days that will really pull me in and just immerse me with the gameplay. I think that RL is approachable by everyone and fun even for newcomers but it also has immense depth for those who want to become masters. That right there is a quality of a good game.I should probably also mention that in my 300+ hours of experience I find that the community is more often friendly than not. Don't get me wrong there have been plenty of experiences dealing with toxic players. But I have made way more friends on RL than I have enemies and people are generally more open to being friendly than rude.",Rocket League®

It's one of those games that you just have to try.The downsides come and go and there is still lots of room for improvement. The company doesn't seem keen on moving real fast with game fixes and enhancements but they do happen eventually. Their strongest suit is just adding content to the game.Bottom line is there are downsides but it's well worth trying.

2018-12-23,0,0,47,False,Recommended,"LOVE THE GAME BUT THE NEW SCORING SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY DUMBI love rocket league so much fun never gets old the games are intense and just crazy. Teammates can be a real buzz kill real fast but everyone has bad games and whatnot. Only things I can complain about is the new scoring system is absolutely I see no reason why they even would change it and at that not for the better. My own opinion though someone else might like it better but I cant imagine why. They really need to add the cross platform party system seems more important to me than a new scoring system to an already established game but im sure they have their reasons.Rocket Pass has cool rewards but seems slow to tier up. Everyones copying fortnite with this ""Pass"" bs... let it end.I feel the Competitive ranking system could be improved for sure slow leveling up and it doesnt matter how well you play if you lose you almost always rank down. If your teammate totally goes full tard and gives them the game your screwed..MVP shouldnt be reserved for the winning team only... most points is most points.Would be cool to see a some bigger maps for standard and chaos for sure.Also lately I have noticed a lot of saves and clear balls that arent giving points on both teams.

Playing football (soccer) with a rocket powered car is not as easy as it would seem yet this game has grabbed my attention from the beginning. I have loved every hour that I have played. I strongly reccomend this game to people who are looking to just have a great time with their friends. The only thing I personally dislike about this game (and yes I know this is picky because this capability would be really difiicult to develop) is the fact that cross platform partying is not an available feature. I'm not close to being a sports fan but I still love this game. This game remains one of my all time favorites.10/10,Rocket League®

2019-01-10,0,0,46,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a car football game where 2 teams of 3 players have to score the most goals for their team to win. A unique project that I've never seen perfected before.Rocket League has 3 types of game modes Competitive Casual and Extra Modes (AKA the fun ones ). Competitive and Casual have the same 4 side modes 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4 while Extra Modes has Rumble Dropshot Hoops Snow Day and Training. I usually play Competitive 3v3 and the experience I have for it is positive while I have met a few toxic people on my journey I've also met some awesome players that I loved to play with.The game also has an Elo like ranking system. You win a few games you go up a rank or division you lose some you drank. I myself play the game to go up the ranks even though I'm still on Silver I still have a great experience playing the game at those low ranks.One big part of Rocket League is the vehicle customization you can put hats flags custom skins or even change your car. I find this part of the game very nice because I love customization in games. By the way my favourite car is the default Octane.One mentionable thing is the main menu Official SoundTrack It has this techno sound and I like it. My favourite song being Mike Ault x Christian de la Torre Darkness.Anyways from a scale from 0 10 How much would I recommend this game? I would recommend this game a solid 9 out of 10.

So you're forced to play with different players who have different play styles meanwhile you go up against people in partys who either suck as a team or more often play well. I was at Plat IV but now I'm back to Plat II literally within a hour (been in Plat for a few months). Either allow the players to chose if they want to go up against a team in a party or set up a ""Stay as a group"" option which people has been asking for a year or two ago. So we don't have to constantly get paired with a bad mix of play styles.Like how your team played stay as a group. If not then rework the ranking system.Strongly don't recommend this game until the devs add more options other needed fixes and maps. Also fix the damn ball/collision especially in Rumble.

2018-12-27,0,0,3027,False,Recommended,Its Finally time for me to leave a review on this game. After countless hours ungodly amounts of practice and some of the highest lows imagineable I think i've gotten a grasp of some of the game. Whats there to say about Rocket League other than there is no game out there like it. The graphics are appealing to look at and the mecahnics are smooth and rewarding with a little practice. The skill gap is almost limitless while the game is still fun for the people with negative 5 hours in the game. Whether you know what you're doing or not Rocket League is a blast and I highly reccomend the game. Ever since bronze of season one ive been enthralled by this game and have been on the endless climb to reach the top. Ranked matchmaking is probably one of the biggest turn ons of this game. You get the satisfying thrill of climbing ranks with a team/randoms that is generally only rewarded by Mobas. What's the catch? Matches are 5 minutes you're in out and ready to go again. And boy are those five minutes filled with great moments toxic players and an experience that will make you throw your computer down stairs. I've managed to solo queue my way to grand champ a few times and have been on and off the game for the past 4 years and let me tell you this community is trash. But they're lovable trash all the same. Ive had days where i lose 15 ranks and days where I gain them all back. One season i was champ 3 and didnt get out of Diamond three for 5 months. The competetive aspect and reward for all that grind keeps me coming back. Learning tech is so rewarding and hitting those goals gives you a feeling like no other. So yeah Rocket League is a great game that anyone can pick up and have fun. The competetive scene is ever growing and players/streamers are extremely helpful and plentiful. Ive made so many friends thanks to Rocket League and became apart of a great Community. And man the FREEPLAY is so ing good in between matches. But no game is without its flaws so lets talk about some stuff.PsionixMan Psionix really messes with me sometimes. I cant understand their motives nor do i think they actually care about this game. Patches constantly break the game. FPS is horrendous on some mid/low end PCS. Optimization doesnt really exist. The servers are getting worse and worse with each year. Psionix please fix the servers. I cant count how many games of US east i load into where my ping is less than 90. Wanna play with your friends in Europe? I used to get a solid 111 ping or less now its up to 200 min. God forbid your mate living in Australia. Constant DC's or server issues plague games and there's nothing that can be done about it. Wanna talk about the crashes? Well the game randomly crashes on game startup sometimes. The menus have been loading slower and slower with each update. Sometimes my RL loader crashes. Sometimes it takes 7 minutes for it to load RL. The controller detection is absolute garbage. Instead or rolling out optimization or getting better services sometimes it feels Rocket League is just rolling out more crates to fatten the pockets of the owners. Why aren't there more tournaments? There are so many good teams and it feels as if there is only three tournaments all year. Rocket League is growing at a rapid pace and it feels as if Psionix keeps pushing the players away and making it a major annoyance to play the game.But don't let the nagatives startle you I love the game and will continue playing it. And honestly so should you,Rocket League®

2018-12-27,0,0,116,False,Recommended,"Wow 10/10 I really like bumping into cars every match it's a lot of fun and in the car world ""bumping"" is a term for what we humans call H U M P I N G and when you demo them that's when you well you know the rest. I also really love tilting my teammates by being so garbage and throwing every single game I play. For instance when I own goal on purpose to have my own fun when I kill myself mid game when I focus on bumping ) the enemy. I also like to tilt the enemy by popping off and making them want to kill themselves the best part is when they actually do it feels really satisfying. Overall very good game and don't forget to bump and maybe even DEMOLISH your enemies especially if you have no life outside of your computer screens )",Rocket League®

2016-11-25,0,0,23,False,Recommended,Приветствую! Сегодня я напишу свой обзор на игру Rocket League .Rocket League это спортивная аркада которая затягивает с первого гола.Rocket League вышла в 2015 году и создала этот продукт компания Psyonix rocket League вышла на PC PS4 XBOX ONE.В rocket League можно играть на клавиатуре так и на геймпаде.(легче играть с геймпада).Атмосфера в игре просто восхитительна! В игре есть много режимов плюшек машин и.т.д.Так же 8 сентября вышло очень долгожданное обновление разработчики добавили кейсы машины колёса окраски бусты.2016 год очень порадовал ибо разработчики не забрасывают а улучшают всё лучше и лучше саму игру.И так начнём с хоккея в игре он присутствует очень добротно и красиво.Баскетбол был добавлен в апреле 2016 года в который сложно играть но режим довольно изумительный.Рокот был добавлен вместе с вещами для тюнинга машины сам режим очень угарный вантус просто тащит как и борцовская перчатка.И кстати в игре можно обмениваться разными вещами например машины.Тюнинг в игре очень большой много чего можно установить на машину шапку нитро колёса и.т.д.Так же вам могут выпасть цветные колёса они очень хорошо ценятся смотря какие только.В игре есть кейсы и их можно открыть в чём минус они редко выпадают может кому они каждую игру выпадают но лично мне падают редко есть 3 кейса кейс чемпионов 1 2 3 в них есть машины красного качества так и колёса экзотические и.т.д.Забыл о самом главном это мм(соревновательный режим) там вы сможете поднять себе ранг в соревновательном режиме можно играть один на один два на два три на три (увлекательно катать мм с другом очень необыкновенное ощущение мой максимальный ранг(challenger 1.)Всегда любил рокет лигу люблю и буду любить.Эта игра затянула меня с первого захода всем рекомендую rocket League запала мне в душу и стала самой любимой игрой.,Rocket League®

2018-12-03,0,0,3,False,Recommended,"Just to start off I've played for way more than the hours stated here on both PS4 and switch prior to recieving it on my PC. I am amazingly surprised with how decently well the game runs on my PC. Here's some of my specs to legitimize my statement (try not to laugh) Processor Intel Core i3 4030U 1.90GHzRAM 6GBGraphics Intel HD Graphics 4400Nonetheless after some tweaking the game runs at a fairly decent quality equilavent to my switch. There's some occasional input lag but nothing out of this world. Internet speeds make up for that. So props to the developers for making it work on old potato laptops.Moving on the game itself is top notch. It remains to be one of the few MP games I still consistently play as all the other games I was into have pushed me towards quitting due to the lack of fun arising from the excessive toxicity (RL can be toxic but IMO it doesn't reach CoD or GTA levels) and skill desparities between teams made up of parties of no lifers and random teams of kids who barely know how to aim and shoot. Meanwhile RL's competitive matchmaking attempts to cuts off that desparity by teaming you up with players who at least somewhat match your skills even if they prove to be ""trash"" during one match. And if you really hated your team's chemistry no worries odds are you will match make with a new set of teammates. Something that doesn't happen with the other games unless you are doing ranked following specific esports guidelines of gameplay which takes away most of the fun of casuals.As for the gameplay mechanics there's a lot that could be said about this but I would say that the fact that so much precision and accuracy goes into scoring a goal shows that a lot of extra work was put into finecrafting a unique sports racing game with unique mechanics that emulates real world soccer/football in a fun fast paced way while maintaining its existing rules.So if you like cars/racing and also like sports and want a chill game to play either casually or competitively without collapsing of a heart attack caused by stress of tilted toxic gameplay then rocket league is for you. Yes you will suck at first and yes you will blame teammates for your Ls but always remember you can or could be the problem (even if you were MVP).",Rocket League®

The singleplayer ""Season"" experience was pretty boring but that's fine with me because 99% of the time I play multiplayer anyways. I'm not a fan of the idea that you have to purchase keys to unlock crates or purchase dlc to unlock cars but I the game can still be played successfully without those transactions. Additionally the multiplayer community.....oof....its pretty.....toxic. Overall there's a handful of negative aspects about this game but for the most part its pretty fun plus matches don't last that long so you can definitely pick up this game for a match or two if you don't have a lot of time.",Rocket League®

If you think you might not like this game think again. There is no defining something like Rocket League. It has a sizeable esports scene and is just straight up fun for the more casual players as well. Since it came out in 2015 professional players still haven't reached the skill ceiling or even come close. I used to think ""how much skill and strategy can be involved in a game about a bunch of cars hitting a ball around?"" As it turns out the game has a huge learning curve. This doesn't mean that it's too difficult for new players but rather that it's all the harder to master the mechanics. And there are ALOT of them.",Rocket League®

2018-12-27,0,0,749,False,Recommended,My most played game. As you climb you start to learn how much you suck but the multiplayer games match are decent at matching you with someone who will challenge so you will incrementally get better at the game.For the most part the community is okay. Like any online competitive game you get the toxic teammates(that are probably losing because they are throwing not because you suck like they claim). Even if you are having problems with that they offer a 1v1 competitve mode that will let you fine tune your mechanics of the game. The replay value is high. I don't have as much time as I'd like to invest in games these days since I work a lot more so this one is definitely a good 'pick up and play anytime' type of game.,Rocket League®

To be honest I don't even consider myself a gamer. 10 min in this game and I got hook for years I can't stop playing this. Morning lunch break at night. I train myself I warmp up I go into ranked games. Every single day. Crazy thing about this i'm still years from mastering the game but i get better every day. When i'm not playing i'm watching videos and blogs about how to perfect skills and mechanics. For a non gamer this tell how good this game is.

2018-12-29,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,Can't play without horrendous lag. Warps my car across the map. I go for the ball the ball warps across the map. I have a wired 40 mbps connection and exceed all system requirements. Unplayable if you want to play competitive. I have thousands of hours in the game on other platforms and never had these problems (until recently on the Switch and PC). Haven't tried lately on XBOne but I'm tired of paying monthly fees to play online so I probably won't.I actually really like this game. It's a fun concept. Right now I can't recommend it for more than letting your kids or nieces/nephews drive around and hit the ball on local coop.,Rocket League®

2019-01-01,0,0,74,False,Recommended,I first started playing Rocket League a year or two ago on the PS4 when it was free and instantly fell in love with it. Moving forward to now and finally having built a beast of a gaming PC I just had to buy RL and play it on PC.If you love driving tiny cars playing indoor soccer/football and blowing stuff up then this game is certainly for you.Yes at first it is challenging and there is a learning curve which isn't too steep but not long after doing some in game training and practice you'll be ready for some insane multiplayer fun online or locally with friends.Advancing on in the game with your skills increasing you will meet other more challenging rivals but that adds to the fun.This game has gained huge momentum and is an official E Sport.I highly recommend Rocket League to anyone who has a level of coordination and loves the concept of indoor soccer/football with cars.,Rocket League®

MMMMM sure do love the thrill of people telling me im bad!!!!The game itself is great and all of the game modes are fine (except for dropshot which has some bugs relating to how the ball bounces on the ground (making you whiff when you shouldn't have)). So why am i not recommending this? Well it's just the community that isn't ""fine"". Some of the times obviously you will get really good games but most of the times the games you play will leave you ticked off.I recommend you find some friends to play this game with. Randoms are too.. well random. With friends you'll know what they are going to do (playstyles) so you'll position yourself better and have a more powerful team. (A good plat team can beat a bad diamond team)If it's your first time playing.. Have fun in bronze while it lasts. You'll sooner or later be in the upper ranks and you'll soon realise what the community really is. I also recommend you to check out the workshop maps. They are really fun.",Rocket League®

2019-01-05,0,0,107,False,Recommended,The game is VERY fun will never deny that. The main problem as with pretty much every single online game is the community is full of very toxic people who care about nothing but points. And no I do not mean the goal points.There is a goal point system for each match similar to that of soccer. When you score a goal your team gets a point and the team with the most points at the end of a match wins. But there is also an individual point system for each player and it is not done very good and the majority of the community seems to use it as a means to trash talk and it also screws over matches with randoms who just want those points because they feel it makes them look good. For starters the point system incetivises players to do nothing but go for the ball and that is exactly what many players do. They try as often as they can to simply touch the ball even it if means screwing over your own team. It also is very hard to get points without doing things like scoring goals or putting the ball in the direction of the goal meaning if you are playing a goalie have fun getting talked down to because you have a high chance of getting very few points and people will often even screw you over at actually being a goalie because they just want those sweet sweet points.,Rocket League®

2019-01-06,0,0,12,False,Recommended,A few thoughts on Rocket League 1) Lots of fun to play casually or competitively. I personally don't play video games too often anymore but this is always a fun one to hop on if I have some time to kill.2) The mechanics of the game are pretty tricky. There's certainly a significant curve to the gameplay experience so you can keep learning and improving in the long run however it's fun and simple enough to get started.3) Whether you're looking for a competitive game to really learn and develop in or you're just looking for a fun and casual pass time this is the one provided of course that cars and football are your thing.4) Micro transactions are tastefully implemented here imo,Rocket League®
2019-01-06,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Alright so ima start this off saying that this game might have the most replay value in a game that I have seen in a while not including The Binding of Isaac Rebirth which is another good game. This game has a HUGE learning curve which is why I would recommend playing 3v3 with bots. It can easily make you better. This game to be fair is amazing it s fun and can also be frustrating. When you first start it you are going to be hot garbage. After spending some time you might actually be able to hit low aerials after tryharding for 20 hours straight you are a god. After dumping your girlfriend and locking yourself in your room and isolating yourself for 48 hours straight and the only food you eat are lunchables and you drink lemonade you become thanos anyone who is below you will suffer greatly and you can now 720 backflip double barrel roll (even though that s not in the game) and then fuus ro da the ball into the net. You get 50+ goals a game now. In all seriousness this game is truly amazing and I recommend it to everyone.,Rocket League®

2015-07-12,0,0,575,False,Not Recommended,"I'm changing my review to negative for what this game has become STUPID DEVELOPERS made everything wrong. I've been offended thousands of times with racists slangs (macaco monkey the n word etc) homophobic slangs (f word etc) but if I offend back I get banned but the racists never get banned. Just shows how psyonix doesn't give a about racism but ban you for saying words like the a word. It's pathetic really. They don't ban trolls either never seen a single troll getting banned. I myself trolled many times people who deserved it but I only got banned when I offended someone (never without reason btw). A pity these terrible developers are only interested in what is happening at game chat which is meaningless since you can just mute everyone than what's actually happening INGAME. As if this wasn't enough now you can't play some modes on casual you HAVE to play them ranked (basketball rocket labs hockey etc). And even more you can't put them together with ""normal modes"" 3v3 or 4v4 you have to select one ""mode"" to play online which is ridiculous because I love especially to play 3v3 and 4v4 but now I have to choose the modes to play the ""normal"" game or the ""special"" modes. Seriously this game was very fun when it was released and the new modes were being released but what the developers have made with this game is absolutely unforgivable. Not to mention they are cowards who closed Steam Discussion because they can't handle critics. 5 years they could develop tools to ban people who swear on chat but you can't make a decent bot.

2019-01-21,0,0,500,False,Recommended,Rocket League is fun to play since the beginning but getting better increases the joy to play it even more. Being able to hit the ball precisely on the ground or up in the air allows you to combine skill with creativity to score incredible goals. Getting there will take you a few hundreds of hours tho. On the way you can look forward to score amazing goals every now and then by pressing buttons in panic and maneuvering the ball into your or the enemy teams goal without any understanding how you've even hit it. These goals as other situations usually come with a burst of preprogrammed sarcastic Messages trying to hit you hard but mostly make you wipe a tear of joy. When your team is a few goals behind it pays off to keep a cool head and lead your team to victory.. or blame your teammates for being noobs as you gaze on the scoreboard to see you being MVP of your team with solid 10 points ahead and ragequit as soon as the enemy team shoots the next ball into your undefended net. Thanks to the fact that most players steer via controller and don't have a keyboard in range the community is much less salty than League of Legends. I love this game.,Rocket League®

2019-01-17,0,0,170,False,Recommended,"I'll start with the cons first I have 300+ hours on Xbox i'm a Platinum/Diamond but i can take some Champions rather regularly. (I'm not the best but i'm not the worst either). &gt Cons Horrible servers even when you're in your region you'll get latency and packet loss issues with low ping. Teleporting all around the map and passing right through the ball are common events. (On a serious side note Psyonix NEEDS to fix the servers. Solo queueing ranked is the definition of frustration. I cannot count how many times i've queued 2v2 and 10secs into the match it's a 1v2 because my teammate lost connection). High levels of toxicity. Salty arrogant racist sexist people everywhere... maybe that's what happens when you give players the ability to talk to eachother in a game. Voice and text chat disabling are available (for me a must have). Teammates will leave the match after 1 goal is scored on you sometimes even if it's in the first 10 seconds of a 5min match. People will tryhard and flame you in casual even more in ranked (usually because you missed a ""easy"" ball but they also miss a similar shot. So the best strategy is to not give them any ""ammo"" just don t reply no argument you have with them will have a fruitful outcome). Currently exists a glitch where a player will suddenly disconnect from a ranked match. Sometimes they won t connect anymore and you ll have 1 teammate. &gt Pros Fun to play with friends. Having Discord can really help by knowing which one will engage at each time or some juicy passing plays. Playing solo in ranked can be very challenging. With no communication things can go bad so don't stress it out too much (""it's only game why you have to be mad"" are some wise words). Remember tilt and anger are also factors for quality of gameplay. So if you're mad about something just stop playing take a break. High level of customization from the start. Hundreds of itens some dropped after a match others from crates. You can also download a modding tool called ""Alpha Console"" which grants you client sided itens for you to customize you car. Like the marvelous ""Alpha boost"". Fun game modes like Hoops (basket ball) Rumble and ""mutators"" in private matches which can give the ball more bounciness make it a square. It can give you more strength to hit the ball or make your boost unlimited... etc.",Rocket League®

2016-12-24,0,0,1063,False,Recommended,This game is fun with different types of sports you can do for example basket ball hockey and soccer. Soccer is what you will mainly play. The way you win is you hit the ball towards the other net and if it goes past the goalie you get a point. Whoever has the most points wins the match after five minutes. They update this game frequenly. The rumble mode is what i think alot of people had fun with. This game is worth every penny as I have almost 400 hrs and I am not even close to getting bored of Rocket League. If you do not like this soccer concept than this game is not for you.

I wouldn't care about the points if it was a one off issue but servers are getting worse and worse as time goes on and it seem that nothing has been done to fix them.

I've seen the opposing team forfeit almost immediately after my team scores a goal or players just leaving. Sarcasm is just built into the game with the quick chat and when players actually use the text chat it's not in a good way.There are games where all the players just hate on one individual and it just ruins the game play for me. I'm taking the advice of some players I've encountered in a game who told me ""that u actualy fkin suck"" and ""yeah fr just uninstall"". Clearly their skill level and experience with the game was much more advanced than my own so it was in the best interests of the community that I uninstall the game yet again. I am amazed though that no one has advised me to remove the game license from my steam account but it is something that I am considering in the future.At times I felt quite depressed but then I would do things that I loved and find enjoyment out of doing them. Then I would play a game of Rocket League and feel depressed from a virtual game that didn't matter. The ridiculous nature of this cycle is actually quite pathetic and was also a major influence in my decision to waste my time to write this review about a game I seemingly didn't care about yet spent nearly 500 hours playing.In my short return to the game I played mostly ranked games in the middle of the ranked ladder where most of the player base probably is so you can just treat me as one of those salty players.",Rocket League®

I love this bonus but one problem is that you cant talk to player across other platforms besides for the quick chat. This bothers me because It really takes the stratagy out of higher level gameplay and can bring your team to a big disadvantage. You cant tell them to ""stay in goal"" or ""move to mid"" or any useful communications.2.)Doubles... Its my favorite gamemode but sometimes the most irritating. I always find myself with a ball chasing noob who pulls down my rank or a freestyle god who scores 19 goals. This isnt a problem but when you find yourself with a teamate who starts shooting own goals and bumping into you the whole game it gets frusturating and when there is no good way to report them or get them to stop you have a problem. i think they need to add more easily found mods and a more aggressive reportr systemIn conclusion this is a great game with so many addicting aspects but it still does have its flaws.

2019-01-31,0,0,159,False,Recommended,An insanely addicting game with wonderfully solid and fluid mechanics that keep you coming back for more. All in all you get to play a mix of car hockey and football in a random arena with a battle car of your choice with up to 3 teammates (if you wish). There are several game modes to choose from ranging from your basic Soccar to Hoops to Hockey to even power up enabled mode with multiple vertical levels in the arena (also known as Rumble) and more.Devs keep adding new events and game modes regularly along with new cosmetics and vehicles. Players keep discovering new things they can do with their cars and by using the arena coming up with new ways to get an edge over their opponents. There is a skill curve but it is quite generous due to it being an arcade game and there are separate casual and competitive matchmaking queues to help decide your speed of play.The community is generally helpful though like every multiplayer game you will run into a few bad eggs. The important thing is to not let them sour your taste of the game.,Rocket League®

It is virtually impossible to get bored of it because the strategy used in every match you play is different. The game mechanics is what makes this game fun and competetive. The devs are active and give the players what they ask for. New game mechanics are discorvered almost every 2 3 months which makes it a never ending joy to learn everything the game has to offer. There are virtually no cons for Rocket league other than a few toxic player here and there.

When playing other games I often find myself blaming the game bugs or other similar things but when playing Rocket League I never find myself doing this. Instead I find myself thinking there was something I could have done differntly to save the ball or score a goal. Even if I pass to a teammate and they mess up the play I dont always blame them more often than not I realize that that there was something I myself could have done to salvage the play.

2019-01-28,0,0,154,False,Recommended,"Started out as a lot of fun. Plenty of laughs. Then we started playing online...It's not fun getting matchups against Championship level players when you're just no where near good enough to even have a shot playing against them. The game keeps matching you up against the same people perpetually unless you exit. So match after match you can get your butt kicked by the same insanely good player.Psyonix how about this as a threshold people that can sink shots while flying (consistently) should not be pitted against those that cannot yet PERIOD!The other gripe I have is the ""no XP awarded"" threshold. If you don't score at least 50 points you won't get XP even if your team wins. Except that effort doesn't generate points. You can work your butt off and be a part of the game and not get enough points. This is pretty frustrating. Especially when you get 48 points and lose out. I know they are trying to deal with the bot problem using this threshold. But I think they need to get a bit more creative with how they determine player participation!The training needs some serious expansion. While there's an airshots training mode. The game never actually teaches you how to FLY your car. You're basically expected to figure that out on your own! Or how to dribble even? The training section really needs to be beefed up with some basic how to and more drills. Striker training should let you do saves repeatedly (if you want) and keep a percentage of shots and misses rather than a silly 10 and done.Complaints aside this game can be a lot of fun.",Rocket League®

I may be experienced but it can get tough if you are against better players who knows what they are doing. People can also get toxic and never skip their goal. But it is just the player base and you get used to it when you play it alot. Otherwise all i have had is fun it is a must need to this game.

2019-01-12,0,0,58,False,Recommended,Rocket League is an amazing take on the soccer genre. It is a nice combination that can appeal to car enthusiast and soccer fans alike. Great game to play with freinds but if you are looking for cross platforms your options are very limited. You can make a private lobby and play with you freinds on other consoles but thats about it. The controls are pretty simple to start but how they get implemented is what seperates the tiers in competitive. The learning curve isn't that bad with flying being the first main goal but progess is made steadily with time. Matches are short and fun so you won't be making any sort of 1hr long commitment to play this game unless you find it too hard to log off.,Rocket League®

Anyone with +100 hours on the game will KNOW how it feels to get matched with bad teammates I mean everyone has gotten through this experience of raging over his mate for basically not doing anything besides flopping around with his scarab octane...Now you got the chance to rage in the chat and what will be the two responses that you most likely get?

And if you persist they will spam over and over until you get sick of it and you either leave end up muting the players or at worst take a hiatus from the game because you lost sense of enjoyment out of it...What I am trying to say is that the ""majority"" as they like to call themselves of the community will immediately without hesitation spam words such as toxic and flammer and the word that frustrates me the most cry seriously tho having a point to complain about and crying isn't the same damn thing without any true meaning until you are completely done for. Those people don't think as of why that would happen and hence they never get better at the game nor learn from their mistakes hence leaving room for more complaints from ensuing teammates they might get matched with. I get it many people can't help themselves and might get out of hand and plainly too difficult to deal with but when people are angry do we try to feel some empathy and improve upon both them and ourselves or we try to completely destroy them and leave no desire to be found in the game from their new view a game full of people that just don't understand that for once they might be the problem and not continuously blame the ""toxic"" players for ruining the game because in reality you are the one ruining the experience of the game. No one wins that way...If you are one of those people The people who call at first sight everyone that critisizes them to be a ""toxic"" player don't do anything and lose the game then calling yourself ""chill"" as an excuse of your most likely poor performance you think about all this deeply because you might be the hindrance of the community and not the others ( That's all there is to Rocket League the first and only game that to my eyes shows that the ""toxic"" community might be a tad bit smarter and more dilligent in the sense of self improving and blaming mates when they have poor performance than the ""chill"" community that just sputters ""toxic"" and ""flammer"" by heart. I will end this here...",Rocket League®

2019-01-11,0,0,548,False,Recommended,In this review i'm going to focus just on the game experience itself. I'm going to skip anything related to the crates and all that because it's all optional and doesn't really impact your in game experience.Rocket League can simply be explained in two words...Fun but BROKEN.As much as i do enjoy this game i hate it as well mainly the rank system and matchmaking....ooooh boy the matchmaking in ranked is just trash especially in solo queueing Now imagine you got to a certain rank in Standard which is just normal 3v3 match..say you're gold 1 division 3. Thanks to the matchmaking system that TOTALLY makes sense there is a chance that you'll get matched up against a team of 2 gold 2's and a gold 3...Why does this happen ? who knows really.There is a bunch of connection/server issues and loads and loads of people suffer from really bad ping even with the most stable connection you can possibly have. Trust me it's immensly frustrating getting disconnected mid ranked match and not being able to rejoin just because the servers are so broken. Oh and i nearly forgot that yes..you'll still get banned from match making for 5 minuts (5 more for every match left/disconnected from) which is just so much fun.Don't get me wrong it's a fun game. It's fun learning the new mechanics and trying to implement them in your playstyle to try and outplay your opponents and if you have some skilled friends you can get some really nutty plays going!The physics are really solid (although sometimes a bit janky but that's a pretty rare occurance) and you don't need an absolute beast of a PC to be able to play it.Now would i recommend this game ? Sure why not...if you enjoy skillbased games than this is certainly a great game to learn how to play. Plus if you can get your friends to play it with you that's even better. BUT just be sure that you'll get tilted...A LOTYes i am going to recommend this game but seriously...psyonix please PLEASE make the game/server connections more stable and fix the ban/report systems too.Also why do players have to get punished for getting disconnected ? it just doesn't make sense.,Rocket League®

The console merges. The monkeys hired to run servers. The matchmaking algorithm. The matches all being competitive. The changes to the loot crate system.

2019-01-17,0,0,1173,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a incredibly fine tuned and skill based game. Don't worry about RNG ruining your experience because it literally doesn't exist in Rocket League. Additionally Rocket League is very rewarding to those who dedicate their time to furthering their skills. There are tons of mechanics to learn besides jumping flipping and boosting. Every single mechanic has community made training packs which you can complete. The diversity to the game's mechanics are what make it so phenomenal. On the kickoff alone you could boost straight boost and then front flip boost for a while then turn slightly to one direction and side flip boost and jump once and then front flip just above the ground to get a speed boost without actually flipping or yolo it by boosting and turning your car 180 degrees midair before backflipping. Whatever style you want to utilize this game offers it. Buy this game it is more than worth your time.,Rocket League®
2019-01-17,0,0,324,False,Recommended,Easily one of the best games I have ever played. The game is so clean and fun with little to no glitches or bugs that ruin the experience. With the intense competitive play and the devs constantly adding items and events to this game it stays fresh and fun for hundreds and hundreds of hours.,Rocket League®
2019-01-17,0,0,127,False,Recommended,Steam shows 100 hrs of gameplay but I played on Xbox for 3 years prior.This game used to be fun but it just seems kinda blah now.Suffers from a broken matchmaking system. Most matches are extremely unbalanced especially in ranked play where it matters most. Not really that fun when the other team is capable of performing ariels and trick shots while it's all your teammates can do to hold a basic rotation. This is probably my biggest complaint.I also feel like the community is shrinking even with the crossplay updates. Usually I just end up playing with the same 2 3 people at time. Even after requeing.I'd still recommend it to new players but only when it's on a discount. (Highly recommended you play with friends though),Rocket League®
