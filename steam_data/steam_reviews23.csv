2017-08-16,1,3,318,True,Not Recommended,I do not reccommend this game for anyone staying in South Africa as there are as of yet no servers so enjoy a 2 300 ping If they are arguing that servers are activated in a specific country that has sold more than 1 million copies then i'm pretty sure there are more than a million PUBG players in South Africa,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-13,0,0,917,True,Not Recommended,I wish Devs were more focused on fixing the game rather than banning streamers banning players honking near streamers adding unnecessary amount of cosmetics for the profit and adding more stuff to the game that can break.I still could not understand why this game is so popular. Concept is great and game is fun with friends but It is not fluid or beautiful. Game feels so honky unreliable.I also did a small experiment. I played on my server and a very far server. I am very surprised to the fact that i have performed much better at far server. I played not just few matches to eliminate this being happened on chance.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Why would u do something so wrong when having something so great buliding up. You just had to be like everyone else and get greedy. You post and brag how many players and how many copies u sold in such a short period of time and yet you just had to make more money during early acess. Well SHAME ON YOU. I had 30 plus friends who play this and now were down 15 if that cuase they are trying boycott theses actions. They will not play until something is done about this.

You can't come in contact with a streamer in a game or you might get banned for ""stream sniping"" but I don't think anyone knows how much they do that. Also sometimes this game just has t physics for example you cant shoot through fence or wire fence which is extremely annoying because at least wooden fence breaks after a few shots but the wire fence does not.

2017-08-12,0,0,1836,True,Not Recommended,After 700h playing this game I am afraid that this game has caused not reversible damage to my psyche.The plus ones will be poured over here + Very good battle royal idea.+ The game is not ugly.+ Large community but most of it is in NA.+ Creators are still working on this game(or are trying to)And now the cons Huge lags desynchronization and bad netcode so fighting anyone in this game is random and little depends on you often hit someone 6 times with AR and enemy is still able to kill you becouse of lags. 3 person mode which force people to continuously camp on building corners they can see you even not picking.. First person mode which eliminate the disadvantages of 3 person mode but is imperfect and it shows laziness of the creators. Huge amount of crashed games. Devs deploys patches each month but it ruined and couse more damage then it improve.. Huge amount of bugs and errors(you cant heal yourself etc) The game is too random you often land on the building with 10 opponents next to each other and despite the search of the whole building you do not even find a weapon. Delay in the appearance of items you often lend and thare is nothing on the ground but after a while items apears. Poor optimization On a PC for 1500$ i get average 60fps on minimal senting what is unacceptable but despite average 60 fps game fps drops so bad that turn the game into a slideshow. Very bad or none matchmaking. Very bad Leaderbords system.The game is in very bad condition after 4 months of EA and only 4 months left which make me wonder if the game will be playable in any future.Po 700h grania w tą grę obawiam się że ta gra wyrządziła na mojej psychice nie odwracalny uszczerbek.Zaczne od plusów będzie szybciej +Bardzo dobry pomysł battle royal.+Gra nie jest brzydka.+Duża społeczność lecz znacznie większa w Ameryce.+Twórcy wciaż pracują nad tą grą.A teraz minusy Ogromne lagi desynchronizacja oraz potworny netcode przez co walka z kim kolwiek w tej grze jest losowością i mało co zależy od Ciebie często trafiasz kogoś 6 razy a SCAR'a a on wciąż jest w stanie cie zabić w ułamku sekundy przez lagi. Niesprawiedliwy i wadliwy tryb 3 osoby który sprawia że gra sprowadza sie do ciągłego kampienia na rogu ściany budynku lub czegokolwiek i wypatrywania wrogów pomimo że inni nie mogą ciebie dojrzeć. Niedopracowany tryb pierwszej osoby który mimo iż eliminuje wady 3 osobowego trybu tworzy nowe problemy przez swoje niedopracowanie i lenistwo twórców. Ogrom crashy gry którę są częste i nieodwracalne. Twórcy wypuszczają co miesiąc patch lecz wraz z patchem pojawia się ogrom błędów lagów bugów i tworzy więcej błedów niż miał naprawić. Ogrom błędów takich jak nie da się dać gotowości w drużynie nie da się kogoś uleczyć nie da się siębie uleczyć utknięcie w miejscu i brak możliwości poruszania się czestę śmierci w pojeździe w przypadku zderzenia się z jakim kolwiek obiektem. Gra polega zbyt na losowości często lodujesz na budynku wraz z 10 przeciwnikami obok siębie a po mimo przeszukania całego budynku nie znajdujesz nawet broni. Lagi w pojawianiu sie przedmiotów czesto lodujesz i na ziemi nic nie ma choć po chwili pojawią sie przedmioty. Słaba optymalizacja Na PC za 5000zł osigam średnio 60fps na minimanych co jest niedopuszczalne lecz pomimo średnich 60 fpsów gra ma częste spadki które zamieniają gre w pokaz slajdów. Tragiczny system dopasowywania graczy lub jego kompletny brak.

They don't issue IP bans they don't investigate these people who suddenly in their first handful of hours make it to the top of the leaderboards (boy howdy wonder how those got there so fast) and they don't investigate these ridiculous cross map headshots and kills despite the blatant use of cheats to get them. Instead they adjust for e sports purposes only and they add emotes because ""well that other game over there did it and people like it better."" You want to sue people for using a concept that has been around since before he majority of your dev team was even born but then you want to copy things they've had since launch? Make up your minds get your asses in gear to permanently ban cheaters (not an account ban because we all know how incredibly easy it is to make a new Steam account) and instead of having your artists devote time into making new skins have them work on the awful texture flickering found on buildings and the fps drops from particle effects.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But still I insisted myself and bought this game although I knew that it was impossible for me to play at home. I knew for a start that there was an internet cafe at the city and that was my only source of playing this game. I went there after school during weekend in order to play with my friends even though the internet cafe was costly. I have spent around 50 hours playing this game (played more on my friend's accounts) and I enjoyed every moments of it.However about a month ago I was banned for no reason whatsoever. I know a month ago right? I still decided to write this as a review anyways. As I have said before I only play this game at an internet cafe and so do many other people that visit the internet cafe. I can see for a fact that hundreds of people visit the internet cafe as it is the only one of two popular internet cafes in the city. But what? I am banned? It was pretty shocking when I first saw it. NO ONE else knew my account details and I was the only person that played on my account and obviously playing at the internet cafe I never hacked. I tried to be calm and emailed Bluehole about my situation and what? They can't revert my account. Supposedly softwares running in the background that ""MIGHT"" be a hack was detected during my gameplay and I was banned. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but wasting 30 dollars + all the money I spent going to internet cafe was it really worth? Do they even actually go through my gameplays and see any signs of hack before banning? Do they actually take their time to look deeper into this situation?

2017-08-26,0,0,5,True,Not Recommended,"Not really sure why this game is so popular. Game mechanics aren't very tight and quickly grew stale for me. Shooting physics don't feel very accurate driving is meh/buggy melee combat is so laggy it's laughable. I get kicked randomly from matchmaking all the time and the game itself seems full of bugs and random glitches. Feels unfinished.Also don't really feel safe or welcome playing this game. The developers ban anyone who kills or annoys their streamer royalty. If you make the mistake of killing the wrong player too many times banned. If you honk a car horn and it happens to be in the vicinity of someone who's choosing to broadcast the gameplay for profit Banned. If you join the same lobby too many times (possibly due to the janky connections) and kill a streamer banned. If I was aware the developers were going to treat their customers this way I would not have purchased the game. I feel they should definitely have to disclose the preferential treatment players can receive in exchange for advertising the game through streaming gameplay. That doesn t seem very fair to the rest of us who just want to play the game and have fun.PUBG developers have basically created a small group of privileged players who have the authority to restrict your enjoyment and playtime either through direct complaints resulting in bans or the constant looming threat of ""is this guy I'm about to shoot a streamer?"". This practise of elevating streamers above the common player base creates a hostile and unbalanced game environment with essentially 2 classes of players tantamount to paid and free populations now it s just Streamers and Non streamers. And with the constant updates there seems to be new ways every week for unaware plebeian players to step wrong and cross the steam lords of PUBG. To top it off if you complain or try to voice your objections to the ban you run the risk of the developers publicly humiliating you on their twitter. They have done so to several players already.I honestly cannot believe Steam allows this kind of developer behaviour.. Seems very dishonest and unfair to me. Combine that with a shooting game that s just not really that fun for me and I can t seem myself playing PUBG again.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-25,0,0,461,True,Not Recommended,Gameplay is interesting enough. For an EA game it runs decent enough although there are some pretty gamebreaking issues (vehicle mechanics buggy hitboxes complete trash foilage settings).I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10 for an EA game if the community and the devs weren't such garbage. The devs bend over backwards to please a couple whiny streamers. As it stands you can get banned for honking your horn at a person you had no idea was streaming. Meanwhile people in the lobby are screaming racial slurs at you constantly but apparently honking your horn is a bigger problem than that.Stream sniping shouldn't be a bannable offense. Simply set a delay like ANY OTHER GAME THAT HAS EVER BEEN STREAMED.Friendly fire shouldn't be a bannable offense. If your teammate is trash in a game of this nature you should be able to waste that guy.Stream HONKING being bannable is the most ludicrious thing I have ever heard. The difference between PC gamers and console gamers is PC gamers by definition tend to work 40 hours a week so we can afford to build nice rigs and play games how we would like to play them. The devs of this game don't seem to care about that and instead favor the opinions of whiny rich kids who can afford to play video games 10 hours a day. The strength of the PC gaming community has always been our ability and willingness to completely screw over devs that screw over us. So in that spirit SCREW OVER THIS GAME UNTIL THEY START LISTENING TO US. Blast the negative reviews tell everyone not to buy this game. Until they learn where their bread and butter is (the MILLIONS of hardworking ordinary people that bought th is game) they don't deserve your support.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you devs see this You should stop wanking off to the streamers and actually think about the community instead of the streamers. And I don't understand how it's bannable? Like if a streamer streams a game it is their responsibility whether someone watches their screen and tracks every movement of theirs etc. Like seriously this game is better constructed than H1Z1 but when it comes to the devs individually they suck.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With plenty of tactics and styles to play the game gameplay remains refreshing. This game gives a rush of Adrenaline that no other shooter has given me specifically when near the end in a position where you might win that delicious chicken dinner. A lot of people have been giving this game bad rep recently since they release a box that gives cosmetics that you need to spend $2.50 on to unlock and receive the item inside but a portion of the proceeds go to charities and the Gamescom prize pool.

However the amount of users/cheaters in general has increased hugely. When I first started playing when it came out the cheaters were pretty uncommon now consistantly getting into the top 10 my teammates and I usually get insta wiped by an user that locks on without even seeing us and drops us before we can even blink. Would not reccommend this game as it's all about the cheating to win now. Region lock China that would be a huge plus.

Once you hit the ground you have to acquire guns ammo and equipment that is scattered through the map. You have to search for them into abandoned buildings and houses. Once you are packed you can try to find another players and kill them or you can hide and wait. As time passes a zone in the map is marked players must get there in a given time otherwise their health start to drop until they die. As the number of players is reduced the game zone is reduced as well. Finally you end up fighting in a small area until only 1 player remains alive.My review (It's my humble opinion after playing it for about 2 days and ending TOP20 on almost 70% of the games) It is a nice game based on a great idea but not a big deal in the end. In fact it becomes really boring after 10 hours of gameplay. Further work and contents must be applied to make it more interesting to actual players and possible new players.I just bought it because the game's loot gives you the chance to turn it into cash to be able to buy stuff for other games.

Could have been everybody though the fact that you can proof that it was actually the person you honked at doesnt mean you sniped him cause if I see somebody well how do you know that I watched that stream and didnt fool around? Yeah now already around 90 people of my friends actrually do own the game. I will tell the rest to stay away from it until devs release that when you priorize a certain group out of your customers you will only cause problems. In the end we are all customers.

Textures/mesh grid not loading at same speed for everyone at start of the game good luck picking up a gun or fighting when you are bobling on buildings up and down with 8bit textures randomly falling through terrain getting stuck inside of walls fences furniture. Lag and desync is horrible get used to getting shot after you have taken cover rubber bending all over the place picking up weapon just to realize 3 seconds later it went magically back on the floor. Before someone says its my internet connection i play on 120mbps connection on my region servers.Besides poor network optimization game itself is badly optimized with fps drops stuttering and freezes i play it on very low even tho my hardware should play it comfortably on med high. Its ridiculous to have to put game on very low and play on 720p resolution while it still looks like crap just to be able to have somewhat stable 40 50fps. I watched streamers such as shroud experience same types of stutters and freezes so its really not something on our end its their badly optimized code.Then there is whole another issue of buggy vehicles fences/walls windows. There also seems to be surge of hackers lately.All in all i cant in good faith recommend this game in its current condition especially considering 30 euros price tag in its current state its worth max 10 euros or so.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-04,0,0,254,True,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS though still in early access has been a wonderful and amazing gaming experience for me personally. I am aware that not all others feel this way but this is my personal opinion. There is never an uneventful moment in this game especially when you reach the top 10 and your heart is pumping faster than ever before. The adrenaline kicks in and you experience a true ""fight for your life"" feeling that is hardly ever seen anywhere else. Even though there are some bugs and glitches because the game is still fairly new this game is truly one to keep your eye on. Recently many people have been leaving negative reviews because of the addition of the crate and key system. They are angry because PLAYERUNKNOWN and the dev team promised ""no micro transactions until the game's full release."" The reason crates and keys were added was to serve as a ""test run"" for later additions. Additionally some of the revenue from the crates goes towards charity the Gamescon Invitational PUBG prize pool and supporting the devs themselves. Plus PLAYERUNKNOWN himself even gave a sincere apology to the community for doing this. Most people overlook the reasons that this system was implemented and only think about the micro transactions. If you actually realize why the dev team did this you would understand that they had to do this for many reasons. But enough about that. Looking at gameplay you definitely need a beefy computer to run this game well which is a downside but I can assure you that it is worth it for the beauty of the landscape alone. Indeed the environment in this game does look very realistic and nice if you can run the game at high settings. One thing that really makes this game stand out from others is the huge requirement of strategy. If you don't have a game plan and aren't paying close attention to everything you will be steamrolled by the other players early on in the match. If you plan ahead and move tactically you will succeed and make it further into the game. Like I mentioned earlier the feeling you get when in the top 10 or higher is something truly unique to battle royale games especially this one. Overall I would definitely recommend that you give this game a try even if you are a bit ""on the fence."" If you truly hate it just refund the game and be on your way. You must remember that this game is still in early access and the devs need time to flush out all of the problems. And with the monthly updates bringing new content and a new map coming in the future there is a lot to get excited for.

2017-10-07,0,0,220,True,Not Recommended,Through out the time whilst i was playing this game I was never truly satisfied with the game itself. Something major was missing and it didn't feel satisfying as a game. Generally I enjoy most shooters but I ofcourse had substantially negative perception of what kind of game this is since the genre of this game is very unfamiliar to me and seems very weak for the long term for customer consumption since it lacks variety in gameplay. But still when I first launched the game I decided to enter the game without any prejudice towards it since the reviewes were amazing and playerbase was rising daily. So when I give this review you have to realise that I was never truly a fan of this game genre so realistically speaking I probably shouldn't have ever bought the game in the first place regardless of the hype this game gets on the daily.Major flaw that affected my opinion of this game was the unpleasant feeling of time being wasted each time I die after spending approximately 10 minutes of my time just looting. The whole tidious process of looting is one of the worst things I've yet to experience in a game add to that the whole slow pace aspect of the game and thats the finishing blow for me. Only gratifying feeling in this game is when you are in the top 10 and you face off the very last opponents you have to kill but that's about it. Everything else about this game is pretty damn broken.Should you buy this game? Yes you should if you enjoy the genre for what it's worth the genre was from the get go not for me.The game aswell is in alpha but its been there for quite some time and good updates were released just to bring up some examples the optimization update did a great job as someone who uses 144hz it was prior to the update unpleasant to play with random fps drops which are mostly fixed. Devs are working and I hope the game will see different game modes different maps that are much smaller so the action is a lot more quick paced since this game has different type of players with different type of playstyles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-01,0,0,77,False,Not Recommended,i used to like pubg but as time went on i realised that they weren't listening to fans and were just added pointless content like a new map (mirimar) that wasn't even fun and was full of gliches to be honest the entire game is full of glitches that will make your experiece less enjoyable and that is really unexepltible since the game costs 30 dollars. now we have the latest tragedy which is sanhook and the event pass sanhook as a map is not that bad but the event pass is just awful first of all it costs 10 dollars to use the event pass which is weird because the game already costs money to play the pass only lasts 30 days and it would take 29 days and to reach those 29 days you would have to play pubg 6 to 8 hours a day which is insane and then when you get an item you can only keep it for 20 days because how dare you for grinding on our 10 dollar event pass and expect to keep what you have no screw you you can only get those items PERMENENTLY through the use of gambling through are terrible lootbox system. they clearly didn't see what their competitor's battle pass did so much better because the event pass does not reward you for grinding it just slaps you in the face for wasting 10 dollars and the tiem you could have been playing a better game. then we have the problem with the hackers and the cheaters which i think by this point they have given up on. but you might be thinking well they did arrest those 2 cheaters in china well my friends that was clearly just a way to set and example for the rest of the cheaters but it didn't work and cheating and hacking is still a giant problem. but again as i mentioned they will never listen to their fan base and just add a new scope that nobody asked for. while their competitor manges to find a balence between adding new content fixing the exsisting content. in conclusion i think pubg is do poorly right now but it can be fixed if they would jsut listen to their community for once and jsut stop adding new content when ever the fans get mad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was a clunky mess of unoptimised poop but it got better. With each update came optimisation and tweeks to gameplay. However PUBG lost its charm when updates became more about tweeking it for Esports that made it unplayable and laughably bad. There's no reward for winning and no runner up prize if you come 2nd after a 30 minute game. Just a few hundren points to spend on some cosmetic loot boxes that give you the same pair of shoes over and over. Servers are trash netcode is none exsistant and hackers are everywhere. It's so bad that now after months of being out of early access released on Xbox One AND has a esports they're like 'ok we'll fix the game'If this were at the beginning I'd say buy it.

2018-06-10,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a good game in general. I bought the game and played some matches with good confidence and excitement. I want to like the game but it's going downhill right now.When I first started playing the game it was fine and bugs existed but the developers had promises with bug fixes and general issues. Personally I think the game needs a big bug fix and optimization because running this on a potato pc makes you feel tricked by paying 29.99 on a game that performs poorly with 20 fps.I'm still waiting for Bluehole to finally get things going and make some good changes such as bug fixes and fps optimization as I metioned. But the thing is that instead of using all of this huge amount of money that they've earned they are jumping on Fortnite and trying to sue them. This makes the game bad because of how the developers are focusing on rivalry instead of making the game better.

2018-06-26,1,3,143,False,Not Recommended,"Game Content Great. For a battle royale one of the best. The addition of the team deathmatch gamemode was also nice. Helped spice up the game add some variety. Gun physics somewhat accurate difficult to master quickly. Overall a very good concept Game Performance Getting Better. For a game that started where it started it's definitely improved tenfold over the beta/early access/whatever version of the game. However a concern all players have is definitely how slow they are to keep optimizing the game. The time spent to develop emotes extra crates and the goddamn ing Sanhok fortnite ripoff money grab event is completely useless. Not to mention trying to take everything from Fortnite that is different from PUBG because Fortnite is ""more popular"". Not to mention trying to sue Epic Games in the meantime for copying. Brendan Greene you didn't invent battle royale buddy. Not to defend fortnite but it's a totally different game just the same genre. If Valve tried to sue Activision just because CS GO is similar to COD it'd be pretty stupid. So stop spending all your time trying to regain your players and trying to rip them off for money + making a useless lawsuit and give your players what they want an optimized game. Customer Support Absolute ing Garbage. Contact PUBG Corp about a problem you have and they send an automated reply saying the same thing Whatever the you have an issue with we cannot change it because of the way that it is. Okay so I might've teamkilled a few of my squad members as jokes and we 'report' each other sometimes as a joke or because it was deserved. Either way it got me banned. Now mind you I didn't think it was a big deal you could contact support and get your account unbanned with the logical and reasonable explanation. Nope. PUBG Corp s you in the Vigorously. Sorry Player your account has had an infraction on it we cannot remove it because it's been applied. We hope this helped ) Enjoy your PUBGless life. Well that was a waste of how many hours and $37 CAD. So as a retard I tried to give it another try. After many times trying to contact support I was kindly gifted the game again on a separate account. (Which I still have to pay back my deepest apologies Monty.) Fast forward to one hour into the game. BANNED. Again. No reason just an almost instant ban. Now a waste of 2 peoples money. Again after multiple attempts of contacting PUBG Support the same automated response Sorry player we can't do this as you're banned. In terms of helping customers by far the worst support team out there. UPDATE recently there was a notice about PUBG giving compensation to accidentally banned players. Hearing about this I reinstalled the game to check if I was part of that list. Nope. Another ticket to PUBG. Another ing degenerate response. ""This only applies to people who were accidentally banned. We noticed you've been banned so this does not apply to you."" Thanks ) makes 100% sense and helped us waste $74 CAD.

Don't expect to be #1 in every game with 99 other players trying to kill you. Most of the time the way you die is the entertaining part.(3) Don't expect spectacular graphics or Hollywood effects in the front end because I think the reason why this game is special is because of the back end its ability to maintain server performance with 100 players and to match make continuously without ridiculous waiting times.(4) There are replays so if you spot a hacker let PUBG know about it. It is in PUBG's best interest to ban the hackers forever. So far I haven't seen a hacker in the EU servers. Hopefully I never see one at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-24,0,0,276,True,Not Recommended,"PlayerUnknownBattleGrounds or PUBG was a great game when I began playing. Now unless I'm playing with friends or just bored out of my mind picking up PUBG is unthinkable. I understand that the game is an ""early access"" game and the team behind this game started out extremely small and is doing what they can. But when the devs start breaking promises and implementing cosmetics that the community decided to be pricey (a damn skirt for an online game is over $100) instead of fixing the countless bugs for this game then I say it is safe to say that the headache that this game causes is not worth the current price of $30.Now if a friend is telling you to purchase this game so you can play with him/her just know what you are getting yourself into. That 30 minutes of looting or driving/walking into the circle can be ruined by one simple bug or camper and when in squads a looting run gets you around 20 50 points with no kills. You wont even be able to enjoy the tasteless cosmetics this game has to offer. However I've had plently of good experiences despite what i've written with this game. Those only came when I was with a group of friends not having a care in the world. So if you want a game to play with your friends buy something else if they already own this game then why the hell not get rid of the headache you get from them nagging you to get this game and get a new type of headache that being once induced from PUBG.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-24,12,149,8,True,Not Recommended,I am not going to give AN opinion on how the game could be like but rather focus on what I EXPERIENCED while playing the version of the game as it is now.Pros Nice weapon mechanics Beautiful and well designed map Interesting game design Environmental sound is terrific Nice character customization Richness of items and weapons Cons Player movements feels clunchy. You can't jump through a lot of small fences and rocks Netcode is terrible. I go further to say that it is even worse than in Battlefield 4 in its earlier days. Actually Battlenonsense ranked this game's netcode as one of the worse out there. Check out his video on Youtube Extremely bad optimized with massive FPS drops (and I have two Titan X and up to level hardware) You might point out that I only had 3 cons for this game but for me they are the pillars of a good game specially the netcode and the OBVIOUS bugs. I don't want to be killed because I shot someone in the face and the server didn't register it or when you try to retreat or/and get cover and the game glitches. Specially for this kind of game where death is a big punishment.If you are coming from even worse bugs and netcode issues such as DayZ and H1Z1 you might find this game interesting or if you are extremely minimalist and do not care for these obvious phenomenons that ARE going to affect your game experience you might find this game interesting.Finally I can only conclude that this game was a bit overhyped. Since it is the best of its kind so far we don't really have much to compare with leading to this massive hype.NOTE You can refund this game if you are not satisfied with the experience. Check your purchases log to call it back. You must have played until X hours in order to do so. I believe it must be just a few probably less than 4 like I did.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-20,3,55,124,False,Not Recommended,"Before anything let me just say that the game is really fun. It really is. But fun / a purchase. The game is buggy. Very buggy. Optimization is horrible and seeing how the developers are ""fixing"" it I don't believe it will improve much. The price is ridiculous. 30$ is WAY more than what this game is offering. Desync and other annoyences are all over the place. You shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun blood comes out everywhere he doesn't die and he 1 shots you with a pistol. Happens way too often. Do not let the screenshots above make you think that this game is beautiful its not. The game is unplayable with everything on ultra EVEN if you have an overkill PC like me. Not to mention that having shadows on super low actually gives you an advantage because you can see players from far away and inside buildings. Also turning foilage super low allows you to see people hiding in bushes. You are banned from discussing cheaters (not cheats) in the forums. (Someone can't take criticism) You wont be able to run the game at a consistant 60 FPS. You just wont. Some places are 10 fps others are 90 but most of the time (if you have a high end PC) you will get 40 50 fps averege. But with all that being said the game is fun. I like running around fighting the other players and trying to be the best and survive. Playing with friends is even funner. But after all of what I covered this will have to be a negative review. I like this game but I wouldn't recommend it AT THE MOMENT.

2017-08-07,0,0,271,True,Not Recommended,"do not buy this game it is trash.this game is attempting to be the next big hotness in competitive shooters and yet it has beyond doubt the worst shooting mechanics of any game i have ever played. i guess the programmers missed the memo. imagine the clunky ""realness"" of arma but with zero polish. never get close to any object if you want to shoot virtually everything in the game has ghost edges that will absorb your bullets and there is no penetration.the game will prevent you from pulling your gun up to shoot if you are too close but unlike arma and some other games even if you are in iron sights will simply drop the gun to low ready rather than just preventing you from getting any closer. so if you need to hold tight angles and shoot back at the enemy too bad.there are massive issues with the perspective you see your crosshairs and the actual angle of your aim. part of this is due to the default third person mode but even in first person there is a different point of aim between normal movement and aiming down sights. this will result in shots striking objects you dont expect in close range engagements because your crosshairs are not represenative of your actual field of fire.the net code is horrifying. all multiplayer games have lag. some are worse than others. some are amazingly well done. i have never seen a game with sync issues like this. it is most noticable if you are dead and spectating a squad member and they aim down sights at an enemy and begin to track and shoot them. you will see them aiming a significant angle off of target its not that they cant aim they are aiming and hitting the target but hat the desync is just that severe. and it is impossible to tell just how much it affects the rest of the game apart from trying to open doors or get in and out of vehicles.the vehicles are arma2 level of bad. small bumps or variations in terrain will launch you sideways through the air. dont hit a bridge at full speed on a bike because you might sink into it before the games fourth rate net code syncs up resulting in you impacting the bridge poping out of the bridge and cartwheeling through the air. taking damage at best and likely losing the bike and getting killed at worstso you have a ""competitive shooter."" hoping to be the next big esport. it has pathetically bad shooting mechanics it has the worst net code ive ever seen and its vehicles behave as though they are on the moon.i get that this is an early access game. i am aware of the issues with early access i own many early access titles. but these are not issues that they should be having even in early access. to put this in perspective. DayZ standalone is a more mechanically functional and sound competitive shooter with regards to the shooting netcode and vehicles. than this game is by leaps and bounds. and we probably all know what a show dayz is.and their announced plans for mtx are pure cancer but really that is a foot note given the massive mechanical failings of the game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-07,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,The combat system is horrible. 1 on 1 encounters seem to be always be decided by who spots each other first with the lower ping and not by reaction or aiming skills. The hit reg and hitbox are stupid and feel incomplete.thanks to that the game feels only skill dependant on your patience to sneak like a retard and communicate with your premade ape friends as combat is inconsistant. the game's design promotes heavy camping because of RNG circles n shheeeeiittt and that's how almost every person in the top 10 gets gets there and gets kills.and its even worse in thirdperson since now you can legit camp behind a door looking at someone incoming without giving them any chance to know you can see them completely unfair because in shooters if the enemy can see you you should be able to see them too even if its a single pixel or zoom in is needed. RNG if not already a deciding factor in your early game mid game and late game via drops plane drops stupid war zones and circles can take the fun out of the game if you are at the other side of the map away from the circle zone if you can't find any vehicle you are either doomed rushing to find one right when the circle spawns or hold shift for 7 minutes.thus the RNG promotes you to usually land around the center of the map or in large cities which in turn you are encouraged to land with a large bunch of other flying feces and rush to find equipment first and kill them like an afghanistan child. the visual information feedback is terrible you have no idea how much damage you can do to a target if the target is wearing a vest under certain clothes what weapon the enemy is holding(unless you're point blank) and even if you hit someone target AT ALL unless you are close enough to see some blood sprays. The game itself takes zero effort to teach you what the is going on and how the core mechanics work such as if your weapons are hitscan or projectiles with travel speed your weapon's damage how certain consumables such as grenades and boosts work from what distance can people hear you running/crawling.it took people to playtest for hours (ON LIVE SERVERS because you can't create a custom) to find a weapon's damage recoil spread reload time weapon upgrade benefits hitzone calculation hitbox bullet travel and drop etc. Parachute control walking running and jumping movement is awkward.

For example we nearly never got an performance update or something.Players/ PlaystyleThen there is a big problem (in my opinion). I speak about the direction how the players plays they just camp in buildings or at the deathly border. This takes away the action parts of the game there are no fair and fun gun fights WHO CAMPS WINS.

2018-08-24,1,4,108,False,Recommended,I'm going to say this now. And i'm probably going to get plenty of hate. All of these negative reviews come from people who are either Too young for this game or prefer to be the majority and say PUBG is bad and prefer Fortnite. Fortnite doesnt have the same quality as PUBG. This does also play into the other reason which is that the younger kids like Fortnite because it is so much easier. PUBG was developed and made for Teens and adults. Fortnite was made for Teens then adapted for younger kids. So when you aplly the rules of PUBG which is meant for people who are harder to beat to a game meant for little children that don't have to much experience in gaming it gets easier.On a side note PUBG brings plenty of new content keeping the game fresh. On the other hand their balancing is questionable. Things like how the UMP9 is so buffed up it's pretty much an AR makes absolutely no sense! They do also need to add some more anti hacking measures. Overall I think you should buy it. Hopefully the Fix PUBG campaign really helps to better improve these problems and bring more content. Anyways I hope you found this helpful. Go buy it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-17,0,0,282,True,Recommended,Honestly PUBG is one of the best Battle Royale type of game. I've had my fair share of H1Z1 and Arma 3 Royale and even The Culling but this one is absouletly the one with the most promise. Although this game does indeed have bugs because it is on early access the gameplay makes up for it. This game requires some skill but in the end it all depends on the loot you pick up and the place where you choose to parachute from. They added a First Person only server and honestly that is the way it is mean't to be played of course you can play 3rd person if you want a more easier experience but the intesity that the 1st person server holds are way too much to be explained in this simple review. If you feel like this game is too much for solo then have a friend join you as this game supports up to 4 people in a squad or if you don't have any friends just join a doubles or squad match with some randoms and make some. I highly recommend you get this game before it's released and has the price increased.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-13,0,0,235,False,Not Recommended,Game released now so i'd thought it would be best if i edit my review.Vaulting is very solid and fun but the game developers have not fixed the real issue with the game.The Netcode Servers of PUBG are still running 15hz while good servers are supposed to run 65hz.The server performance is clearly noticable while playing the game you get shot after you get in cover. Damage takes a while to go into effect. Example I quickly peek another player and shoot him. He looks up but i duck into cover again. He shoots and a second after the shot i get hit in the head while i was in cover. This gunfight was CQB so there is no excuse for this slow bullettravel and hitbox issue.This game will not feel solid and after 200 hours the fun of winning doesn't feel like a reward. Its core issues arent being worked on or resolved so i don't see PUBG being a longtime favorite for most people.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-25,0,0,55,False,Not Recommended,It might be a game that had all the potential of blowing Triple A gaming out of the water which it did. It pulled off what most indie companies DREAM OF. But than instead of doing everything to go and give the middle finger to this world of microtransactions overpriced DLCs and lootboxes it goes and joins on the bandwagon with lootboxes before the game even came out of early access I have held off on this negative review because I wanted to believe but as of this review. The game still is not well optimized I run into glitches constantly and overall this is just a experience I can not do without friends. Which is a shame because it holds potential for a market saturated by the battle royal experience and while it might have made it popular it definetely could be improved. I write this more out of disappointment for what this COULD have been rather than what it has become. For while it can be enjoyable still I would rather just spend my time in other games where I know I can have a consistant and fun experience without the fear of really getting frustated by dumb ways to just die from game breaking bugs from textures not loading in regardless of being on a relatively good computer and a SSD drive to a object actually loading INSIDE of me and causing me to just be stuck until the zone kills me or I leave. Me and my friends have gotten frustrated about countless things in this game that are more or less out of our control. While this had so much potential I am disappointed to see the route that this game did take.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-02,0,0,7,True,Not Recommended,I'm not aware of any streaming/harassment drama involved with the game developers or streamers but I can tell you what's wrong with the game mechanically.For a game that is as succesful and popular as this game is you'd expect more frequent patches and improvements to the technical aspects of the game and not the streaming and video capture features. It's like painting your nails when both your hands are broken.Aiming a gun with or without a scope is like flipping a coin. Sometimes you completely miss other times you get headshots with shotguns from 50 feet away. Graphics engine and textures are horrible. It feels like you're playing an unfinished alpha for college computer science project that some kid started and forgot about 15 years ago. Doesn't matter how powerful or up to date your video card is what settings you enable or disable in the config it looks terrible. I don't know how they got their screenshots but the game doesn't look like that even with every video setting at max.The car physics are ridiculous. If you've ever played GTA5 and laughed at how some of the cars handle playing PUBG is like that except you die. Usually for no humorous reason at all. The interface is atrocious and was obviously designed by a developer. The inventory management screen makes no sense at all. Let's put everything in one giant list that you have to scroll through. Seriously guys hire a qualified UI/UX team and at least make your game look professionally made.Basically this game is getting a lot of attention and a lot of money as a result but the only things the developers seem to be working on are the streaming and video capture features. Instead of improving the game engine physics interface and graphics that should be at the top of the list.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-09,0,0,63,True,Not Recommended,This game has a lot of potential but at its current state it really is a hit or miss each game. I dont have the latest expensive graphic card or processor but they arent bad either. The rounds are a hit or miss due to the fact that buildings dont load in properly for like the first 1 2 minutes atleast 5/10 times. This will either get you killed or set back quite hard to the people that do load in properly. Furthermore server stability isnt to best either and lagg happens often aswell. However if the devs do keep up their work and optimize this game further i would play it again. Just at this time i would not recommend buying the game due to the fact that it is so unstable.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Should I buy it immediately? A2. Mmm.. Sure but you ought be cautious and know what your getting into. Objectively looking at the game it is quite a mixed bag.&lt The Long Story&gt *NOTE this is my first ""battle royal esque"" game so my view point when I might refer to H1Z1 or DAYZ may not be completely accurate. However I have been following those games and watching gameplay for quite a while now so I should have a general idea.So as many have countlessly stated this game can be very entertaining and rewarding when it wants to be.Whether you are a team player or a lone wolf player there is something for everyone. But do take into account that having friends to play with will enhance the experience a lot. It can be hell to work with strangers in team matches. Random matching can often end up with strangers screaming in their microphones for the mistakes you or someone in your team made be it on purpose or not. Speaking of which there are people who don't have microphones. By that point coordinating a must in team matches will become impossible.Also by the very nature of the game it can get very aggressive in both gameplay and voice chat. You'll be often greeted with politically infuriating(sometimes hilarious) statements being thrown about. If you have seen any of the Asian Server gameplay ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1""(hilarious if your from neither) will be the first thing you'll hear. If you get easily offended by such things this game might not be for you.To strictly talk about the gameplay side I'd say PUBG is a middleground between H1Z1 and DAYZ. What I mean by this is that it doesn't take it self too seriously to the point it is rediculously realistic like DAYZ but at the same time is gritty enough that it doesn't feel too arcadey like H1Z1. Bullet ballistics are user friendly with a touch of reality enough to make you think twice before shooting a target hundreds of meters away with an UZI. Maps and vehicles are also well crafted and spaced that you have a feeling of open world but not overwhelmed at the same time. Weapons are in variety and most are well balanced boiling down to personal taste than the actual specs. Not claiming that there aren't some weapons you might want to switch out later but PUBG does leave a lot of room for strategy. So even if you don't have the best gun doesn't automatically mean you are screwed. Overall its a good mix which I think is one of the reasons people are gravitating towards PUBG.Now gameplay is one thing but being a great game is another. Like I mentioned PUBG is kind of a mixed bag. While the gameplay it self is great there are major issues with the game like optimization and server crashes. Optimization has been greatly improved over the days but there is still much to be desired. If you don't have the latest desktop packing some major computing power prepare to lower settings. Even on Highend PCs there can be stuttering from time to time. Not saying that it is completley game breaking but its something you might consdier if you like +60fps with all your games.Servers are something that worries me though. I get that the number of PUBG players are growing rapidly but this issue with servers going down and people not being able to play is happening very often. Its has been a problem since day one and we are still seeing it. Bluehole(the dev) is not a small company. They have the capital. They even have an mmo under their belt as well so its not even lack of experience. Why they won't expand to a server size more capable is beyond me.While I do recommend this game. Please be cautious and think through before buying because you never know what will happen with an Early Access game. The servers and optimization issues are likely being tolerated because it is still Early Access. However if the problems persist through full release a lot of player base may abandon the game. The devs won't care either because they already have your money and LOTS OF IT too...Now if your still convinced to buy it... GET IT. GET IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

But that is not the thing now the game is still in a early access.But about that promise devs really shouldn't be that disohnest when they made the promise about not monetizing the game more untill full release. Now we have system of keys and cases. What is more dumb organizing an event revolving around competition in an unfinished game.Also... Brendan should take it easy go blow off some steam cause what he does inside his PR tent is just off.If this keeps up I'll be really disappointed. The game has so much potential going for it.

Made by Brendan Greene. (BR Arma 2 Mod) Good looking &amp fresh graphics. (Unreal 4 Engine) Acceptable ingame balance so far. (e.g. weapon spawns) Good reward system. (Still in progress) Simple but effective weapon variety and customization. No random spawn you ""decide"" where to land on an massive 8x8 km island. Work hard against cheater. Battle Eye forum and algorithm demo search. Very good &amp smooth menu guidance. (Highlight matching parts) Early access game yes but core mechanics of the game are 99% solid. CONS For some people performance needs to improve. (But they are working on it) Movement animation looks sometimes bit strange. (Maybe because of lags?) Hitboxes sometimes doesn't fit. (Lags?) Some distance graphic bugs which can cause advantages. (e.g. shoot trough not loaded trees/stones) Sometimes the start of a match is unplayable laggy. Overall one of the best.

2017-08-22,0,0,39,True,Not Recommended,The game itself is decent with a lot of interesting things and mechanics like shooting out tires on a car. However the endgame (10 20 left on solo) is pretty bad. It takes skill to make it to the end with luck (rng) having only minimal affect on you but once you get to the end the luck (rng) has major impact on how well you will do. There is of course still some skill and strategy but luck at the endgame can either screw you over or make the game for you. The circles (playzones) seem to be completely rng at the end rather than being neutral which ruins endgame content.Plus an obscene amount of cheaters/hackers. Despite many claims to fix this they have yet to do so successfully. You wont typically notice it unless you are consistently getting to/near the end (10 20 left on solo).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-31,0,0,498,True,Recommended,It was kind of a risk adverse run. I dropped at the powerplant usually there's a few other people who drop there but there were no one there that time. I found some good loot and stuff including a SKS and level 3 body armor. I run from the powerplant to some area outside and locate a car. I sit and camp hidden in a bush close to the car to scout for other players until I have to move.I took the car up in a hillside a little deep in the circle and went to a close by rock for cover. This is where I see my first players in a town about 400m away. I don't take a shot because they are constantly moving. I wait here checking behind me a towards the town for other players when my car which I parked like 100m away from me is stolen. I don't get a clear shot on him but I have to move by foot for the next circle. I make it even after spending a significant time in the blue because this is only the 3rd one and you can outheal the damage if you time it right.At this point I get my first kill just inside the white. It's safe to assume he doesn't expect me because the circle has been active for a while. I pop him with a silenced pistol (just in case). The circle is closing in on a town area I try to make my way down there using tree cover. On my way I see someone hiding behind a bus down in the down I kill him with SKS headshot and go back into cover in case someone heard me. I see someone else running on my right towards the town I try to kill him but I just tag in hard before he gets to cover.I sit here for a while before I have to make it into the town. My path has no cover and I am certain there is someone on my right. So I off smoke my approach and on my way there I see him and I stop to take him out. At this point there are 4 players left my heart is pounding like crazy and my hands are sweating. This game can be properly intense. I am hugging a wall close to the leftmost edge of the circle when Feistyfrog takes out 2 people consecutively with the M24 sniper rifle leaving only me and him.I am certain he does not know exactly where I am and I knew roughly where he was. The play area is down to like one house and the surrounding backyard. Grenades were exchanged to no avail and he has to move because of the blue circle (which will deal a lot of dmg at this point.) He tosses a smoke in another direction to bait me (I assume) but I saw where it originated and I heard his steps. It ended in a head to head battle where we cat and moused out of cover a couple of times. I managed to come out ahead.So well a lot of patience some luck some positioning and some mind games. I didn't queue up again because I needed some time to decompress.I made it to 3 one time also but that time I was embarrassingly killed by the circle.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-22,1,4,575,True,Not Recommended,boring game for boring people but its kind of fun if you're playing with friends.If you're playing solo and your play style is aggressive (searching for kills moving around alot) then you'll lose alot of times.also sound system is ed up you'll have no clue from where you're getting shot and there's no markers or anyhting telling you like cs go.1/5 solo experiance 4/5 when playing with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-27,1,4,260,True,Not Recommended,Very enjoyable both alone and especially with friends however deeply flawed. I see no motivation from the developers to get this game into a state where it could be considered a complete finished title/experience.

2017-04-01,11,13,31,True,Recommended,"This game has been very enjoyable however just recently (that is in my last game) I executed a perfect three point turn over a teammate I was paired up with basically this began after he insulted me personally by assuming that I was some sort of charitable taxi service demanding if he could ""come get in the car with me"". When I then responded ""being a teammate is not a sufficient payment and in order to get into my vehicle you must first perform oral sex on me."" I was then met with an uncouth verbal attack. This then escalated further into what can only be best described as a spontaneous form of slapstick comedy. ""VReady970"" began firing off several shots at the back of the vehicle in order to injure me and then subjugate myself under his control by his laughable attempt to dethrone me from driver's seat in the vehicle his telos (ultimate aim end goal and so on and so on) being so that he could drive off and abandon me to die. However in protest I then began gaining a momentous amount of speed proceeding to contact my car with ""VReady970"" until he was downed and then reversed over him dead. A catastrophic outcome for ""VReady970"" is also in part a valuable lesson in morality. The lesson being (although a depressing one) that he must perform oral sex the next time he wants to get into a vehicle without having anything to offer (in real life or alternative reality he must decide).Finally this game raises an important philosophical question that must be examined that being whether the player (the gamer the individual and so on) can handle such an intrinsic lesson in ontology which is delivered in such a naturalistic and almost primordial narrative so suddenly without any knowledge to the player beforehand.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-29,0,0,85,True,Recommended,"I don't usually write reviews for Early Access titles but this game has *a lot* of potential if the developers continue to make progress and don't abandon the title like most seem to do. I'll try and keep things short and sweet.Pros If you like DayZ's PvP then you'll enjoy this. It's essentially more of the same except without zombies. The map is reasonably sized so that although there will be periods you don't encounter anyone you're never really too far away from a threat. By extension of the above since you skydive from a plane and that plane is randomly positioned there's more variation in your starting experience. The mad rush to find weapons at the start especially if you land in a hotzone is thrilling. Weapon variety is good and are not too scarce with some of the more powerful weapons requiring effort to obtain. Vehicle variety is good and not too scarce. The playable radius of the map decreases over the time funneling people into a hotzone closer to the end of the round. Generally good performance. I can run on Ultra 60fps with a GTX 980 I5 4670k OC'd 4.2GHz. Sound and animations are pretty much spot on.Cons Although you shouldn't really expect it in this type of game don't expect players to be nice. If you've not found a weapon and some guy comes across you with an assault rifle you are dead. Similarly players are incredibly annoying over voice chat. Mute. By extension voice broadcast is ""On"" by default and can potentially give away your position. Numerous bugs crashes performance issues on occassion. To be expected with an Early Access game but worth mentioning nontheless. Hit detection is hit and miss sometimes all your shots will make contact sometimes not. Desync issues cause players not to take damage etc. Cheaters / hackers. Yes they exist. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise is either a hacker themselves or ignorant to how multiplayer video games or computer systems actually work. Although the use of Unreal Engine 4 is good I find the graphics to be pretty lacklustre.Potential Improvements I would like to see more map varieties. I'm tired of ""Generic Island"" and miles of farm yards / forestland. Give us snow! I honestly think they should implement a seperate PvPvE mode where say wild animals are a threat and you have to eat/drink. More vehicle clothing and weapon variety but doubless these will come in time.Comparsions I haven't played H1Z1 but most people seem to be thinking it's better. This game is essentially what DayZ should have been without zombies and is already much better. The smaller map and lack of survival elements outside of PvP combat lend itself to a much tigher engaging experience. Bothemia Interactive REALLY dropped the ball with DayZ which is unfortunate though not suprisingly given how much of a money maker it was. If PUBG continues to get updated regularly and with plenty of content then it will stand the test of time.Verdict If you're on the fence especially with it being an Early Access title then I don't blame you. Although the game has had support since release such can be said about previous titles that have become incredibly popular only to die a death. For what my opinion is worth I am confident that this is a product worth investing in purely for the current experience alone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-24,0,0,101,True,Not Recommended,I used to love this game but now I wish that I never had brought it.Reasons 1) Developers had broken their promise of not selling in game content during the Early Access. Only 4 month had past after early access release and they already lost honor to their own greed. 2) Developers keep stuffing the game with ridiculous content. For example ads all over the level. They are ruining the atmosphere of their own game to advertise some stuff like online stores(I mean ESL) or they own tournament events on Gamescom. 3) Game performance is terrible. For example my 200$ videocard(GTX 960) can't handle the game on ultra low setting without lagging for 3 30 seconds just on landing. Every second lost on landing is devastating for your survival chance because you need to arm yourself as fast as possible but instead you are lagging standing target for up to 30 seconds!And its getting worse with every patch because developers are overloading video memory with textures of ad graffities and paid content like pink miniskirts! 4) Major game bugs are left unfixed for more than 5 months for example invisible obstacles which could destroy your car when hit on.5) During Gamescom tournament developers had shown themselfs from not to bright side. The event had terrible score rules low quality operators performance and was overcrowded with streamers instead of good players. Very very unprofessional as for my opinion. I no longer believe that game will become anything good. With every patch it's more game of ads and miniskirts and less about guns and tactics.Think twice before spending your time(the game is very hard to learn) and money on this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-08,2,9,2036,False,Not Recommended,"Terribly optimized. Creator cares more about profits from crates than fixing the game. Buildings dont always load in my specs are well above the recommended.Game freezes all the time Multiple restarts are sometimes required just to play 1 game. Just sad how the game was very profitable and instead of reinvesting money back into the game to make it more enjoyable for consumers the creator just implements more ways for him to profit.Would be a pretty decent game if not for the unplayable bugs that rely in the game and have been there since the beginning of release.Also connecting to games is a hit or miss and you might just not make it and have to restart.9/13/2017 Edit 5gb update and none of it is improving optimization. They also stated ""PUBG declared its updates would become less regular so as to maintain a ""high standard of quality"" moving forward."" basically stating updates will come less frequently showing that the bug fixes will take longer to come in and seems like they just don't care about the playability of the game. I do not recommend you getting this game for many reasons.1. The devs do not care for fixing problems that have been in the game from the very start.2. The optimization is poor and there looks to be no correction of that in the near future or maybe even the future.3. $30 is an outrageous price to pay for a game with this many problems. Wait for a sale and i dont mean the one where the game goes from $30 to $29. It is not worth the frustration that will inevitably come from you trying to play the game.Lastly they can see that their game is doing better than their counterpart ""H1Z1"" so they would be under the impression that they won't need to change anything big in order benefit the user experience. After promising they wouldn't do ""DLC"" they released things otherwise because they see the profit margin that games such as ""Counter Strike"" ""Dota 2"" etc is pretty large. And in thinking that they would want to pursue that alley of content in order to increase the money they made from the game but refuse to reinvest in order to provide a game we deserve.Edit It has now been over 6 months since the initial release date. The game was said to be out of early access in 6 months. Too much work for the PUBG team? Too many bugs they care little about? Too many ""DLC's"" that you pay for to be released before the game is out of early access? Just sad.Out of ""Early Access"" review Game fully released. Tons of bugs still present. Game is still terrible optimized. The only real big difference is you will not find this under the early access games. Still garbage still not worth $60. Still not worth your time. Play a different game don't give the owners of this game any satisfaction by playing their game. Fortnite BR is free 2 play and the owners actually care about their game with frequent updates.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-28,0,0,140,True,Not Recommended,I love this game and I wanted to grind it out quite hard after waiting more than two weeks for the release however I came to a huge dissapointment.After buying it straight when it came out I couldn't run the game at all and I still can't after some time of waiting for the optimisation patch or something like that. After going through pretty much every post on the forum and tutorials on youtube how to max out the performance of this unoptimised I give up. The minimum system requirements are a total lie and only the best rigs can run it fine... It's a shame but I will still wait for the patch because I really enjoy watching the game and I would be even more pleased if I could actually play it. For 27 I expected much better. As I said there is nothing wrong with the game itself it's just the performance and optimisation section which made me not recommend this game at the current time.

2017-09-13,0,0,465,True,Not Recommended,Desync issues lag issues and the lack of kill trade makes the game super imbalanced. With the amount of players playing the game you'd think they'd have invested in some servers. I can go from DOTA 2 and play with 40ms ping to this game where I'm constantly at 120 150. Invest in your game might be a good idea instead investing in fog maps and hats.Do not buy this game until they fix the issues mentioned. If your lucky enough to live close enough to one of the servers you might have a good time killing everyone else that has worse latency/desync.Oh and there's thishttps //steamuserimages a.akamaihd.net/ugc/858355614969126502/A54FE324B51AF518FC9E77308441A9E445C3D090/ Enemy drops with no buildings spawned drives a vehicle through all buildings/terrain because he can see every person/loot on the map.

2018-05-24,0,0,630,False,Not Recommended,"This game is the most garbage piece of that you can possibly spend your money on.The game still feels like its in early access the game runs like complete dog even when you have a super high end PC. The game is debatably not even playable for the first 2 minutes of the match because of server lag so you have to drop away from groups of people to avoid dying from lag. The game is prone to crashing and memory leaks no matter how much ram/vram you have. you can't shoot out of a vehicle because the game runs like and you go from 100 to 15 frames while peaking out of a car(should honestly just take it out the game because you're more likely to be shot out the car. You can only shoot out of a vehicle of the person is driving completely straight down the smoothest of roads.. Vehicle mechanics are trash and unrealistic for a game that focuses mainly on realism. Cars flip and do barrel rolls after hiding the tiniest of bumps. While driving you'll randomly crash into an invisible pebble that will make you do front flips or just have the same effect as hitting a brick wall. If you get inbetween two object the wrong way you'll be glitched intbetween them (with the only way escaping being knocking yourself away with a grenade.) There have been times that I have glitched through the floor and the only thing you can do is swim under the map. You crash AT LEAST 1 3 games and it WILL be durring an important moment that your team needs you or when the game is about to end or when you're simple trying to run to zone. This game is prone to hackers (Like shotgun your entire squad out of a moving vehicle or just no scope your entire squad) or killing your entire team with a single clip of a gun. Grenades in this game make little to zero sense at times. Someone could throw a grenade at the opposite side of a house with there being litteral walls inbetween you and you'll still be knocked out. You can throw a grenade right ontop of someone and that person either gets slightly damaged or be completely unaffected. Shotguns are extremely inconsistent in damage you can shoot someone with no armor twice with a shotgun and they wouldn't die. you can have level 2 3 armor and helmets and you'll get oneshot with a shotgun. There were also times where I sniped someone decently far away (70+ meters) with a 2 pump shotgun. Guns in this game aren't balanced at all. It's not even that guns are preferenced over others some are just inferior in every single possible way to others. You'll spend most of each match running to zone you never find a vehicle when you need one. Or other players ahead of you just shoot out all the tires of every vehicle you see. Majority of your games where you choose don't land near the center of the map you'll walk the entire game then die to edge campers.The game looks like literal They arguably made the graphics look terrible so that it would be harder to see enemy players. The way things are shaded makes them look like they're something else. For example a far away bush will look like an enemy player aiming at you. A far away rock will look like a vehicle. Parachuting in this game is extremely bad (this literally determines how well you do the first 3 minutes of the game which for the most part determines how well you do the rest of the game.) While parachuting you'll get stuck on nothing and hover above the ground likely until another player comes and guns you out of the air like the degenerate you are for playing this trash game. Or you'll just glitch off the roof you were trying to land on. You buy crates with points you earn ingame (BP) which contain clothing and gunskins. You aren't able to choose whice crate you buy. (most of the crates require keys) The key's cost $2.50 These crates are basically ""gatcha boxes"" which have extremely low chances of you getting anything worth while. 99.9999% of the time you use a key on a crate you'll get something worth 30 cents(if you're lucky) so you can't even sell it to make a decent amount of your money back. Most of the clothes you can get in this game look like utter doodoo unless of course the very very very rare ones. If you want specifc clothes in this game you're much better off just buying it from other players. I've saved around 30 boxes for a mass unboxing test to see what i'd get and i've recieved about 10 copies of the same trash combat pants one button down shirt and a bunch of other garbage shoes and pants that are worth 2 cents each.(meaning nothing i recieved were considered rare). This is even more ridiculous because you can't choose the crates you recieve so you can't even decide from which pool of items you can roll from. each crate requires its own seperate key meaning if you have extra keys and another crate comes out you have to buy the next designated key. This game made little progress since early access mechanics are still buggy and glitchy as they were before some things are debatably worse than before. The only actual improvement that I've commended were the change to throwing grenades through windows they used to break the glass but bounce back towards you (made zero sense.) The reason this game has so many players and has been doing decent over the past year and a half is because it had a lot of potential and people had fun playing the game because they understood the game was early access and that the game was on track to be an amazing masterpiece. HOWEVER I repeat ... the game has made very little progress towards actually fixing and optimizing the game. Insstead of actually improving the game they waste time porting an even ier version of the game onto console (at that point it was considered an unfinished game ... and they spent alot of time porting it) they spend alot of time making garbage maps adding more garbage guns into the game more gacha boxes. They're just cashing in on the game right now because it's easier to make more clothes and skins to buy than fixing the game. The only argument against this is that they donate SOME of the proceeds to charity. again only some of it they still greatly profit off of this. This isn't a small company. They've had more than enough time to fix and optimze the game.The only people that got their moneys worth are people that preordered the game for the unattainable preorder clothing and' and or got the limited eddition twitch prime clothing. I made my money back from selling my twitch prime clothing.At the time of writing this review I have about 588 hours average 20% wins top 10% of players for squad games (average i'm not bragging if you're not top 10% you're garbage and should feel bad because most scrubs die first 3 minutes of the game) so i'm pretty qualified to explain why you shouldn't buy this game.To sum it up Graphics are trash Game runs like trash even with a $3000 computer Game feels like it's still in alpha Game is pretty much luck based (you'll either get really lucky with the zone but get really unlocky most of the time) (loot an entire town not find a gun then get rekt by someone that did) $30 market price when the game at this point feels its worth $5 players would rather ruin your game than try to win themselves. The game is trashIf you don't care about the building aspect play fortnite it's free optomized works doesn't crash everyother game better developers they'r actually noticable improving their game. Fortnite's primary game mode was supposed to be a zombie defence game but made a battle royale game mode in about 5 minutes relative to the time pubg spent doing absolutely nothing to improve the game. I'm not over exagerating pubg has plenty of time and money (most played game on the steam charts practically 100% of time time). it's sad they should honestly just sell the game to another company with better developers that will actually improve the game and give it the attention it deserves.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-10,1,5,882,True,Not Recommended,"Edited for update Unfortunately this will be my last edit for a while until I hear through the grapevine this game has improved or I get fatalistically bored and play it. Steer clear from this game as is because the developer has no idea what he is doing with every subsequent patch where my lag issues have only gotten worse and hackers are more prevalent than ever. (I just ran into a guy who was able to delete the guns I was using. Think about that. As soon as I ran into his radius (I assume) my gun just disappeared. Happened to my co op partner. Sure it could be a bug but it did not look like a bug to me. Edited for update The current lag in this game has gotten worse with the most recent update. The amount of hackers has also skyrocketed. Every time I play this game I run into at least one guy. Hell I was playing Duo with a guy who was able to fire his gun underwater had unlimited ammo and could duplicate anything he picked up. I can't even stomach through what I once was able to enjoy. Definitely hold off on a purchase until this is resolved. I uninstalled the game after reporting hacks/cheats and receiving a WARNING from their forums for simply agreeing with someone that this game has massive hacking problems my first and last post. Original review I would like to recommend this game but I will not.There are lots of good things about this game but it comes down to really one major feature. Tension.Pro Tension like you wouldn't believe.Cons hackers (so far run into hackers that I know of over a half dozen times in two days.) latency issues Firing a full AKM clip into a guy before he goes down where as I take two shots as i'm dodging and am put down.Really those are the two cons.The latency issues can sometimes seem like ""hacking"" issues and frankly it'll be hard for a lot of people to tell the two apart I've had years of admin experience in FPS and consider myself somewhat of an old hand when it comes to realizing I've been stiffed.It can be fun but again I have the best internet possible in Chicago and playing in the NA server I'll be finding myself putting 5 headshots from behind into some guy only for him to turn around and destroy me. Instances like that will have you go ""lag or hack?""When this happens every other game its more than frustrating. Its a shame.If you are like me and get frustrated at these things this game will not be enjoyable.Here is an example of a frustrating match Landed in the military base managed to kill two people (one with my fists vs his pistol because pistols are god awful) and one with that very same pistol (P1911) into a prone looting guy in a corner. Pick up a M416 and a silencer. Then find a kar98 and kit that out. Find a Mil vest 3 and helmet 3 and various other goodies.Run across the bridge to the ne and find a crate falling from the sky. Camp the crate for two minutes and kill one guy with the kar as he is trying to loot the crate. Run up to crate and find the MG. Grab that and drop the m416 and run to a nearby buggy. Drive buggy to the center of the white ring and jump out. Find a second story building where I camp a door with no windows. Sit in room. Player numbers tick down from 60 40 30. I stay in the same room. 20 18. Same room. White circle moves to outside my room but still covers the building. I go to the other side and do the same thing for two minutes. White circle moves so I jump from the balcony to the floor and make it to another building where I repeat the same process. Now 15 left. 10. Sitting in room guy opens the door and I blast away at him with my MG. he just stands there looking at me. Then shoots me after I've finished firing 100 bullets close range into him. I die from one pistol shot despite having full armor/helmet 3. Yeah... no thanks.Half the frustration of this game comes from the incredible highs you get... to be undercut by what I mentioned is again a shame.It's possible this game will be worth playing in the future.

2017-08-05,0,0,667,True,Recommended,So I've seen the reviews fo this game take a hit with the recent updates and wanted to give my two cents.Yes a crate system has been introduced but the items are purely cosmetic. Don't see why so many people are off by this since it has absouletly no effect on gameplay. It's purely optional like Dota2 or CS GO. Just because it's there doesnt mean you have to take part in it.The most recent monthly patch (August 2017) basically broke the servers to the point where the game was unplayable. However within around 36 hours a hotfix was released and since then the servers have been in the best shape the've ever been in. Been playing this game since it came into early access and within 4 months they've come a huge way. When i first started playing I was getting around 30fps the game was full of bugs and the servers were (granted I'm playing on a Laptop running a GTX 860).Now I'm getting a constant 60fps on butter smooth servers. and almost all of the game breaking bugs have been fixed to the point where I can play for days without encountering one.Don't get me wrong this game still has a ways to go before completion. There's still bugs and glitches that need ironing out new content that was promised and proper First person for all servers (only available in NA and EU solos and duos at the time of writing) but seeing the dedication of the dev team and their attention to the community I'm fully confident that this is gonna be a masterpeice of a game at full release even more so than it already is.Even in its current state this game is highly recommended. Duos or Squads are the best since theres nothing more fun than dicking around with a bunch of mates but solo can be incredibly fun and tense too and is the mode I've played the most probably cos I don't have alot of gaming friends (. Obviously can get frustrating when you have all the gear in the world and you get killed by a guy camping a bathroom with a micro uzi but thats part of the game.The very late stages of the game are the best bits. When you're in a town with fire fights going off all around you and you hear footsteps around the corner. Has led to some of the greatest gaming moments of my life.If you have a rig that can comfortably run this (and a few friends to play with optional) get it. You won't regret it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-09-08,3,5,1213,True,Recommended,The game as an idea is very good very fun and very addictive.Let me tell you that i am running it medium settings with an AMD FX9590 GTX970 and 8GB RAM i can't get stable FPS and sometimes the game lags alot. Now lets go to the gameUps Awesome gameplay The idea is amazing 100 people battling around for weapons and who will stay alive in the finish. You can play this game either as solo quequer duo with a friend or squad of 3 and 4 people.The game is addictive and that's good you don't get bored of itYou might say the developers are not planning to drop the game since they force updates weekly and monthlyCons Game is still buggy Many bugs that needs to be fixed even if it is in EAPoor optimization They need to fix this ASAP i don't take any excuse why they hadn't done that alreadyPoor servers Servers in general are okish but there are some that you have massive lag from ping (playing only eu servers)Cars and vehicles The cars and generally the vehicles are slow and make a lot of noise which makes you have massive disadvantage you also have disadvantage if you are on the vehicle and someone knows how to properly shoot you. I believe they can change that.Shooting people The hitboxes are a mess as the shooting itself. Happens to have 4x scope 8x scope aiming to the head from a distance (ofcourse i changed the meters) and the bullet went very very off (You can learn that by playing more and more so you will get the mechanic but still they can make a change here). Map I think the map needs some improvement due to so many open places and sometimes you run and you pray noone is there to hit you and die. Also the campers are part of the game. I pray for that one time that the safe zone will close on top of me which never happened always had to move in safe zone and fighting with person were already in there cause the safe zone close in them without doing any move.One other thing that i would want to see it changing is when you are duo or squad if someone hits you and it's instant death you should die and not just knock out. And one last happens very often looting 5 houses and find absolutely nothing and get in one house and find 1 ak 1 kar supressors and full extends with healing I belive they need to do something with this i know it's kinda random but we all know where are the hot loots even if you have to battle for thisTLRDGame is nice needs alot of work yet before it gets released. I hope the developers fix everything i mentioned and i am sure many more i didn't wrote. Recommend since it's fun and addictive but as i said needs a lot of work.6/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can empty an entire clip into someone with the same armor that I have and they'll be fine. On the other hand people can consistently fire full auto from miles away and kill me in 2 or 3 shots.

It has such a tactical gameplay feel and the gun selection is great.I have 93 hours played in H1Z1 and I can honestly say this game is more fun to play. I wouldn't say it's any better or worse because it's totally different. In H1Z1 you can run around with a shotgun. If you try that in this game you'll get sniped from someone on a mountain 200m away with an 8x scope.And if anyone tells you that a beastly PC is required they're wrong. I have an Intel Core i5 processor and a GTX 750 and I run all settings very low (with the exception of textures those are on medium) and it runs a steady 45 50 fps which is perfectly playable for me.The only complaint I have is the servers. It seems as if the devs weren't expecting this game to be as popular as it is and the servers are always overloaded. You sometimes get a popup saying ""network lag"" and you can't move at all. This only happens rarely and if it does it lasts 10 seconds at most. So in summation this game is great and you should pick it up if you don't have it already.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So you create unfinish products and trying ban people because they abuse it. Its like selling unfinished automobile and if you hit someone they take your car back. Noo you the manufacture automobile get sued possible goto jail when you know you selling broken automobile. ok ok....LOGIC BLUEHOLE????3. selling skin with keys!!!!! you game is UNFINISHED what the **** SO UNETHICAL just because DAYBREAK doing it and you follow their footsteps. GREED GREED where is the priority finished the game!!!! you sold 2 millions copies 40 millions profits use that money if you are going tournament price money !!!4. Since community support you guys BLUEHOLES at least the one give community free skins as APRECIATION!!! not the one cheap as skins or stupid skins with twitch mark on it.Overall that me off GREED GREED GREED skins skins skins...its should be free!!!!! Now everyone release unfinished game and keep making more money from broken game. Ill give thumbs NO due to the GREED and UNETHICAL doing business.If you buying this game its fun to play with friends but do not support their skins selling. Great community is the community that can boycott this type or kind of business company as a lesson. If the community is dumb keep supporting this type of bad behavior nothing will CHANGE.

2017-11-01,0,0,613,False,Not Recommended,Another game spoiled by greedy developers. Nothing is optimized in this game. I have issues myself but considering my friend with GTX1080 and having barely average 60fps is pretty ridiculous. If You can't get at least 50 60 average don't even play this game you will never win nor kill anyone without playing dirty. The servers are crap I could speak about their issues the whole time but it's pointless they are unoptimized hitboxes respond like 40% times. Players teleport at times they hit you from ridiculous angles. Servers are simply fu**ed up there's no denying. Most people camp because they cannot get the playable minimum from their PC and as they are willing to kill someone they are forced to take extra precausion. You may have watched some streamers and You never see them camping they obviously know that when it comes to shooting they have all the hardware advantage thus only 5% can only stand a chance with them. Throughout the development I have never seen a patch with engine improvement. They just praise the streamers that can afford the best of hardware our feedback doesn't matter. All they do is add advertisements to the game and more microtransactions. There's no reason for You to go and read more reviews this game is done. After all the income they got the development didn't advance a single inch. It is really not worth Your time there are much much better games than this early access cancer.1.0 Release Update The only thing that makes this game unplayable are now servers. I am 400h into the game and the game still does not register 86% of fired bullets. The funniest thing is when I am watching the demos to avoid what I've done wrong in my plays but the sh*t comming out of the server side gameplay is just nuts. F**k anti cheat measures I prefer playing on high tickrate servers with cheaters rather than with casual players with no aim capabilities that kill me behind the cover by shooting the air not the actual model this feels like a cheat to me really... Fortnite servers are basically the same.I am happy to get a profit of the in game crates not to regret the purchase but that's all I can tell good about the game at current state. The game performance improved but it's still all over the place. I've played hundreds of early access games and I can tell you that PUBG has genuienly the laziest developer team I have ever seen.

Looting simulator when you are looking for items for 30 40 min and then get killed by sniper with single shot. Whole game is a russian roulete so mostly luck decides who would win.2. Lags.How about to play for 30 40 mins and then die because of stucking in a texture of stone riding motocylce. Here we go.How about to by a f****cking chinese supercomputer to play this game without lags?How about to play for 30 40 mins and then your game will crush what obviously leads to your death? And how about same thing happened every 5 6 games?If u don't mind this u can actully try to play it. 3. Desync.In pubg there is a big differene in what is going on server and what is going on your screen.Even desync in 0.3 0.6 sec makes this imposible to win fair 1vs1 fight. You think u were hiding behind the cover? Nope you were busy catching all f*****g bullets enemy shot in you.4. CheatersAll good sides of this game really goes away when you were killed by a chater. Game is used to relaxing not to making me feel my helplessness.5. Bluehole. With all these sides Bluehole really made one good improvement map choise.After community became mad at them.But I DON""T NEED NEW F***NG MAP.

Almost every game ends with a hacker wiping out the last 20 players or few teams.I know that people are being very rude to the Chinese playerbase but I honestly can understand the frustration. When roughly 70% of the games you play in any other server are filled with Chinese speaking players it creates a verbal barrier for the community. NA servers and Oceania servers are prime examples of this. Try playing squads with matchmaking and see how often you are teamed with a Chinese speaking person.And the people who are stating that there has been an influx of Chinese hackers are not racist there just happens to be an influx of players who just happen to be Chinese and also happen to be hackers. Not every Chinese player is going to be aimbotting or wallhacking but there is a very noticeable group of them who are. That is not saying that other groups of people around the world aren't hacking I have met plenty of other language speaking hackers as well.I'm not saying region locking the game is the way to go. But I believe a temporary block could help give the team time to create a better anti cheat. The death cam was a step in the right direction! You just need to follow it up now.Also there is also a bug that defaults people to play in the Asian servers despite clicking on any other please fix.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't think I need to discuss all the problems this game has and how lazy the devs are. Somehow Fortnite is a free game and the amount of quality work and optimization done to that game is leagues ahead of this trash heap of a game. There's also a more recent game called Ring of Elysium that is almost identical to pubg in every way but plays better and has dozens of QOL improvements that pubg doesn't have.

Too bad that's rarely the case. The game COULD be great but it's not. The devs choose to add new maps the vaulting system sounds animations weapons which are all great! But not when the game is poorly optimized contains too many bugs to count and it stays that way. They ignore everything wrong with the game add in new things that break the game a little bit more then expect to be praised like heroes. Nah I'm not with that. On the other hand the game is fun. Wether you're solo duo or in a squad there's always something fun about the game and that's why I spend a lot of time playing it. Just because a game is bad doesn't mean it's not fun.

Now I get 6 a night through a 2 3 hour session before I give up. Nothing sucks more than playing 25 minutes into a match reaching the top ten then crashing. No other games crash. My drivers are up to date. It's just PUBG.Yeah there's botters / hackers / cheaters but the crashes ruin my experience more than anything. I've no idea how they're going to fit in a full release before the end of 2017 as it's early November now and major features are still missing from the Test Server and the Live Early Access servers.There's other stuff but it doesn't bother me.

2017-12-05,0,0,343,True,Not Recommended,My experience started off extremely well but was quickly stunted by the very high amount of hackers and aimbotters that are present in this game. Every second death was the result of a ridiculous headshot with a weapon that should'nt be that accurate. On top of this the game has started to crash for no apparent reason. I would understand this is the game was small in popularity but given how popular it is and how long it has been out for this is an unacceptable occurance that tragically hinders the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-07,0,0,212,True,Not Recommended,While interesting as a concept this game lacks in basic features. There is a lack of actual controller inputs and while this game does use anti cheat software people still abuse solo play by buddying up which needs to be addressed. The game is poorly coded and poorly optimised for what are very much last gen graphics. I am running a GTX 1080 and this makes my PC fans go crazy yet I can run other games on ultra and my PC doesnt go crazy. There is also a long standing bug within the game where by the frame rate drops drastically as a player is rendered somewhere in your area. reducing graphics setting does not solve this problem and it effectively lets people know when people are nearby. It is a heavy drop too going from 60 to about 45 fps for a few seconds. The game is basically rinse and repeat. Good but not great. 6.5/10 maybe a 7 on this games best day. Oh and the hit indicator is dog on a paper platter. It does not help locate where the shots are coming from.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-14,1,1,1012,True,Recommended,So because I played so many hours of this damn addicting game i thought i should do a review. First of I have nearly 500 hours brought into this game so I know nearly every pro and contra. But there are many things where you can think with two mindsets and I cant look into the brains of other ones so sorry for that boys. I have to say this game is absolutely amazing to play and you really get into it after a while playing it. Its really skillbased but you can still have really much fun even as a beginner because there is so much to learn. the level of strategy needed by this game is quite high i d say and till yet it didnt get any boring. You just go into a round kill a few people or die win the round or lose but still you have fun and lust to do another round. Its a great thing for such a game that there is yet no ranked game mode because after a few months you would get tilted as to be completely honest. Also if you dont have a good computer yet you should just forget the game. Its kinda impossible to play it with a below average PC. Also there are many bugs in the game but I can tell by twitter that the team is really working on it. So i think i have to give this game a thumps up and really look really forward into the future of Playerunknowns Battlegrounds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,200,True,Recommended,A great game if you have a couple friends to play it with. The concept's not new 100 person battle royale style gameplay however it has been done very well here providing some exciting shootouts and standoffs. On the downside the devs have seemed to move from caring about making a great game better and moving away from optimisation (which it needs a lot of) to money making with the new crate system. The recent reveal that they were planning to port to console was also quite upsetting as I feel the game isn't complete a) in terms of content and b) in terms of bugs and glitches.I really like this game and I would recommend getting it but I'm not going to be surprised if it turns out to be a flop in a couple of months.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-04,0,0,1797,True,Recommended,"04/04/17 120h ""Review"" If you want something with action to play with friends this is the game to do so. Been 2 weeks since launch and the game is going strongh. Optimization needs work but like I said game came out 2 weeks ago. I have a solid 60 120fps in houses/towns/middle of the field (can get low as 40fps in big towns but those need work) with a RX480 and i5 6400 4Ghz. Right now you can play solo duo squads of 4 people (you can play with only 3 and fill up with a random or just your group). It's not comparable to H1Z1 I mean sure it's battle royal but it's a totally diferent game and feels different aswell (DayZ feel to it). Early Acess have to say this is the best example of EA I've ever seen. The game is fairly polished and runs well ( on this I'd like to add that the game runs WELL for ME I also play with everything on LOW settings for a competitive end. A lot of people been complaining about performance but with the game being out for such a small time you can't really complain about that...or anything at all since its EA...and you were told that..) Bad stuff? I don't like to point the finger at anything given its a EA acess game sure optimization is ok but will improve circles need work servers are sometimes but well this game its the 3rd most played game on steam right now so its stressing the server game feels arcadish? (is that a word?) well for game purposes it has to be that way this is not insurgency you don't hit a person once and he dies...sometimes it takes way to many.1500h&gt AWESOME GAME",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If they are not 100% try to replace them. You want all your equipment and health at 100% in the final circles. Air drops are a gamble. Use your instincts on whether or not to go for it.

2017-09-30,0,0,379,True,Recommended,25.06.2018 I have to admit I've been losing touch with this game for a few months. It has not been enjoyable and the content was stale. This new update has changed things for me. The QBZ is an incredibly fun weapon. It feels right the damage is great and the spawn rate is fantastically high. The upsetting part for me is that I know it will soon be nerfed...The new map is what dragged me back into the game. Since the update I have played hours upon hours of it just for the new map. There are however some issues to be addressed.1. The lack of map selection on the old battle royale series is not a good idea. Why are we calling it mini royale and battle royale? What's wrong with just selecting a map?2. When you have just exited a game and you immediately click ready up your character does not ready up you don't find a game but the ready up icon is greyed out and unselectable. This can usually be fixed by restarting lobby but on occasion I have had to restart the game.3. The loading screen time has been significantly increased. When I'm loading into a game sometimes I can hear myself running on the dirt after parachuting and I'm still not loaded in.I hope these issues can be fixed soon. Thanks for making the game good again. An early access supporter.OLD REVIEW So This game of yours that I paid a good portion of 30 for really does not work...It is a great idea and a great game however you need to FIX THE DAMN THING.This is literally the defenition of AIDS Half the time you can't connect to servers The lag is actually unreal Loading errors left right and center Made hundreds of millions of dollars still can't fix the 'servers too busy' thingHeres a suggestion Put the extortionate amount of money that you made from an unfinished pile of wank to good use and FIX THE GAME PLEASE!If the game doesn't work why on Earth release it?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,593,False,Not Recommended,Initially this was a fun game. With friends. Even with all the kinks that came with the game for it's price it has been quite enjoyable at times.Game is gradually getting worst. It has been less than 2 weeks since 1.0 release out of early access and I feel there are already plenty of cheaters in the game. Every game has me questioning whether I've been killed by a cheater. It's a terrible experience. Credit to Bluehole for adding the death cam in game. I know now for a fact when I've been killed by a cheater. Let's be real they are cheaters. They don't deserved to be called hackers they don't hack anything. Pros Fun with friends Relatively cheap $30 game for hours of replayabilityCons Too many issues with game (lag bugs glitches and overall instability) Cheaters Lack of quality of life features (can't choose what map to play on etc.) Co op with friends is punishing if someone dies early on (either you play on or restart if your team mate plays on you could be spectating them from 1 30 mins). Although this is arguable as this is the style/objective of the game. Batte Royale.If you are planning to spend on this game because your friends are committed to playing with you then by all means try it out. You'll probably get your money's worth.I don't play this game solo anymore it's not fun. It's not rewarding. Cheaters make it worst. The game looks much nicer and smoother (at some points) in 1.0 but overall it's still a experience.Uninstalled 569 hours.Peace,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,256,False,Not Recommended,I got to be honest I bought into the hype of this game. I played it for a while during pre release and did have fun with my friends getting into all sorts of crazy situations but there is a single major problem I have with this game and thus would not recommend it to you. That problem is optimization. I have a pretty high spec rig for gaming with which I have played MANY demanding FPS and MMOs and I was wrong in thinking this game would eventually run decent. The game stutters randomly Frame Drops happen randomly throughout both maps hit registration is the sound can be hit and miss and finally it just feels clunky when doing most everything in the interface. It's not the worst game ever but I got sick of waiting for the game to run like a well optimized piece of software. I'd also like to add that I have observed cheaters in roughly 1 in 3 matches on average ranging from the early days with full auto SKS to the ongoing speed hackers that can run at the speed of light. The servers are also and you'd think with all the money these devs are making off the MASSIVE community they could upgrade their netcode and servers. Save your money and buy something that actually runs and doesn't play like it's still in Alpha. Clunky as hell.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is really fun to play and when it works it just works rest of the time its torture to play. I hope they fix most of the problems when the full game comes out because now i have a love hate relationship with it.

2017-11-23,0,0,36,True,Recommended,Product received for free. This is a fun and enjoyable game but not without faults. It needs to be optimized and the servers are lackluster. But the game play is very enjoyable. The game is not worth 30$ as of right now but with time and further updates I'm sure this can be a very successful game. Its best played with friends so you can communicate among yourselves. And if you don't like games that have slow points you will not enjoy this.

I'm sure that is why the game has massive sales figures.When you see the tweets about the massive amount of players banned take into consideration that they all probably bought another copy after being banned.I hope they sort it but they seem to be twindling in updates and I think they rushed 1.0 out so as not to be associated with DayZ as being another failed EA game stuck in beta. This game is still in BETA in my eyes. When players are rubberbanding all over the place and add to that all the other bulls**t it's still beta until fixed.

2017-05-10,0,0,75,True,Recommended,This game is exhilarating! I've played just about 10 hours so far and already the number of times I've felt my heart pounding in my chest or gone giddy with excitement or jumped in my chair from surprise are beyond counting.To address the elephant in the room it doesn't run very well (I get about 20 25 fps on the lowest settings with a basic laptop and good internet) but I'm surprised to say it hasn't put me off perhaps a testament to how good the gameplay actually is.Battlegrounds is addicting exciting and always fresh but from what it sounds like the poor framerate issues are universal (even on high end computers) and will be hard to fix my impression is that the devs are indeed working tirelessly on it but the improvements are still a long time coming.If sub par performance is a deal breaker for you maybe this isn't your game... Yet. It's still in early access as of this review so it can only get better. I would still recommend it for those seeking exhilarating gameplay but with the above reservation that it won't run as well or look as pretty as other contemporary games of the same ilk.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The physics are slightly improved and since the full version I have only once been killed by a stationary car. But here's the largest issue with the game Hackers. They're mostly Chinese and there EVERYWHERE. It's really seeming like I end up encountering them in most games that I play. Within two hours I was killed by a man noscoping me through a rock and another guy headshotting my teammates through smokes at impossible distances.

2017-10-26,0,0,486,True,Recommended,Let me start by saying i really enjoy playing this game. PUBG is a blast to play espcially with friends. However there are several things that absolutely ruin the game. First off the game is still poorly optimized. I know i dont have a top end PC but i have no issues running any games but this. 3 out of 4 games i have to wait about 10 25 seconds prior to looting due to buildings not rendering. Also the game is filled with hackers. Hopefully the creators are doing things to fix these issues. All in all it is a fun game and i enjoy playing it but buyers beware. Until changes happen you will be dissapointed probably half of the time while playing this game.Update to my review My game has been running much smoother now with all of the updates the game has been adding. Hackers are still a thing but i feel like the creators are doing a good job of banning them. I strongly recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Good luck ""hot dropping"" anymore because when you land you can not pick up any weapons because of their code and then you get killed.

For example it doesn't have a lot of weapon variety or another example would be the buildings across the whole map they're just the same buildings with the same furniture inside them and sometimes even the same items.

I dont' mind grinding or having paid cosmetics but when I earn BP and buy a loot crate and get a locked one requiring to pay real $ to buy a key to open it. Thats just plain wrong. Period! Would never have bought it if i had known.That aside the game is fustrating but if you hold on and can be fun. The other biggest problem with this game is the asians on the N/A servers.

First of all You need to have PERFECT pc to get at least 100 fps cause even if you're playing on 70 fps and shoting guy that has 80 fps you lose cause the tick rate on the servers are like 5 or 10 and there are tons of t in that game like you shot you see the blood and in fact the guy didnt take the any damage cause tickrate says so. Second of all the amount of cheaters in this game is ridiculous. It's not cheating with simple maphack or even aimbot there are next level cheats like for example no recoil arms extending (yes like gadget arm) to shot the guy from the 100km away teleportation. Game even with terrible lags and worse optimalization was playable on the release cause there wasnt enough cheaters and you could make it to top10 rather easily now You're dealing I would say with 80% of cheaters most certainly triggers no recoils and ""no enviroment mods"". Anti Cheat system in this game is Battle Eye which is the arrow to the foot already You could literally download any cheats for free and yet won't be banned for more than a year.

Even though I don't have many hours on record to write a full review this is what I can say for the game so far. (Side note as of writing this review I have 10 hours on record). This game gives you adrenaline very quickly. One moment you can be running in a field not thinking there is anyone near you and the next moment you can be getting shot at trying to hide or locate the enemy. Very few games have given me this feeling of anticipation and making my heart race and I am so glad to have purchased this game. I was a little on the fence since it is an early access game and the price was 30 dollars but I said screw it and bought the game. I don't regret buying the game for a second. When I play with friends and when we find a four seat vehicle we like to shoot at enemy cars Mad Max style.

If you are coming from H1Z1 don't be suprised that it is much less arcade y and a much slower paced game. Cars are less rare however there is more weapon choice clothing attachments and so forth. Minimal bugs and missing features make the game slightly annoying to play.

Dejavu360 hours on recordHad so much promise it'll turn out to be another 4 years until 'beta'. Just like famous charities giving your money to faceless companies expect more turnover and lack of actual product or promise of a product.What PUBG is a basic FPS with copy and paste design and structure. A much better version of PUBG is available years ago it was on ARMA 2.The same arguement excuse of 'it is a small developer with a number of actual people working on developing the game design' well after 300 MILLION DOLLARS PLUS 6 months of time to development it is clear the direction of this company like so many before it Rust (Facepunch) 7D2D (The Fun Pimps) Dayz SA (Bohemia Interactive Dean Hall) just to name a few have been in development for YEARS and are no where near closer to being finished than 3 years ago. Now with PUBG it is being introduced to console gamers as an 'early access' game. Another wave of weak willed consumers ready to hand over $ to bluehole or whatever other developer that wants to profit off creating half made games in the hopes that it will gain popularity and become 'viral'. We as the consumers are creating this enviroment and allowing these companies to take advantage of our hopes that they will be good to us and deliver a working product.I would never pay someone upfront for work on my home it should be no different for a video game. Unless as investors we got some sort of return thus far it is broken games and false promises.Bought the game because it was the week 'favorite' for my friends.I found it fun and infuriating as any early access game. Overall this game is a disapointment... Developers seem only interested in adding cosmetics and micro transactions then actually fixing any of the actual issues affecting the player experience.Experience cheaters every day I have ever played this game. To the point I don't want to play it anymore... old feelings of titles like Rust or Arma 2 Dayz Mod level of hacking that really ruins the fun of the game as you can't simply respawn without starting all over.Game is clearly poor optimization and is still considered 'early access' which is pre Alpha... yet this game company is releasing a bug ridden semi working featureless battle royal with poor gun realism?I give this game one year of 'interest' good for PUBG another better company will come along.

I absolutely ing love this game.Okay sure it's got a LOT of issues. Some are small such as the schizophrenic gun mechanics and utterly sadistic incarnation of RNJesus that dominates this game's world as its overlord. Some are not so small such as HORRIFYING optimization and wonky mechanics. But you know what? I'm not going to about those things as this is early access. For an early access game this thing plays and looks damn good. Add that to an awesome dev team and a stellar community and things look peachy.But that's not what I love about this game. What I love is the gameplay itself. When I first got the game I was down with a three week case of pneumonia and I felt like And so getting rekt in an unfamiliar game with mechanics I wasn't used to and a choppy framerate (It runs exponentially better on my machine with recent updates by the way) I'll admit to getting a bit salty and thinking ""This game is crap."" But as I got better both health wise and gameplay wise I began to like it. What really clinched it for me though was my first kill. Dropped out in Gatka with a buddy one other team with us. I'm looting a building and this dude comes around the corner with an M16. It was a split second of electricity I clicked my mouse and heard the gloriously realistic sound of my looted shotgun going off and watched my would be killer drop to the ground in a lifeless heap. And once I had the taste of blood the game took on a whole new light for me. I began to enjoy the ferocious firefights the tense sniper duels and the terror of running through the open. I fell head over heels for this game and while I still suck at it I HIGHLY recommend it.Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go get rekt some more xD",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-10,0,0,1520,False,Not Recommended,"If you are looking for a short answer whether to buy this game or not the answer is no. NO. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. (Dated Jan.10 2018) If you want reasons jump into the extended review below.First of all I want to start by apologizing to anyone that has encountered hackers/cheaters in this game. I am Chinese and on behalf of the good(non cheating) part of Chinese players of this game I want to sincerely apologize to all of you. I am sorry that the majority(if not all) of cheaters are Chinese. I am sure you hate them I hate them too. They are ruining this game. I understand your #regionlockchina thoughts but please know not all of us are bad. There are even Chinese streamers cheating and Bluehole did not do anything about it. Unfortunately I cannot elaborate here but new comers please note BLUEHOLE KISSES STREAMERS' ASSES AND THEY WOULD NOT HEAR PLAYERS OUT.Secondly there are lasting server issues that is not fixed. This review is dated Jan.10 2018 almost a month after the 1.0 release. You would think that server would not have issue after the game leave EA. However during this month often player tags/names and clothing items would not load when you enter a game. This game still has server issue days before and after every patch. There is said to be an update Jan.11 and today I had played 5 games where 3 of them I could not enter at all and get connection timeout error pop up screen and other 2 of them I was killed by hackers.Thirdly there are several glitch through out the game and rubberband issues that severly hurt your gameplay experience. In the lobby sometimes some of your friends would not show online even if they are. Sometimes the team invitation will not go through. In the ""new"" map where it is tested on the test server for almost 3 months there are spots you can fall through floors stuck in crates etc. Regarding the rubberband issues I have experienced a lot of times where on my screen I am already behind cover for more than a second and in the killcam I was still exposed. (P.S. I am playing on NA server in Boston)Finally I would mention several things where the game did good even if in current state you should NOT buy it. The killcam was asked for in the EA state they did add that into the full release even with minor glitches it helped a lot pinpointing hackers and cheaters. There are obvious difference in killcam where one is hacking and one is just good. The optimization is imporving with each patch. I have experienced 30fps with GTX1080 in March 2017 to stably above 60fps in my current mid high custom settings. The game itself is extremely fun and the adrenaline rush it gives after each kill each firefight each win is unparalleled. Note I am not going to discuss the incoming microtransaction because everyone has their own opinion about it. But there is incoming microtransaction to be implemented into the game. It is cosmetic only.Note 2 If the hacking issue is fixed(there is incoming Chinese server of PUBG run by Tecent hopefully it will take at least part of the hackers away) then the game would be enjoyable and bearable as glitches and issues are being addressed and fixed. At least they are doing something. Will update review if issue is fixed.At last (non Chinese speakers are welcomed to google translate this). 开挂的都该死 生儿子没屁眼 生女儿没阴道 你妈被人操的七窍流血染上梅毒 你爸出门脑溢血摔马路上被车撞死 你家祖坟被人刨了 你家房子被雷劈了",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Heart racing the whole time....but...now....its gone. Hackers hackers everywhere. Every game has atleast one hacker to ruin that match for everyone. Next concern is the items in the game and I know its random every time but I went through 2 whole towns with about 5 buildings in each without finding a single optic or ammo for the weapon I was carrying. The very next game I find 3 red dots in one building the next has a 4x power and 2 holo sights and the very next building has 2 AKs 2 more effin red dots in the same room not to mention the other holo sight up stairs. I know it seems petty but it happens pretty often. Main concern is the hackers fix it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I am in love with the whole ""hunger games"" fight to the death/survival games. I liked The Culling for a while but that game has gone to I have played the Arma 3 Battlegrounds and that was fun but arma runs like aids(even on my i5 6600k and 1070 combo)and it has lost some of its popularity lately making it hard to find a match thanks to PUBG. If you are worred about this being an early access title you're not alone I am in the sinking Dayz Standalone ship made by the slowest devs in the world but the PUBG devs seem to inspire confidence and have been working hard with well timed updates and do a good job at keeping the community informed with what is going on behind the curtain. This is not the most or the worst optimized game in the world but check your specs to make sure you can get something like 60 FPS or better if not you will be at a disadvantage in firefights and that might get frustrating. But if you can run the game at a playable frame rate IT IS A BLAST especially with your friends. This is one of the only games that will get my heart racing and actally immerse me in the game.

As pleased as I am with the optimization it is vastly overshadowed by the game breaking hit detection. Sure you can say it isn't that bad. But you're only fooling yourself.

Developer listens to community and fixes bugs or makes wishes of the community come true (e.g. last 2 zones are now slower).I would add more weapons or new maps but the gameplay on its own if fantastic every round. Note this game requires more GPU than CPU.***Update 1.0***The new map Miramar is pretty good at all. Vaulting is a long awaited feature but does not affect the game as much as I supposed because on the old map you cannot get on any roof. You have to keep in mind that Erangel is not based on vaulting and Miramar indeed is. Rubberbanding is still a problem tho which could be easily fixed in my opinion. I hope the focus of the devs will be at improving the performance of PUBG rather than beginning with micro transactions or too many cosmetic items.All in all a pretty good game to play alone or with your friends!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

He then died to another hacker who was spraying his QBU wildly across map and shooting people in the head every time. That same player picked up a kar98 then started jumping around head shotting people without even aiming down. Too many hackers at all times for me to keep on going.

The first game my friend and I won we shouted and immediately ran around outside. The gunplay is intense strategy is critical and something as simple as good positioning are very imprtant in this game. People who value teamwork and communication are rewarded here.As you may hear the game can crash fairly often and has some moments of network lag. This can be frustrating and has sometimes resulted in the loss of 20 minutes of build up and preparation. However most of the time I have been able to relaunch the game and join back in after crashing in a minute or less. This game can be a lot of fun but it's always better with friends or with a squad that communicates in your language and has a good attitude. I haven't regretted my purchase.

I feel this game has promise but there some glaring issues. PROS Vaulting. This game needed vaulting for so long and its a welcome change. Terrain load times have been greatly improved since the release of early access. Deathcam feature is a nice change its been in other games for years. Allows for people to learn from mistakes immediately Replay system allows someone to analyse their matches from any angle to improve their position play and get better through film work. Gunplay in first person is really nice and is fairly smooth. (I main solo fpp) bullet drop is in the game which makes sniping at long distances a nice challenge but once you get good at it you can destroy people. CONS There are too many hackers a lot come from china and have infested everyother region. These hackers are making the game less fun to play because of their aimbot and are basically impossible to kill. That can be fixed by region locking chinese players to china. The lag on the servers is insane. The servers can either bless you with making you almost impossible to kill or make it so another player doesnt get hit. This is a must fix to have competitive play be possible. Its super frustrating to have what seems to be several shots to a body of another player not kill them. Replay system shows how bad it is but registering 2 of your 7 shots hit for like 33% of their health. The last big concern I have about the game is that it crashes. Not only does it crash but its always at the worst times like in top 10 for instance. Ive looked up supposed ""fixes"" but none of them really seem to do anything to help. This is a MUST fix it makes me not want to attempt to keep pushing my rating. It makes me almost not want to play the game because at the most intense moment without fail my game crashes thus killing me. I can't recommend the game in this state its too unpolished and theres too many issues to pay $30. Once Bluehole fixes some of the issues it'll be great.

Each shot and each action you take in a gunfight puts your skill and everything you put into this game against someone who has done the same.

2017-07-28,0,0,484,True,Recommended,I don't write reviews. Ever. However reading some of the reviews on here they are all aimed towards the microtransactions system. They are negatively rating the game over cosmetics. They do not enhance gameplay. I will still continue to play this game after microtransactions get introduced. The game is poorly optimised yes I will agree. However the core gameplay and experience is amazing. This game is enjoyable every match. So unless you feel the need to buy a new shirt for your character or something (Which in game will be covered by body armour and helm anyway) then I would HIGHLY recommend this game.EDIT Now all of the reviews are based on hackers.

Players warping several meters at a time players hitting you behind walls (and I thought battlefield was bad about this now I think its wonderful in comparison.) and some broken rng where an entire apartment complex will contain nothing but a pistol.

I wouldnt mind dying so much if it didnt take 20 30 minutes each cycle starting up a game and getting looted. It just creates this frustrating atmosphere that really takes away from the game.

High Hopes! SlothfulEdit 1 Not really much has improved in the game from what I can see it's still badly optimized and laggy with the tendency to sometimes get your charcter stuck in weird places and the bullets not always hitting your targets like you think they are! It's a fun game to play from time to time but other than that until they fix the bugs and make the performance a lot smoother I think I'm going to keep this review a negative!Edit 2 They have added added some better stability improvment updates now and the game actually runs relativley smooth the hit registration seems to be a bit better now too but I could just be imagining that the only thing I really have a complaint about is the lack of new content considering how much they made and how well they have done surely a new map or even just a bigger variety of weapons would suffice?

THIS IS A STEAMING PILE OF GARBAGE UPDATE 3 last update deleted game 14.10.2018 Continued played this game on and off since start. The game goes wrost bad to worst. This game has the same glitches and bugs since the early apha version of this game even tho now its full release for about a year now (of course it was rushed due to presure from competition) the game on top of the old bugs and glitches that never got fixed has new bugs and glitches due to updates that are horrible eg. the god mod bug. This game is early apha or beta AT BEST. The devs put a lot of crap work in skins and keys and boxes (even thoe they promissed to NOT HAVE those in the game before the game was released the game is circled around skins now similar to CS GO) the game is in absoluteley horrible state. COD 4 just came out never palyed cod tested beta first now i got it purchased and its flawless compared to this pile of steaming (and i never liked COD mind you and played battlefield and arma in comparison).UPDATE 2 10.07.2018 playing this game on and off since start. last few months i have bearly played a game where i was not killed by a hacker! Usually when there are no hackers we play in the top 10 with 1 out of 10 games we have chiken diner. Today we playd again and 2 out of 2 deaths we were killed by hackers with snap on hacks headshots from 500+ meters without clear light of sight. Finally uninstalled the game and not looking back.Original review do not buy unfinished products like me ... wait till the game is fully compleated and ready to be played. Game is filled with bugs (as it should be in alpha/beta state i mean it is expected) and even being in this early state it should not be recommended till full release because things like dayz standalone happen ... 5 years later we still waiting!wait and buy on full release after reviews!update 1 2 Oct 2017 6 20pm the game state is worst than when i wrote the review ... it gets worst with every single decision they do ... no optimization whatsoever! NONE! bad decision all the time they got the glory now they are fighting with other devs and instead of fixing the game breaking bugs!!! the game is in a terrible place right now do NOT buy the game!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

After getting to grips with it I soon realized it had a solid engine good optimization and heart pounding gameplay. It took me back to the days of wasteland and dayz mod for arma 2. If you're an arma fan pick this up you won't regret it. The reason this is a temp review though is that I have a game breaking crash when opening my inventory. It's apparently a known bug and in the pipeline to be fixed though it has been the cause of a few mini rage fits when in the final 10 players and sitting on great gear with 6/7 kills under my belt I loot a guy for the ghillie suit he's wearing and crash to desktop ( All in all it's early access so if you can withstand some annoying bugs go ahead and pick this one up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-27,0,0,11,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. You'll see negative reviews remarking about how its wandering around until you just get jumped and murdered weird U.I clunkyish controls loot boxes cheaters and all the other stuff. If you haven't just poke around you'll see them. However while all valid criticisms I think there's one big real major problem with this game.This game has no soul.There's no personality no charm no depth. Scratch the surface of this game at any point besides the skill curve and you'll hit the bottom right then and there. The game just exists and there's nothing that really makes this game unique or stand out in any way aside from its popularity and being in a fairly uncharted genre. Show me a screenshot of this game and I'd have trouble identifying it if the logo wasn't plastered on the shot.So hang on what WOULD be an example of something with everything PUBG is lacking that I mentioned? Borderlands. Those games... they're distinct. For example when you see something from Borderlands you KNOW it is Borderlands. That series has its own art style its own personality and flair when it comes to world story and gameplay... it stands out and its unforgettable whether you love it or hate it. Those games ooze with personality they simply make too good of contrast. And for more examples? Almost anything Nintendo Armello Warframe The Long Dark Aion City of Heroes World of Warcraft Wild Star Turok Fallout... and that's just off the top of my head without thinking too hard. I've not even played all of those but the souls of those games burn so strongly you can't help but recognize them.PUBG... it has no soul. It's a lifeless large scale free for all PvP generic shooter whose only claim to fame is being famous. And while it'll probably be spoken about for a long time by virtue of its explosion of popularity in time it'll most likely just serve as the stepping stone for something better something with soul to take charge and truly define the battle royale genre.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you kill a streamer who wasn't paying attention then they will accuse you of stream sniping them and that means you guessed it! A temporary to permanent ban.Region lock is not a thing. Right now hacking is a serious problem and the players hacking are more than often from China. That means they can hop into servers for other regions and ruin the experience for everyone else. This game is supposedly the 5th most played game on the pc platform and if that's the case then this hacking crisis is absolutely unacceptable.

2017-10-11,0,0,285,True,Recommended,The game is a lot of fun but in my opinion it is in dire need of some optimization as the framerate is extremely variable.Also I recommend playing PUBG with friends as it is loads more fun than playing it alone.The guns are pretty all right and the different attachements make some of the weapons really versatile as long as you are lucky enough to get the parts you need. Sometimes though you'll be running around with a red dot scope on your sniper rifle for an extensive period of time before you find something better but obviously this is bound to happen with randomized loot.The vehicles are in my opinion usable but not something I enjoy using. The vehicles can sometimes feel difficult to maneuver (especially when being shot at) but this might be because of the game engine. Regardless I think there is potential for improvement in this area. All in all the game is a good buy and you are bound to have a lot of fun. However sometimes the game can be really infuriating but this might break down to the loot being randomized or your skills being limited. Whenever an optimization patch comes out I'll praise the developers. For the time being though I would not recommend anyone to play the game if they have worse specs than a GTX 970 or R9 280X paired with a CPU with the least possible bottleneck /b as the framerate can be infuriating and especially in tense situations. Shootouts in 40fps is not very satisfying I'll tell you that much.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't think so maybe for Early Access but easily not a full release it's laughable.This game is so fun and has the potential for a really long lifespan but if I have to die to server instability for 1 in 5 deaths then f*** this. Put in a ping lock remove the server browser it defaults me to Asia half the time anyways and fix your s***!

2017-08-24,0,0,64,True,Recommended,Game is amazingly fun and I rarely have friends to play with.Have had literally no problems with optimization or poor fps despite all the complaints I've been reading in reviews here and my PC isn't amazing by any means. As for the microtransactions got some sweet looking items from 'em already and can sell extras for a nice profit($2.50 crate sell jacket drop for 7$). Literally don't buy them if you don't enjoy them its not breaking your game plenty of content and fixes are being pushed out regularly alongside the MTX items. One thing I would like to see is more map diversity which they are working on if the upcoming desert map is anything to go by.There was also some crap about stream sniping and people being banned for stupid reasons(Like honking car horns) but I haven't experienced anything like it myself. Pretty sad if thats the case but just have to be careful.All in all awesome game. Even better if you have friends to play duo or squad with sometimes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-08,0,0,77,True,Recommended,Essentially the game is a great game Its so good and I'd give it a 8/10Gameplay Gameplay is great the shooting mechanics are great the animations blend in well when running and I love it.Sound The sounds of gun fights turn it into fun fights (get it Fun Fights lmfao) I love the gun fight sounds as you can hear enemies from a while away but at the same time is realistic.Graphics Graphics are average (Then again I play on the lowest graphics.) Optimization is really bad atm so if you have a computer don't buy it until you get a better computerPlayerbase Player base is interesting actually Its very diverse with spastics and actual tryhards all and all everyone has the same objective so you don't have to care about being shot unfairly/toxically unless you're on a Squad or Duo which has never happened to me.Guns and Customization The game has a lot of guns that make it systematically good. You can also modify the guns which changes the dynamic of the game A LOT. I love games that allow for customization.Character Customization I love how it works You don't need microtransactions to get better clothes you NEED actually play the game that makes me happy because it rewards players who actually play the game Love it.Plot There is no plot just a plot of massive land P.Map Map is interesting I enjoy exploring the map biggest problem is that it caters to players who've been playing the game for a long time so they know better spots for loot.Car Driving It operates similar to H1Z1 King of the Kill in such a way possibly due to it sharing a SIMILAR developer playerunknown kun sama chanArt Art is alright very plain and boring but the gameplay makes it up.User Interface The User Interface is VERY PLAIN and boring and it a problem for me in such a way because it is not convient I don't want to learn tricks with the UI in the battlefield For example looting when healing etc.Realism Realism is not what you play this game for even though the art of the game has drab colors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-13,0,0,110,False,Recommended,Love the game! But it takes to long time in the lobby as well as in mid game to actually get in the game u know? It takes 20 min of looting to so get in a tiny bit of action that might just end in 2sec becouse u die. So basicilly what am trying to say is that it takes to long before things happen as in games like fortnite it takes max 30sec in lobby rare more then 15 sec. Then there is action almost all the time. thats why I play fortnite more then pubg. Becouse I get more out of the time playing fortnite. Have a lot of friends that agree with me as well. They also play fortnite more becouse of that exept one guy who went back to Leauge of Legends. And the game is insanely big and takes a lot of space My wifi and computer is fine so dont really care. But most poeple who play the game dont have 280mb per second download speed. So should try to make the updates as small as possible ) But exept from those small things the game is great! Love the whole concept of making it feel more real and stuff! So Realy like the game ) Really recommend it ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I don't know why this game has so many negitive reviews. Also if anyone ever tells you that Fornite is better than PUBG they probably wear a skirt I'll just throw that out there. It all started with H1Z1 and this was really big when it was released and took KOK's fan base. This game was the second biggest battle royale game released but then overtook H1Z1 and became number 1 on the charts. It's really fun and action packed. It also takes some amount of skill. Now even though i don't agree with some things the devs have done with this game It still doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good game. One of the biggest problems with this game more so in the past is the hackers. This games playerbase kind of died out and maybe that's why there's not as many hackers but it used to be very bad. Overall not a bad game.Pros Plenty of loot Fun with friends or by yourself Two large maps Character customization Intense gunfights Realistic Plenty of buildings You can vault many different waysCons Games was fully released too soon Hackers ruined this game FPS can be bad Could be more guns Toxic community Region lock?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You see somebody not too far maybe about 30 feet infront of you and he is facing away from you now is your chance to make your sponsor proud you fire at him thinking you are a badass and he will die and hate himself for ever showing his face in your part of town but alas the game devs decided that when you pickup a fully automatic rifle the default gun firing mode is set to single fire so you were unaware of that and he managed to turn around and kill you.Prone BlockedYou will then try to just follow other players on the map and try to weither beat them to death or beat them to a gun and use that to make them die but you will get beaten to death. three times.Prone BlockedYou then get top ten two games in a row by hiding in a bathtub with a shotgun so you figure this is the secret to this gameProne BlockedYou realise that wont work every gameProne BlockedYou spent one game on a rock because the only way off of it is down and its death but a very friendly random person will shoot you in the head even though you will either die from jumping or the blue wall of death and you were also unarmed Prone BlockedYou spend 2 minutes trying to jump over a fence that is knee highProne BlockedYou survive two red zones while being directly inside of it!Prone BlockedYou play game after game and finally decide to start a review you decide to make a bad review but change your mind halfway through because its okay and fun at times but its not fun ALL THE TIME most time is spent on foot because vehicles are either few and far between or too damn noisey there is no killcam which honestly i love i favour being able to kill someone without them knowing where i was so they cant just learn and get better its very punishing and enjoyable having a good spot that no one knows about so it doesnt become like a most well known spot. jumping is so bad id honestly prefer is it was disabled entirely its usless.if you dont get a good scope you should pretty much just grenade yourself the map is too big and is heavily dependant and scopes for survival alot of elevation and flanking positions for solo play at least it is a pain because you will always lose to that guy who got an early 8x scope and is chilling up on that mountain way over there.i honestly dont even know why melee is in the game even if you survive the hail of bullets that would greet you at such a close range even if he hears your footsteps he is gone running very ineffective. most grenades dont provide enough time mid combat to even be thrown you have to press your grenade key and then click to throw it im one of those guys that just likes to press G for grenade you know and then it throws a grenade because G is for grenade. if you are in a house and yo uare on the top floor your pretty much getting on if there is only windows up there because you somehow cant vault through a window (it even is possible to survive the majority of drops out of second and third story windows) so yo uare forced to confront the intruder head on or again hide in the bathtub like a champion and wait untill he leaves i have tried both options and i have both suceeded and failed both options.Prone Blockedthis is just a personal opinion but the white area should surround towns big enough to support the remaining players when it shrinks ive had a game where the white circle was surrounding a major town and a few farmhouses and when the play area shrunk instead of selecting the town to be the play area it chose about 2 farmhouses in close proximity for 40 players to go to and fight that is just ridiculous not unfair mind you but ridiculous how is that any fun for anybody heavy casualties zero cover just an obvious bloodbath.Prone BlockedThis game is still fun i am not by any means trashing it but there is a ton of room for improvement and more flaws than there is stability but with that being said i did enjoy myself and spent a good chunk of time during my first play session i am sure that i have alot of room for improvement aswell but the game still does need some better qualities but if you like battle royal games i reccomend it because honestly there isnt much else out there that isnt quite as populated as this gameProne blocked 4/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,195,False,Recommended,It's a great game and IMO the best battle royal game out there I've experienced this game since early access and I have to say that it has came a long way since. The full game release has killed many bugs and introduced some (no doubt) but it has also introduced a better UI more content such as items maps and vehicles and a whole new desert map. the developers have definitely been pulling their weight around this game and I expect a whole lot more bug fixes and content they already have a snow map underway so i'm quite impressed compared to the devs that worked on H1Z1. Gameplay wise it is a little bit of a hard game in the sense that getting used to it takes some time but eventually you learn more by just playing and experiencing the game so play it a bit before you judge the game as a whole. I mostly play duos or squads with my friends and I must say towards the end of the game when there is about 10 people left is where it becomes really thrilling either that or you get your legs cut off and left there to die because that er had the high ground. To excel at this game you need good situational aweness or else you're just going to get mad that you died randomly. Playing alone is more of a challenge although it can be easier in other ways.

2018-06-21,0,0,797,False,Not Recommended,"I got in on this one pretty early before it's ""release"". So I've had quite the ride with it's up's and down's over the period. It's certainly more polished and works better than when I first bought it for myself and my friends over a year ago. However the quality of the matches have declined steadily since then. Cheaters have been somewhat curbed now and are no longer as infuriating common as they were a few months back. However due either to the declining player base it seems like you're almost always going up against people with insanely fast reflexes pinpoint aim and eyes stolen from an eagle. It's getting very uncommon to get into good fights in duo and squad where it's not completely on sided. This drastically hinders enjoyment as 8 9 out of 10 drops ends up being a roflstomp. It may just be my age or my play style hindering me here but it's an issue to everyone I know who plays this game.The direction of the game has changed a bit as it blew up in popularity and its frankly gotten extreme scummy. We've gone from crates that were 100% earnable and openable by gameplay to an overwhelming amount of paid key crates. Something we were assured would only be for a special event became the increasing norm. The item drop rates for crates has sadly remained every bit as sad as they were when I started however. Expect the same 2 3 items over and over with exceedingly low drop rates for anything else. Not as bad an issue if crates are free to open but now with the ever increasing rate of key crates being introduced it's ludicriously stupid to blow cash to get a crappy hat 3 4 times in a row. Also major issues like bugs physics and other serious issues take a back seat to whatever new paid crate they're getting ready to push. Gamebreaking issues have been left live for months before while paid items were released left and right.It's hard to talk about the company's recent scummy cash grab turn without pointing out that they are as of this review suing Fortnite for copyright infringement. And while this is going on they've stolen several gameplay mechanics from Fortnite wholesale. This includes a new level system on test server that was 100% lifted from Fortnite right down to the paid season pass. The company has seemed to either run out of ingenuity or integrity possibly both. I cannot recommend this game on any platform besides mobile for this reason. As mobile seems is run by a different company it's far more advanced and plays better than the PC version. Sounds like it's also less of a cashgrab setup oddly enough.TL DR Buy this game only when it dips under $15. Expect games most of the time due to matchmaking and bugs. Also expect the game to probably die due to lack of players soon. Just play Fortnite or PUBG mobile for a better experience.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You will have fun in this game until one of the thousands of hackers does the same to you after you spend 20 minutes looting and carefully planning your victory. I can't recommend this title until something is done about the absurd number of hackers you will see (or rather not see at all) in this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,35,False,Recommended,A game you won't regret buying! I was orignally planning to buy PUBG much earlier then I had however my hopes for the game were very low mainly after watching videos of very early access gameplay which showed very little promise due to the vast amount of bugs packed in with the game and terrible ping and latency issues. This game almost reminded me of Rainbow Six Siege being as though that game is still packed with bugs and ping issues even though we are moving on to year 3! Another reason why I was persuaded not to purchase this game was because I never really thought Battle Royal games would be my type of thing. Eventually I purchased this game after the Steam Winter Sale and some of my friends almost forcing me to. As soon as I played my first game (although I was terrible and died at the start) I loved the game to bits! You wouldn't expect a team based game like PUBG would be fun solo however due to the amount of things I could do compared to knock off games such as Fortnite kept me occupied for as long as I was alive for. Squad play blew me away even more as the situations you get into are incredibly fun and the amount of team work required for this game is amazing as well as the satisfaction of getting a good team position or even 1st. I would definitely make sure to have friends to play with to get the full experience from it. The best part about it is that most of the buggy mess from early access seems to be gone and due to smart choice from the developers to implement BattlEye I almost never encounter a cheater. This seems to be more of an issue in the Asian servers according to others however I am solely basing this on the EU servers.Would most definitely purchase this game even if you have no intrest with games of such and I can assure you will enjoy it however I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game if you aren't living near either the EU or the US servers as there seems to be a big cheating issue at this current point of time in Oceania and Asia.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time you could be banned for one semi famous streamer s accusation. The rampant lag spikes of chinese players creates time travel like abilities allowing them to enter building without being seen shooting you when they are on the ground and the language barrier makes them useless in team combat and that's if they don't team kill you first. Game breaking glitches that will make you either die or wish that you did.

Power ups are also offered to help players through difficult levels but these must be purchased and typically cost a lot more than a dollar.

2017-09-04,0,0,854,True,Recommended,I will start with this it only takes one round to understand why this game is so special.PUBG is one of the most elegantly designed shooters ever created. Here s how it works up to a hundred unarmed players parachute down into a vast map. They find weapons armor and vehicles. As time passes the safe play area shrinks forcing players into the same region of the map. The last person alive wins.That s pretty much it. And yes you may have noticed that it is pretty much the movie Battle Royale in video game form. In fact PUBG's namesake creator Brendan PlayerUnknown Greene cut his teeth developing similar mods for games like ARMA 2 and 3. PUBG however is built entirely around this structure and it s this purity and focus that makes it so accessible. The game s balance is a lot less forgiving than Halo or Call of Duty but it s not quite as harshly realistic as ARMA.What this means is that basically anyone can jump in and have a meaningful experience. Everyone starts in the same vulnerable situation and every kill is significant. Winning or being the last person standing is immensely difficult but since the scoring system is so simple it s always tempting to try to improve your ranking next time. And PUBG isn t shy about including elements of luck even the most skilled player might find themselves landing in an area oddly bereft of weaponry beyond a frying pan and getting rifled in the back.Every time I'm in the final ten players have been among the most intense gaming experiences of my life. Everything you do becomes a small but profound decision. Do you wait inside that room and stay safe for now but risk having to blow your own cover when the play area gets smaller? Do you attack that other player now or hope she doesn t notice you and wanders into a more compromised position down the line? Do you draw attention to yourself by using a loud vehicle to cover more ground or can you make it to the safe zone in time while keeping quiet?PUBG has none of the trappings of online shooters that I ve found so off putting for the past decade. There s no way to reliably game the map no requirement to put up with usually offensive voice chat no oppressive metagame that requires you to spend every waking hour playing if you have any hope of catching up. Each game rarely lasts more than half an hour and even that s only if you re playing very well. Anyone with a basic grasp of shooters can have fun with PUBG.That said the game is clearly unfinished. You may find yourself cursing the netcode when you die due to lag. The visuals are distinctly unpretty even if you re not one of the many players that turns down everything except draw distance for competitive reasons. Jumping over knee high obstacles is weirdly difficult. And you need a beefy Windows PC right now despite the unimpressive results.Overall I highly recommend you purchase the game if you like the sound of it from my review and if you think you will be able to run it on your pc system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-19,0,0,396,False,Not Recommended,There are many things i could say about pubg and first of all i think the most important thing is to see if the game is actually evolving in regards to network issues bugs framerate issues etc. I am currently running this on a i5 6400 and a gtx 1060 so keep that in mind that my criticism is adjusted to my own PC.First of all when i bought the game around 8 months back it was a lot of fun the game itself feels refreshing and it's not like most shooters so that's what made it fun for me and made me able to see past it weak points but after playing around 50 hours the issues that are present just kill the experience. When you put 20 minutes in a map only to die because you're stuck your motorcycle just randomly decided to flip you died in a firefight because of desync the zoneplacement is really off (like being on the other side of a mountain or on the other side of the water with no bridge within the zone) or any of the other bugs then it can really sour the experience. Youre in the plane? Great the moment you try to jump the plane decides to drop you facing the other way which results you into being disoriented what just happened and losing an edge in time. When you finally are in sight of your target your parachute decides to start heavily pulling left making you spiral away from your target. You landed you're lucky normally you would've been dead already because your landing sucked. Let's go loot some houses! First house you find 2 extended mags for handguns because we all need those extended mags for handguns and a crowbar. In the house besides you you hear shots from an ak being fired at another person outside. You run outside away from the noise so you can perhaps find a place without people in the hope you can find a gun. Second house you find a random amount of 556 bullets without a gun and a gas tank you leave sprint towards the third house and you manage to find a handgun. You're being pushed by the person with the ak and you take your chances your game lags before you manage to fire and you're dead. The reality is this game suffers from the same bugs that it had during its alpha fase and during its beta fase. I tried thinking about some improvements that they made and they made some like for example when you reload a clip and do something else it doesnt cancel the whole reloading. But mostly the same bugs are still present in the game. Random cars flipping network issues (and they happen so frequently it feels like WoW vanilla patchday all over again) parachute issues where you get stuck your parachute becomes uncontrollable or gets slowed down framerate issues assets loading in issues issues with crashing issues with drivers. And then i still havent mentioned ANYTHING about hackers and cheaters because of the way this game is set up it's not likely you would be banned for cheating due to the immensely flawed system that they use. They made hundreds of millions of dollars and what did the consumers get in return? Locked boxes that need money to open them (bluehole said they needed the money to fix the game) and new maps which for a long time even continued to dilute the experience. The way zones work and the way they interact with a big map like miramar kills the whole battle royale experience. If you had a game that rarely was subjected to bugs then a big map would've been less of an issue but because of the very long games playing on the miramar map becomes a drag and hard to enjoy.I'n the less than 300 hours i've played i encountered lots of bugs and almost 90% break the game or make you gain a disadvantage. Getting stuck not being able to loot servers lagging everything works seamlessly together to kill the whole fun behind pubg.Did the game improve these past few months? Not really they added some new features gave the UI an update and now we're getting a jungle map but is that really fixing the issues that've been haunting this game for some time now? Nope. Is it worth 20 euro? I think so especially with friends its enjoyable but for the love of god dont try to play it too seriously because the mechanics and the issues will smother your fun with a layer of rage. I will be happy to see when this game burns down since the developers made no intent in showing that they want to improve the game. Locking skins behind money isnt content or bugfixing. Not being able to enter the game being stuck in lobby being thrown out games the servers not working not being able to draw your weapon because youre for some weird reason to close to an object not being able to prone on flat surfaces and many more annoyances that i forgot to mention. Dont buy this game if youre gonna try to play it seriously. In all honesty even though it's a fun game it's usually more frustrating and non rewarding than fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-27,0,0,368,False,Recommended,Well let's start from the beginning.When I bought this game I was extremely excited to try it out after watching so many funny clips on youtube. Sadly I was disappointed by the performance issues that the game had at that time and it was not something you could easily get over because of moments when you would make it to top 10 and then just die because of a freeze or some drastic frame drops. BUT this was all before the official release and all the other updates that followed updates that significantly improved the performance of the game as well as the server lag. I'm glad to see the developers really showing interest in making the game a better experience for everyone and taking their time to fix bugs and get rid of cheaters. Since these big updates I've had so much fun with the game in every aspect. Both TPP and FPP are enjoyable wether you're playing solo duo with a friend/random or squad. The game really manages to create tension every fight being unique in it's own way. Fighting scenarios vary a lot due to a large weapon and attachments selection as well as different types of terrain that play an important part in the way you come up with tactics to stay alive so you could get that chicken dinner. However quite a few things can still be improved. One of them being vehicles. Man I really hate when your vehicle can pretty much go over any hill and through bumpy areas but somehow manages to get stuck in a little piece of terrain. Overall I'd say this is a very fun game that offers a unique experience. In my opinion this is the best battle royale game up to date and I say it has a bright future ahead of it.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,455,True,Recommended,PUBG is an online survival based game in which the objective is to survive against other human players scavenging around the entire map for weapons attachments boosters vehicles and and medical supplies. All of this and the ever closing threat of a dangerous fog surrounding the map which in turn every so often stops for a certain time then changes the point of intrest for you to get to. My thoughts on the game are a follows PROS 1. Friends fun The game is in my opinion much more entertaining when accompanied with friends whether with 1 or 4 other people. (1player Solo 2 People duos and 3 5 players Fives)2. Tension When you play this game whether in solo duos or fives it gets really tense as you see the number of people remaining go down on your screen. Also as you look around for your vital survival equipment you know that just next door could be another player.3. How getting kills can be satisfying How does this game do it? when you are roaming the map or checking out villages coming across players 99% of the time result in gun fights then proceed to kill someone you get a feeling of accomplishment and that you have earned whatever place you finish. (Many other shooters lack this feeling)4. Game feels realistic and has a very rewarding feel to it!CONS 1.The one thing i was hoping this game was gonna do different was add more than 1 map. I know maps are very time consuming but playing on the same map 1 000 000 times eventually gets boring.2. Being in Alpha obviously means there is going to be a lot of Bugs and Glitches some games you will lag out/lose connection game crashes and lots of annoying bugs like that.my conclusion is that this game is a great battle royale game and is one of the only BR games that has done it right! Possibly my most upcoming game of the year! ) RATING Action/Gunfights 10/10Fun 10/10Servers 8/10FPS 8/10loot 10/10playing with friends 10/10Overall i would rate this game a 9/10 just untill they fix the bugs and lag at that point i would probably go far enough to rate this a 10/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,622,True,Recommended,I played this game during the Beta and really enjoyed it I have also played quite a bit of King of the Kill and find this game to be similar in play style but different in actual experience this game feels a bit more realistic all items are found and nothing is crafted (currentley) it is extremely satisfying when you sucsesfully kill another player and firing the gun is very rewarding. The player experience feels more gritty and raw and its very fun and addicting. Weapon damage seems as though it more realistic than other battlegrounds because one or 2 shots well placed and you are dead also bullet trajectory and ballistics feel more closely to actual ballistics.If you are a fan of Battleground/ survivial PVP genre games I would DEFINITELY pick this one up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sometimes you can here people as if they were right next to you (while in reality being 3 stories above you in a different house while other times not hear anyone at all while they could remove earwax with the silencer attached to their gun.Lag is inevitable and feelings of losing games to ingame flaws rather than poor shooting skills are more than likely to be felt multiple times.When you do win a game you feel great.

It's sad considering the fact that opimization has seemed to take a back seat to a myriad of other issues the devs seem to think are more important. Such as Banning players under false pretenses of stream snipping Porting to console even though there's a plethora of issues that need to be addressed with the PC version Microtransactions to sponser a tournament that was for all intents and purposes a PR flop btw it was said by the devs that the only paid product that would be introduced to the game before the actual release was the game itself Lack of fine tunning new weapons before they're added to the game Simple quality of life fixes (server prefence perspective prefrence settings that you can only access in the .ini etc)However the gameplay is interesting though it leaves you wanting. The map is too big for this kind of game leaving you wandering across empty fields and forest never seeing another player until the last 30 or so people. Shotguns tend to feel random sometimes one shotting a player then failing to do half their health in the same circumstancethough be warned as this is my experience with them. Buildings loading in as blobs and staying that way for the first 2 3 minutes of the game with the only known fix being to by an SSD. A personal issue that has casued me many deaths that could have been avoided is FPS drop when firing in CQC.The game is enjoyable it just has a very long way to go before release. That and the devs need to get their act together and focus on what's important to the health of the game rather than belly aching streamers and their pockets. I regret having ever spent my money on this game as well as every hour i've put into it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was fun in the start getting kills and such with friends playing squad just to die from a glitch that would shoot the car miles up. But now...I feel nothing for PUBG. Nothing that could win me over and say ""Let's play some PUBG"". There were game breaking bugs such as small rocks could flip your car and explode or go under the map by riding a bike. And don't get me wrong those bugs still exist. And in the end I didn't really care about the bugs. I don't see anything fun in PUBG anymore. The only thing I cared about was kills and in a decent round I can get 8 without even winning nor did I care about winning.In conclusion PUBG was nice about now it doesn't seem it is as enjoyable as it was before.

2017-05-25,0,0,880,True,Recommended,Okay well I've played this game for almost 250 hoursI think and I still find it very fun and Im not here to blow out steam Im here to show legit problems if people were wondering. In this review the cons are the most important and almost every big bug is listed. Thankfully the game company has been awesome and fixing most issues people had before this review so I hope they keep up the good work and soon have the fun as crap game they've made without these big bugs/issues.PROS Fun game All you could want from a battle royal game VARIOUS SCOPES FOR ALL RANGES Great game to play with friends Game company is great on adding new content and giving big patches for fixing lots of problems.CONS Game crashes (used to be a lot but now doesn't happen often) Beggining game lag (cant walk in/out of buildings loot fight well for first 30seconds 1 minute after landing) GETTING SHOT AFTER TAKING COVER (I've had people shoot 3 4 bullets into me after taking cover a good second earlier and solo games it seems to be even worse). Vehicles flip on the slightest bumps and even invisible breaks between terrain. The game company after each patch will have some new stupid error left in the game (Now blue circle just keeps closing a lot farther in than it should but does no damage to player) Floating buildings have spawned in on open fields water and other places they're not supposed to be. (Only few people per match see these buildings though which give others advantages ESPECIALLY IF ITS IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST 3 ZONES!)**** Very very rarely there is this audio bug and the game makes an ear peircing static noise that comes through at probably about 3x the volume you have your volume set at. (HURTS EARS)**** Rarely and randomly entire games will lag to where game freezes for a few seconds during fight and bullets will sound choppy and players will put in a lot more shots into you than you hear or feel until your downed. (Worst part is its hard to tell if a game is laggy until getting into a fight)I hope this either helped someone decide whether to get this game or not but even with all these bugs I would still reccomend this game its THAT good. Or if you already have this game and is seeing if someone else feels your pain with these bugs... I do...but we can make it through haha.EXTRA TIP You can crouch jump in this game by pushing spacebar+C at same time pretty much but push spacebar the tiniest moment you can before hitting C... or just spam it and find what works for you (,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-06,0,0,548,False,Not Recommended,Do not purchase this game until Bluehole has region locked it.If you are from OCE regions I highly recommend avoiding it entirely.After huge promises from Early access mutliple broken promises and back tracking over server progression microtransactions anti cheat strategies reporting methods time frame based promises it's very obvious to see that Bluehole cannot handle how big this game got and how quickly it got big.The OCE servers are infested with hackers and taking a week off then coming back to play 1 game and get killed by a cheater is disgusting.The server tick rates are appauling and well below the standard of almost all other FPS shooters on the market. The game is broken and being pushed with an engine that the developers aren't adapting to.I've sunk a LOT of hours into PUBG and play it with friends on my discord and it's definitely disappointing to see this game go from Early Access (Closed) to Early Access Open to 1.0 Release and drop the ball so heavily.PROS The game can be a lot of fun with friends The gun play isn't half bad when the servers are behaving There's enough playability for various play styles and can encourage people to try something new There are regular patches and updates The devs are somewhat transparent with what they have planned.CONS Huge amount of broken promises Exceptionally poorly optimized causing huge loads and overheating of CPU Cheaters galore with a flawed reporting system No region locks Jittery gameplay for the first 5 10minutes of gameplay where the servers cannot handle the load. Buggy broken physics engine often sends stuff bouncing around in ways they shouldn't. Cars hit literally nothing and get collision damage and explode without warning.Ultimately The game is fun but the frustration of a DEV team that REFUSE to address the hacking issue is turning me away from the game and it should turn you away too.I'd love to recommend PUBG but in the state that it's in with hackers so predominant and a dev team who cannot hold true to promises and address issues plaguing the server loads and tick rates I'd highly suggest staying away.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-03-28,0,0,161,True,Recommended,"I have most recently become interested in these ""Lasst man Standing"" type of games. I dealt with the unpolished never updated H1Z1 and was becoming less interested in these ""hunger games"" type shooters. however 20 hours in Battlegrounds this game has definitely tickled my fancy. The ""jump whenever you are ready to spawn"" feature is only 1 of several perks to this game that definitely sold me when i first started playing. Spectating your teammate when you die so they can critic his shots and movement was another positive upgrade from previous team based shooters i have played. And last but certainly not least are the weapons and attachments. The ""snap"" to FPS as you have an ACOG attached and the pin point accuracy of the bullets leaving my rifle seem excellent considering this game is in a Beta.

2017-06-06,0,0,91,True,Recommended,With a mid range GPU and a upper mid range CPU this game runs surprisingly well for an early access game despite what I was told I went in expecting a low amount of frames and having to lower graphic settings to be suprised I averaged 50 75 FPS with some great graphics on it's highest settings. After playing the Battle Royale mod in Arma 3 I feel absolutely comfortable in saying that this game runs and works on many levels better than the mods ever did not to downplay thier success. The gameplay is fast and exciting but can vary to quiet and eerie and allows you for the most part to take your own pace while still pushing players closer together every few minutes. From long and mid range battles on hillsides apartment shootouts and close range combat while clearing rooms the game offers combat that can suit different play types allowing you to bring your own style into the game.With the community guides and tutorials even the least experienced players can enjoy and have a good shot at winning their share of matches. The game is well rounded enough that within the first day after trying both Squad play and Duo play I was able to win a solo match. This game is fun with friends and even alone on solo play which I can't say for many games like it. It is an all around thrilling experience and I absolutely recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-28,0,0,903,False,Not Recommended,I started playing PUBG last summer during the 'Early Access' Phase but I decided to wait for the release of the game until I would write a review.After the 1.0 release I wondered if this game really deserved the version number 1.0 because PUBG was far from being a complete game worth the 30 (price in EUROPE). I wanted to be fair and gave the Devs more time to listen to the community and work in some improvements.NOW six months after 1.0 the situation got worse the game still looks like Arma 2 considering it's UE4 game. Especially the LoD is really annoying and the AA doesn't work correctly. Despite that PUBG is still poorly optimized and the netcode is 20th century crab. Although the game led the steam charts for a long time and made tons of money through crates and market PUBG Corp. was unable to use their financial resources to set up a capable server architecture. Instead they're implementing more and more crates skins and othe bullsh**. But the real straw to break the camel's back was last patch when they introduced the EVENT PASS! WTF 30 are already too much for a game like this and now the're adding even more useless crab combined with useless missions to pay for!?This had been an eye opener for me PUBG Corp. doesn't want to improve the gameplayand create a good game together with the community they just want to fleece as much money out of this game as possible for their Tencent owners.bye PUBG,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-26,0,0,454,True,Recommended,This game is best played with friends in duo/squad mode. Solo mode is fun enough but nothing compares to roaming the 8x8km map with your buddies. YOU MAY NOT ENJOY THIS GAME IF You dislike slow paced games where you can die in an instant without ever seeing your attacker. However planning your movement to avoid these situations is part of the fun and eventually you will be the one sniping at long range from behind cover. You dislike lots of randomness. The loot distribution is fairly random with some areas having higher concentrations of good gear than others (these areas tend to attract more players though). The path of the plane is random. The restriction of the play area is random. However learning to manage this randomness is part of the fun and the different conditions each round lead to diverse strategic options. You like winning reasonable frequently (50% of the time or more). Each game starts with 100 players and only 1 player can win. This game has a lot in common with roguelikes where you lose frequently but get further and further as you improve.The game also has some serious technical deficienies and much needed features Performance is bad even on a high end rig. I recommend turning all settings to VERY LOW. Performance optimizations should arrive in the next 5 weeks. There is no practice range which means that it is difficult to learn the guns.These flaws are acceptable to me because this game is extremely fun and reasonably balanced for an early access title. It has the potential to be the leader in this genre if the developers can deliver on their early access promises.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And with 200+ hours and 60+ hours on the test server it seems to have gotten worse after the 1.0 update for hackers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-02,0,0,107,False,Not Recommended,This game is a neat thing all of the best pieces of the PVP from something like DayZ or H1Z1 without the tedious crafting or respawning.I've put over 100 hours into it both in EA and 1.0 release and as it stands I can't reccomend it until Bluehole addresses the absolutely overwhelming issue with hackers (that has seemingly increased with the official release.) Of the 10 games I played even this morning at the time of review atleast 9/10 of those I was very obviously gunned down at over 500m by someone using an aimbot. Maybe once the publisher manages to institute an autoban system it will clear up but for now steer very clear and take that valuable free time to a gamer where the publishers value your time and money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I do not suggest this game in it's current state until bluehole puts some actual effort and takes care of the community that built this game. The reviews matter Bluehole. You may have a high playcount but these reviews share similar feelings to those on Media streamers alike. This is a game that I'd love to play more of once issues are resolved.

2018-06-10,0,0,174,False,Not Recommended,"If the game was optimised &amp had better perfomance if the game had fewer bugs or if the game at least was better looking maybe I could recommend it. But it does not succeed in any of these areas. The gunplay often feels clunky frequently performing inconsistently similarily too its FPS throughout any particular match. The developers outright refuse to restrict player regions to those with at least a common language ruining any strategy or plan players can devise with their teamates. Further this worsens the problems with connection leaving you in limbo mid game waiting for PUBG to reconnect you to those on the other side of the world. The graphics look as if you're playing a game from 2008 and the bugs and hacking issue just exacerbate the problems leaving you feeling cheated out of a fight or ""chicken dinner"".However the game does provide an experience although one that is laughable in its current state that is somewhat fresh and realistic in design. If you can bypass the above mentioned issues you may be able to enjoy the game ignoring areas it failed in now and focusing on what it was intended to be. But $30 USD is too much to ask for a game that is just 'mediocre' and far from the claimed ""World's premiere battle royale experience"". It's an experience infested with problems that never seem to be fixed but rather hidden with a new update or map. The game should not have been given a full release in its current state but niether should a broken game like this be $30 USD even in Early Access. The addition of crates adds some progress into the game offering a small reason but a reason nonetheless to keep playing. However unless you want to spending $2.50 on a key per crate for new boots or a different coloured shirt which is almost a 10th of the amount you paid for the game initially the crates become a constant reminder of the wasted time you've spent playing this broken mess.With 170+ hours played I've given it more than enough time to see improvement. I've watched it go from early access to a full release and can safetly say that the game has seen minimal imrpovement often seeing changes that actually make the game worse such as the crate system. Those updates that do seek to change for the better do so so insignificantly or with such little focus on the real issues that they may as well not have even bothered initially.This game does not deserve you're money.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,69,True,Recommended,Well. To start off this game is fun. Yes it has lag. Yes the minimum system requirements get you a solid 10FPS (KILL IT). So if you want a halfway decent framerate you need these GTX 10 series GPU (preferably 1050 ti or above. You can have an equivalent AMD GPU. I highly recommend more than 2gb of VRAM)AMD Athlon x4 2.8Ghz (or equivalent.)8Gb ddr3 RAMEither a SSD Hybrid or fast as HDDThese specs can get you 30FPS to 144FPS (Mostly depends on amount of RAM and what GPU you have.) I hope this is helpful sorry for those with bad frame rate. (I know how it feels to have 24fps) Best of luck to all have a great day. PS This game is fun. The FPS doesn't really matter if you aren't competitive and have a friend on.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To the point that they're openly advertising on the forums and not even trying to hide it ingame. Same with the ingame leaderboards being used to advertise such things.A huge percent of these hackers come from a certain country which was stated by the developers at BH and so the community said we want pinglock/region lock to fix this problem.BH response is that anyone who agrees with this is racist and xenophobic.So if you are expecting the developers to do anything about this huge problem then please think again.I enjoyed this game at one point however me and my friends no longer bother with it and i highly recommend you stay away from this game with the way it is right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They are still present just not as often.Hackers still bad as ever check back here periodically for video proof!Mantling and vehicle mechanics updated with launch day patch huge improvment but again the game is ruined with hackers and cheaters. I still do not recommend you supporting Blue Hole whatsoever until they address this dire issue! Nothing worse than spending 20 minutes in a game to get wrecked by a aimbotter who's armor never takes damage. The problem here is cheaters effect 99 other players not just a lobby of 10 or 16 like other games! Banning half a million players is NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT! That speaks volumes that your ""anti cheat"" system does not work! Blue Hole is dragging their tail when it comes to countermeasures for hacks.

And if you don't have a lot of friends who play PUBG there are a lot of community discords which you can google and find fun people to play with.If you're looking for an esport to get good at I'd not get too existed. The game has no other objective (currently) other than to survive which leads to the best tactics being camping which again leads to very boring gameplay from a viewers perspective unless the player is someone you follow. And this isin't even taking into account the logistical problem of getting 100 people together for a turnament but maybe they could reduce the map size lower this number.TLDR Fun game to play both alone and with friends with a few technical issues.

But it's ing broken your servers suck you can't optimize for and you ain't even trying to fix it! You're just pumping out useless content and pushing for the xbox release I know this is 'early access' but that's just a get out of jail free card these days and I'm sick of it.

This game has bad optimisation but to give them slack it is only in early access what do you expect. Besides all of that the game has alot of stuff to do and can have tons of hours spent into learning new skills positions strats and heaps more. Ive spent roughly 300 hours playing and im learning lots of new thing everytime i play. Another great thing about this game is the test servers.

2017-06-27,0,0,263,True,Recommended,PUBG is a very fun game to play on your own or with a group of people although it is terribly optimised at the moment. Overall the game is amazing and I do intend on spending more hours playing it but recently I have been obsessed with the test servers the new features that are coming are incredible.First of all the devs are bringing vaulting to the game which changed the way the game is played completely with vaulting you can climb through the windows climb over walls which are impossible to just jump over and it can be used when trying to escape enemies. For instance when I heard an enemy above me in a building he was able to jump through one of the windows that was already broken and then sneak up behind me before the vaulting was out this was pretty much impossible without someone hearing you.Secondly the game has been optimised with the 1.0 update but it still isn't the easiest to run. I currnetly have a GTX 750ti an i5 6500 and 8gb of RAM and I am able to run it at about medium settings but it still crashes and has it moment I think this is down to the amount of RAM I have personally. But if you own a 10 series graphics card or the equivelent for AMD the same or better CPU and 16gb of RAM you should be able to run this game fine in the 1.0 update.And third the devs have brought a new map with this update Miramar which has a completely different play style to the original map Erangel. Miramar is a massive map almost double the size of Erangel and if you drop somewhere like Los Leones you meet very little enemies but the loot is incredible. This map is more slow going than the other one with much more sniper play so make sure you have a long range weapon on hand. I would like to see some more weather variations come to this map like a desert storm which restrics view and elimiantes most long range battles.I believe 1.0 is releasing around 15 hours after I have wrote this review so I can't wait for that.I honestly don't have many complaints and any I did have have been eliminated by the 1.0 update for example optimisation. Before 1.0 I struggled to get textures until about 5 minutes of waiting and by that time I was probably already dead.I would recommened this game to anyone whos looking for a thrilling new game and I can't honestly compare it to the main contender Fortnite but just from looking I believe PlayerUnkown is a much better game and is worth every penny.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fact that the game has an e sports league is absolutely amazing to me because the utter lack of consistency is mind boggling.

2018-07-02,0,0,357,False,Not Recommended,"A typical love to hate game. I really loved it in the first hours but the trust I put into the developers just turned into disappointment. Once more. Other reviews are probably more accurate and more well founded than mine. Usally i'd never write a review cuz i m just too lazy but because that this game was one of my favorites I need to let some frustration out and try to only give you my opinion. NO analysis or techtalk. Just another ""recent review"" on steam.Long story short Pro + the game itselfCon developers/publishers what so ever just trying to press as much money as possible out of our poor souls cuz ppl still would sell their first born for stupid online character clothing. GG!+Gameplay(idea) is awesome. When I started to play I was getting addicted. It was filling a big gap in my game library which no other game could fit in. And still it remains as an unique phenomenon to me. Even big laggs or some bugs couldnt stop me from playing. Neither did it take away the fun for just a second. It was a pioneer game so what? Everyone had the same problems and so it seemed fair. Just give the developers some time to create a masterpiece. All this will be fixed. From all the early access games that dissapointed this will be the one. So it would seem. It was all the time clear that a big game a massive project would take a looong time to be perfect (e.g. starcitizen). To me it was already besides some teething. BUT after 1 year of patience its enough. For more then one year i m reading every single patch note with growing lack of appreciation. The so called ""full release"" was the first big lie. It promised to fix all the bugs all the horrific netcoding and even double the content with a new map. Yet i can say that every randomly generated map from minecraft looks better than what they try to sell you as a big improvement. Miramar rocks are just huge squares standing in the desert that are barely painted because the map had to be released in 2017 to fullfill the promise of a fullrelease before 2018. Time to give some optical improvements to those poorly designed and low detailed structures remains unused. We re in the middle of 2018 and they just released another new map. The rocks are less in numbers and only a minimum of details has been added. Still stairs and houses appear to grow out of a pile of sand instead of having at least some sort of realistic foundation. Its not that i m to much picky when its about graphics its just that everyone is having a little bit different point of view or a different realisitaion point but its going all to one point &gt It just shows that there s no one giving a **** what they are producing. And they re showing it far to obvious. Instead of taking a little bit more care of repeatedly reported problems like the networkcoding or even smaller problems like server stability anticheating not loading textures roughly working lobby ... ... ... ... which all are game essentials (more or less). To be fair it took cs a long time to fix delayed hitboxes but its just one of many points that is untouched for far too long. Especally if theres a forced full release which is claimed to be ""esl ready"". The opinion wishes and the expectations of the community stays ignored far too often. What happend so far 1. Maximised the number of payed chests. 2. Adding an exclusive parachute skin for ""just"" 5$. (is that a DLC or what? No. its just a badly painted parachute for the first 10 seconds.)3. 10$ mission pass to have access to some kind of rewards and half of them are just temporarely unlocked. WTF? Are you serious? So you re making ppl buy your game and then they should pay like one third of the original game price to have access to a 2 3 weeks mission series with ""fake"" rewards? The only thing worth to get is the rename reward so i can rename myself to ""imnotafcknretard"". Oh wait you could do the same by just playing the game for some hours. So WHY? The sad thing is i even know many ppl buying this ridicioulus offer and i hope that on one day they will realise what theyve done to themselves. 4. There was an article I dont remember exactly how it was written because its been a while but ill try to reproduce the meaning. 50% of our income are from China so thats what we re taking care of most. Surely China has the most players so thats where the money is coming from but how it was written was more like an screw the rest of the world chinese are willing to spend more so we dont care about the english speaking peasants. In general all of the articles they publish seem more than just cocky to me. I cant help it maybe i m just too prejudgy too but i have my reasons.The only thing that forces them to at least sometimes take care of the needs of the community is growing competitors. Which they tried to keep small unsuccesfully. The pressure is growing and with small events they re trying to keep the players at it and testing new features like dynamic weather and many other nice ideas. They started to be creative again but till something fundamental is happening i wont bite anything.In the end I can say that compared to the game one year ago many things happend that helped the game alot. Many improvements that made the game more stabile and playable. But all these things were only the side dish served to some bitter tasting payable weapon skins and introduction of sham rewards/dlc's. Im not done with the game but with the corpooration. Even Hello games deserves more respect and trust.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-09,0,0,324,True,Recommended,Lets be honest here most of us who had H1Z1 spoiled the game genre of battle royale. But when you come across this game and try it out the combat is phenomenal every second of it which is about maybe 40 70% of the game depending on how you play or your play style fits into the game. It is so fun for a majority for people because you can play how you would like camping buildings rushing high populated areas etc. You can play it how you want to and its special in that way. The devs are doing a really good job keeping the community close and working hard to make it come out for release. A game that is actually good in early access and when it came out? I never heard of such games but this could be the one and im 100% going to be with it untill it releases. I recommend it to anyone who is interested you will not regret.. Also you may want to find some friends to play with because depending you may not like solo's. One downside thought is that is crashes almost every 5 matches or so but keep in mind dev's are trying their best to fix all the bugs.

This game is SAD. So much wasted potential I'm honestly used to it since h1z1 and dayZ were let downs I still have faith however PLAYERUNKNOWN needs to get his head out of his *** and ping/region/ lock the game he says it's ""xenophobic"" however the game is supposed to be competitive (sure its an RNG fest) but battling to get number 1 spot and be the last man/team surviving is competitive and people want to try their best to win and with chinese hackers/laggers with advantages RUINS the game. On top of that searching for random teammates is ABYSMAL since chances are none of your teammates speak english and the chinese are all playing from pc bangs (internet cafes) with open mics therefore having to mute your whole team.

Learning the map the guns the bullet drop and especially the way the other players act and react in different and similar ways and the intriguing predictability of where the players might be and how they might manoeuvre. This early access game tickles out a lot of primal emotions and instinctive decision making moves out of my core. This game is a lot deeper than people think. The fear of dying or at least losing loot and starting over again mixed with the adrenaline of the hunt or just plain fun and reckless combat.I love the realism of firearms the random spray patterns and how you can get comfortable with your favourite and how you push yourself to practice with the ones you might have hated.RESPECT THE ZONE! There are a million ways to die in this game but the most common one for me is this necessary evil.You might hate this game because you keep getting shot from who knows where or you might love it like I do because of it's raw ridiculous and infinite ways of playing or getting lost in the recurring nightmare of possibilities or what ifs.

2018-01-11,0,0,403,False,Recommended,After about 300 hours on PUBG you relize its a game you love and you hate. 1.0 was much needed patch and dropping into the new desert map was like droping in for the first time in Erengel. But after about 30 hours on the test server and another 50 hours on the live servers of 1.0 some of the changes have out stayed their welcome. The worst one of all seems to be the loot system. I dont know if its changed in 1.0 but since i have had multiple matches in a row on both maps where ill get to the end game top 10 or 15 or even 5 and all i have managed to find after dropping at a town such as Las Leones or Yas and looting every building i can and attempting to kill every player i see on the way to the zone to roll up with if im lucky a assualt rifle. Even better when i land ill run into the house or appartment loot every single floor and get a 1911 why the guy accross the street in his little one bedroom house leaves and kills me with a M4 SkS combo. Then the icing on the cake is when i finaly get a good loadout and make it to the zone i get killed by some aimbotting hacker who snaps to my head and drops me.But Ive put in 300 hours and i will keep playing hating and loving the game the whole time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You see i tend to like the gameplay more so on Erangel then Miramar.... especially for solo play Erangel gave you a sense of tactic and bravado when you absolutely needed to cross a open space so you bolted and was happy when you reached the next crest of a hill or rock thinking your safe. Miramar is just this all the time.... there is never a moment where you can relax its 360 degrees of exposure at all times and cities are far and wide between.... if that sounds appealing if this is your jam then by all means play Miramar.... its a nicely designed map for that type of action packed gameplay... as for me ill see you oldskool pubg players on Erangel i cant handle the change... oow yeah and vaulting works well but i prefer the old ways slower is betterGrandpa signing off,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-24,1,1,78,True,Recommended,TBH IDK what the deal is with the FRing Streamers but I haven't experienced it so why would I give it a bad review if it doesn't personally affect me and I like the game? It's very dumb for these people to be giving this great game a negative review. Maybe if you have a legitamate argument on why you don't enjoy the game with that as a reason then sure by all means. But if you are here just to join the bandwagon then thats kind of dumb. I have only seen TWO stories of people getting banned from this. Me and my 2 other friends that play this have not gotten banned at all.Anyways here are some pros and cons and my explanation on why I personally enjoy this game.Pros Good with friends good alone. Matchmaking doesn't give you empty squads but I have had instances were everyone left the squad pre game.In game voice is flawless no need to add randos on steam.The loot is abundant however its possible to get nothing but a pistol for the rest of the game unfortunately.Cars frequently spawn but only on the outer edges of the map. Anywhere else won't usually give you one.If you only like first person then great! The game has you covered just queue for FPP modes.Very easy to figure out what to do and how to play I knew what to do by my second match. Watch gameplays they help (although I didn't personally watch any.)Cons Honestly there is some lag between you and server which is bad because everyone sends signals to the server and you recieve them back its not p2p so you could unload into someone then they 2 shot you 1 second later and they are fine and you are dead.You can easily run yourself over make sure the vehicle is completely stationary before attempting to exit.Somehow somewhere there are people dropping to the same location and are getting there first. I don't understand I have looked at strategies all over the internet and still people will land before you.Honestly to me the pros outway the cons. The games matchmaking is shockingly fast as the game surpassed Dota 2 and CS GO in all time player peaks breaking several records its not surprising. The last 2 things I want to say is to make sure you look up strats and buy the game now its not on sale and it WILL NOT BE TRUST ME ON THIS. It won the summer sale without going on sale... So yeah if I were them I wouldn't put it on sale either.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game developer calls his player base ""xenophobes"" for simply trying to Region lock since lag happens frequently because people are from vast distances across the world. Instead of the developer (Brendan Greene) trying to fix the issues his players are having he acts unprofessional and curses/swears through his interview using the expletive F**k . Mr. Greene does not stand for his players and instead disrespects them. I don t see how region locking is a bad alternative since it only makes it fair in terms of lag and implementing this poorly optimized game. I do not see this game lasting 6 8 more months. There are two maps a 3rd person and 1st person perspective and nothing else to the game besides a typical battle royal game. Other games are creating Battle Royal modes and becoming more popular since they already have an optimized game and instead ""adding"" to their already existing game.For anyone willing to purchase this so called ""game"" please take into consideration that the developer does not care about you as a gamer nor does he act like a professional developer and human being should act Respectful. Another thing you should consider is that the game was stated being a 1.0 game yet they still act like Beta. Console systems cannot handle this poorly optimized game which sends a red flag that they did not put the effort where it was due. The company and developer keep stating how they are working on the cheaters. You would think that by 1.0 they should have already had that under control yet it is still just as bad as start of early access. The development of the game is at a snails pace on any and all fixes toward the game.I personally have nothing against any culture any religion and any race. Yet when we as gamers help fund a game and the developer tells the people who helped him get where he is that we are called by Greene ""xenophobes"" because we want to help improve the game where it is fair and runs better for every player. There are always ways to assist ones player base but calling us ""xenophobes"" is not one. I do not speak other languages however it makes things very difficult having someone on your team not understanding you or you understand them because of the language barrier. I did not say a specific race culture or anything negative besides having language barrier.So to all fellow gamers out there please take my words into consideration before getting this game.

The game is the post played atm (3 100 000 on January 2018). Clearly the developers are doing a great job and people are loving this game. A lot of different changes and additionals have been made into the game and are more to come as mentioned by the game dev team and the creator it selfs on Twitter so it looks like they have a lot of stuff comming up. A big thumbs up from me!The game it self in my opinion is really good and I've had so much fun with it. It's a great game for being in it's current state as it got out of early access.Some people just hate the developers because of how they ban people and bringing crates into the game. In my opinion if you don't play fair or can't follow the rules you should get banned. IDC if they puts crates into the game it's does't give you any kind of advantage anyway. If you don't like it then don't ing buy it. Give the devs an oppertunity to work on this game for years even after early access.

I've even gotten 3 wins so far (2 duo and one squad) but that is not the point of this review.My issue with this game is Brendan ""PLAYERUNKNOWN"" Greene's (The creative director for this game) inability to keep a promise. He stated that there would be absolutely no monetized content during this game's early access period yet here we are with a newly added in crate system very akin to that of CSGO's. You can currently purchase weekly lootcrates that don't require keys to be opened with in game currency yet that feature is slated to be removed and replaced with the ""key crate"" system once the game comes out of early access as well.Tsk tsk. And here I was hoping that this game wouldn't go full CSGO in terms of skins and loot drops. I honestly hope this crate system is removed and reintroduced further down the line when the game is more stable (further bug fixing and optimization patches). Vote with your wallets people. Let Mr. Greene that we will not stand for microtransactions or paid DLC in early access games (just look at what happened to ARK when they released scorched earth). More importantly teach him that it is a disgusting practice to lie to your dedicated players and then use the excuse that the ""crate system needs to be introduced to the community before the full release"" to cover up what is an obvious act of pure greed.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-27,0,0,666,False,Not Recommended,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I have played the hell out of this game but as of late it has become nearly impossible to play a round without being killed by a cheater. I remember when i could play TPP in the NA server and not have any problems but then it got worse and i had to move to the EU server again it became unplayable. So my friends and i finally switched to FPP and it was okay for a week or two but then they began taking over those servers.Here's my take on the problem the game has a bp system in place to buy crates that have cosmetic clothing. this clothing can be sold on the steam marketplace for money sometimes in the hundreds so the cheaters will accumulate bp fast buy crates and then open them in hopes of finding a valuable item then they sell the item and purchase a new copy of the game before becoming banned.Bluehole keeps saying the anti cheating measures are a top priority and yet the hacking gets worse and worse and it always seems to coincide with the release of a new crate with new valuable items worth selling. I imagine that if they removed the monetary incentive a lot of the problems would go away with some time. Without crates and items to sell they would be forced to spend their own money to repurchase the game after a round of mass bans. This company had a good thing got rich quick and now they're just riding the microtransaction train to retirement. In short despite the hype you may hear about this game do not purchase it until they come up with a solution for the cheaters or you'll find yourself wishing you could get a refund like myself. There is a reason that every post bluehole makes and many reviews inclue the phrase ""region lock china""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-02,0,0,360,False,Recommended,This game is one of THE biggest reasons why I finally got a gaming PC. The battle Royale genre was modernized by this game and it's easy to jump right in to learn the gameplay and mechanics and have a good time. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you enjoy ANY 1 3 person PvP. You parachute down on to 1 of 2 maps and loot buildings and areas with up to 99 other players and the goal is to be the final survivor or your squad to be the last team standing. The game keeps people from spending an entire game camping in one spot due to a ever shrinking circle forcing players to move in as the numbers dwindle keeping gameplay moving. My ONLY complaints about this game as of writing this is there are SO many chinese flooding the North American servers and kind of ruining the experience for other players looking to team up with a random player from North America and speaks your language. The other complaint that can't be fixed unfortunately is there will ALWAYS be hackers in online multiplayer games. I will admit that Bluehole and PUBG have done a decent job making it seem like it's minimal at least to me and it hasn't turned me off to the game and I feel that if I don't win a match it's due to coming up against a better player and situation rather than someone cheating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-12,0,0,20,False,Not Recommended,This game is so boring you can not imagine it. If you have a low or mid range PC you are at a serious disadvantage because the game is so unoptimized the framerate drops to single digits when you get into a conflict. That takes all the fun from the game. The game goes like this Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp. A new player with a high end PC using a pistol can kill you even when you have full lvl 3 gear and best guns. That's how unoptimized the game is. And that's not the only boring part. The most boring part is there is nothing else to do. A full price game that only has two huge and one middle sized map and nothing else to do other than loot camp shoot and die. I have this game for two or three months and I only played for 17 hours and most of them was on the first week. I would refund it if I could.

2017-12-09,0,0,22,True,Not Recommended,Don't get me wrong PUBG is a very fun game a 100 player battle royale with stress inducing moments which can mean life or death. I had tons of fun despite my short hours of gameplay and its ability to top out at 2.5m+ players while in Early Access is one hell of an achievement. HOWEVER PUBG is flawed perhaps very flawed. The game contains a good number of bugs and glitches server latency which can lead to your unfortunate demise if in a firefight or in a rather bad situation and the good 'ol hackers occasionally finding where you are despite being well hidden (sneaking into a building that you know is occupied by another player quietly finding and waiting at the perfect hiding place and yet he manages to find you and thus find yourself screwed by a gun aimed at your dumbass head even though he doesn't even know your position in the first place) and taking your head clean off in a single shot. And microtransactions. In an Early Access game? Really? And I recall them making a promise about NOT putting Microtransactions in Early Access. The devs need to put their act together. If they don't improve the game we could see a drop in its popularity and lose players bit by bit. Even if they have 2.5m concurrent players.tl dr fun but flawed.

2017-03-28,0,0,116,False,Recommended,Updated for post release There's a reason devs are ripping off this game. The formula is solid. Sure there's going to be new twists on this style of game and improvements but PUBG is solid in it's simple design. It's not a game that demands huge amounts of your time but if you chose to dedicate yourself it'd pay off.Its great to load up when you have an hour or so to spare and it's great for an evening of gaming with friends too. Even if you aren't good or experienced with FPS or battle royale styles of games it's fun.The replays are a lot of fun to watch back and include the ability to spectate who else was near by and what was happening around you during past matches which could be really useful to someone trying to git gud or for someone like me is just fun to see how wrong things could or did go.There are issues sometimes with rubber banding and I think there's small improvements to be made to just the over all polish but having seen it grow through development I have faith in the devs that these things will be sorted. I'd say this is a must buy for anyone who has ever played and enjoyed FPS games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It'll take you a few matches to get the hang of how it all works becoming familiar with the map which weapons to use if you find them catching someone off guard. But you'll soon come to realize that this game has a rampant cheating/hacking issue that the devs seem to not care about in the slightest. So far they have refused to even set a ping lock. You'll light someone up see all sorts of beautiful blood splatter yet your target doesn't die and you've been killed. A quick review on the kill cam shows that the server never even registered you hitting your target.The furthest this company takes punishment is by banning the product key. They do this because the vast majority of people banned just repurchase the game and continue to hack for another month until they are banned again.

He showed me what it was A game in the style of Battle Royale the movie (of course at this point everyone knows this but at the time I was perhaps blissfully unaware). I immediately thought ""This is what I've been waiting for!"" and opened the steam app and remote purchased it started it downloading before I went home.Fast forward to today I've put a fair amount of hours in. Nothing like the crazy pros but enough to have a pretty good feel for it. It's definitely a love/hate relationship. The love is when your heart is racing you're in the top ten you've got a real shot at winning this match. The moment you find an 8x scope or a weapon drop that gets you going. When you and your teammates do something crazy and it actually works. There are so many great stories. It may be the ultimate anecdote factory.The hate (hate is too strong a word maybe annoyance) is when you die to lag the servers are down in your one hour of a chance to play this week You drop and your parachute goes wonky and you end up stuck in a grain silo with literally no way out (ever heard of invisible barriers bluehole?) you spend 20 minutes scrambling for the inside of the circle only to die because the RNG dropped it on the complete opposite side of the map from you and spawned no vehicles.

Enough time for them to hoard a bunch of wins and get a bunch of crates to sell and buy the game again with minimal loss and do it all over again clearly the company does not care about getting their game under control and weeding out these people permanently and would rather just keep selling subscriptions to cheaters rebuying and ruining their community and dragging the game down.Still lots of glitches black screens and no load ins... when you can crash on a 2 inch pebble with any vehicle and explode and die. Also the loot system where you can land with a few people check 4 5 buildings to find not a single weapon but rather useless and get shot by the guy that got a gun in the first building they looked at while you looked at half the city to find nothing. They really need to rework this randomizing of items and luck rolls to balance out whats the point to land and check so many buildings and die because the guy had no effort to find a weapon its like a big F U.I found myself enjoying the games at times and the thrill of being down to the final 3 or 4 to bring in the win was a rush but all these other things just dragged the game down the community is getting quite dragged down and I personally cannot wait for a better game of this genre to come out and wipe out most of pubgs community due to their lack of commitment to the game and its real issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game used to run like ..fps drops and server lags (rubber banding and i couldnt even opent a door) but the new update (1.0) it runs smooooooth. I thought the game was not ready for full release but update 1.0 literally fixed everything. Servers are decent with a little lag sometime especially at the start of the match but it is bearable. The fps is smoooooth af. For the best possible experience make sure your greaphics drivers are up to date. This review was based on my experience on Oceanic servers....Overall gameplay experience in other servers may differ.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This update they have ED the physics up on vehicles so they flip much more easier and they will drift and spin out at the slightest touch. most damage done to me so far in the game was from vehicle flips on randoms invisible bumps or small hills that the vehicle did not like.new map is exesively laggy and the loot overall went from alright overall to tier. Playing squads unless you get a whole CITY to yourselves count only one person getting an AR/AK with a 4x and others will be hardpressed to find even an ump or thompson. overall this release is absolute dog and bluehole should be ing fined for releasing such a unrefined untested and such a walk backwards from the games release overall.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Devs have done a great job on optimizing this game so it's a hell of a lot better than when i originally bought it and indeed gave up on it. I don't play sub 60fps games personally not in 2017 it's unacceptable. So glad to see the devs have put in the work and got this running properly. No point going into a full blown review on the game.

Not GOTY tho. that nomination is BS.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-18,0,0,61,False,Not Recommended,First off let me say that I used to love playing this game. It was an interesting concept and showed potential. Now what started as a fun game to play has turned into a piece of garbage. Every match is riddled with aimbots and cheating software and it's getting worse over time. The developers aren't doing enough to stop the cheating and it's ruining the game for all of the honest players. What's fun about waiting in a lobby full of obnoxious people for 1 minute for a match to start investing 30 minutes into surviving only to get shot once by an aimbot and die? Not to mention there's only two maps to play on with no way of voting on the map post match. This game needed some more work and polishing before it was released. The developers only care about the money they made from the 30 million sales though. I don't expect the community for this game to stick around much longer if they continue to show a lack of support. It's pretty much turning into another one of those early access games that makes a lot of money then dumped. I don't recommend this product I can't anymore.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Legit PROS The game is somewhat good if you are lucky and manage to get 1 2 fights in a round in LONG range. CONS bought it some months ago had 60 80 fps stable. Now I cant manage 40 stable good optimization progress. servers close combat is a joke and even if 60 fps+ feels like 10 max. close combat is a joke then they implement a fog map where you only have that. vehicle phisics are a joke and they randomly hit invisible walls on terain. graphics are a joke even on max (not that any system can run that) hit registration is a joke you cant hit over a fence that has 20 cm air between 2 little steel rods. parachute landing is a joke and annoys the out of me.I am not an expert in game making but if you are not either then pay someone to fix ur game. You got the money now. PS. better optimisation more ppl can play more money for you more players will spend money on creates more money for you.

2017-12-14,0,0,569,True,Not Recommended,The Game I Love to HateI cannot express how accurate the above statement exemplifies my thoughts on this game. This game can be so fun playing either solo in a duo or as a squad. I have a few good friends I've made by playing this game and we agonize and love this game on a daily basis. PROs It has that unseen 'it' factor that makes you want to keep playing it. It's similar to CS GO for me in that it's the type of game I'll play for an hour or two just to get that 'itch' out. It's the best iteration of this concept that is on the market imo. I do not enjoy Fortnite or KOTK mainly do to their gunplay mechanics. In Battlegrounds there is some base attempt at realism which I prefer.CONs Optimization and netcode Ever ran up to a corner to post knowing there is an enemy running your way in that general direction? Ever did that and somehow lag or teleport 5 feet away from said corner? While I'll admit this issue has gotten better in the months since I've owned the game microstutters and other input lag issues still occur far too often. I own a 7700k 1080Ti and 32 GB 3200 and a 960 EVO SSD my computer isn't the issue.The netcode issue is tied in with the next issue which is that the NA servers are filled up with people from every other continent other than NA. Many times their lag issues cause issues when you are trying to kill them. My internet is 300Mb/sec down and 30Mb/sec up again my computer and services are not the issue. Hacking Early on when I'd purchased this game this wasn't an issue for me. Bluehole was even taking people to court for Christ's sakes! Now I seem to be encountering hackers any time I play for an extended period (2 hours or more). I say this not to be a whiney but because I grew up playing CS and I understand how hackers work (anyone that played 1.6 knows what I'm talking about). I.E. people staring at the ground and shooting you with godlike precision from a couple hundred meters I start shooting a guy 400 meters away as he's running across a field to School and he whips around with an M16 and opens up like an M249 and every shot registers (once I'm downed the kill feed at school lights up like a xmas tree as this dude single handedly clears it or lastly me and a couple friends are driving in two separate vehicles and die within 5 seconds to the same guy all as headshots.TL DR I still play the game because I enjoy more than other games of its kind. It is most enjoyable when played with friends. Microstutters/input lag and netcode issues still common issues. NA servers are filled with everyone but NA players. Hackers are starting to become as invasive as Herpes. I'll give this game a positive rating once remedies are in place to deal with these issues most likely after full release (kill cam should help get rid of hackers).

The white circle almost everytime is RNGed in an open field or u just happen to be on the half with no cover VERY BIG CON The forcefield is transparent therefore many unwanted stuff can happen such as 1.You can be camped from inside the playzone while you try to run into it. 2.Some noobs who don't have any chance of survival because they started running too late can pick you off even though you can still make it them being 100m behind you.Conclusion Would die by force field again 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,210,False,Not Recommended,"Well. I will try to be as fair as possible. I haven't write any review so far here but I decided to do so with this game as I have never encounter such a case before.So to keep it simple the game has very nice graphics and they are combined with pretty good movement too.The gamestyle is easy plain not complicated so anyone can learn to play easily.The two maps are nice and quite large even though I'd prefer more so it doesn't feel that repetitive.There are still some glitches especially with the movement and moving with vehicles here and there but overall I am satisfied by the quality of their work.As for the gameplay. As I said it is not complicated so anyone can play it. It has several modes solo which will place you against 99 individuals duo which will place you against 49 enemy teams of 2 people each and team of 4 which is against other teams of 4 and 3 people.It can either be played in FPS or TPS modes but whatever mode you pick it means that everyone in the team is pretty much onto the same mode. Of course while of TPS you can always zoom in to FPS viewing mode at any time during the game.The difficult part comes to spotting the opponents as the map is quite big and the other hard part is targeting. Headshots are effective but difficult to achieve and even with a bit of server lag you will find it hard to shot a moving target.But up to this point all is within the enjoyable limit. I will close this review with two simple sentences that actually ruin all the above.1. I have never seen so many cheating in a game before and so unsuccessful attempts to counter hacking by a developer.Most of the time I lost my enemy achieved a headshot by having the target to clip right onto my head.2. The reward system is crap and that will make you loose interest especially when you see that they will start offering you more ""just simple appearances/clothes"" for several dollars. And even these dollars you might spend for nothing as the case that you will be opening might contain something that you already have.I do not suggest this game unless you are looking so spend 20 euros/dollars into a game that is already obsolete after 6 months of it's release. You will get angry due to cheating and bored due to the repetitive nature without an actual reward.If it was a free to play then sure I would suggest it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-22,0,0,93,False,Not Recommended,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I personally do enjoy this game. But there is a lot that holds this game back first and foremost the game is $30. I think it is worth the money if your looking for a ""tactical"" game but when there are many other F2P Battle Royale games that have much better payment models PUBG isn't very competitive in that sense. Not to mention they just released a season pass you have to pay $10 for that gives you a significantly better way of unlocking items. Why is this not an update for every person playing the game? It's much better than the system currently in place where you use BP to buy crates that not to mention are complete RNG on what crate you get that may or may or not REQUIRE you to buy a key in order to unlock it which the crate is also complete RNG on what you get. I understand this system being in a F2P game to an extent but there are better ways of doing this especially in a $30 game. Even Fortnite has a better system and they didn't have to pay a cent for it.We get it you want money but at least be fair and competitive. With recent events such as Bluehole trying to sue epic games for them supposedly ""infringing on copyright laws"" We all knew what that meant what they are doing is trying to get other games shut down or taken down so that they are the only one left. It's kind of ironic that the company who used the same engine bought assets directly from it's store and slightly modified some of them for their own game tries suing the company who owns said engine. Not to mention trying to get rid of other mobile Battle Royale games as soon as they put their own on IOS and Android claiming they were just copycats or clones. While that may be true for some of them take a look at your own game first you weren't the first to create a Battle Royale game there were others before you who also met success.There have been much needed improvements to this game however it's obvious where their priority lies and that's making the $$$. Their are still a plethora of issues like poor performance on lower end hardware even on better systems people still have issues. Hacking is still an issue although I havn't personally come across any. How long before these issues persist? It's been a year yet some of the biggest complaints about this game still remain in the game. Their greed and ego will be the downfall of this game take a look at your mixed and mostly negative reviews there's a reason it's there.

The amount of chineese players that will teamkill you if you do not speak chineese outnumbers the amount of North Americans on the NA (North American) servers that speak english. This makes getting a random group for squad impossible in matchmaking. The vehicle mechanics are broken and the weapon variety is small. Before the game starts all your hear is asians yelling in their native tongue at the top of their lungs and other asian players in an internet cafe with their mics always on thus allowing you to not only hear that asian yelling in his native tongue but all of the other asians in that cafe doing the same.... at video games...... as grown adults......All in all if the vehicle mechanics were fixed more weapon variety was added and there was a region lock the game would be great but from what I have read bluehole has no intention of stopping the invasion onto other servers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Above all of this this game is payed as opossed to its competitor Fortnite and still manages to not perform as well.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,296,True,Not Recommended,*A lot of people might hate on me as I've only had about a hundred hours so far but I think that if a player had a great time playing a game for a few hours they should be coming back because of their enjoyment.* *I am also not good at English so please bare my gramatical mistakes if there are any*I was really skeptical about this game when it was first out on Steam. I didn't like the idea of having another early access game with a slight open world feeling to it. Well more than 2 million people obviously didn't agree with me. Despite it's popularity I wouldn't advise buying this game until a few months AFTER its official release Here are my reasons why 1. In my experience the servers' performance is somewhat poor recently. This probably isn't a problem on all servers though but I've experienced much server issues to the point where it has caused me to be very frustrated with this game. (Don't even get me started on those times where I constantly tried to even get to the main menu because of the login issues)2. I haven't encountered too many hackers but I've been through a few (about 3 so far). With many people saying that there are numerous hackers swarming around I don't think developers would be able to resolve the issue by the time this game actually releases (props to this game coming out of Early Access soon though). But I believe that they'd be able to resolve the issue although probably numerous months after the release. I understand that there will be always hackers in ever so popular games but having a large percentage of them around ruins the experience for the community. 3. While this game is being updated with new content (don't get me wrong this is a good thing to keep games alive) this game seriously needs to be somewhat optimized for PCs even on beefy computers. I would much prefer it if there was AT LEAST one major update that would fix the performance issues this game has (and the numerous bugs infested as well) instead of giving a very large focus on adding new content every update. Getting back I play on low medium settings and I still get many instances where my FPS would drop to really low numbers oh and stuttering (lots of it). I have a decent system and I don't think I should be getting this kind of issue at least not very often. For my final words I still believe this game can survive. Despite all the points I mentioned I still somewhat enjoy the game especially with friends. The thing that drives me away are the problems currently floating around. Bluehole has a very very good game with lots of potential in their hands at the moment but if they drive it to the wrong turn the opportunity will slowly cripple down to the trash. Oh and uh please please please stop making this game into an Esport and let people have fun with it and not turn it into something like CS GO. Also this game isn't even Esports ready c'mon it hasn't even come out of Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just today to get into it I needed to launch it several times due to several crashes when attempting to load the main menu. Thankfully that is the worst bug I am encountering though that is not true for everyone.Why do I recommend this game? Because all that aside it is fun. The bugs aren't aggravating and the experience is overall worth the money. Now in many other games I would dismiss these bugs as inexcuseable but I understand that these large map realistic physics games are hard to get right. Even the oldest people in this genre Bohemia Interactive still can't get everything just right. And the PUBG team has demonstrated that things get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-19,0,0,404,True,Not Recommended,Kyle Walton19 November 2014Steam ReviewsThis game has progressively and is continuing to get much much worse. You would think the opposite from a game that's sold millions of copies and is still in early access advancing towards release but absolutely not it seems every aspect of the game continues to somehow get worse and worse every update.To start off the optimization is what can be considered &amp quot quot . I don't have the absolute up and best rig there is but a ryzen 5 1600 and a gtx 1060 6gb shouldn't be struggling to hold frames in a game at 1080p. The amount of network lag in this game is at least 100x what I've seen from any other game I've ever played in almost every single match. The amount of worthless cheating asian players on NA servers is absolutely insane. It seems to be 1/3 games now I'm killed by a cheater. Even more often I see a player rubberbanding around because his/her ping is through the roof and I can get kiled before I even see him/her.The combat in this game is boul honksworth. It's inconsistent and buggy. Some games the AK spray is on lock and easy to use and then the next time I use it it's absolutely ballistic. Some games the SCAR automatic is precise and predictable and sometimes it goes wherever you tell it not to.The graphics are sub par for the specs this game expects you to push. However I will note that I have one good thing to say about this absolutely garbage game it isn't pay to win which is nice for a change.On that not eat my Bluehole this game is terrible please remove it from the Steam Store.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That time has passed though and while I still do deal with the occasional bug it has gotten a hell of a lot better over the last couple of months. Havent run into a single hacker since the beginning of November either. I enjoy this game both solo and with a team... While there are still issues with the game and a lot Bluehole can do to fix them I feel like they are actually taking the steps necessary to make improvements over time... which is all I need.

2018-05-13,0,0,43,False,Recommended,"I think this game is pretty top kek and worth the money. The most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from people who just died a lot and said they were killed by aimbotters ""through the wall"" when most likely they were just shot through a window that they didn't notice or they just have too much lag due to a slow PC trying to run the settings at max. I like the fact that there are no in game purchases besides the market and the ones that are there are reasonably priced besides the extremely rare items. Fortnite however is free so it relies on overpriced currency called ""V bucks"" which are only used for cosmetics and emotes so instead of paying for content you pay for actual PUBG has none of this and is fun especially with friends. A few cons are that it can lag sometimes very slightly on its own and other times you can be killed by someone intentionally playing on the north american server when they are actually in china which sucks Overall rating 9.5/10 Would meme againpretty top kek game i recommend",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They are slow with coming out with new features. However the events was a nice idea that was added in.

The core gameplay itself is already good but the performance is still lacking. Not just fps performance but network performance. There still rubber banding and people teleporting around...

2018-08-15,0,0,2006,False,Recommended,Still remember the first time i jumped out of the plane in Erangel and landed in Yasnaya. Didn't know about the game but the excitement was real. Looting the good stuff (coats hats and to look cool) i even prefered a black baseball cap over lvl 1 helmet LUL. I also remember my first kill it was with a shotgun in the mighty moomin house (in Mylta i guess).I played my first 200 ish hours as TPP and it took me 97 hours of gameplay to get my first chicken dinner. The first few hundred matches were exciting as hell and reaching the top 10 made my heart rate to go over 9000.Running 10km per game because you didn't know the car spawns dropping at small compounds because you weren't brave enough to drop at big boys' places such as Military Base and Georgopol.Fog was annoying as hell you couldn't see everyone was proned or camping in a building. Scopes were because the edges were so t h i c c. C jumping was a thing and i loved it. The old main menu and theme song were better imo.Frustrating things are 1. Dsync2. Losing health after diving when you clearly are at the surface already before you run out of breath3. Rub your guns in windows and stair railingsNonetheless PUBG was and is very refreshing after thousands of hours of basically only CS 1.6 CSGO and OSRS.

2018-09-11,0,0,572,False,Recommended,I bought this game as recomended by a friend recently in a sale. It fits nicely into the simulation/survival niche it ticks my boxes between fast arcade gameplay and brutal simulation......and manages this very well. Short fast games with barely time to think.....at the very least it's teaching me some good map reading skills.Too add some context i'm a long suffering DayZ fan that got tired of waiting. I uninstalled that game recently after 6 7(?) years of waiting patiently for a release. PUBG fits the gap perfectly spookyily almost i still pinch myself to remind me that its an Unreal engine port of DayZ which is a standalone version of a Mod that ran on ArmA2 which is a renamed release of the classic Operation Flashpoint.My only request would be more vehicles a light chopper would be nice. Hell lets just try teams 50v50 limited vehicles with 2 Team zones to be captured. Wouldnt take much effort and would match its rivals for more content.Overall the sound of this game stands out above all else the time delay on distant sniper fire the delay of Thunder after a lightning bolt I would give it 10/10 for sound quality.But overall it needs work on various things stability graphics quality and just a bit more content please!Overall 7/10 (needs some work but has great potential),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-17,0,0,1116,True,Recommended,I recommend this game. But with certain caveats. There are several things that are required in order to have the best gaming expereince.1) Even if you have the top of the line gaming computer this does not guarantee a consistently smooth gaming experience. In other words most people with average gaming computers will suffer a bad gaming exeperience from time to time in this game.2) There is a cheating problem however it seems to be centered on the Third person servers. Currently if you play first person then you are much less likely to run into rampant cheating.3) Even if you have the best computer and the game has no cheaters you still have to contend with lag and desync issues from time to time.4) There is no guarantee that bluehole (the game's developer) will ever completely fix any of these issues.Even with all these potential problems I think PUBG offers enough return on your money to get a good 500 hours worth of fun (and occasional frutstration).For 30 dollars that comes to almost 5 cents per hour of fun. You can't beat that. Once you become good at this game the adrenaline rush situations are second to none.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-26,0,0,826,False,Not Recommended,A terrible game that is dying. The dev team is a mess and unable to communicate easily within their departments. The game has not delivered on what was promised. There's no mod support there are no custom servers there are no custom maps. There is no way to practice anything other than either the loot simulator or fist fighting if you drop in hot zones. The devs are ruining the competitive community with their lack of knowledge of proper game mechanics and failure to deliver on the bost basic essentials required for a competitive game. The game is still ugly and unoptimized and can barely run on the top end graphics card. Do not buy this unless you have a top of the line cpu graphics card memory and even a top m.2 drive. If you don't have top of the line ram you lose most of your performance and if you don't have an m.2 many game items/buildings will not load in properly and ruin your game.Even the anti cheat is terrible not banning who it should and banning people it shouldn't. A game filled with people aimbotting and flying and they are still wasting time banning people for using povohat's mouse accel. If the third party leaderboards didn't automatically hide cheaters then the leaderboards would reveal the severity of the problem.It's a great idea for a game but another developer needs to swoop in and release a proper version. Maybe the chinese version by tencent can come to america. 1/10. Waiting for a better battlegrounds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-31,0,0,13,False,Not Recommended,A fun game concept but the most frustrating game I ever played in my life. This is the only game that is better on a mobile device than on PC or console save yourself $30 and a lot of frustration and enjoy the smartphone version (which incidentally also runs much more smoothly). When the game first came out it must have been great fun but at this point there are too many experts and cheaters that make it almost impossible to get ahead. Several times I dive landed carefully making sure there are no parachutes nearby only to be blasted right upon landing by someone with Level 2 armor and two primary weapons already equipped. ...What the hey?... In 20 games I only landed 4 kills I know I'm bad but I'm not completely terrible with shooters and ended in top 10 a couple times using stealth. When the game is challenging and has a steep learning curve there should be some way to train before sharing the field with experts who've been playing for weeks or months and/or streaming on twitch tv.

When it first came out was probably the best time to have played it the game was way more fun with what I think had fewer glitches than it does now. Negatives Optimization is still terrible ( I don't understand how it's still this bad for a game that's fully released and not early access)Constant crashes (Lots of people still crash either it's at the loading screen for a match or when you leave a match)Terrible servers (they can crash in the middle of a match so you just watch yourself die to the zone)updates that only make the game worse (new errors worse optimization some how adding things that aren't needed)Developers not listening to the community (not fixing issues and getting rid of weather)Lots of hackersGood chunk of glitches (some are fun like how motorcycles can just launch all other vehicles)Pros hmmmm???Honestly this game isn't worth playing anymore until they fix their I would rather recommend Fortnite a free to play game to people who want to play Battle Royale. I just can't understand how pubg is fully released but is just this piece of garbage Fortnite is better by a long shot and I don't even like Fortnite that's saying something.

2018-02-11,0,0,205,False,Not Recommended,I used to really enjoy playing this game with friends. I don't have the best graphics card so I lag everywhere on the lowest quality but I would put up with it just to have fun with my friends. The dessert map is what is causing me to dislike this game. It was a good idea at first because it was something new and different but now it's all you ever play on. There is no cover when you are being pushed by the zone across an open field while your being shot from a ridge somewhere and the loot spawns are absolute garbage. I looted 4 different houses and found nothing but clothing items and pistols. Pistols are a complete joke unless you shoot someone point blank in the head and you can't do that when the other person has a shotgun or smg or an assault rifle. My graphics card can barely handle the game and when I get put onto the dessert map that is considerably larger it kills my computer to the point that it's not even worth the money I spent on this game. They need to go ahead and add a map selector so that way if you don't want to end up on a map you hate 5 times in a row you won't have to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-31,0,0,651,False,Not Recommended,"They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. STEREO sound... what year is this?? Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc. But compared to the above points these are pretty minor.What would make this game better? Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). Actually ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items) it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50 they would make millions. Win win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their . I will never buy a key to open one and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedy ! Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.Why is it so popular then? It's exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them) or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etc.The most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.Edited to add To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"" the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1 CS GO COD etc run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything but it's a big part of the network delay between two players and low tickrates can cause other issues.PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8 10Hz with everyone alive and that increases as players die which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I will say that this is still one of the best battle royale genre games out there. With that being stated however this game has a very Love/Hate relationship with most players so if you're not looking for that look elsewhere. Overall the shooting is pretty decent the fact that they smurfed some of the guns is a lot better. and the new scopes they added are amazing so at least I can say they are headed in a positive direction. Just give us the new maps already.Oh and all i'm posting are the most recent cons because I don't want you to be reading for days.CONS They say they've fixed the cheating however it seems like every other game someone sucks and has to use an aimbot to make themselves not suck. (which even with aimbots they sometimes still suck) WTF is going on with the crates you have to buy keys for.. at least make it an option to use battle points to purchase them and stop trying to rob the people who play this game.

After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win!

2017-10-27,0,0,277,False,Recommended,Love it. I dont encounter hackers that much anymore so i will believe they did something with the anti cheat. Also some bugs were fixed but not all of them.Those cons things aside i think this game is awesome and capture every genre i love like open world survival and FPS. After they fix the server issues i will love to see it in the e sports scene. The perfomance on my mid range PC became better and better after tons of updates and i know can get up to 75 85 FPS in medium settings.Edit It seems they fixed the server stability making it from 24Hz to 60HzEdit 2 About the Event Pass for me at least its not a big deal. They added something so you can get skins by leveling up and doing missions which lets you have a purpose for playing the game (at least for casuals). If you dont like it dont buy it. It doesnt make you better at the game.Overall 9/10 worth the money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm happy because I got to the camouflage mechanical skin .The strong sense of operation makes people feel a feeling of being in the world. It's a good hit. It's very interesting to have four teams with friends because there are always interesting things to happen. When you meet another four person team it's a moment of excitement. We need to communicate and discuss tactics to eliminate the enemy on the opposite side so as to ensure that we are not eliminated. Of course sometimes the tactics are good but the game is finished because the technology is not good so it's very angry and wants to do a good shot. In a word I think the game is interesting even though I have played for five hundred hours I don't get tired of it.

2017-07-18,0,0,132,True,Recommended,Okey First things first obviously game craves for optimalization.But let's create a list of Pros and ConsPros+ # Game is Fun to play for me it's a game which works good around idea of battle royale *few games failed miserably so yeah that is a succes* # Feeling endangered at every bit of square meter # Shooting Other players it's naturally fun even when i die before i kill anyone but i'm getting hang of it so everythin can be learned . # Inventory UI works well and doesn't make you squint where the hell i left something so tiny plus for thatVisuals are not bad but having everything set to low gives you a lot of advantage / .Cons # Optimalization need's some work. # movement is sometimes clunky and interaction with items sometimes makes you wait for action to happen. # Loot dropped everywhere creates a weird feeling. *Cool idea for devs Weapons and other stuff like that in houses are random but in boxes which are generated on fly so basicly loot inside is rolled at first opening of the box inside house or Warehouse . # Clothes on the floor all look the same so always white shirt and always black pants it should be seen from distance what colour that item is. I hope that small detail will be patched. Not a big deal but still nice to have. # Settings in menu are done in a weird manner every thing should have it place so for Instance Anti Alias should have simple 2x 4x 6x 8x and not V Low Low Medium High Ultra and it gives us a lot of bloom with it so no separated settings would be so nice to get as much from game. But still thing to develop until that i will check ini settings # leaving a car while moving creates damage at least do animation responding to that bcuz that makes weird sittuations someone jumps the car damaged but still ready to shoot me straight away it gives some advantage as an tiny exploit . in My opinion. # Weapon Attachments should've some statistics about what they give in percentage or anything numerical and gun could've stats in Inventory too # Audio sometimes distorts on spawn area *lobby* before getting into plane # Having low setting's give advantage so playing on prettier game makes you worse in comparison with people playing on a poorer pc components # Loot boxes Fine idea but every item is thrown into one so i cannot choose what item i want to roll *box for every category of clothing would be nice *box for Tops Pants . Another For hats and masks other for boots and gloves would be nice i could like at least choose for what I'm Aiming buying a crate.And that game in current state for me is 6/10 or 7/10 it's a bit rough piece of Coal but with some work it can be better and better. Some things are trivial i know that but in summary game is Fun and i hope it will go out from early acces hell to be a normal product with updates events and stuff like that Upcoming updates are a good sign . That Was a Casual review Thanks for reading i reccommend that game for scavengers and shooters left in some Russian island,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-03,0,0,601,False,Not Recommended,"Back when the game was Early Access I had a lot of fun and wrote a possitive review about it.But lately with it's official launch and having found nothing but hackers and cheaters being a constant in the game I have to change my positive review to a Negative one.First the PROS The game still has some fun to it dropping in finding gear to hunt down other players (either solo or a team). The game is always an adrenaline rush from the start. This is not your typical CoD Arena fighting. So you either play smart or get shot.The CON Sadly teh CONs have grown a great deal since the game release. The biggest ongoing issue with the game are the hackers and the cheaters. No surprise the majority of which are the Chinese. I realize it may sound stereo typing and racial. But the fact is they are Chinese hackers/cheaters. Just in January (2018) the devs banned 100k players for cheating the majority of which were Chinese. More so as of April (2018) they announced they made 15 arrests IN CHINA. The arrests were on coders selling source code to hack/cheat PUBG. More so these same coders left BACKDOOR programs into the PCs of the ppl who BUY their hack code.So to all those hackers buying cheats from China to win the game. You got E D and deserve it.But even that is not enough to save the game sadly. There are still hacks going on with cheaters using Snap to Target No Recoil Health Regen and Instant Kill Shots. Even more where they instantly gain high tier weapons on drop or survive ourside the blue ring w/ no damage. The latest problem is now the game is trying to pander onto the ""weekly mission"" scheme of gameplay. Like last x hours on this map travel x miles etc. It's killing the sake of the true element of the game in favor of achievements. if I want achievements i'll play CoD.Final Thought In the past I said this is a ""must Buy"". But now with the state of it with hackers cheaters and slow responses from the devs on handling and controlling the problem. I have to say PASS. All their focus has been on new pointless content from swag to skins. With little in the way of battling the hackers still going on.Pro+ survival of the smartest and wittiest+ Some good team players for Team matches+ diversity of weapons gear and vehicles+ Randomized item drops and deploymentCon Chinese hackers Purchased hacks now show they include backdoor programs on their clients. So cheaters are getting hacked after purchasing the code I do love the irony. slow updates on security for game little to no improvements in security or decline in hackers and cheats",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every other freaking game no matter what server you play on you get by some hacker who then starts screaming at you in Asian. There was a massive player backlash because of this where the head of Bluehole said we are racists for wanting to region lock the game. This is my first negative review ever but this game literally went from my favorite game to the biggest piece of crap of the century not even bacause of the hackers because that could be solved by region locking but because Bluehole are actual pieces of crap. They are great game designers but have some of the worst personalities in existence if you are going to attack your players for wanting to make the game fair again. 500 000/10 Would NEVER EVER RECCOMEND! This is by far the worst 30 dollars I have ever spent. I honestly wish I could remove it from ever appearing in my library just because I don't want to look at something that is as garbage as this I may as well just put my trash can infront of the screen than play this game because it would be about the same just with less hacker.Never again will i buy another Bluehole game for as long as I live because they are actual pieces of crap.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All we want is to be listened clearly through the mediums available. Yes PUBG is a phenominally addictive game considering it is essentially one map (soon 2) the same thing on repeat BUT each time the parameters change which make for a more exciting time. There's a couple of issues that give me stark reminders of the DEVil (WildCard) bugs keep appearing and it seems they aren't a priority over different means such as rushing releases and adding different competitions or paid loot drops.

Memory leaks massive frame drops. Inconsistent framerate. Terrible network issues. Desync lag unstable 20 tick servers poor hitreg is CLIENT SIDE. No region restrictions/ping limits. Some guy from China will be rubber banding and teleporting all over your screen and ruin your run. Poor vehicle physics. Enjoy hitting a pebble with your motorcycle and dying. Aiming system is horrible and inherently broken. When aiming in first person bullets will come out below your crosshair which means you will get caught on a variety of props/walls/corners and be unable to shoot the person you are correctly aiming at. Indoor combat is EXTREMELY clunky as a result. For some reason there are a lot of bars on windows which will prevent you from shooting out properly. Zero bullet penetration for now although the devs have said that this will come in the future. Poorly balanced circle of death (Extremely random and will cost you games. Some runs will be screwed right when you decide to jump leading to a feeling of wasted time/effort spent looting) Unprofessional dev team. They are already breaking promises made earlier and are intending to add a CSGO microtransaction system.

2017-11-04,0,0,153,False,Not Recommended,"What is this game?This game is a ""one game mode"" type of first and third person shooter.You start in a C 130 type plane and you parachute onto an island filled with weapons with 99 other players.An energy barrier surrounding the island gets smaller and smaller as time goes on and anyone left outside the barrier slowly loses health.Last man/woman standing wins.What is the gameplay like?The gameplay is smoother and straight up better than the arma and H1Z1 versions of battle royale (when you're not experiencing lag more on that later). Looting is pretty exciting since all the loot is designed very well weapons and their attachments all have their strengths and weaknesses and me and my friends already have our different prefrences (so no ""one weapon to rule them all"" bs) The pacing can seem a bit boring for new players (it was for me) though as I learned how to play what to do and what not to do every moment I spent in game felt somewhat exciting and feeling of ""wasting my time waiting for the zone to close in"" disappeared. Every moment felt precious since it could be spent finding better loot getting into a better position and etc.What is the player economy like?Every character earns points during games and with these points they can buy crates which they can open to reveal cosmetic items for their characters to wear.Character customization is relatively simple but some of the items in these crates sell for a nice amount of money.The crates themselves can also be sold.However the dev mentioned that the players would have to pay to open the crates in the future (Update this is now the case) so keep that in mind if you want to buy this to earn some nice steam wallet money.What is the community like?Sometimes there are some really nice people who join you in team games but its mostly bad.Would you recommend this game?I want to recommend this game I really do but I can't.Battle royale is a relatively young genre so its games are obviously going to be a little clunky till the genre fully develops and devs are familiar with its challenges. However calling this game ""clunky"" would be a straight up lie.This game is an absolute travesty of software design it is so bad that it even runs very differently on two machines I own with the exact same components. Running this game is an absolute chore it eats up every last byte of my ram and still asks for more. The frequent crashes lag spikes and frame drops makes this game borderline unplayable. Basically when you buy this game you enter into a lottery if you win your system will run the game properly. If not it won't. I frequently experience lag spikes and frame drops and whenever start a game I have to wait for the buildings to load before I can start looting and sometimes it takes the game ten minutes to load the damn buildings. I've also died several times where the game would literally freeze as I enter a firefight. Oh and the hackers... This game has a bunch.This game could have been amazing if it ran properly. But it doesnt and it probably won't on your machine.Honestly its the best way to play battle royale but only if your system can run it properly.Other than that some of the assets in the game are from the Unreal asset store and not made by the devs which seems a bit dodgy if you ask me.If you're dying to play a great battle royale game (I was and still am) buy this. But just know that its gunna eat away your enthusiasm with all the lag bugs and freezing.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have not had any crashes at all and neither have the people that i've played with which have way more hours than I do. Only problem (which isn't really a problem just kind of annoying) I have ran across is when playing with random squads is that it is mostly full of Asian people and as I do not speak any form of any language other than Spanish and English it makes it hard to communicate where a shooter is where we wanna go if they have any items etc. As of so far I have not (to my knowledge) met any hackers that are blatantly cheating.Overall I would def. reccomend this game as it is better optimised (I do not have a OP GPU and I still run it on 50 65ish FPS) than before.

2018-08-06,0,0,569,False,Not Recommended,"Well my first negative review on Steam... This game had it all to be a great game and it was at sometimes and the gunplay is still one of the very best in shooting games. The core concept of the game is good everyone knows about battle royale now and this was the king. Aside from all the weird stuff with Epic Games and Fortnite the truth is that PUBG Corp (Bluehole Software) is running this game into the ground. From overloading the game with micro transactions to not fixing the games' many bugs everytime they patch something they break something they can't handle the problem with the cheaters the optimization is still really poor and finally they bring a season pass for 9.99 for a month of ""missions""( they were bugged to hell) with very little compensation (like skins and clothes many of them temporary). The end result and for me the final ""nail in the coffin"" is the fact that as the player count goes down the time which you spend waiting for the matchmaking goes up a lot. In a game where RNG counts so much and a bad landing can mean you only play for one minute before getting killed having to wait more than 2 minutes for a match to start is a dealbreaker for many people. Maybe when all the AAA titles like CoD and Battlefield come out with their takes on battle royale they'll decide to fix this game...not very likely and probably too late for that. /",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I can play on high to ultra settings and record with fps not drop below 60fps. Yes the servers can be laggy. This seems to be getting better though. What bugs me about this game is the fact that players can not be rewarded for strategy in that you can be left in a bad position just because of the random circle collapses. Also the player base in the OC server is becoming toxic. Cheats are becoming more and more common. Overall I do recommend the game as it is a lot of fun when you play against genuine players.

2018-08-18,1,1,11,False,Not Recommended,Its a great game.But it's not worth a cent. The reason Fortnite took off so well is because it did what this game wanted to do but it did it with more stability and didn't charge players a cent for it. This game is still optimised like trash there's no players online match wait times are appauling as a result there's next to no insentive to play other than to get little bits of coins to buy loot boxes that contain nothing of any value.If this game was free it'd be a different story. But I paid $30aud for this. And I've managed to get about 10 games out of it. More than half of my 11 hours of currently recorded time is me just letting the game sit on the match search screen while I do something else and hope to god I get a match. I quit playing months ago. But I came back just recently to have another go at it and found that I wasn't able to get a single match in 2 hours of searching.Honestly I want a refund. This game is great but it's not worth the price at all.

2018-10-25,0,0,382,False,Not Recommended,Far too much server lag. Iconsitancies with damage caused. Fired a headshot player more or less point blank with a Kar98 and he was wearing a level 1 helmet it didn't one shot kill. Fair enough. However I was wearing a level 2 helmet and level 2 armour was one shotted and died whilst having full health.Also when the game is minimised the in game music still plays. Every first game you play you're stuck at the loading screen and effectively aren't in control of your character until it's too late. Many times in combat the server lag gets you killed.This a just a broken game with INCREDIBLY poor quality control. It's utter abysmal and need a serious overhaul if this game is to become a success in the long run. As it stands it's and has had very little creative input from the developers. Virtually no game modes other than Battle Royale. Also very little maps. Very little weapons and just a general lack of variety makes for inconsistent gameplay and therefore is not enjoyable to play. I think there should be a game mode where you can at least start off with a weapon and have a level playing field. Again quality control is the root of the issue wih this game. It had potential when the game was in beta it had a charm like no other game I had ever played. Then the game sold out and everyone and their granny got into it like a Christmas that was stuffed with This could have been so much better if it weren't for greedy money hungry developers.

2017-10-16,0,0,1,True,Not Recommended,"This game's optimization is by FAR one of the most egregious examples of ""Early Access Syndrome"" with literally every rig having trouble maintaining a stable 60 FPS without a fair deal of tweaks to both in game settings or even config files. It absolutely baffles me how people can continue to support blatant examples of rushed products and cash grabs. This game is fun down in there somewhere amidst some of the worst graphical issues in a triple A game currently. The graphics would look nice if the game would run but the need to basically kneecap the game's settings makes the world look like a poorly textured buggy mess. All of this aside the game is fun but I just don't get why this particular battle royale game is successful. PUBG does nothing new or even particularly interesting in my opinion. This plays very similarly to any other BR game. H1Z1 KOTK The Culling ARK Survival of the Fittest Rust BR Dayz BR all of these games are battle royale games (or include BR modes) and none of them are really all that different IMO. The only BR game in recent memory that stands out (again TO ME) is Fortnite Battle Royale. That game is free for one runs really well for another has the fort building mechanics which add a unique new aspect to a BR game has a more uncommon art style has less of a barrier for entry has quicker matches has fewer bugs and in general seems more creative than these other BR games and PUBG. I don't play BR games much in general but the only one that made me stick around was Fortnite. Anyway I had to refund this after 3 matches. Sadly I just can't deal with all of the graphical problems in this game. Even if this game was cleaned up it still wouldn't be anything new or inspired. I understand why others have fun with it but I don't see how it has earned its undeniable success. This isn't even touching the insanely inappropriate behavior of the devs involving stream snipers and bans as well as the in game ads and extra microtransactions in the Chinese version.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-04,0,0,358,False,Not Recommended,Before going further let me inject a little clarification.PUBG can be extremely fun. Obviously it's much more fun with friends but even solo can be immense fun. However this game is probably the best example of a love/hate relationship as can possibly be. Below is my cynical take on the game and what frustrates me the most.Let me give you an accurate portrayal of the PUBG experience.Be in pre game lobby hear prerecorded asian messages played over and over on voice chat drowning out any actual helpful or enjoyable conversations.Be on plane waiting to drop hear top 1990's pop songs being played at maximum volume.Drop onto a roof. Directly on top of a roof. For some reason the game throws you the off the roof and lands you on the side of the building with no door cutting your time to find a weapon down by about 10 seconds.See stash with ammo and a weapon. See enemy player in same room. Rush the weapon stash. Immediately start looting. For some reason the game prioritizes ammo pickups before weapons. Acquire 750 rounds of 55.6 before the game finally realizes you might need a weapon. Finally gives you the weapon. Start loading enemy kills you.Join another lobby. More asian t. You double check the server your on and confirm you are infact on a north american server that's flooded with people that don't speak any english playing a team based game that revolves around communication.Drop from airplane again. Find gun load it sucessfully. Find more gear. So far so good. Find a motorcycle. Start driving. Oh no a pebble in the middle of the road blocks your path. Your motorcycle instantly stops like the hand of god blitch slapped it's and you fly over the handlebars at lightspeed. Die instantly.Join another lobby. Drop from plane. Acquire mad lootz. Make it all the way to the last 10 people standing. You take one or two out now it's just you and one other person. Last enemy suddenly starts spinning around like an ice skater in the olympics and lands 3 direct headshots with a revolver.Congrats you just spent $30 on a broken game from a company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars and locked cosmetics behind an RNG paywall as well as an extra season pass they charge for.TL DR Game at it's core is fun playing with friends can be epic but the thousands of bugs that are still present the lack of a reigon lock and the rampant cheaters murder any kind of fun you almost start to have.EDIT They have removed 2/3rds of all guns in the battle royale modes. Search 20 houses just to get a single gun and maybe 30 rounds of ammo. Meanwhile Sanhok is so populated with guns you get 5 guns and 500 rounds of ammo from each tiny village. Go figure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All of this and they've just announced a 3rd map? how about making the game playable first?Can't recommend in the current state. Solid 2/10.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-04,0,0,1077,False,Not Recommended,"I can't speak for other game modes or elos but as a top 1000 player in TPP (third person perspective) the game is quite unplayable currently. If you make it into the final ten players in this game mode and elo the chance of running into a cheater is incredibly high.I can appreciate the difficulty of catching cheaters. I can. What I can't appreciate though is Brendan Greene's (PLAYERUNKNOWN's) refusual to institute a region lock in the game. There are so many reasons why this should be done none of which have anything to do with the nonsensical ""xenophobic"" accusation he threw out recently. Here are the two best reasons 1. Cheaters. I don't care to delve into hypothesizing why the following information is the case I'm just going to lay it out of all the obvious aimbotters/wallhackers I've identified thanks to the game's replay system (I'd guess at least 15 20 at this point possibly more) I can't recall a single one having a name which I would consider to be of a Western nature. Also every time I checked the stats of a cheater I encountered on op.gg or a similar site I discovered that they played the majority of their games on the Asia server. These facts along with the fact that everyone else who is talking about encountering cheaters has mentioned them being Chinese leads me to believe that the overwhelming majority of cheaters in this game are from China. I don't care why this is the case all I know is that this is indeed the case.If you can't stamp out cheaters which as I said is a task I can appreciate the difficulty of you can at least contain 90% of them to one region by instituting a region lock which is well within your capacity. And judging by the experience I and countless other people have had in the past few weeks this would make a monumental difference in our ability to enjoy the game. We're talking about millions upon millions of players having a much more enjoyable game experience instantly with one simple change.2. The lower the average ping is in the game the more enjoyable the game is for more people. If half of the 100 players in the game have 300ms because they're in China and playing on the NA server that drastically increases the odds of you experiencing something which feels absolutely terrible and ruins your enjoyment of the game. I'm talking about things like getting hit by bullets well after you've gotten behind cover getting hit by someone well before they have even peaked on your screen players warping etc. It is important to point out that in many cases these people are playing on far away servers in order to deliberately take advantage of the aforementioned unfair edges which a high ping grants in this game.I'll update my review if the problem is resolved but currently this issue is making it impossible to enjoy the game at high elo.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'd rather have 15fps and take 5 minutes to load in than be insta killed by a hacker after 10 minutes of looting. At this point this game shouldn't be deciding between hackers and performance. Another giant issue I have is you can't pick which crates you get.

2018-07-10,0,0,701,False,Not Recommended,"Playing from South Africa where connection is an issue due to distance this game is the worse by far PUBG only benefits those with extremly good luck and a spot on connection that live near the servers that will allow for a low ping. Lag and desync is a MASSIVE let down your targets are always 2 3 second a head of you making it impossible to get the drop on someone even with their back turned CQB is null n void too. Hackers and Players ""teaming "" on all forms of play are a big part of this game. Pubg does show promise if they can polish the main issue that they seem to not be bothered with at all. I would Recommend this to people if a ZA server was set it the fanbase/ surport is big in Africa but so far for a ZA Players its been a Salt Mine 24/7 with constant let down. everything that can co wrong will go wrong all due to lag. things taking way to long to render in. Good example is from my side is landing in an area with 1 other player Ill run threw 3 buildings looking for a weapon and the weapons still have not rendered in while my enemy is fully gear in 30 seconds flat. Or running around a corner for cover and still dying with one shot 2 seconds later after you closed the door you still die. Orbeing behind solid cover and the other players driving into the wall and still killing you. ( the hit box is HUGE for some reason.Or Getting the drop on someone taking your time to make your shots count you get a good grouping of 3 to 5 rounds center mass. you see blood but you still die with one shot to the head after your targets does a 180 spin ADS leans with Q/E ( somehow that incressses accuracy and reduces recoil for them? ) But... after you watch the death cam from your targets point of view I didnt let off one round at all. that is pretty much Pubg for me in 341 hours of game play. so if you got the slightest lag prep yourself for some pain.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-27,0,0,612,False,Not Recommended,This game started out as being fun and I have played it for many hours with friends and reluctantly still do as it's still their prefered choice despite its many flaws. However I have grown tired of the lack of optimisations and just plain mistakes the developers appear to make. I am fed up of cheaters and at times just cannot tell is someone is cheating or if its due to the game's poor netcodes where for example I get killed behind cover my end and game cam shows me out in the open is it poor hit detection syncronisation optimisation server issues? I just don't know as I am no expert but I know this is the only game I appear to play inconsistently in. It bugs me when I get killed by other players consistently taking shots at me in a leaned postiion even out in the open and then discovered it's another failed implementation on the part of the developers where leaning gives a player advantages from lack of bullet penetration might as well paint an invisble level 4 vest on it. Then comes the lack of options why so long in map selection for example which is borked (one option is split between two maps at present call that map selection?). I'd like to see game options e.g. selecting servers with a pistol load out when you drop might no be to everyone's taste but that's the point of having selectable options but unless you're some youtuber similar options are just only for a special previliedged few. It would be nice to selct options for event modes instead of having to play them only when the developer allows it. Then comes the QBZ which appears to be the weapon of choice. They have messed about with the weapon tuning so much that unless you get one of the flavours of the month the recoil or just plain poor handling leaves you up the creek without a paddle though the single shot Kar98 knockdown or kill even with a level 3 helmet leaves me puzzled as I have never accomplished this but only with a m24 and I don't think they were wearing level 3 helmets. I have loads of unspent BP because crates are locked behind keys you need to purchase and what's this event pass charging? This is no free to play game and I paid up front. It would be nice for the developers to focus on getting the game properly optimised instead of money grabbing. What started out as a fun game hoping it would improve with updates has remained poor and just appears to evolve into how can we make more money. I cannot wait for something better to come along so my friends will move off this game. The other cartoon alternative I shall not mention does not appeal to me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-14,0,0,55,True,Recommended,Its early access but its not too bad at the moment. There is some basic stuff missing (like a way to adjust voice chat volume) the server connection can pretty janky at times and its a bit of a one trick pony with just a single mode split into 3 different team sizes.But I am happy with it and looking forward to seeing where it goes. Guns are powerful and fairly easy to find but there with the different types (pistols automatics shotguns) and helmets/armor you can still find yourself feeling vulnerable and wanting to look for more gear even after you loot a couple houses. When you can easily go 10 min without actually seeing another player Its great at building tension as you hear footsteps nearby that are not your own and you got to decide whether to hunt them down or wait for them to pass (or come to you). As far as winning is concerned you won't do it often. Like *very* rarely will you win. Hell your odds are so slim you'll probably around until there is only 50 of the 100 starting players left then you'll start paying attention. Then it will get down to 25 and you'll start feeling some pressure. 15 10 people left and the tension really racks up as the zone at this point is very small and buildings are most likely extremely limited sometimes not even having any. Less than 10 people left and you lock it down as your palms sweat and every decision carries tremendous weight. Then you get down to 7 then 4 then it is just you and one other guy. And if you pull off that final kill it is *exhilarating*. I really have never been done so much fist pumping and cheering for a win as I did when I got my first solo win. I may as well have won the world championship for how it felt.Overall its kinda bare bones but there is still a core concept that works very well and it enjoyable on its own. It should only improve as additions are made.8/8/2017 Update Basic third person mode is still good. An additional first person mode only was added. Nice addition with a slightly different playstyle but for whatever reason runs quite poorly. Where the base mode I would get only 2 3 FPS drops during a match where it would go from 60 fps to maybe 35 fps I get drops to 35 FPS every couple of minutes drops to 10 FPS or less every 6 7 minutes and at least once a match will just freeze for full couple of seconds. Its a good idea for another mode but it REALLY shows that it is early access in this mode. Overall still recommend game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sure it has its downfalls with the slowness and the server problems and the hackers but the game itself at its core is a great concept executed rather well. As opposed to Fortnite which focuses on fast paced heavily cartoony gameplay PUBG has a more slow paced realistic feel. Both games definitely have their draws but I feel PUBG is worth the money over the free Fortnite for a few reasons.1. The gameplay As I said the PUBG gameplay tends to be slower and a little lessaction packed than Fortnite which I believe works in its favour. Without the ability to build and alter the world with an overpowered god tool like the pickaxe PUBG makes players rely more heavily on their quick thinking and knowledge in regards to the existing world. This makes gameplay more challenging and more exhilerhating and far more fulfilling when you overcome any disadvantage you may have with nothing but your pure skill as a player (okay maybe there is some luck involved too). Also the inclusion of a first person perspective mode is seriously a huge merit to PUBG.2. The Playerbase Being a free and easy to run game Fortnite attracts a lot of people who could otherwise not afford a game or a better computer this demographic includes a healthy serving of children. The stereotypical Fortnite player is an early teenage boy with a bad mouth and a tendency to sleep with the mothers of his opponent. This is NOT the only type of people that play the game though there are still people that play it because they prefer it or for other maybe monetary reasons. I'm just saying that this is the core demographic. If you have a group of friends to play with and keep in game chat off it can be no different that PUBG.3. The Weapons Having the ability to modify weapons with attachments really does add to the game immensely. Not only this but also the vast variety of weapons helps make the game more varied and give the player more choice in regards to their style of play.Now it may seem like I'm blindly in love with PUBG and just a Fortnite hater or something I can assure you this isn't the case. Fortnite 100% has its merits it runs better it has better and more consistent servers and the devs aren't as dumb (seriously don't sue the company which develops the engine your game runs on) and depending on your preference it has better gameplay (if you'r eimpatient or just like to shoot a lot of things very quickly Fortnite is definitely a better suit for you). Fortnite also has much less of a problem with hackers. Now that we're done with the comparison let's get in to pros and cons.Pros Weapons high variety and customizability makes for better gameplay. FPP first person perspective is a much more intense and fun experience. Realism while maybe not the most realistic the grittiness and somewhat realistic gunplay definitely adds to the experience. Updates as a game with active developers PUBG is constantly getting new content and bugfixes and whatnot completely free. General Gameplay you are lying if you've played PUBG and say you have not felt at some point tense with adrenaline pumping through you as you lie in the grass with 3 players left. This intensity of play that is delivered by the game's core mechanics is unrivaled by any other game I've played.Cons Hackers hackers ruin the experience of this game when you encounter them. It is awful to play a half hour round only to be headshot by a guy facing the other direction on the other side of a building clipping underground running at the speed of sound. PUBG Corp has done very little to combat these issues (the 20MB patches aren't helping a whole lot). Crates If I'm paying $30 for a game I expect to not have to pay anything else. I should be entitled to my in game cosmetics without having to pay 3 dollars for a key to unlock a crate. It's stupid. To add insult to injury PUBG Corp is adding more and more exclusive cosmetic items in more and more paid for crates. Please stop this. Servers The PUBG servers are notoriously bad. They go down more than a cheap hooker on a friday and even when they are up they run worse than a one legged race horse. Optimization The performance has definitely gotten better but on my mid high end PC I still have to run the game at very low (except for textures and AA) to have an acceptable experiece. (constant 60+. Anything higher I get 60+ most of the time with major drops when it matters in a gunfight or while driving)If the devs fix these problems this game will go down in history as one of the best ever. But even now the game is definitely worth playing. Some of the problems such as cosmetics are easy to ignore and the others don't pop up often enough to completely destroy the experience. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience that at the moment is unrivaled then PUBG is for you. It is especially fun when enjoyed with friends or so I've heard.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-31,1,1,1343,False,Recommended,This is the best game I've bought. The gameplay is immersive and realistic from the environment to the effects all the way to combat Dynamics. It's the best battle Royale I've ever come across putting fortnite to shame as a cartoon sci fi childs game with all that immediate building and kiddish graphics. PubG will lend you many hours of enjoyment with Friends as you try to survive till the end. Don't get caught by the blue wall of death when the zone shrinks though! Yes there are a few hackers but the developers have been very good at minimizing and banning the ones that have been identified. I rarely come across one now. And yes the game still needs a region lock implemented so that we don't have to deal with Chinese in the North American servers.... Otherwise this is the best game for your money right now and will definitely not disappoint!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-15,0,0,186,False,Not Recommended,This game used to be really great. However you can't play the single player mode anymore without running into cheaters. Lots of them. I cannot suggest this game to anyone until there are region locks and other factors.Unfortunately this has become a cash cow for the owners because the cheaters get banned and simply purchase another copy of the game and start the cycle over. This keeps a continual revenue stream for the developer. Since they can't cop to that the president pretty much said anyone who believes that region locking should be applied is a racist despite being legitimae lag concerns as well as other benefits. Anyways this game was good once. Maybe when the hype dies down I'll be able to play it again. Im not overly hopeful though.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-11-10,1,1,657,True,Not Recommended,When this game came out it had many enjoyable aspects the size of the map random placement of equipment and vehicle the random flight paths and the random finishing location meant no two games would be exactly alike. Unfortunate in recent days the hacking has gotten completely out of hand. In our last match my teammate and I saw several consecutive players taken out by crossbow headshots in a near rapid succession while on a fog map. Then when it was only our team and theirs remaining my teammate and nearly myself as the bolt hit the other side of the wall where my head should have been was quickly dispatched in a similar fashion. It was obvious that we were way out of visual range as I watched them slowly come into view as they came to eliminate me as well. This was not our only experience with hackers in the past few days but as far as this game goes it will likely be our last.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-23,0,0,131,False,Not Recommended,Updated Review (June 25th) Here's the deal this game was a gem when it first came out. Now it's an unoptimized clunky mess. The real deal breaker comes from the cosmetic system. It's using the stupid CS GO crate+key system. Not to mention a battle pass ripped from Fortnite Bluehole is suing Fortnite btw and a whole mess of microtransaction cosmetics. Fortnite has more obtainable and transparent cosmetics than PUBG. This game used to be great now it's just an opportunity for the Korean devs to get as much money as they can milk before the game dies. If they remove the key+crate system make the game less clunky and stop with the t 10$ for two skins mess then I might change the review. Recommendation Stay away and play either Fortnite or Realm Royale. If you still want PUBG I highly recommend the mobile PUBG version. Easier to get cosmetics daily quests more gamemodes more fluid controls (Yes the phone has better controls + customization). Just heck this game for now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-17,0,0,30,False,Not Recommended,I've been playing PUBG while in Early Access for a few months and now that it's in full release I feel I can write a proper review of the game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a Battle Royale Style Third Person Shooter (Though there IS a First Person mode). Battle Royale Style basically means you're plopped onto a giant map with roughly 94 97 other players with no equipment you have to scavenge for weapons armor and healing items in order to try and survive. You only have one life no respawns and whoever is the last man standing wins. Simple.But therein lies the problem it's last man standing style gameplay and once you're dead you're dead you have to find a new server and start over from the beginning. This is a style I don't find particularly fun and it's a style that's hard to get good at. If you're not a FPS/TPS savant already then you're not really going to have a lot of fun for probably the first 50 100 hours. And if you aren't willing to dedicate a majority of your time into learning the fine details of the game's mechanics then you're never going to get good.The main flaw of PUBG and other Battle Royale Style games is this You can essentially hide in a corner for 99% of the game and win. You can also run around the map only to get picked off by a sniper 30 seconds in. Now of course these games have a gimmick wherein the map becomes increasingly blocked off by something. (In PUBG's case it's a blue forcefield) Constantly limiting your play area and forcing you to move but if you can stay inside the circle and keep hiding staying out of sight then you can end up in the top 5 constantly (And I have by doing just this.)Now PUBG comes with two maps An island map full of foliage and ruins. And a desert map which was released with the 1.0 retail release of the game. The island map has been in the game since the beginning and was a pretty decent map to play on you had plenty of camoflauge and areas to hide from enemies in.The desert map not at all it's large spaces of open area no camoflauge and is basically free reign for anyone with a Kar98 and a 4x scope to pick off other players like fish in a barrel. It's not fun to play at all. But the worst part is that it seems to be the only map in rotation. I played 5 matches and they all came up with the desert map. And all but two times I got picked off while trying to get to a safe zone. Fun times.This wouldn't be a problem if the game actually gave you some indication of where you're getting shot from. No indication means you have no chance to even attempt to hide or fight back. (And before you tell me that the sound of the gunshot is the indication I have surround sound headphones and it's still often hard to determine where shots came from.)So really I find myself getting bored of PUBG after 2 or 3 rounds because it just stops being fun when you spend all this time collecting and gathering equipment and you just get picked off from 500 meters away and then you have to go back to a menu matchmake again and start all over.Now one of the things PUBG was infamous for was it's optimization and while I can't speak for high end users the 1.0 update seems to run much better than it did in Early Access. But I also run the game on low at 720p. So maybe it's just me. But I don't notice the framerate stuttering and drops I used to back in EA. Plus the infamous texture bug is fixed too which is really nice. 1.0 also added the ability to vault over things which makes moving around a hell of a lot easier but the detection is wonky sometimes you just end up hopping in place a couple of times before the game detects there is a wall you can vault and actually vaults over it.In conclusion Should you buy PUBG? Depends. Does the concept of running around collecting equipment for a 1 in 100 chance at winning sound fun to you? If yes then buy it if no then don't. Trust me this Battle Royale stuff is NOT for everyone. Which is why I'm not recommending this game. It is obstensibly not for me I prefer deathmatches when I can at least have a second go if I get killed. But hey I can see why this game appeals to people it's a concept that sounds amazing on paper.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-25,0,0,168,False,Not Recommended,"It had potential for so much more content but if you even try to add in RPG's now or grenade launchers Fortnite players would immediately call you out for it. Every game just feels the same and it does get tedious at times. I bought this game shortly after early access and it was fun for a month or two then I neglected it for a couple of weeks. The performance issues of the game is not in good shape. Other reviews could tell you that. But I'm writing this because the game starts to feel more empty everytime I play a few matches. The events are pretty cool and I do like them but there should be more content such as weapons special weapons special vehicles (like the armored truck but something with a turret or like a secret agent vehicle gadget) and smaller maps. Regarding maps I feel like implementing bigger maps isn't necessary anymore. Landing on the outer edges could give good loot but it's the low risk that makes it well boring. I usually land near the center or in Miramar Los Leones and Erangel Military Base but that's because they are popular areas. Those two maps are big and I dont know if it is intented for players not to land near the outer areas but most outer areas are ghost towns with about 1 3 players. Something like Sanhok was a great idea but I hope for future levels the map size is smaller something like 6x6 km. Then in the 8x8 km add more action giving content to make it less empty. Sanhok's size already gets me scared wherever I journey to and that is good. But in Miramar and Erangel it really is just a run and watching simulator. Maybe multiple redzones could be neat just to make it on edge when trying to enter the safe zone. That's just one thing and I don't have any good ideas and it'd be cool to let you guys do that.*Just to explain the events when I do land in populated areas sometimes I don't land there because of lag and frame drops. I mostly drop there just for action or warming up.*Once more action content is added then the name ""Battlegrounds"" will truly take its role.

Cheating didnt really get bad until the end of the year.

Graphics are very good but could use some optimization in some aspects like trees and their hitboxes. Gameplay is good but could be greatly improved more servers for different regions ( I keep gettings people from Africa and I am EU ) latency check and hitbox fix are urgent vehicle bugs fix ( random flips jumps crashes into nothing 30% of the time) weapon fix and little more balance ( double barrel shotgun doesn't reload if the animation isn't 100% done even if you inserted bullets and closed it but didn't wait additional 0.1 sec for it to finish before swapping to your other weapon). Game as of now has huge problem with loot boxes why do I need to pay real money to unlock it if I paid 30 for the game and paid in game curency for the box you tell me I need to pay $2.50 dollars for the key? Get the f*** out of here! Random connections drops are terrible it often lags you get hit in the head AFTER you dodged it behind a tree and heard a shot 0.5 sec later ( have video proof). Zone location is completely random ( not good because it doesn't take into accound where most people are and some litterally run for 20 minutes chasing the zone just to die from a sniper while they enter the zone in a last second because it was far away and they are very visible because of running). Force everyone to have grass ON because sniping over 100m you can see everyone on the ground if your foliage setting is low even though they think that they are hidden in the grass sucks ). There are plenty of stuff that are good but there is a ton of bugs that aren't getting fixed.... I like this game and play it still but for how long I don't know because it is 70% luck if you win or not. I have video of a game where my team landed in Camp Alpha got good loot then tried going out into the world to fight only to see that zone is coming to us. Final circle ended literally on Camp Alpha we were on roofs with full loot and hp while watching Player Counter going down lower and lower. In the end there were 6 players left 4 of us and 2 enemies. We saw them running to final circle over the hill sniped them easily and without any problem and won the chicked dinner. MOST BORING GAME EVER!!! Win was undeserved and I didn't feel any joy. This was all recorded and will be put on YouTube on my channel with the same name. Do I recommend it in this state yes and no yes if you are willing to wait and hope they fix things and no in the current state that it is you can play it and SOMETIMES it's fun but usually it isn't it's a gamble about anything and winning doesn't go to the most skilled but to luckiest.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-31,0,0,1008,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Update I still play this game a lot but it is definitely not worth $30 with the vast amount of cheaters there are. The developer decided to go with BattlEye for their anti cheat software and it is simply the worst anti cheat program I've ever seen. Unless you're terrible at this game (low mmr) then you will see a cheater in every single match you play. Of course they're still chinese. Aimbots and no recoil cheats are the most prevelant right now but there have been wallhacks in the last month.If you're a glutton for punishment like I am then get this game somewhere where you can get it for cheaper than the asking price here. If you don't feel like dealing with cheaters while you try to enjoy your game then hard pass this. It is cheat central.Original Review Alright game for being in alpha. Lots of graphical pop in and it looks like something from the 90's even on ULTRA settings. Players can turn down graphical settings to gain an advantage while playing which shouldn't even be a thing. LOTS OF CHEATERS MOST FROM CHINA. This game seriously suffers from non stop cheaters. Speed hacks aimbots wall hacks etcetera. Luckily China's government is talking about banning PUBG so we should see a drastic drop in cheaters across all servers.I recommend this game only on the caveat that you're okay with losing a lot because of cheaters. Otherwise it can be an enjoyable experience.My friend bought me the game. That's why I marked it as got it for free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I think it s sad that it has so bad ratings and I honestly don t see why it does.I mean you have to look at the game as a whole not give it a bad rating after trying to challenge an M249 with your tommy gun.

Very unrewarding and often makes me feel like ive wasted time when playing. You run around scavenging for ten minutes then die or die almost right after landing by a punch to the face while you had shot the person 4 times point blank with a pistol. Outside of games there is no reward system. In game points you get give you lootbox that contains very bland cosmetic items. Imagine if in overwatch there was weekly loot box and everytime you earned a box it got progressively harder to obtain the next until the week was done and the rarity of the items never changed.

The worst part right now is that even though you are on a North American server you get paired with full asian squads that don't speak a lick of English. This makes communication die and ultimately they either kill you or you end up playing solo. Edit While the asian presence has lessened greatly there is still a huge issue with hacking Aimbots recoil nulls GPS bullet hacks speedy run super jump etc.Even though there have been attempts to cull hackers they always find a work around winthin a week and they come back.

However if you shift your perspective a little bit you can definitely see why the price is what it is. You start playing solo and you immediately get pulled into this battle royale experience one in which you are eager to reign supreme. So you play this game for hours and hours and hours until you gain experience and improve as a player. Eventually you get your first ""chicken dinner"" as we all call it and that moment feels so accomplishing and relieving. You feel as if you are supposed to stop playing the game because of this satisfaction but no. Instead you feel like going for ANOTHER win and you keep going and going. There is no stop. And then you bring in friends with you which opens the door to so many more opportunities in this game. You also meet new people and get to know them better in a sense as to how they think and operate inside their brain. Countless memories are created with these friends as there is so much you can do with them. For example you can do different challenges or you could go even crazier and do bike stunts in game only to find that you crash and die in the most hilarious way possible!

2017-09-06,0,0,772,False,Not Recommended,"While the game remains fun and very competitive the entire experience is hobbled by HUGE influxes of cheaters/hackers to the point where it's basically unplayable. I understand that it's impossible to rid any game of all hackers and that there's no way to prevent people who want to cheat to win instead of play the game properly. But holy crap when 80% 90% of your games end in a hacker shooting you things are just getting embarrassing. Not only do tens of thousands of people brazenly use aim locking and recoil disabling cheats very liberally with seemingly no punishment whatsoever but the more prevalent form of cheating wall hacks where people can literally see your name and location in game at any time without line of site is not even policed at all by the reporting system in the game. Want to survive in a game? Better hope the person who you're about to fight doesn't have X ray vision and knows your exact location at all times. I feel a lot of people could simply brush off a negative review as ""Oh they just got salty it's not that big of a deal."" But as someone with dozens of wins in the game I'm fine with a loss if the fight that made me lose was fair and competitive. Lately the majority of the matches I play are NOT competitive because it is essentially a coin flip whether any player I encounter has inherent advantages through third party utilities. On top of the pointless updates to the game 6 8 times per day and zero commitment in the past 5 months to do ANYTHING about the massive cheating problem except insistence that ""anti cheat is in the works "" there is no way I can recommend this game anymore. Which is a shame because this was my zone out stress reliever game. Maybe if they make meaningful choices that actually deal with hacking/cheating or release an actual functional anti cheat system that isn't just a promise on a test server I could be lured back. But as so many new games are reiterating the ideas PUBG presented in more unique and interesting ways PUBG has become a hopeless cause.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

BUT as much as I hate this game I still play it and still enjoy it. There is alot of potential in this game and now that fortnite and other battle royale game are getting attention it has gave the developers some motivation to start improving the game with patches and new content so hopefully it continues to improve over time and turn into the game we all want.

You actually have to try REALLY hard to make the Unreal Engine perform this bad. If it wasn't for the fact that there is no other Battle Royale game that plays all tacti cool like this game does this game would be mocked as another Early Access catastrophe. There will be die hard fans of this game that will defend it to the death even though Bluehole has never really been a good developer to begin with.

2018-06-22,0,0,756,False,Not Recommended,Alright I know this is a bit late with this. However I have over 600 hours in this game thats right Six Hundred. I have been playing since about a week after early accsess dropped. Ive been through the glitches and the pre Monetisation. This game in short is fun in spurts. With every patch and update something seems to be geting worse about it. Wanted to get a crate that is free to open you have a 10% chance each week. There is no bad luck safety block on this either so you can end up spending all your BP and not get a single crate that is free to open. Then there is the BP earning and spending. Only thing to do that seems to be a sense of progression is getting BP for placeing high or wining plus getting kills also vets you a small amount of BP. If you win you get a bigger chunk. But even with a win most of the time your not going to get much more then 800 BP. Which is enough for the first box of the week thats it. The earning of this in game currency needs work. It needs balanced. With the most recent patch i see more and more availability for a mission system and lvling up your account. Although there is a catch you have to pay to unlock more missions and to unlock specail stuff. In most cases this would not bother me. However you get to do 3 missions a day for very little xp towards your lvl if you do not want to pay. This is PUBG trying to get the most out of their dieing player base. Player Unknown himself has unfortunetly lost his connection with his players and his audience of gamers. Your streamers are only a small amount of people that play your game sir. So please get back to your roots and offer a better option to those who do not want to pay to have the ability to customize a bit more. You wonder why the PUBG steam market place is flooded with hoodies and rare items that people are selling because its so rare that a normal player isnt getting them or if they do they know its big money. Your streamers that you pay to keep eyes on your game are even shifting away slowly. Pay is a strong verbage. You give free gifts and such to entise the gamer to keep streaming your game. However I digress. Besides my Hatered for pay to enjoy games and such this game has been going down hill. The amount of hackers that PUBG themselves have admitted play the game alone should be alarming. If you do not have a strong connection kiss early game goodbye. Things in this game simply need to get tightened up. Enjoy at your own risk. I will continue to play now and then if my friends are on and we want to go do somthing but other than that i refuse to play alone on this game now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-30,1,1,392,False,Recommended,PUBG may have some flaws but the good stuff about it makes them insvisible. It's an amazing game and have tons of future potentiality they can make it even bigger and better. It's amazing to play alone and with friends but i do recommend playing with a friend or a few friends for the best experience. I used to play on a really bad computer with 30 40 fps on very low and 1680x1200 (Normal res is 1920x1080 on my screen) and i still had an amazing time. Now i bought a new computer and play on pretty much max settings or atleast i can but i dont really do that cause it has pretty much 0 visable difference between some settings. But before full game realese PUBG 1.0 i had max 90 100 fps mostly 60 80 sometimes even 40 and this is with a 1070 and I5 7600K and now after realese i have above 100 fps on better settings then i had before so its alot better now a days and is constantly updated so i recommend PUBG. 10/10 Most Fun Game of the year nerv racking and intense the way i like it ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-20,0,0,89,False,Recommended,"I'm very torn when it comes to PUBG on one hand it is a super fun if poorly optimized game. On the other hand I have some big problems regarding recent changes. It feels like with the rise of Fortnite the developers tried to turn the game into a version of Fortnite PUBG is not Fortnite and it should not try to be. Emotes? No thanks. Event Pass? No. AND if they insist on doing event passes they SHOULD NOT make the free leveling rewards leave players inventory's after 30 days people have put time into getting these they should keep them. I really wish Steam had a middle ground rating because that's what I want to give it.Gameplay Fun enough more realistic than other BR games.Performance Servers are... Meh at best not the worst I've ever played on but for having only official servers I would expect more.quite possibly my biggest issue with the game is the fact that I have everything on low and can't even hit my monitor's native refresh rate and before you ask yes I do meet in fact exceed the recommended spec. Would I recommend? Again I wish I could give an ""ok"" but since I can't I'll have to recommend it. I have had a lot of fun with friends.Overall 8.5/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-26,0,0,380,True,Recommended,A great game combat feels good seems the devs have traded out having hitmarks for blood spraying. It's not a bad change it's just kind of confusing sometimes to know if you sniped someone or not. I don't over estimate bullet drop and after you learn the map it doesn't seem that big. All around great game there are only 2 things I dont like. The game always has lag when in the plane and randomly has lag spikes. It still runs good on a 1050 ti just the rendering is a little slow. The last problem is the iron sights on guns. If you don't have a scope or red dot might as well shoot in 3rd person.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-17,2,1,315,False,Recommended,I would recommend this game but I don't want my friends to want to kill themselves after playing like I do. It's definitely fun however as I said I want to kill myself after playing it. This game is like having a beautiful child born to you only for it to be killed on it's 4th birthday. You're not mad that it happened but you still feel like shooting yourself in the head when you realize how much the developers are on this game. The premise is great but the absolute garbage servers and amount of purely that happens is ridiculous. I've started to not even get triggered when some laying down in a random field kills me because it saves me the trouble of killing myself because the game makes me feel so dead inside. There is a special kind of sadness that this game can bring you spending 20 minutes looting an entire village to not only get the worlds worst loot (some gas cans and a pan) only to run into aforementioned sitting down in a field and kill you. Boom 20 minutes wasted. But worry not because the ingenius developers realize that to make this game bearable the user must sit through 2 3 minutes of lobby time just to get into a new game and playing again. During this time I recommend that you think of the most efficient ways to kill yourself after your disappointing loss. I spend hours on this game the one thing I can look forward to is maybe just maybe getting some fun item in a loot crate. I use my HARD EARNED resources on a loot crate only to find out to open this god damn loot crate I need to pay for a mother ing key. I can only assume this process is to provide the player with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I truly do not understand 2 things about microtransactions in this game. Who the wants to buy for this AIDS game? AND why the hell do the developers think they need to put in microtransactions before fixing things like severe lag (it has gotten better I suppose) terrible hit registration and plenty of other glitches and problems. Instead they add ing microtransactions. Also I don't understand their developer decision from a financial standpoint why you would want to spend money on having some cool coat when you can just find a lot of them on the ground in the map anyways? Why are they even on the ground?? Probably makes the game run even more like dog with having all these random cosmetics EVERYWHERE.It's unfortunate this developer was the lucky one that popularized the genre. Overall it's still fun the game just makes you want to die. I wouldn't recommend this game if you're depressed because you may just end it all after playing it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-11,1,1,825,True,Recommended,I like this game it's gameplay is like a simpler Arma (my opinion) but it is great. It is fun to have this anxiety over you as you never know if you get shot in the back by someone you did not know was there aswell as the adrenaline building up as you reach the final 10 last players. If you got friends this game gets even better as you got the possibility too 1. Use them as cannon fodder as the idiots they are WHY DO YOU RUN INTO THE OPEN !!!!. 2. Make them pick up the stuff you want because YOU ARE 10 x BETTER THAN YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW IT!!!. 3. Pick up their supplies because they died as 4. I heard that they sometimes do see other players and can give information have yet to test this outIt is an Early Access game and you can feel it will it be released? Devs say so it is yet too see as most of us have experienced the bad parts of Steam Early Access. But for slightly less than 30 euroes (Atleast in my currency) i think it is worth it based on the fun i have. I use a gtx 970 but as far as i have learned the game is a lot more CPU heavy in this stage due to it not being optimized as far as i know (might be wrong) games tend to lean heavily on the CPU until they optimize it too render more on the GPU do check out guides on improving your framerate and similar as i have experienced that can be quite gamechanging. I do though think that this game can prove too be a lot of fun once it is fully optimized and lead too some fun ways too improve your teamplay or prepare you for Arma if you want too try something with similar yet more casual gameplay. Will update once it is released fully.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-30,0,0,103,True,Recommended,Summed upPros Good gunplay. Frequent patches in early access. Cool map. Very exciting and thrilling. Matches start very fast. Many scopes and attachments (though attachments are kind of meaningless because you are gonna use them like every time).Cons Desync. Bugs (early access still though so). RNG not that strategic zone moves quickly and forces you to take bad routes with no cover. I wish the matches would be a little longer so I had time to play in cover and choose tactically. It's really the battle royale genre though.Conclusion Fun game best with friends in squad mode. Has problems and it also has the RNG factor.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,210,True,Recommended,This game provides a myriad of emotions from me. Elation happiness giddiness as well as anger hurt resentment and hatred. This is by far one of the best last man to survive/team games ever made. The atmosphere is incredible. Decent graphics coupled with hilarious glitches at times makes it a fun time for days. If you can stand the still in development combat/animations/textures etc then this game is definitely something you should pick up. Especially for the CO OP aspect and SQUAD aspect. Without a doubt the loot will frustrate you the players will frustrate you the circle will frustrate you but at the end of the day you will have a ton of fun just ploughing away at people less fortunate then you in regards to the above mentionables. What this game truly suffers from is bad servers bad hit registration at times terrible loot chance and some underhanded tactics with graphics. They supposebly patched the ability to edit out foilage from the ini.file. However there is a noticeable effect when putting your graphcis settings on low that foilage DOES NOT LOAD after a certain amount of meters distance. What does that mean for you? THAT MEANS if you are in tall grass or wheat fields etc etc the foilage will not load for the person shooting you X amount of meters away. So you are COMPLETELY visible. Fundamentally this changes the entire early mid game because people are far away when you see them usually and if you are trying to hide in grass to escape or just survive you will die simply because they see you but you don't see them. This does not take affect late game because at that point everyone is within the X amount of meters and all the grass and such loads for everyone. UNLESS they are hacking of course which of course there are hackers out there rare though they are. My second complaint/suggestion would be ENFORCED first person when inside a building. There's some truly horrible peaking around the corner action going on when in third person and it completely screws the individual who has superior position. One of the problems with third person is you are able to line up your gun on a target from behind a corner and come out shooting before you even round the corner. Thereby already hitting your target the split second you can and HE/SHE can't even react because they are already dead. Granted there is the off chance they anticipate you coming and just start shooting but more often than not that is not the case.I doubt this will ever be implemented of course and our only hope is FPS enforced custom servers at some point after full release. If they ever fix some of these issues this game will be a 10/10 from me. It truly is one of the best already from this niche of a genre and should they fix it it will be perfect. As of right now 6/10. Truly fun to play but without a doubt frustrating beyond all means in certain circumstances.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Still no option to play custom games to get a feel for shooting different weapons to test recoil. Always trying to get more money out of you by giving you crates that require keys to open. Took them over a year to fix simple bugs that ruin gameplay such as getting stuck while parachtuing teleporting randomly to another location on the map. and vehicles flipping or getting sent flying for no reason.

The plane also takes ten years to fly across the map which really sucks because by the time you get to where you want to land some one is already on the ground fully geared and all you can find is a pistol or a crowbar. The RNG in this game is complete garbage. Oh and you need two 1080TI's to run this game on high and to get 60+ FPS. The servers this game runs on are also garbage on your screen you shoot a guy 30 times on the his? you shot him once or twice.

I've been playing since shortly after it released and it's been fun to watch it improve. 1.0 is going to be great.EDIT Going to start off by saying that this game really captivated me and gave my friends and I a really great outlet to connect and have fun. I REALLY love this game at its core. However I can not accept the decision made by ""Blue Hole"" to lock loyal and paid players behind a paywall. It seems they jumped on the Fortnite bandwagon (albeit after an embarassing lawsuit attempt...) and are now charging in real time without any testing of viability the idea of paid content passes. You can flame me for saying such a thing but this is my view point.I supported this game from nearly day one. My friends shortly followed. We gave hundreds of hours of our time (AND ACTUALLY FILLED OUT BUG REPORTS) to improve this game. And in response the Devs/Company decided to paywall all of us on top of our current frustrations with a lack of real support. No compensation whatsoever. I applaud the Developers and this company as a whole for giving us many new weapons along this journey. The love is felt and it really did improve the game. It seems to just be a mask now though. A stale desert map and some clusterjunk island map will not justify a reason to pay for any sort of content pass when you STRICTLY engineer unlocks to only be accessed by paying a sum of money.It seems as though the only priority of this company is cash flow. Perhaps the original sales money of this game was squandered I really hope that changes before it's too late. This game set records. IT SET RECORDS all time records. The player drop off isn't because of Fortnight or any other BR games it is a result of the haphazard way in which the game is being dealt with. It's just my two cents. I love this game but it's in real trouble. The statistics all prove it. P.S. I didn't say anything abou tthe hacking it's prevalent and it ruins entire games.

2018-05-31,0,0,12,False,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Do you like chinese hackers running for hours only to get killed in 3 seconds playing with friends only to run or drive for long periods of time only to die by one squad who has been camping for 40 mins? Well this gamemode is for you (honestly a gamemode not even a full game).So I wanted to like this game but it's honestly bad. The maps are so large you will probably spend 80% of your gameplay running hoping to get in the circle. 15% of the time you are inside the circle so you are camping waiting to ambush other players running into the circle. And 5% of the time actually engaging in the circle. Unless you jump out and try and follow a group. Then you'll most likely engage 80% of the time and either you die quickly or end up repeating the previous process. That being said there is really no huge motivation for winning a game other than patting yourself on the back and getting a free tshirt the first time you win (in game). There are lootboxes which are pretty much their way of saying hey buy cosmetics or play for many many hours to unlock a free box. Beyond this there is no level progression or incentives to keep playing the same kind of game mode over and over. Ultimately you are paying for a single game mode with very limited number of maps (and while they are quite large they are pretty empty outside of settlements) no real progression or incentive to keep playing and you will be very bored very often if you are trying to win.I had a very boring and frustrating experience with this game please save your money for better games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-16,0,0,272,True,Recommended,"Having an absolute blast with this game almost 100 hours in with no plans of stopping why not write a review on why I love it?What is it? This is a Battle Royale game it's set up as a massive free for all and the last man standing wins. You're grouped up into a plane with around 100 other people and you choose where to parachute out and where to land proceeding to loot for weapons armour health and other items and then proceeding to hunt each other down. While this is going on throughout the game a circle will be making its way inwards which continues to get smaller being outside of this will cause you to take damage and eventually die the smaller it gets the more damage you take which is a great way of forcing confrontations preventing camping and generally bringing good balance to the game.The Positives Gameplay wise the movement and general controls are great and sensical with fully customizable keyboard and mouse bindings the gunplay is solid and you're able to switch at will between first and third person which is a much appreciated element. Guns sound as they should and the sound effects themselves are on par with a Battlefield game which is to say fantastic.The developers have done a great job at building upon elements of the game and taking feedback on board from what I've seen they're also due to incorporate vaulting over obstacles and climbing which I'm pretty excited about as this is definitely an area I feel would serve the game better.Weapon selection is nice and varied with new ones like the VSS which was added very recently and a new Assault Rifle that was just announced at E3 also joining the pack soon.The game offers a great layer of customisation in terms of appearance and while that doesn't matter to some people it always matters to me as I like to look to look a certain way. I'm definietly not indifferent towards this and it always helps to add replay value and provide incentives.The map is also massive and has a lot of variety in the buildings towns and locations we also have two more maps confirmed and coming which pleases me greatly!In terms of replay value and the progression system you earn points from games no matter what how many you earn depends on how well you do in a game generally and these can be spent on Supply Crates which offer a random customisation item for your character. They get more expensive as you buy more but the price resets to the basic price each Monday. It's a good system but the primary replayability comes from the game itself of course and the concept.I've had many hilarious and exciting heart pumping moments in this game and continue to have them there's such a variety of things that can happen in the game and it makes it all super addictive and super enjoyable.The Negatives The main problem for me at the moment is in terms of server lag and general lag at the start of matches which seems to be somewhat consistent. You will land on the ground and try to get into a house only to find you have to press ""F"" to open the door multiple times because your input won't register this happens consistently for me at the very start of matches and it can lead to frustration at times. (Their upcoming update is focused on server performance however which is awesome and will hopefully resolve this.)There's a few other bugs that can occur with physics and small miscallaneous things usually but generally speaking the devs have been doing a great job working on optimisation and sorting out these bugs. The last big patch was focused on optimisation and myself and friends have definitely seen improvements particularly a friend with an older GTX 770 the patch supposedly helped him a great deal.Enclosing Overall I'm having a fantastic time with this game it's made the most out of a fantastic concept and the formula is just on point. The developers are doing a solid job patching stuff up consistently and listening to player feedback sure you can have some potentially boring games where nothing eventful happens and you just get killed from someone you might not see but this unpredictability factor is one of the main draws to this game for me and it's something you don't see too much in many games nowadays I feel. The feeling you get when it's just you and one other person left alive in a tiny zone is a heart pounding feeling that I do not feel in many other games at all.Play it!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-25,0,0,230,False,Not Recommended,This game is fun I enjoy it immensely they update it frequently the gameplay is solid graphics are good etc.. however the problem is that you pay $30 for the game and you're punished for not paying more. I could understand battle pass style microtransactions for a game that's initially F2P but having bought the game and having to pay an additional $120 a year for their BS Battlepass to make the game actually fun and implement some form of progression is complete crap. I understand that it's all about vanity items and that's not my problem. Not being able to collect completed missions and achievements that are in game is a serious issue. If you're like me a game can be decent but have a great progression system and you'll keep playing it. PUBG has a cool mission system challanging and fun while also giving you that feeling of accomplishment for completing a mission. However what is not fun is that it's hidden behind a $10 a month pay wall. I don't have a problem paying the $10 money is not the issue. It's the principle of the matter. You have fans that pay your $30 asking price and you expect to gouge them more for an additional $10 a month for features of a game that should be free for those who actually paid for it in the first place. This isn't even touching on the merger of the battle crates that force you to spend your BP on the possibility of getting a new item from a keyless crate while incorporating the inability to choose whether or not you get a premium crate which requires you to pay $2.50 to open it. So in essence you can play your off to accumulate 4200+ BP for the third crate in the unlock line and you're going to end up having to pay to open it after playing for a day or two to make that kind of BP because lets be honest 99% of you don't win frequently just as I don't. Before the forced merger the items weren't flooded on the market and it was a fair way to do things. However when you force your community to receive your stupid premium key crates and extinguish their ability to bypass them this is cramming your micro transaction system down their throat and shows us the people who do pay your bills for you that we do not matter in the least. Your game has netted you millions probably tens of by now this is greed. This is also shady as hell and a blatant slap in the face to your community. Greed is the downfall of anything that succumbs to it. I enjoy the game but things need to change because they're making AAA moves as a B class developer There's a reason why Indies are gaining ground and it's because the AAA industry is about making money in the most grotesque ways possible and not about it's players who got them to where they are. BlueHole right this issue or you're going to be standing alone. We are not cattle we are the reason you're popular and we will be the reason why you are no longer. I enjoy your product but you've made a huge mistake by hiding basic features behind a pay wall. You're not a AAA developer and you're not a F2P game that requires mass revinue to upkeep it's servers. The volountary Micro transactions I'm sure were far more than enough and what you make from your inital sale price should have netted you far more than enough for anyone to live comfortabally for half of a life time. Stop cramming your crappy schemes down people's throats show respect for the people who support you and be human beings... EDIT This snippett is taking place after realizing a few things that are even more shady. Namely you get one Mission per week as a non battlepass holder. Limited to 80 EXP a day towards your level and if that weren't bad enough here's the clencher. The Items you bust your bum obtaining other than 3 (two of which are out of reach completely ) are on a 30 day timer. Meaning that no matter how much you work to level and earn the items by leveling to a high free level due to their BS restrictions to Non Battlepass subscribers they disappear after 30 days at best. Just thought I'd toss this out there. Shady.. Just Shady and wrong. TLDR In essence I do not in any way reccommend giving your money to this greedy developer there are far too many Free to Play alternatives that will cost you far less in the long run. A fact that I hope they realize before they collapse. Prior to the mandatory participation in their Microtransaction system I would have recommended this game to anyone and I still would if this was righted however hiding progression of any form behing a pay wall is just dirty and removes any recommendation I would ever give.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It was hard the first 10 hours getting used to it kind of fun for about 20 hours and then when you realize how horribly balanced it is you just start to spend more time playing other games because this one pisses you off. I will say that the only fun part is the first few times you get to the last 10 or so people because you get that adrenaline rush from being so close to the top and the tension is real. Overall I'd rate it 6/10. It has a lot of room for improvement and hell if they actually finished the game to the extent 2017 games SHOULD be made then it will be something to look twice at. Until then Buyer Beware!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-08-09,0,0,284,True,Recommended,With every update the game the gameplay gets more solid. It can be extremelly brutal and yet so satisfying at the same time. When playing solo I tend to not go in guns blazing until I know I'm going to get a sure kill but also not be picked off by someone else. Have not managed a win here yet but plenty of 2nd and 3rds. Still very satisfying and very intense.Duo or Squads it really is all about communication and synchronised attacking and defending to survive. With the guys I play with it took us awhile but have finally successfully got a win. I expect more will come.With every game there are moments that you want to forget and others you like to brag about.Just the other day In a game of Duo's three times we stole another duo's vehicle which I am sure them off greatly. Especially based on the amount of lead that flew in our direction as we boosted away. We couldn't stop laughing.Being early access there is definatly improvements to be made and we expect issues. Although the big lag issues that occured the other day was pretty annoying. On the plus side the gun gameplay seemed better and the game got smoother once player base got below 50.I cant recomend it enough. Looking forward to new weapons and maps in the future.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

While I think fortnite definately has it's niche...In my opinion PUBG is better and hands down a ton of fun to play whether your playing duos with a pal or squad with friends this game has given me a lot of enjoyment and out of a scale of 1 to 10 to if it's worth buying?

2018-07-10,0,0,496,False,Not Recommended,"I bought this game last year about two months after it came out and honestly PUBG had potential it was a really cool and fun game at the time that started to take off and rise with popularity and I understand some of the bugs that were in the game then (horrible optimization awful netcode a mass amount of glitches and broken physics and hackers/cheaters) The game just came out then so I would understand if those things were in the game. Fast forward 15 months... The game couldn't be in a more awful state. The game's netcode is still atrocious I still have to deal with putting a mag in a dude and he takes it like it was nothing its awful. Also the optimization is still terrible. Erengal is alright but still pretty bad but the other two maps run awful for me. especially Sanhok that map has been delayed multiple times and it still runs horribly. The amount of glitches in the game is still awful as well glitching through walls dying from falling out of the map weird broken physics with cars it doesnt even look fixed and the game also crashes sometimes which is annoying. Oh god I can't wait to bring this upWHY DIDN'T BLUEBALLS ADD REGION LOCKING ALREADYThis whole entire community has been begging for it is since the dawn of this game its no fun seeing some fly across the map and gun you down with no clip and god mode. it really turns me away from this game when I have to deal with a hacker I waste 20 30 minutes in a match just for some speed hacker to run around a sonic speeds and murder me. I'm done with that garbage. Also the amount of chinese people in general in North American servers is awful enough to turn me away. I dont wanna play against laggy s it ruins the game and makes the net code feel even worse than it already is. Lastly I feel Blueballs knows their time is running out on this game so instead of ""fixing"" it they're gonna add every single kind of way to make money. Hell they even copied fortnites battlepass system which they still managed to screw up by adding timed skins for when the event ends which is horrible and now the game is just full of advertising in your face and it just makes me turned away and upset at the fact that this game isn't the game it used to be.

It has been thoroughly enjoyable to play no matter if it be Solo Duo or Squads it does a fantastic job at what it is. As a ""Battle Royale"" style game it's gameplay was simple and easy to learn overtime as a first timer playing I was cautious but now I just go full on in a battle it's just fun! I understand why people are frustrated with this game and many moments you just feel like smashing your keyboard but that what its meant to do provide a challange. Early Access Games have and will always be buggy a bit broken or just downright unplayable. You make the choice to choose a far away location and run your way cause you can't find a vehicle the match you play is how you make it. H1Z1 had similar issues with the developers but seeming as Bluehole is expanding I can't help but feel a bit sorry no one can make something perfect and I give huge props to the team behind this fantastic game.

2018-02-22,0,0,641,False,Not Recommended,Firstly I have had a wonderful time playing the game. There has been some really fun moments playing with friends. The gameplay is fun and the game looks sweet.I have an issue though. The game is just not optimised as well as it should be. Some people can hate on this comment but if you are going to release a game and enhance it's price it means that people expect a more polished version of the game. WHICH means testing more on the test servers before releasing to the official servers. I enjoyed and 'played' through the performance issues of the game a lot but there gets a point where it's too much.As of this current update (22.2.18) with the new spring cases ect the game feels unplayable. Jitters it's really terrible. Myself and my friends played one round and quit afterwards and went to other games.I think it's great that games in alpha/beta are able to get to certain points to welcome a big community and become playable games but in pubg there remains an issue that the game still requires many updates impacting performance. It saddens me. PUBG I hope you're doing the best you can. Use more money on resources to optimise the game smash the bugs make the game polished. Otherwise I guarantee you will see more people going to Fortnite why? Because it's optimised.I recommend this game only to those who are patient enough to deal with regular updates that can affect the quality of gameplay you have. It's heavy on hardware (I have a 1080ti atm from 75 60) and those things alone can be quite frustrating. Otherwise the game is fun. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to give a downvote at this point in time.Regards.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game is promissing and interesting kinda hook you up but then reality hits you when some 3rd world player with HIGH PING takes advantage of you he plays agressivelly and shoot you before you even notice he is comming and that ruins your game experience when you lose almost all close quater fights.PUBG is only game I know so far when technological advantage (LOW PING) is actually disadvantage.New matching (matching pool of people with low ping) was promissing but I actually still have same close quater fight experience could be ping variance or some people missusing it (change ping to high after matchmaking).

Add onto that that there's NO WAY to sneak up on someone outside of very very slight taps of movement keys which would literally take a few minutes to ascend a single flight of stairs doing and if you up once you make a footstep.Guns make no sense whatsoever and the tiered loot just adds an element of "" you"" RNG to the game. Oh wow you found an SKS? That's cool but this guy found a lvl 3 helmet/vest so you do next to 0 ing damage to him meanwhile he kills you in a few hits.In it's current state this game is an absolute joke and I doubt the devs are going to listen to feedback to fix it because MUH MONEY",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Coming from a freshmen college student I can essentially guarantee you that for the next 1/2 2 year/years there will be no change to how good the game is and if you'de buy it you'de feel ripped off as I am.

High end hardware is not enough to enable smooth performance. Servers are unreliable as well. Distance rendering is problematic as it shows players behind cover depeding on your settings. Poor updates that constantly cause new problems. Paired with BattlEye which just cause a ban wave of innocent players... Probably destined to die out as it already seems to be in a free fall. In total after almost a year and a half of playing PUBG it is an unmachted experience of frustration with early symptoms of boredom. Too bad because the game had a lot of potential.

2018-06-22,0,0,261,False,Not Recommended,I can't say I hate PUBG but I definitely can't recommend it right now. Yeah I'll still play it and enjoy my time with it here and there but at this point the devs seem to only be concered with backpeddling excuses and cash grabbing. Sure it's only cosmetic so I don't really care all that much about the monetization methods but it still sucks that so many games now have lost the fun of customization. I think most people are overreacting a little. You can dislike this 10 dollar pass without acting like the devs have literally in your mouth. I really enjoyed the Event mode where we would get things like 8 man squad shotguns only where everyone is driving around in trucks ramming each other etc. but they seem to come and go before I even get to experience these modes. And nowadays they seem to only be doing War mode for events which I might as well be playing Call of Duty or something if I'm going to waste my time with that boring mode. I haven't even bothered to check out the new map yet. Meh. I hope for the best for PUBG's future but not expecting much from these devs at this point. I'll gladly recommend the game if they get their together. Until then here's looking forward to seeing how DICE can tackle this genre I guess.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Early access...my Here are my facts Price / Early access release on march 2017. After six months from that it has been sold over 13 million pieces. Price almost 30e and Bluehole still struggles (it's December!) with lag and other improvements. Where has all that money gone? ! ? They have either superslow coders or it's the lack of their skills. Or both. Realism / There is no realism. Handguns are useless ((dont use them at all try cast iron pan )) yeah like shooting someone with 9mm from 10 meters do less damage than a F****** iron pan. Yeah...Same goes to other guns and bullets you have to empty a full clip of M4 on players feet to only see how he/she makes a perfect headshot afterwards and kills you. Yeah... Graphics environment / Graphics are the same as games had 5 years ago. It's ok for a multiplayer like this. Nothing new. Environment is not that special. It's kind of a dull. As a part of mentioned realism you should only play FPS version. Personally I cant understand whats the point of seeing behind every ing corner just by moving your mouse even though your character is safely behind every wall and obstacle. 3rd person mode should be banned. It's cheating and cuts realism. Conclusion / This game is not for pc. It's perfectly made for ps or xbox. As we all know console games have always been ""Less"" than pc games. Thats why this game is simply dull on pc. Maybe its because of this unknown publisher/producer or their incapability to create things well.

We were shocked to find that on these two players we killed was a fully equipped AUG which we had ammo for and on the other guy was a AWM sniper rifle with a 15X scope on it with full ammo. So we had two of the best guns in the game fully equipped and only 16 people left. We needed to move closer to the next circle so right after getting these weapons we hop on the motorcycle to move. My friend looks at me and says you drive I said no i don't trust myself you drive. About 10 seconds after leaving on the bike in a completely open field we hit some bump we did not see and flip over and die. I peed myself for about 5 straight minutes laughing so hard because of it. Basically whether its a good situation gone bad like in this case or whatever the situation its a great game to play with friends. Assuming your friends know how to laugh that is....................Good game solo.........Great game with friends.

2017-11-22,0,0,206,False,Recommended,PUBG is the best game I've ever played. Sure it has bugs sure it's voice chat is hilariously bad and the $30 price tag which has drawn many of my friends away from the game. The graphics are pretty good the game's optimization is not the greatest so i5 with GTX 1050ti or higher will be your best bet for no lag on medium+. I have poured 150 hours into this dear game and it was some of the most intense stupid goofy funny and tasty (as in the chicken dinner) I have had in a video game. The day that they ruined this game was the day they brought it out of early access. It killed the reviews it brought in more hackers to try and challenge the Battleye crap. They pushed Miramar too hard. It was supposed to be the best map ever and now I get into a match in it and it has 70 80 people. Sanhok has officially been the best map and the nail in PUBG's coffin. PUBG has established itself as the E Sports competitive game. Now if you actually want to have fun and goof off with your friends a person is gonna jump you from behind a rock or tree because they detected your engine from across the map. Like seriously this game has turned into a game solely consisting of tryhards and noobs pulled in from the sale. I can't bear the fact that this game that once was amazing and fun for anyone even complete noobs has turned into this Drop land accumulate decent to good loot get jumped by guys with worse guns but good aim three stay and fight one runs away or doesn't even fight in the face of fear we all get knocked while screaming at the runner to help the circle comes in and he is forced in. The noob runs in like a chicken with their head cut off and gets one tapped to be fed to the victor of PlayerUnknown's TryhardRoyale. The moral of the story If you want to have intense fighting with good gunplay buy PUBG. If you want to goof off with your friends like it's a physics sandbox go pick up GMOD.

This game is a disaster.This game had potential but it is not worth the money in it's current state.Feedback is a tool for continued success and they don't listen or seem to care about the community at all.Also I want to point out that no one that plays this game seems to know what optimization is since this is ""very optimized and good"". (Sarcasm??)Let me just state very clearly that this game not ""good optimized"".I'll start off with the CONS Cheaters plague the game. (Getting better)Long between updates.Feels like it's very unoptimized server side (Getting better sometimes)Game feels unoptimized at times (Client side getting better)Game is sometimes very quirky/stale.Feels like there is no communication with the developers/creators. (No feedback updates) This in return makes the game feel ""abandoned"" or handles like a ""milking cow""/""quick money grab"".PROS Let's just say that PUBG is a ""Unique Battle Royal Game"".PUBG is the game that popularized the battle royale genre.Unfortunately this is all I'm going to give PUBG at this time.(Untill they show that they listen to community feedback and care for their playerbase.)It s pretty hard to escape cries from some PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds players but I'm genuinely concerned for the game and I'm not just whining. Content isn't everything gameplay is most important and I feel that this has been somehow... missed/neglected. If the developers and the Creator Brendan PlayerUnknown Greene signed off on these changes and were happy with them including some of the previous changes... I don't know If I will enjoy the end results. Game feels like a ""milking cow"" created only to make a quick buck.

I said we wouldn t have microtransactions until we left Early Access but it comes from my naivety (From Greene himself) To be fair we re still not adding any kind of skin system with microtransactions fully until we leave Early Access but we do need to test it and we need to test percentages. (Source https //www.vg247.com/2017/09/07/playerunknowns battlegrounds creator admits that adding microtransactions is the reason steam review bombing started/ although I'm sure you can find many others with a quick google search) They'll ban anyone who kills a streamer (assuming said streamer claims stream sniping or hacks) and if they're popular you'll never get your account unbanned. (See Shroud's popularity)(Quick example likely the guy who killed him is banned https //clips.twitch.tv/RoundRoughZebraOneHand ) Servers are crap. Devs mock Fortnite for making a similar battle royale AND ALREADY HAVE BETTER SERVER CONNECTIONS for FREE. FREE. Not 1 cent is required to play fortnite's battle royale. Millions have purchased PUBG and their servers are worse than anything imaginable. https //twitter.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN/status/92793316455054131320 MILLION sale milestone. $30 a product means $600 000 000 in sales.OVER half a BILLION dollars and they can't bother to pay several thousands to make it enjoyable.For anyone who's curious about the ""bad servers"" here is a 30 second video that shows it.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v XqwhekZdBP4Hackers are everywhere. EVERYWHERE. I'm a terrible player at this game and my rating is in the 1millions (NA/AS/SA servers) and even while waiting for the match to start if you stand on the plane you'll see some guys just running in circle faster than vehicles.Don't get me wrong it's a fun game and it has its amazing moments. I've put in over 100 active hours played. I likely got my $$$ worth in time in the game already but it's infuriating that developers will bend over their fans and audience for more money not improve what NEEDS improving and ignore their fans outcry.I really hope that the game can become better for everyone but currently it is not reccomended anyone play.EDIT They added the option to select what map you wanted to play!!!

2018-01-19,0,0,778,False,Not Recommended,Ok so I now have a fair amount of hours invested in this game and the more I play it the more frustrated I get. Lets start with the hot topic of cheaters they are everywhere and its rare to get a game without them. Bullet detection is absolute garbage and even worse at distance. This is down to them using 32 tick servers which is pathetic and atrocious netcode. The Circle sytem is also bad and most of the time its either in the centre of the map or right at the edge with most of it in the sea and I garuntee you will spend most of your game chasing the circle. The loot distribution really needs to be looked at I love dropping in to an area and finding no gun whatsoever in a battle royal game. Maybe increase spawn points of M16 and AKM might fix it but very rare do I drop into a high pop area and find a gun so whats the point in playing if your just gonna get shot with only a smoke grenade to defend yourself. Also the devs seem really touchy at the moment as I got banned from the general discussion on steam for spamming after posting 1 single comment. Now I will say as bad as the game is at the moment I have really enjoyed my experiences and won numerous chicken dinners which is a glorious feeling. But as it stands the bad outways the good for me and will be interesting to see how the devs handle this going forward.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-10,0,0,51,False,Not Recommended,I regret buying this game for 30 Frikin dollars it is certainly not worth it the most it should be is 15 or less. I never play this on my own that is how bad it is. Let me tell you why. No reigion lock and bad ping abuse lead to players seeing you and shoting you head off before you even see them leading to instant one taps when you finally see them. The reigion lock also allows people from countries where hacks are massively used and (cough the chinese company that bought part of the game and sells hacks out the back.)unregulated . I am writing this after a match of me doing great on a solo cause my friends were in a match and i was waiting well anyways i got one and then i hid to reload and around a corner comes a guy and L to A to G (LAG) and dead. I got maybe one shot off before I died. It almost always happens like that when I play I get shot and my game lags. Like many people have said it is fun at first and your first win is ic but then the stink comes to the game like it it's P.U.B.G corp get your together and fix this and give us region locks.And for fudge's sake crack down on hackers cause cross map no scopes happen and are a real threat. Only you can prevent this dog crap game from getting what it wants money. I'm done.

The gun mechanics are good the variety of attachments are simply amazing and especially with friends this game can be a lot of fun. However it is an early access title. It has its problems.

Thing that is sad is that I had over 440 hours on this game and never cheated once and their failed system to even dispute a ban is astonishing. I understand pubg has a problem with cheaters in general but their system needs to verify its an actual cheat before a ban is applied. Or at least give us an opportunity to appeal I have a game ban on my account now for something I did not do. That game ban has caused issues for me in many of my gaming communities I am in.

2017-03-23,0,0,953,False,Recommended,"Upon Just passing 800 hours I felt a need to get rid of my older bare review of the game (Which was posted in March of 2017).PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Places the player in a large open environment with 90 100 other REAL people. The objective? Be the last man (Or team) standing. And how do you get that done? Parachute down with everyone else into these environments scavange kill and loot what ever and wherever you can.I can honestly say after 100's of hours I am still VERY much enjoying the game and can find myself sitting down and putting in a 4 8 hour session of games with friends over the weekend over and over again. The variety of guns attatchments and just sheer options avaliable to you the player really increases the uniqueness of every game you play. Each of these attachments guns medical items etc can serve different situations/playstyles and environments better than others and have their own list of pros/cons attached to them and ultimently can all be used effectively depending on how much time the player takes to learn and practice with them. The two maps currently in the game offer their own (Albiet small) changes than the other. (Miramar taking place in a desert map Offering a unique pickup truck Van Sawed off Shotgun revolver and winchester. While Erangel is more of an island of hills and trees offer the DP 28 Machine gun Dacia it's own revolver as well as a jeep).In terms of where it sits among the other games in the genre I place this among the top. I find the game to continue to be improved expanded upon and tweaked. Something a lot of early access games have failed to do. These updates and tweaks have not stopped with the end of its early access period. The more clunky at times movement and controls are met with a more realistic approach to the guns damage and ballistics create a feel that leans more towards ARMA than H1Z1.And on a final note as of writing this with 800+ hours I have yet to encounter a cheating experience. The closest thing to being ""Cheated"" I have had was early on in development buildings would sometimes not load in and you would be able to see through them I have not encountered or seen this bug in about 3 months. The game takes a lot of hate for being overflowed with Hackers as well as chinese players and its option to buy cosmetic crates. As you read above I have yet to encounter a hacker and while yes it would seem many asia players can be found on NA/EU and other Regions I have yet to see it impact my gameplay other than not being able to understand them. I play with my friends and we Do not pick up random players if we are short a 4th (3 man squad option avaliable) And I play solo if a friend is not online to duo with Avoiding the chance of being paired with careless players players I cannot understand (mic less Foriegn language to myself etc) would strongly suggest taking the same approach to have the best experience. Lastly The cosmetic crate system (Earned with in game curency OR purchased via the market) is a nice addition to the game The items and crates earned in game are marketable ranging from a few cents to several 100 $'s. There is no in game benefit to these crates other than a choice of clothing to wear (no defensive bonus). I personally have Found this to be an enticing way to keep myself playing. I have been able to purchase games such as Rainbow Six Siege Dragon Ball FighterZ) and more copies of the game for my friends because of these crates and cosmetic items. Cannot complain about being able to make more than I have spent on the game Without spending an extra penny for any other reason than wanting to.The best Battle Royal Experience to date Only matched by its foundation created in the Arma Modding community by PlayerUnknown as well. 9.5/10STRONG RECOMENDATION",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-09,0,0,283,True,Not Recommended,A great start for a potentially awesome game let down by it's lack of support on optimisation and hackers. In truth this game is far from a proper full release and should realistically be held in early access for atleast another 9 months to work on the countless bugs/optimisation issues as well as the cluncky movement that feels like its been taken straight out of a vintage Tomb raider game.

2017-05-10,0,0,99,True,Recommended,This game is my first try in the genre and i love it. The gameplay itself is fantastic.

Somehow my settings are ASIA servers automatically and when i change them to NA or EU or any servers where i think i might get paired with someone who speaks english seems like everyone has this issue. I'm not sure if the regions are out of wack or what but this seems like it happened out of nowhere and its gotten out of hand. I do enjoy the game but if you are thinking about buying this game i simply cannot recommend it at this point in time until this issue gets fixed It is literally a rare thing to get paired with someone from NA or someone who actually speaks english. im assuming everyone from NA got annoyed with it and just stopped playing this game completely or the servers got completely invaded. I dont enjoy this game simply because sometimes i do get team killed by these players. Sadly now i find myself palying one game or 2 and then turning it off and playing something else. I also rarely do reviews here on steam but this one just made put me in that mood to just say whats the situtation.

This is most prevalent when you're trying to pick up loot but when you try to pick up as fast as possible the game derps out and refuses to acknowledge that you used the pick up command. Second example is when you press to open doors theres always like a one second delay even if you're playing in your native region. Buggy movement The mid game is absolutely dead and boring because of a recent change which means that you can't travel as far as you could do prior to the change from the flight path. Terrible collision e.g. (this is my video) https //www.youtube.com/watch?v cSq9C2NolxA Cheaters note that China represents 40 50% of the playerbase but 60% of banned cheaters are Chinese and over 90% of cheats come out of China Playing with Chinese players regardless if you queue NA/EU/SA/OCE servers Disgusting amount of desync getting shot around the corner because of a combination of horrible netcode and high ping players (cough Chinese) More often than not having multiple houses consist of mainly clothes as loot (and it has shown sometimes guns load in slower than clothes) Being shoved the new map (and previous to that the appalling weather modes) down your throat with no option of selecting what you want to play (the only option at the moment is to leave during the pre flight lobby) Desert map being horrendously bad too big too many open fields and loot being questionable at best. They're trying to rectify this disaster of a map by adding in better loot and more buildings IIRC. Disastrous and legitimately dangerous sound balancing. The plane noise is horrendously loud when grenades are thrown close to windows that you are close to (and when the redzone blows up windows close to you) e.g. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1cjMI00BP7A A notoriously bad Korean dev studio who were the developers of Tera (and we all know how that one panned out) who are obnoxiously not transparent with what they're """"""""""working"""""""""" on. The same bugs and problems have been prevalent since long before this ""official launch"" when the game could still be considered barely in a beta state. Refusal to acknowledge the problem the Chinese players are presenting to other regions even Brendan Greene calling western players Xenophobic because we do not want to play with the Chinese due to the points listed before. The only hope left is Tencent launching their own server and blocking off the Chinese from playing on the international servers. This is one of the more extreme videos showcasing how toxic the Chinese community is to PUBG https //www.youtube.com/watch?v woBcpSURKgcThen this is the game for youFinal notes Do not fall for the shilling thats on places like the PUBG subreddit who exclaim such stuff like ""they'll make this game better just give them time to polish it out"" it's almost been 2 months since ""official release"" and like 9 months of EA prior to that and they still havent attempted to fix any of the core problems related to networking.But hey atleast the gunplay is pretty good and rewarding for outplaying people and they managed to release one dare I say decent patch which significantly increased fps and added in vaulting which was like 4 months overdue since the time of release.Atleast I made my steam dollar back from this game by selling crates (when they said they weren't going to add in loot boxes during early access nice one btw)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-04,0,0,672,False,Recommended,Never posted a review for a game yet but why not.I've gone from loving this game to hating it to back to loving it.Pros First unique gametype added to fps/third person shooters in literally years... RPG Elements can be felt too because of having to find and collect items to have a better chance at winning the game as well as eliminating enemies and taking all of they're items to better equip yourself to survive sort of like a morphing leveling system. mmo level FPS (there aren't many good ones out there)Cons Glitchy and requires a fairly decent gaming setup to run without any flaws and usually running everything on low except for the draw distance will lead to the best performance ingame which means the game doesn't look amazing unless your running a 4ghz processor with at least 8gigs of ram and happen to have a GTX 1080 GPU or equivalent graphics card. The game actually does look amazing when all the graphics settings are on high but unless you have the system to handle it you'll experience FPS lag and slower ingame interactions and maybe even crash more frequently but the main attraction to this game is the gameplay style imo not the way it looks. Lots of controls and the better your control system is setup the better you will play. (mouse with extra buttons does wonders since your other hand can only do so much and still be used for moving around at the same time) Loot system while this is an essential element to the new gameplay type (survival/battle royale) it can also be a pain to spend 10 15 minutes finding all your gear only to get headshot by someone which is why I play almost exclusively on the new map Miramar it has more consistent loot spawns and the high level loot spawns are easier to find as well as scopes so when you do get caught out in the middle of a field you'll at least hopefully have something you can see your enemy with and shoot back instead of just a shotgun.I'm really hoping they fix the original map (Erangel)'s loot spawns because right now they are ridiculous compared to the new map (Miramar) to the point that the only place worth going to is the millitary base because it always has the best stuff but because its so popular it often becomes a massive drop zone and theres not a weapon for everyone if everyone goes there. The loot spawns were better on that map in early access but they tweaked something or broke something and now its always a hassle to even find an AR with a decent sight on it. Plus the maps terrain is pretty bland so finding a hill or gully to hide in is almost impossible and your left with trees to hide behind and some rocks which are pretty scarce and its a bad situation to be in if you still have a pistol and a shotgun at that point. (why the hell are shotguns so popular on this map please tell me bluehole they are literally EVERYWHERE)My other little problem with the game is the aim modes which turned me off from the game but I since adapted by using a better mouse. Putting two different aiming options on the right mouse button is ridiculous when your trying to fight in CQB. (Hold for better hip fire aim or toggle for full aim down sights ADS ) Half the time I'd end up stuck in ADS mode and getting killed because I couldnt click my right mouse button fast enough to escape that mode. Now instead both my aim modes are set to hold for ADS and Aiming Hip Fire mode and use different mouse buttons... took some getting used to but makes quick ADS and moving around way easier and is great if your used to normal FPS games where your used to aiming in and out of sights fast.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-10,2,1,240,True,Not Recommended,Long story short this is not a good game. It's not fun. It is not enjoyable. It is poorly designed damage to other players is not consistent (or high enough at its best to begin with ) cheaters run rampant and there are more bugs than I could even begin to describe. The idea of a good battle royale game is great I love the genre. But PlayerUnknown needs to revamp bullet mechanics and damage coding because they suck. Plain and simple. I would not recommend ANYONE to buy this game as it is right now. I regret ever spending $30 on it. I've played over 200 hours with my friends TRYING to enjoy this game because I really want to. But after playing other games that did this genre correctly such as ArmA I just cannot bring myself to think it's good. It is in alpha yes of course. However the direction the game is heading is just bad. Focus on making damage make sense before you start worrying about creating new vehicles and weapons. Focus on controlling cheaters before you start worrying about making new boxes with clothes in them. Seriously? You can be one shot by a jumping punch from another player 100 times in a row but then you go and SuperMan punch someone in the back of the head then punch them in the face four more times and they proceed to shoot you and kill you. It's frustrating when you expect the game to be functioning and have working damage registration like other games in the genre. But for now it'll continue to be on my uninstalled list. I would give this game a 2/10 for its graphics and attention to detail. That's about it. Fortnite a free to play game does it better than a game with hundreds of millions of dollars behind it. It's really sad.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I would recommend you to read some of neutral reviews from real people who are not streamers and youtubers and who have brains and dignity left those people count and if you really set on buying this game then get ready for everything writen above I sincerely cannot recommend this game not matter what others say or show you on mainstream media fake t videos and streams. I would rather spend my 22 23 euros on something usefull or give them away to somebody who needs them more i got burned.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-06-24,0,0,196,True,Recommended,"Battlegrounds is an action game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royal a type of large scale deathmatch where players fight to be the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo or with a small team of two or four people. In either case the last person or team left alive wins the match.Each match starts with players parachuting onto an island approximately 8 by 8 kilometres (5.0 mi 5.0 mi) in size 1 from a plane without any items outside of customizable clothing options that they select prior to a match. Once they land players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons vehicles armor clothing and other equipment. These items are distributed throughout the map at the start of a match with certain high risk zones having better equipment. 2 Players then proceed to either stay hidden to avoid being killed or hunt down other players whilst continuing to search for more equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. At random a plane will fly over various parts of the playable map and drop a loot package containing items which are normally unobtainable during normal gameplay. The package also emits a highly visible red smoke drawing interested players near it. 2 Players can opt to play either from the first person or third person perspective each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness. 2 Every few minutes the playable ""safe"" area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage over time and eventually being eliminated in game the players see this as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. 3 This forces players into more confined areas and increases the chance of encounters with the surviving players. During the course of the match random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed posing a threat to players that remain in that area. 4 In both cases players are warned a few minutes before these events giving them time to relocate to safety. On average a full round takes no more than 30 minutes. 5 At the completion of each round players gain in game currency based on how long they survived and how many other players they had killed. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character customization.Lead designer Brendan Greene better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown had previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ Battle Royale an offshoot of popular mod DayZ and inspired by the film Battle Royale. 6 Greene had been inspired to create the Battle Royale mod as he found that in most multiplayer first person shooter games there was too much repetition as maps were small and easy to memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect creating a high degree of replayability this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized and using random item placement across it. 7 Greene also was inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ which featured a number of Twitch.tv and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left as he was not a streamer himself Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play. 7 When DayZ became its own standalone title Greene transitioned development of the Battle Royale mod to ARMA 3. Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in Greene's work and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1 which was split into two separate games the survival mode H1Z1 Just Survive and the battle royal like H1Z1 King of the Kill around February 2016. 8 Greene had completed his work with Daybreak around the time of this split and was contacted by Chang Han Kim of the South Korean developer Bluehole offering him the opportunity to work on a new battle royal concept. Within a week Greene had flown out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the options and a few weeks later became the creative director of Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development. 7 According to Greene this is the first time a Korean game studio has brought aboard a foreigner for a creative director role and while a risk he states his relationship with Bluehole's management is strong allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal oversight. 5 Development began in early 2016 with plans to have the game ready within a year. 9 Kim served as executive producer for the game. 7 Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's work but which as of June 2017 has expanded to 70 and expected to increase again to 90 with a new studio based in Madison Wisconsin Greene said that many of these developers are voluntarily putting in longer work hours into the game due to their dedication to the project and not by any mandate from Greene or Bluehole's management. 7 10 In addition to Bluehole Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive the developers of ARMA and DayZ for support with motion capture animations via their Czech studio. 10 BATTLEGROUND IS A GOOD GAME TRY IT",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,985,False,Not Recommended,"(This review is excluding hackers because that is a debatable subjective without real evidence of it.)Pubg is a game that had a hype train and good potential. What did they do with it? Put it on xbox made a new map and made the interface look nicer. They developed the game on an already broken foundation but never wanted to redo it and fix it because they were hellbent on getting the game ""out"" as soon as possible. So now we have a years worth of band aid fixes that try to hide the still core problem in the game. I have over 1 000 hours in the game across two accounts but the replay value and longevity went away with the updates. Too much of the game is mixed with 1/3rd wtf moments? Glitches or rare moments 1/3rd Game broken Main menu troubleshooting or Server instability with another 1/3rd of intense moments that can be fun or exciting. So take 2/3 of the game being emotionally draining and add 1 000 hours. You get someone who gets burnt out. I feel most people that are still playing are people who haven't given the game a try during alpha who don't play it enough to feel they've got their moneys worth.

2017-11-22,0,0,4052,True,Recommended,Even though PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds is still in Early Access it s already a groundbreaking online shooter. Each game starts the same way but its remarkable ability to feel like a fresh new adventure every round has kept me coming back for hours on end. It manages to approach the Battle Royale style death match made popular by games like DayZ with relative simplicity without sacrificing the essence of the hardcore survival sim creating a tight focused and no frills experience that places it leagues above the competition.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. Even this first act is a critical decision and must be part of your strategy jumping early lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but may also place you farther from the center of the arena where the fighting must inevitably funnel towards. Jumping late might give you some distance from other players giving you some early breathing room before entering the fray. Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action.The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground as everybody scrambles for weapons and gear and the killing begins right from the get go. Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests healing items melee weapons and a good mix of firearms are in good supply.Item distribution is randomized but you can t count on finding a good gun early keeping you safe. It isn t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle since good gear is only half the battle the other half is wit. As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly ever shrinking force field until just one is left alive. Victory is an exhilarating reward matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it. But even if you die early jumping into a new game is always quick and easy. (Kill cams are wisely omitted to avoid cheating but you do have the option of entering spectate mode for surviving teammates.)The deadly moving force field that contains the arena and occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a consistent sense of purpose and with it an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize reaching the center to avoid each incremental reduction in size of the survivable area move slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into the open to avoid the oncoming doom or even hide in a building until you absolutely have to move letting everyone else kill each other so you don t have to. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious defense and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly liberating bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to plan around and tackle as the next.The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky) survivors condensing the action and ending a match after around 20 minutes before it can get bogged down by campers or other distractions. Action isn t hard to find in Battlegrounds if you re looking for it and impossible to avoid for long when you re not but it manages to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet tense moments we know and love from games like DayZ intact.While the rules are always the same factors like where you choose to land which items spawn where or how fast you can find a weapon or a backpack or a scope keep every match new and exciting. A large map and an abundance of loot means hunting for a weapon isn t a frustrating task but instead an opportunity to weigh your options and pick your approach for the round. This not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone but ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods or on either end of a deadly hunt across one of the island s many cities and towns. You might even find yourself holed up in an attic listening for the slightest creak or scrape to indicate a nearby presence shotgun in hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby enemies is one of the ways Battlegrounds forces you to stay attentive and tactical rather than treating every round like a Call of Duty style shoot em up. Play long enough and you can learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a place before you an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should be watching your back. All these layers merge to build a shooter that s as invested in creating a smart nuanced survival experience as it is fun action packed combat.The entire dynamic of both exploration and combat changes drastically by grouping up in the pre game lobby. (Teaming up after you re in game is considered cheating and a potentially bannable offense.) Playing solo brings certain elements to the formula that going in with a partner doesn t and the same goes for trios and four player squads. There might be more freedom and greater opportunity for stealth in going alone but a well coordinated team has more potential for pulling off exciting ambushes and vehicular assaults.The gunplay itself is also great firearms feel good to shoot and are impressively balanced even in Early Access. And while Battlegrounds does retain that military sim clunkiness that s become synonymous with the genre it s just smoothed out enough to keep combat and movement satisfying and accessible to newcomers. A couple of handy hotkeys to cycle weapons switch between third or first person perspective and toggle auto or burst fire for your gun are most of what you need to know. The simple and intuitive UI is also particularly refined which makes looting bodies and swapping items with teammates as easy as a quick click and drag. A number of quality of life features round out even Battlegrounds roughest edges being able to access your inventory and map while on the move and a generous leniency with fall damage stand out as some of the most valuable.Of course Battlegrounds is still Early Access so it does have a few problems you should be aware of. I ve dealt with annoying glitches such as pieces of loot I couldn t pick up wonky collision that has gotten me momentarily stuck in doorways and performance issues like bad latency but game breaking bugs are fortunately rare. The exception to that is an apparently small group of players who have reported frequent crashes something that will hopefully be resolved once it s fully launched. Overall it s a relatively smooth experience especially when compared to most early access games that have only been available for a month or so. While the gameplay Battlegrounds offers now is strong enough to stand on its own additional features I d love to see in the final version include custom servers new maps and a separate practice range for getting a feel for individual guns.PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds has taken the genre popularized by games like DayZ and boiled it down to only its best parts making for quick and accessible rounds of pure hassle free survival based action. Even though it s as rough around the edges as the early access label implies it s absolutely worth playing right now. We ll continue to play as it gets closer to a full launch and revisit this review with updated thoughts once it s out of early access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All you can do is take it slow and try to be the one doing the killing.In my opinion PLAYERUNKNOWNS'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the best battle royale game on the market.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-05,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,I bought this game in early access last year and initially really enjoyed my first few matches. I thought this game is fun but man it's janky I bet it will be really awesome once it's realeased and they clean everything up. Well it's a year later and the game runs more or less the same as it did in early access. The framerate is better but it still feels super slow and swimmy to play. The lack of polish throughout the game beginning with the main menu is just really dissapointing this far into release. Honestly the game feels like an unfinished mod.It's too bad because I prefer this style of gameplay to something like Fortnite I've never thought the building in that game was very fun but at this point Fortnite is the BR that i'm playing because it's so much more complete and the developer is so much more responsive to changes in the player base. I mean Fortnite is like 60 FPS on consoles has fun events and progression different modes of playing with different levels of intensity other than my feelings on the building aspect it's just a much more solid game.. also it's freeIt's really dissapointing if you wanted PUBG to end up good because right now it looks like they've missed the boat and won't get the players back on board.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I make top 10 every time won a few. I get killed by a hacker in 2 out of 3 games I play. It's pretty blatent and obvious and theres nothing you can do about it. China and Korea promote hacking in computer games and bluehole does not have a legitmate campain to stop the problem at the source. Gaming lounges there advertise that they provide the latest hacks and its all a money making circle. Ban players sell more copies. If you can deal with that buy it. Great game the only game I've ever seen real world combat tactics in a survival environment actually work and payoff everytime. Stay low use cover and concealment stay quiet cover your tracks engage only when you know you will kill don't give away your position always try to live to fight another day keep your 6 clear use surpressive fire use terrain to your advantage don't get pinned and you'll make take top 10 everytime.

2018-04-16,0,0,807,False,Recommended,Pubg is something that has gained mass popularity very quickly and with that comes reviews that express a very stern love or hate of the game instead of exploring it like most things and seeing the good and bad and deciding which ones matter more to you.I have 200+ hours at the time of writing this review which compared to many others is nothing. If you look through my steam library you will see a pattern common among many users.I purchase games and barely play them or in some cases I do not play them at all. 200+ hours for me is signifigant and that is for a reason.I want to start off with the bad things.The game isn't the most optimized and can be hard on even beefy machines. I get 40 50 fps on high settings with a roughly 3 year old machine. I have a very good internet connection and I rarely have any server issues. Any that I have experienced were steam wide and not exclusive to me. I have been playing online games since the original quake so none of this is new or unexpected to me. lag happen. there are 100 players. de sync is going to happen. servers are only going to get better and better as the game is developed. I personally have not ran into enough server issues to warrant a complaint.many complaints I read do not consider the technical requirments of such servers and the net code required. Rainbow Six Seige had one of the worst party systems I have experienced for over a year and that is made by Triple A developer with years and years of online gaming experience.some people simply won't like the game play. that does not make it a bad game. I do not enjoy many games that people leave positive reviews for. I understand it just isn't my cup of tea. Yes you can land and get killed in the first 10 seconds. As you learn the game you can figure out how to avoid situations more consistently. Most complaints I read in terms of gameplay come down to lack of skill not the game it self.The addition of events have really spiced the game up for me. A couple examples lately have been shotgun/pistol only matches in small circles. Another was 10 person squads.I really enjoy Pubg. The challenge of it and the open world is a ton of fun. Coming across some awesome loot grabbing a vehicle and getting into epic gun fights is awesome. As a 20+ year veteran of pc gaming. Pubg has been one of my favorite PC Games to come out ever.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-14,0,0,515,False,Recommended,This is a list of my pros and cons in this game.Pros.It's very addicting and you end up playing for like 3 hours on end.The loot drops are very well put and balanced.Each weapons feel powerful and good in their own way even the pistols.The map tells you exactly where you are and how far away from the safe zone you are.There are a lot of vehicle spawns which makes the game fun.The gunfights are extremely intense at times and it makes you feel like you're in veitnam or something.The drop zones are balanced so people can't go too the same place every game.Complete gun customization.The bandage system is well put and seems fair.You have the option to revive your teammates._______________________________Cons.The game crashes a lot if you don't have it on low settings.If you run over the smallest bump in a car you'll go flying and most likely die.you can get stuck in the giant well at the ruins if you fall/land in there.No optimization yet BUT it will be added.The game freezes sometimes and once it does that the only way to fix it is to restart your computer which is very annoying.FPS drops are insane at times. ____________________With all the pros and cons out there now i'd have to say i recommend this game because it's still in early access so you gotta give it a chance because i'm sure most of the bugs will be fixed in a few updates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I'm on ultra low settings with 8GB of RAM a GTX 760 and an AMD FX 8320 and it just runs horribly and looks abysmal.Bottom line if you have any doubts about this game don't even bother.

2018-06-19,0,0,8,False,Not Recommended,Everything I could possibly say about this game has already been said. From the atrocious networking and hit detection to the pitiful optimization it is pretty clear why PUBG Corp. appears to be in full damage control mode. Rather than fix what is already in the game the team focuses of introducing new flashy features long before they are ready for release (see moving building geometry without moving loot spawns).Even after all this time there are still core game breaking bugs that persist unfixed. These include late loot spawns (loot spawning in after people have landed) vehicle physics glitching out and killing people to world geometry not having collisions to buildings straight up not loading in. Rather than try to fix these bugs PUBG Corp have been persuing lawsuits for ideas they didn't invent or for items that are not unique to the game.Every day the game seems to prove that there are more bugs than working features in the game but PUBG Corps' got their money so they're focusing on what more microtransactions they can pull from this full priced game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-04,0,0,375,False,Recommended,A review for this game is meaningless because who doesn't know about this game. Even if you haven't played it you have seen someone else play it and probably already know if you would enjoy this game or not. The game is pretty much everything it advertises to be. Its an enjoyable battle royale/last man standing game that throws 100 players onto an island (and soon a desert) to fight it out. PUBG is a very fun game that has held my interest for about 250 hours. I would say im pretty bored with it now but I find myself coming back to it everynow and again with a friend or squad which is the most enjoyable aspect of this game teamplay.If you are interested in playing this game I would say go for it but do it quickly. The devs are pushing the esports scene for this game way too hard for what it is. The best part of a battle royale style game is the randomness and unfairness of each game. Somegames you find amazing stuff some games you dont. Flight path airdrops bomb zones area circles vehicle spawns loot quality &amp quantity are all random and is the main reason these games don't get repetitive quickly. Pushing esports would lead to these aspect being somewhat balanced essentially killing the game. At its current state though its a really enjoyable game and I hope the devs make the right decisions going forward. 7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-16,0,0,42,False,Recommended,"I bought this game hoping to get some multiplayer fun with friends out of this game but actually to even get to play the multiplayer game you have to first beat the loading screen boss. It can take a few tries and you may need to update drivers or change settings the problem is there is no real good strategy guide for this since each game is unique and randomly generated. The worst part is you are timed when fighting this boss because while other players get to move freely your character is stuck standing still with no chance to move around or even defend yourself and now your character will automatically get sent out of the plane free falling into whatever challenges awaits. Sometimes you character will drown while fighting the loading screen other times you get attacked by a guy just trying to get some extra BP from AFK kills. After Finally beating the loading screen boss I thought ""OK! time to have some fun with friends!"" but here comes the second boss his name is ""The rendering"". the rendering boss uses a variety of attacks ranging from low poly buildings which if entered can make a player stuck in something that appears inside or on top of the character and some obstacles just not spawning at all which your character will just run into what appears to be an invisible wall. After beating the second boss I was pretty worn out but it was time to play the game. But little did I know that the hardest boss would be my teamates! If you find better loot than them or maybe they are just feeling silly they might shoot you or hit you with a frying pan in the head one shotting you whilst they scream ""would anybody care for some EGGS!?!?!""10/10 would like some eggs",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Adding new cases that could only be unlocked by keys to earn them even more money but in doing so they have put off some fans of the game to other battle royl titles.2. Adding the pass for the new map is a bad move as they are just ripping off the battle pass from fortnite yet i believe this is as revenge for fortnite ripping PUBG off (THATS WHAT BLUEHOLE THINKS SO I PROPOSED A THEORY DON'T KILL ME)3. The game has been out for a long time now so why hasn't there been any major updates to help with optimisation this game was once running smooth but now not so much.4.

This is my favorite game and i've met some amazing people visited a different state and got invited to a wedding in another country because of this game. I've never had the same joy from winning or the frustration from a close second in any other game than i have with this one. Its amazing and it still could be even better. People who talk about like its paid to win or that the devs are greedy are missing the business aspect of this game. They aren't greedy but they still need to get paid just like everyone else. How many of you would continue to work for free or on reduced pay to an ungrateful and hateful community? Most of the copies they're going to be able to sell have been sold. They aren't going to be able to sell another 30 million copies and making that extra money back money which they weren't just sitting on. They're spending it on expansion advertising making new content working on performance and optimization a bunch of new things. But that origional money dried up so they have to come out with a new way to make money which would be loot crates and the more recent event pass (which i bought gladly and with zero regrets). This is how they continue to make money to keep on updating the game paying for servers everything that goes into this game is made through the lootcrate and hopefully that will be phased out by the event pass. The issue is that gamers are the most impatient people in the world. The game was made on bad netcode and it wasn't supposed to be the success that it turned into so it wouldn't have mattered that much. But they were a success and those quirky glitches and things in the netcode that made pubg the quirky flavor of the month came to bite them in the and they can't easily fix them. Yes they did not do what they promised to the extent i and many others wanted it but what did you expect from a small studio like bluehole that had little to no experience with fps games that then became a runaway success. If they were to fix the game they would have to smash the castle and start anew which they can't do because they're too big. To satisfy the harrassing and loud players (who do nothing but spam the community announcements with what they want added in the game that they feel like they deserve because they feel entitled to a one time purchase and continued content to last them hundreds of hours that costs bluehole tens of thousands of man hours making) they had to make promises they simply couldn't keep and that lost them the trust of the player base. But a lot of things these people complain about is stupid and unrealistic like the cosmetics. If you don't want the cosmetics don't get it. Its simple as that. I will continue to buy the event passes though because i for one think that they're an amazing alternative to lootcrates and give me a reason to play the game because I want those outfits since I think they're awesome. You do you boo boo. But while i understand it doesn't mean i'm not frustrated from things like lag desync being killed behind cover stupid glitches that cause me to die after i've got 15 kills and i can potentially break my record of 19. Its frustrating. I wish it would be fixed. I'm typically in the top 100 in duo and squad tpp the highest I've ever made was 28 in duos and i kept on losing games after i got that high to people who were killing me behind cover chinese es who abuse the poor coding to get easy kills hackers (though bluehole has done an amazing job with them recently they are still there and occasionally i catch them) and other things that could be avoided if they were able to fix the netcoding. But they can't. Because every single mistake or misstep they make is put under a microscope and they're an evil company that was only trying to take your money. Yeah they're trying to take money from the person who spent $30 on the game spent 400 hours on it that they mostly enjoyed but had a couple bad games and decided to leave a bad review because the game isn't perfect and up to their standards because they've been playing Cod and battlefield which haven't changed at all in the last 7 years. But i'm rambling because i'm updating this drunk as after reading stupid negative reviews. If you want a better and more cohesive explaination watch WTFMoses' video https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 96nUghwWGJI&amp t 1sDeuces buy the game and find some randoms who you like and who like you. This game wasn't meant to be played alone. The first 400 hours are the toughest but you'll get a win in occasionally and once you get good you'll be slaughtering kids left and right. You could be the next Shroud if you decide to just buy the game despite the negative reviews left by bitter people who feel entitled to more and expect more from a company that wasn't supposed to ever be known outside of those weird indie game players.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Hacking is still at large and the Dev team of Trogs have somehow created even more technical issues with the newest update like frequent crashing for no apparent reason.

2017-12-20,0,0,897,True,Recommended,Great game! Yeah it's buggy but it's getting better and better after every update. At the core the game is really thrilling and the long games ( 30 mins if you survive) makes you really stressful. You really don't want to die and start over again which makes you super alert and defensive. I like the fact that it rewards positionning over plain point and clicking it feels like a real survival game instead of a regular FPS.People are complaining about devs but in the last month they've been really active. Three massive updates did lots of great change rubberbanding (in test server at least) is getting better hitbox could get a little bit of work and the game often crashes at the beginning (which is not so bad because you can rejoin the game without any issue).I find myself thinking about this game alot when I'm at work or college... so yeah needs polishing but it's still my favorite game as of right now.Oh my specs (I run at 80 120 depending where) I5 4690K R9 390 8gb RAM Evo SSDLike I said I'm crashing and I get some rubberbanding at the very beggining of a game but everything else works fine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-01,0,0,249,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game not as it is. The game is decent yes but it's full of bugs like getting stuck in the world items not being collectable or flat not working and there's a massive MASSIVE issue with server connections. From rampant issues with trying to connect to servers being kicked off the server and unable to connect the game refusing to load and being unable to interact with allies if you manage to rejoin. Worse yet is the cheating. BattleEye sources say as also qouted by the Dev Brendan Green that 99% of the cheating comes from China which is 47% of every single player in the world. The cheating like shooting through walls teleporting insane speeds no recoil instant lockon all these things make the experience just ruined. It's only worsened by players who cannot physically communicate with you because they do not speak the native language of the regions' servers they chose to connect to. In a game where teamwork and communication literally decide the outcome of a game where seconds count this is Terrible. Almost as terrible as the PING connections as it takes several seconds for the data to travel around the world to reach those NA servers precious several seconds that effectively don't happen in a Reflex and Percision based FPS where entire fights could only last 5 seconds. When half of that time all that data just disappears and hasn't reached the player yet it can effectively make a player you kill still be alive for long enough to kill you. The game is good very good. But the player base is toxic and riddled with server problems cheats and bad connections. Rather than fix it for gameplay reasons the Dev called all players in the west upset with this Xenophobes. For that alone I would recommend against it as well. Do not buy this game. Not until servers are fixed and the dev sees you as something other than a racist for wanting solid servers and a fair game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-26,0,0,572,False,Recommended,Also known as the Long Distance Running Simulator. Hehe seriously though this is Battle Royale the others are pale imitations. The game play revolves around you and or your squad being dropped from a plane onto an island where you have to find weapons and defend yourself in an ever decreasing play area. Every one else is hostile! There can be only one winner.There are many tactics to playing the game but not one that can guarantee a win each time there is luck and skill required to get the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner but the most important is time in game. Many new players join the game and get frustrated with the brutality of the game. If you new don t drop in high density areas )Make sure you play with good headphones with directional sound! You will need it.Would I recommend? Yes I play most weeks/nights and is one of my fave games.Pros Hard Core (if you like easy go play Fortnite)Large selection of weaponsGood selection of cars motorbike and boatsVoIP works well as long as you set it correctly in you settings (discord is better)Large MapsAtmospheric yes yes I know but the game has a better feel that the other Royale games and the replay system is just awesome to play with.Cons You need a good high end PC to get the best out of the game a 1050ti is a minimum I would say.Cheats sadly it is rife with them the devs are trying their best but it is wack a moleLatency issues with the servers are still persistence.Hit reg because of the above is sometime way out of sync.Some sounds are way too high (for example stand next to the sea and you would think a storm was rising but it s a pond)Large Maps (yes its in both! Needs more bike/car spawns on them or pedal bikes!)Special Events (this is new and not well thought out 8 player teams for example but you can only have a squad of 4.

2017-11-13,0,0,287,True,Not Recommended,This game has the potential to be so good but it has some extremely frustrating flaws that hold it back. Bluehole has more than enough resources to improve this game at a much greater rate than it has been so far so why its still in its current state is a little concerning. They are still claiming a full release by the end of Q4 but I don't think thats going to happen. My biggest issues with this game are as follows 1) As of 11/13/17 the amount of hackers/cheaters in this game make it unplayable. Spending 20 or 30 minutes in a game only to be shot and eliniated in a matter of a few seconds by someone from across the map is unacceptable. It's always being shot through walls from impossible diatances with full auto weapons or some other form of cheating. Its almost every game now something like this happens and yet Bluehole claims their anti cheating measures have been ramped up and they're banning more people than ever. 2) The amount of bugs in a game a month away from full release is crazy. Crash to desktop stuck in walls/doors parachute getting stuck weapons not firing when commanded not able to scope in etc. I don't mind bugs here and there its impossible to have a perfect game but sometimes the game become almost unplayable. 3) The optimization of the graphics is not good. With some of the most recent updates my frame rates took a big dive. With my set up (1080Ti &amp 7700K) I don't think I should be running mid 20's FPS at some points of the game. Alot of textures still look really bad seizure inducting texture clipping on some walls. I don't know a whole lot about tech but wtf. 4) Servers are always lagging. You think you made in behind cover in time only to be killed behind a wall or something. Why am I always in lobbies full of Chinese people? I don't mind them they seem like perfectly pleasant people but how can their ping be relative to mine? I know this has to affect the game play in some form or another. 5) Advertising in game is shameful. Are you that greedy for cash that you need to graffiti walls with a sponsors logo/information? I know it seems like a petty gripe but where does it end? Our whole world is advertisements being crammed down our throats now its leeching its way into games. And the paids crates. I suppose the paid crates aren't a big deal as long as they're purely non game changing cosmetic items. But putting paid crates in a beta seems a bit like a cash grab. PUBG is alot of fun sometimes but at this point the flaws are game breaking. I hope they make some changes at Bluehole and get this back on the right track again. Maybe future updates will give this game the help it needs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They had enough time and enough ressources to fix almost everything I.G. Servers it isnt too hard to bring up some proper servers who are stable for all people and not even that expensive and lets be honest with the money bluehole made they could easily have done this.I am more and more convinced that this game was just made for 2 years (like a little project) to grab all the money and just do the minimum of whats needed so they cash in the money.with all that beeing said i cant recommend this game anymore simply because i dont see any future for the game and if u think about buying it you are better of not to. the only thing that kept me playing sometimes was with friends and even then i didnt really have fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-21,0,0,118,False,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is a lot of fun. You definitely have to stay on your toes and never stay still because late game there are a lot of snipers. If you're new to the game just accept that people will see you before you see them in most cases and give it a few days before you get too frustrated. I would definitely recommend playing with friends if you can. Duo's and Squads are a lot of fun and it helps to learn the ropes with someone else. This game is also very life like there is drop on your bullets you can hear where people are around you (like the floor and room of an appartment and whether their crouched prone or even bare foot) you can also customize your weapons with silencers magazines scopes etc. You can also do friendly fire!

2017-11-26,2,1,1620,True,Recommended,Been playing this game since the first month of it's early access release and it's been one of the best experiences I've had in my 9 years of PC gaming. The game developers are committed to pleasing the gaming community who are playing the game with constant updates and implementations of things the community has asked for. (i.e. vaulting lag fixing/optimization...etc) This game can be played totally on your own or you can group up with 1 or 3 other players and jump into a 8km x 8km map that is filled with an infinite amount of opportunities and chances to be the last man standing in a all out battle royale between/with you and 99 other players. The only thing that is a nuissance right now is the amount of hacking but the game is committed to preventing this from continuing with more and more bans each day.Give it a try though!

2017-12-20,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,Truth be told if it weren't for the game's poor optimisation effectively pointless hit registration streamer supremacy and plague of cheaters I'd recommend this game. However all of those problems are common in this game. Their methods of blocking cheaters was alright until they started blocking ReShade among other ridiculous measures. Not to mention that the aforementioned streamer supremacy is extremely common Twitch streamers just out right get priority over people who don't stream. In all honesty if you want uber realistic gunplay don't look here play the Arma 3 mod that started it all. If you want simple gameplay that is actually interesting even when you're not in a gunfight play Fortnite. There's absolutely no need to take a second look at PUBG in my opinion seeing as Fortnite is excellent and free plus Arma 3 is 10.99 on sale not to mention all the other things you can do in it. There's also Just Cause 3 Battle Royale which despite an almost complete lack of players is actually quite enjoyable.NEW Cuisine Royale's out now and I'm blown away by how much better it is than PUBG despite being an April Fools' joke and a free game (at the time of writing).

2017-08-15,0,0,0,True,Not Recommended,I know they run on different engines but when games like Metal Gear Solid 5 run on high graphics flawlessly with almost no frame drops on my system I find it intensely unsatisfying that a game like PUBG suffers from massive frame drops with textures failing to load and unbearably long loadtimes that are so long that by the time I get into the game the airplane is already halfway across the map I have to question why this game has the balls to even do a crate/key microtransaction system.In my opinion the most important part of a multiplayer experience is optimization and compatibility. Games like Overwatch Rainbow 6 Counter Strike they are all amazingly compatible with a multitude of systems. When people play games with a competitive nature the last thing they want to worry about is falling through the building when the building they were attempting to land on failed to load in time.And before you ask yes I am intending on eventually upgrading my computer's graphics card amongst other things but it isn't currently on my top list of priorities. I heard a lot of good things about PUBG a lot of my favourite Youtubers have played it and it looks very enjoyable when it runs right. I was fortunate enough to have a halfway decent match in this game before I decided it was not woth it right now. But PUBG has a lot of problems that they need to fix before I'll ever look into getting it again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every update makes it worse and worse. The latest update ruined it all. Game crashes uses too much resources servers are super slow and not responsive at all. I get it that servers are expensive the staff has to be paid but come on you literally had one job. Why are you pushing game modes events experimental servers when you can't even fix a normal match?What has to be fixed Player movement is too slow Car mechanics and fuel consumption Overall optimization Server response time just upgrade it lol Some weapons mechanics is just silly Don't push updates that make it even worse 3D sound3D SoundWhen people first told me this game doesn't have 3D optimized sound I thought they were joking. This game without 3D is like a car without the exhaust. It's loud sounds like crap and eventually ruins the engine. The same is happening with Your game. The engine itself is spectacular the best engine I have ever seen so far. But your use of the best engine ever is poor.UpdatesImagine if Facebook pushed out an update that gives users more games allows them to change profile colours etc. But in the meantime it ruins the whole platform on how poorly it's made overloads the servers and makes the platform unusable. But now we can change colours am I right? You're doing the same thing. Except Facebook's base platform is in the perfect state while your base state (battle royale mode) is crap. It's so badly made it's incredible. Such low level optimization crap mechanics and slow characters I haven't seen yet. And then I see a new update is available I download it and now I have EVENT mode. Yay! Let's play some battle royale! Oh wait it's more broken than ever.MechanicsYou're using Unreal Engine 4 right? One of the best engines if not the best EVER made. And yet your use of it is like using a free open source game making software found on Google and downloaded on Softonic with an extra Microsoft Explorer toolbar that you can't get rid of. PUBG and Fortnite were both built on Unreal Engine 4 yet Fortnite has superior optimization and performance while PUBG has literally none. Just make a good use of it otherwise what's the point of using Unreal Engine 4 since the game performs like made in Unity free edition.PROS Fun to play on a super high end PC due to crap optimizationCONS Everything related to optimization resource usage servers back end &amp front end developmentIf you need any help in making the thing work contact me.

The gunplay although not the best is super fun and for the most part fair (except going against cheaters). Every part of this game is pretty great of course there's bugs and other frustrating parts such as vehicles and some falling glitches.

2017-07-28,0,0,235,True,Not Recommended,It really sucks that I cannot recommend this game to others because I've enjoyed it so far a lot the rush you get at the end of a match is awesome. However the last month has been filled with drama and politics from the developers. They went back on their promise to not introduce microtransactions until final release. This part doesn't bother me so much but what does bother me is that the way the crate system is going to work you spend $2.50 per key to unlock a crate which has a random PIECE of a set. So you might get a shirt or shoes or whatever which feels too much like they're nickle and diming the playerbase. Furthermore items from these crates that you have to buy keys for are real money exclusive as in you cannot aquire them unless you spend real money.More importantly though is the devs are extremely ban happy and there are instances where players have been banned for killing twitch streamers who then claim they're stream sniping. No actual evidence or anything the streamer just claims the person that just killed them is stream sniping and then all their followers mass report the person (which is a community problem) and the devs greenlight the ban. Heck even if you speak out against the game on forums or discord you'll get banned from those without batting an eye.I really want this game to do good but as it stands the actions of the devs and the community are both pointing towards a disasterous tailspin.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-25,0,0,495,False,Recommended,I have nearly 350 hours and it's time to make a review.PUBG to me is like that perfect balance between an ARMA game and a game like H1Z1. It has that tactical and survival part from ARMA then spiced a little up with some stuff from games like H1Z1. ARMA II is by far one of my favourite games to date so being able to play a game like PUBG that has some of the same aspects as ARMA is amazing.I can nothing but recommed this game but then again at this point I think we all have it(I even own 2 copies) of course the game has it's flaws like any game does.The thrill and the overall experience of being top 10 makes this game so unique feeling your heart pumping faster and faster as people get picked of one by one is one of the greatest feelings in the world and then the storm calms down when you finally get that sweet marinated chicken dinner.Me and many of my friends cannot wait to see what devs and future modders have in store for us I'm mostly hoping for an survival mode or do i dare say an DayZ like mode o Just buy it already.

All of my deaths feel fair and lack of skill on my part. Other reviewers exaggerate the condition of this game. The game does have issues with stability. I'd say out of 10 games the game crashes atleast once however when you load into the game it plays out fine. Having a good computer with an SSD helps against the stability issues but does not eliminate them. The stability is especially troublesome when playing with four players. PUBG is contrary to other reviews constantly being updated on all fronts not only cosmetics.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Many of my compatriots bring the shame to us and they just use Steam as a launcher of PUBG DDDDIt's not about the honour of Chinese nationality. It's simply a Chinese player want to get his game experience back. I pay for the games just like most of you. There's no reason that I get a different experience.

I've never seen blatant cheats but when i watch a deathcam and see the guy that killed me was aiming about 5 feet behind me and yet every bullet hits well that's a pretty obvious aimbot. When I make it into the top 10 on solo and see someone 50 yards off fire enough SCAR shots into my head with no recoil for a quick kill there's an issue. I'll change my recommendation the day I stop seeing cheaters.Loot boxes.

There's no real reason or feeling of progression or achievment. If I wanted to play a pointless slaughter house I'd play quake or UT4 ( UT4 is free on the epic games launcher).

I feel I've been unfairly killed more than once such as when in a house at the top of the stairs after clearing the upstairs and somehow someone magically shoots me. I am also a little ticked off that I worked so hard to get into the top 10 and the stats don't show it. That is hugely disappointing. What is the point of stats if you don't record them accurately? A top ten leap frogs you literally tens of thousands of places on the leader board.There is also some lag and that might explain the unfair kills.

Yes a punch (yeah so don't give up if you are empty handed you can still win!).When flying over the map there is a huge disconnect between where the plane is marked on the map and where you really are so make sure to decide when to jump based on what you see not what the map shows.All things considered I can't seem to stop playing this game.

When you shoot a chinese player in the head with a shotgun six times while they are sitting still only to watch them not die turn around and shoot you in the face killing you the issue should be addressed.Not to mention the issue with the massive amounts of cheaters coming from China. BattleEye has the numbers on this. 99% of the cheaters come from China according to BattleEye itself. (Look it up). And Brendan Greene (creator of the game) is not concerned with this stating people in China have a different mentality about cheating. (Which makes it OK I guess). They are pathetically partial to streamers. (Because they bring advertising thus money). The majority of players don't stream so they don't matter as much.If you critizise the issues with PUBG odds are Brendan Greene will call you racist xenophobic or some variation of that without addressing the criticism.

Getting it denied by yet another kill happening when you are already behind cover for 2 seconds feels terrific on the other hand which leads us to the bad part of PUBG which is still a game with BETA like performance no matter how good your pc runs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-02-21,0,0,252,False,Not Recommended,lets start off Pubg is an intense fun battle royal game it has a good variety of guns and and tools to use at yur dispoisal that can make for a fun time with friends. Aswell as the crates you can be awarded sell on the steam market for a pretty penny. But thats where the Good parts End and the reasons on why I would not recommend Pubg or Plunkbat. Pubg servers suffer from constant connection issues and laggy portions. On top of that you will more often then not get the specific map you hate 9 games out of 10. I think the worst part though is the blatent hacking that runs rampant in pubg. Dieing in this type of game can be rather rage inducing especally because alot of the time it is due to your own poor decisions but one thing that is more rage inducing is dying to someone who is clearly hacking. More than 90% of hackers come from china according to battleeyes own reports on the subject and although these problems have been brought up to Brenden Green he has refused to do anything about it. To add insult to injurys is not only are these Chinese players hacking but they are joining North American Servers Causing a mass Ping issue which practically makes them time travalers on top of the hack yet Brenden Green refuses to region lock China choosing instead to call his american player base Xenophobes for not wanting to play with Laggy Chinese Hackers. Overall although PUBG is fun it has to many problems for me to reccomend this game to anyone. Also,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-08,0,0,758,True,Recommended,Product received for free. If you have a really good pc and don't mind playing in third person this game is amazing. However if you're like me and have to play fps get ready to be dissapointed. For whatever reason first person perspective or FPP has crippling lag the first few minutes of the game. You can't pick up loot consistantly you don't get good hit registration and you die six feet around corners. This does MOSTLY go away after the early game but you are still slapped in the face with audio imbalance like the deafening buggy deafening plane deafening rain and deafening ear in spawn island. Luckily they give you hotkeys to mute your game but do you really want to have to mute your game when you're driving through the middle of a field during third to last circle? I think not. The game also has chonic bugs not 420 chronic but bugs they can't seem to or don't care to squash. Like not being able to drop a quickdraw mag when you're inventory is full a bug I've encountered since release or car collision mechanics. Despite all this despite Kar 98 bullets going through people despite the joke of a home screen and the awful UI despite the terrible lack of optimization I would still have to recommend this game.

2018-06-21,0,0,260,False,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game in its current state. I used to play this game a lot with my friends (it's one of my top 10 most played on Steam) but now it just sits in my library occassionally downloading an update every couple of weeks or so. I went from playing about 25 35+ full games a week (each game being roughly 20 30 minutes) about 6 months ago to only playing 2 games in the last 2 months. The same problems that plagued it almost a year ago when I got it in early access (optimization and bugs) are still there. The new weapons cosmetics attachments etc. are not enticing enough to bring me back to this game which I had so much hope for.Despite being taken out of Early Access almost half a year ago it still is as poorly optimized and bug filled as when I bought it a year ago. For every bug that is fixed there is a new one that takes its place in the next update. Vehicles are where the bugs are most prominent but I have also experienced problems with the buildings not loading in on time and my character model getting stuck inside a wall.If I want a somewhat decent performance out of the game I need to play it on low or medium settings to get 45 60 fps however this is on the same computer that can run the Witcher 3 on Ultra and Battlefield 1 on High settings and still manage 55 60 fps while looking much more visually pleasing. There has not been one update in the last year that has made any significant improvement to optimization in this game.All while this is happening they are pushing out new cosmetics new weapons and new attachments changing the meta. Which by itself isn't a problem. The problem is that they are doing this while ignoring some of the longest running and most prominent problems of the games. I get the argument that an art team is different than a game design team but PUBG has made literally hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no reason why they can't higher more people and get them up to speed to fix things. If it's an issue of wanting to make money there's a lot more money to be made off of a game that has a strong and stable player base over many years than trying to milk all of the money you can out of a dying player base. Just take a look at Rainbow Six Siege and League of Legends for examples.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is so much potential for this to be a great game but it just seems like the devs have no intention of ever making this happen. $30 is insanely expensive for a game that plays like earlyearlyearly access. Obnoxiously long matches that almost always come to an end via glitch server lag or hackers. I would much rather play this than Fortnite in terms of theme and style but it's just... bad.

I discovered the Battle Royal style which I love so much but this game is just dying they spend more time asking themselves how to make money with the skins (cfr Shroud's and Doc's skins) than actually working on the game itself. We had to wait for over 4 months for them to put a Map Selection Button !!!!!!! Cheaters were top leaderboards for 3 consecutive seasons (cfr QQun cases).

OR LIKE MANY PLAYERS ASK'd was instead of banning players take all the reviews of actual cheaters reported and just put them in their own sever. that way they didnt know they got banned and just constantly just match up with eachother. once the whole cheating thing gets fixed it will be an excellent game. ive come to the point i dread on even coming on thinking Damn i wonder if i will die by a cheater or not. its a mentality. thank god XBOX isnt suffering like we are at least.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-05,0,0,324,True,Recommended,At first I didn't like this game and was going to get a refund...Now I wish I had taken the refund. I die and die from little kids hidding in toilets or hiding behind rocks. They only use the double barrel shotgun and I get killed 1 hit. Armour on the game is pointless as wearing a plastic bag over your head and torso they literally do NOTHING. In addition to all this bullcrap the framrate on that game is worse than me trying to play witcher 3 with my potato computer they really need to fix that All in all it's sorta grown on me and I have come to enjoy the game somewhat.

Even more the developers seem to be absolutely insistant on ticking off the community by adding and then REMOVING a core feature they have been clamoring for map selection. Why on earth they would add it only to remove it again is beyond me. There really is no excuse.While it doesn't have any effect on my personal opinion of the game as I'm not into cosmetics a lot of people are pretty unhappy with the new crate/key system as well. If you're into that sort of thing take a look at some other reviews to see what it's turned into.The game is an absolute blast when it works right. Until it works right with more consistency you might want to stay away._______________________Update This is some real EA (Electronic Arts) style garbage here ""The Event Pass was introduced to let players experience a different way to enjoy new PUBG content.""Charging a third of the original price of the game for this when there are so many other issues that need fixing is a giant slap in the face. You're already making money off cosmetics and crates. I will be the first to defend a developer releasing paid content to keep their game running over the long term. But this game is only about six months out from the official release and it still has SO many perfomance issues.This isn't and has never been free to play.

I would recommend this game in a heart beat. BUT... There is a huge negative that cripples this game like Franklin D. Roosevelt' polio and that is CHINESE F*****G HACKERS. They absolutely plague this game with their over abundant presence in lobbys that predominently would speak english (NA and Oceanic servers) and their hacks.This game would be so much more bearable if the hacking was actually successfully cut off. Not to mention region locking or at the very least ping capping the servers that belong to each region.PUBG Corporation has milked their cash cow long enough. They've lined their pockets. It's time they finally lay down some law and fix this otherwise amazing game.OVERALL I love this game but I will not recommend this game purely because of the amount of hackers and non English speaking players on predominently English speaking servers.

You will lose players.Bluehole have only worked on marketable features like weapon skins cosmetics and new content... instead of fixing issues that are detrimental they work on mission passes.They decided to not region lock the game they decided not to fix netcode they also decided not fix a bunch of bugs and instead added new maps and content that all have the same bugs. They've decided recently to focus on certain stuff that matters. But the bread has already been burnt. The idea that we accepted ingame purchases for a game that isn't free to play... is bad.For instance the community wanted progression and they gave us a paid event pass. They dont need to charge for the pass but they will..For those who have PUBG keep playing it while you can.

The items may be cosmetic with no gameplay effect but they still effect the player experience (unless you'd be happy with a textureless block of polygons as your avatar aesthetics do factor into your experience) and the way they are implemented is both unrewarding and uncomfortably close to gambling seeing as rare items can be sold for large amounts of real world money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-04-07,0,0,357,True,Recommended,The most balanced and well made Battle Royale game out there. No Surprise coming from PU )From the movement to the gunplay to the UI it's all very well done and simple to use. Coming from a survival player's viewmpoint playing games like like arma 2 arma 3 dayz/SA H1Z1 etc. This is the most polished and well thought out game i've played in a long time and it's rapidly turned into one of my favorite games. I fully place my faith in PU and the team behind this game They've already showcased their ability to fix different bugs and problems so i hope and trust that its not going to be like the dayz SA dev.

2018-06-30,0,0,1384,False,Recommended,"This game is very much based on luck. I note some have the reflexes of a cat and eye sight of a hawk but for mere mortals luck is all you have. Some games you die early because you are unlucky to land near someone who finds a gun before you can. Other games you can be in the last 10 because you managed to stay out of sight. Very rarely you might manage to shoot someone before they shoot you but it often comes down to what weapons and armour you each managed to find before happening across each other. When you do well you think you're improving until the next game proves how unlucky it can be. I've played so much now that I know ""improving"" is an illusion.So while I say the game is largely luck it's still definitely fun.I also feel this is what war would be like those who get to come home are mostly lucky. With so many people shooting each other winners can rarely boast their victory is because of how clever they were.I have to play this game without headphones. And that puts me at a serious disadvantage as I can't tell where shots are coming from I have to be Mr Hidey! Why no headphones? Because the intense atmosphere in the game makes me literally jump when all is quiet I'm creeping around and a shot rings out nearby plus my character gives a startled grunt when hit! This upsets my wifey who is calmy sitting next to me reading because she jumps too since I jumped!The reason I play this game so much is it's the first game I worked out how to earn money from. You earn Battle Points by playing the longer you survive the more points you get per game. Then you can buy loot crates with the points and then sell them on the Steam market for real money. While a smart person would save this money to buy games I'm blowing it all on Trading Cards! And not because I care about Trading Cards but because when you get a full set of Trasing Cards you can craft a Badge. And each Badge you create helps you level up in Steam. Why? I'm a closet RPG fiend who likes levelling? I just like big numbers? Who knows!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-18,0,0,304,False,Not Recommended,In my honest opinion this game was great. So much fun. That was until they became more focused on putting new pretty things into the game instead of actually worrying about the state of the game. Almost every game I play there's someone cheating whether it be with a clicking macro ESP auto aim or often times all of the above. There were actually a lot less cheaters in the beginning months of the game where you'd expect there to be less anti cheat. But alas it's nearly an every game thing. It's ruining the game and I'm starting to have no fun with it. It gets really lame to continuously spend 10+ minutes looting just to get 4 tapped from across the map every game. And if it isn't the players it's the server just being garbage. I recently played a game where I shot a guy with a Kar in the head and watched it hit the ground behind his head. He then later challenged me where I had 5 shots into his body before he even fired and I died instantly and on the kill cam I allegedly hit him once and my internet is completely fine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-26,0,0,28,False,Not Recommended,I really want to like this game. I've tried. So much. It's just. So. Bad.The biggest problem is the cheaters. They are in literally every game and the devs don't give two flying rips about it because it brings them revenue (they ban a cheater said cheater has to buy another copy of the game and they do because cheating is profitable for the cheaters too even if they're having to buy new copies of the game every so often).The next biggest problem is the gun mechanics. I've played games ranging from PUBG to CoD to BF to Squad to CS etc. None of them have worse gun mechanics than PUBG. Sometimes it's simply impossible to hit someone. I'm not going to say I'm the best gamer or even great or good but I know I'm better than being dead on with a reticle and missing. And there's simply nothing worse than unloading an entire clip on a guy and not hitting him then he turns snaps to your head and one shots you. Just awful.If these two things could be fixed this game would be completely different. The bugs and other weird things I can get over.

2018-05-29,0,0,115,False,Not Recommended,I remember when Playerunkown's first came out... it blew my mind. It truly appeared that online gaming would change forever (did not know about H1ZI at the time). With that being said I did not buy this game because 1. I was waiting for a sale (two years later PUBG still thinks they are too good for a sale even though reviews are mostly mix). Which gets me to Number 2. Hackers. Just read down the comments and certainly you will come across some very bitter players. They have every right to be when PUBG is played as intended it is an amazing experience that changes everytime. Unfortunately hackers really RUIN this game whether they are Chinese Russian or American I am unsure but one thing is for certain none likes a cheater. Especially when games can last anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. Doing all the work only to be gun down by some dude behind a rock who MAGICALLY knows when you will be out in the open and kills you / your teammates with a headshot in the very same way is ridiculous.Fortunately I DID NOT BUY this game my friend got it for me because he wanted competent teammates. I do enjoy playing this game when everyone is playing FAIR but as you can see we are still having issues.So bottom line game is fun if you are able to play with other players on the same ground. Game gets frustrating because of cheaters and the fact that they never put this game on sale despite these issues makes me question the developers intentions. They promise gameplay improvements so we shall see...Also lootcrates are a ING JOKE in this game... you earned a crate with your battlepoints that you got in game GREAT! NOW BUY A KEY WITH REAL MONEY TO ACTUALLY OPEN IT BECAUSE YEAH!So if you are on the fence about PUBG literally just go play Fortnite. It's a free battle royale game sure you don't get first person / vehicles. However both can be enjoyed in their own right and at least with Fortnite you don't have to hate yourself for spending 30 bucks on a hacker / run simulator. Also fortnite is way more optimized and offers a new mode of play almost evey week. Conclusion Blue best un themselves or else they will be the first developer in history to define a genre and fail it completely at the same time. They really need to focus on polishing this game.

2018-07-07,0,0,520,False,Recommended,This is the most difficult recommend I've given.On one hand the game has it's fair share of problems. Vehicles bug out and kill your squad people shoot you from behind walls textures don't load sometimes the game is rampant with hackers the devs have a penchant for being greedy.On the other hand it's still so much fun and there's no other Battle Royale experience like it especially with friends.I've tried plenty of Battle Royale games H1Z1 Totally Accurate Battlegrounds Fortnite but none of them hit the feeling PUBG gives me. The bad stuff nearly doesn't bother me as much as you'd think when it boils down to it. The game doesn't require additional purchases to play (not that I'm advocating a cosmetic only system in a game that costs $40 already) the textures not loading and people shooting through walls happens maybe once in 20 matches for me and you can use the buggy vehicles for some pretty dumb things.There's the feeling you get when you win as well. Maybe I just get it because I don't win a lot but it's still refreshing and exhilarating when you kill the last person and you can ride that high for the rest of the play session with your friends.That's the other point this game is WAY more fun with friends especially good friends. Finding all the attachments to tweak a gun to your preference moving through the map as a group calling out flanks and positions it's a nice feel to it.This game won't be for everyone.

2018-07-07,0,0,191,False,Not Recommended,Alright lets break down the average PlayerUnknown Battleground experience. After almost 200 hours I think I have a solid idea of what its all about.Experience 1 (most common)You land and if you land with other people you will probably be immediately killed. Experience 2 (semi common)You land with your team you kit up spend 20 minutes not seeing anyone you are fully geared. First encounter with people everyone is killed generally 2 people out of 4 won t even get a shot off before incapped. Experience 3 (rare)Luck. If luck is on your side no other reason you will get the drop on your enemies get good loot and make it to number 1. Why am I not going to recommend this game after playing almost 200 hours? Well in short my friends enjoyed this game I played it because its all they wanted to play. Did I enjoy it? Sure yeah it has its appeal and can be fun. Was most of my experience with PUBG die immediately or die after getting fully kitted yeah. That was 60 percent of the time I d play the game. Am I good? No not really so bear that in mind. So here are the consHorrible support and optimization BlueHole seems to think it s a great idea to do 3 6 hour maintenance during peak player time on West Coast time zone. I can t tell you how many nights my squad wanted to play PUBG and guess what we couldn t. It showed me how little they care for their American fans and players. They do not give a Gunplay is embarrassing/input lag with movement and picking up items This game has the worst combat I have ever had the displeasure of playing its all random. You either hit what you are aiming for and every shot misses even though you are dead on or it works because RNG or latency. There is no reliability with combat it s a grab bag of general trash and disappointment. The movement system feels like you are walking on mush when you hit spacebar it takes a second for you to jump when you want to pick up something it takes a couple seconds to register. Its all just awful. Lack of Content 3 maps since release 1 of them Mianmar (Mexico) is plain trash. They had to remove map selection because everyone veto d it. No one wants to play it there is no cover and its too frikken big. The new map is better but it feels like a cluster . Their first map was the best. I wanted to like PUBG more than I was actually able to. I see the fun and I see the appeal but in the end it is an absolute waste of time made by devs more interested in selling 6 dollar parachute skins instead of actually improving the combat or server problems. Hard pass on this game play Cuisine Royale or Totally Accurate Battlegrounds instead both have better combat.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-21,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,This game could be amazing but the developer refuses to address the issue of huge numbers of chinese players with terrible ping invading all other servers and ruining the fun. A fair few of them cheat too but the thing is it's hard to tell because of their crazy latency. The death cam will show them shooting empty air. Each game is a significant time investment and to be killed by someone who's aim snaps to you across the whole map is not a rewarding conclusion. The developers greed is ruining this game.

2017-12-05,0,0,147,True,Not Recommended,I am a player from China. This game can be so hot today there is no doubt that it has its own competitive and entertaining nature.We can not only show the skill in the game but also experience the fun of play with friends.This game has many advantages but I still gave the negative review. It's not because of the optimization problem or the server issues of the game it's the game developers' disregard of cheating. Cheating is an unavoidable problem for FPS games. But now there is so many cheaters in this game and their attitude is too rampant. This phenomenon has reached an unmanageable point. A part of well known game hosts are publicly using cheating programs on live webcasts. Now it has been found and denounced by many netizens But the Blue Hole Company turned a blind eye to it. They never come out to explain as if they were allowed to use the cheating programs legally. More rumors said in the whitelist people on the whitelist will not be detected cheating. For many ordinary game player this argument can not be verified but if it is true it will make all the e sports enthusiasts angry. The negative review is to tell the people who saw this evaluation the game developers are not only doing nothing with the problem of cheating but also tolerate some of the hosts' cheating behavior which is intolerable. It is the embodiment of the lack of moral bottom line in Blue Hole Company. I believe that what I said above is also what many Chinese netizens want to say.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Which has just killed my enjoyment of the game. The lack of region lock is a large oversite in my personal opinion.Update. 07/07/2018I will start this update by saying that the developers have finally managed to get the hacking/cheating under control for the most part However I still can't give this game a positive review due to the poor optimization and unnecessarily heavy demands it puts on your GPU and the poor upkeeping done by the developers who are more concerned with pushing new content then fixing the bugs and issues that have plagued this game since launch. Im not going to go into detail about all the gripes i have with a game but i find the laggy/buggy menu's to be especially frustrating on a regular basis.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-07-14,0,0,1122,False,Not Recommended,Brief synopsis You parachute down onto the battlefield and have to scavange quickly for gear and a weapon. Then like hunger games you kill the other 99 players hoping to be the ONE to survive. A circle restricts game areas and gets smaller as the time goes by. If caught outside of the area you slowly take damage until you die. It's only one map but the replay value of where you drop in what weapons you end up with where the other players drop are all key. Then surviving is entirely different. You only get one life so make it count! I recommend starting off in a squad to learn the buttons before you just roll into a game solo and get repeatedly killed it's easy to get frustrated but the payout is worth it. Knowing when to move when to fight and when to let people pass is all important but knowing how to shoot is a skill in its own. ***UPDATE*** Hackers have taken over the servers. Until this is fixed although this is my favorite game on steam it needs to be fixed. 7/10 games a night with hackers is unacceptable. This can be fixed by either a. Making items untradeable (but not profitable for bluehole) or b. Putting all new accounts with less than 300 full games into seperate servers. This way the hackers with new accounts are only fighting eachother saving the rest of the players from the punishment. It wont stop all of them but it will certainly slow the hoard of chineese hackers. They talked about banning China for a while since studies show 95% of them are buying the game going to internet cafes' and selling crates for profit and making alot of money in doing so. I love this game but the developers are concously ignoring this problem.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

For me the servers are now terrible although i have good internet. More and more paid crates keep getting added to this game and the new custom gamemodes which you can create yourself are behind a paywall. I find the new sound updates very confusing and can't pinpoint the exact location of the shots like in the early days. In addition the redzone is so loud everytime i'm in the redzone i mute the sound of the game because it hurts so much in my ears. If you want to play battle royale I recommend Realm Royal(Free) or Totally Accurate Battlegrounds(5$).

You can break every game mechanic (speed hack teleport hack aim wall healing cast time reduced to instant instead of 6sec etc..)They banned 1M+ cheaters in January alone (lol wtf) but in game it is still the same you face at least 1 cheater in every game just watch op.gg match history and see the disaster. 100% headshot accuracy players 1 km + pistol headshot kills etc.Early February 2018 Anti cheat update didn't fix much.Game is currently unplayable for the ladder grind part. If your goal is to play 100% for fun winning or not I totally recommend you to buy &amp play this game with friends good stress and even if the game is young as said above it is developing fast because Bluehole is working hard on it.I personally uninstalled the game until next year.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-04,0,0,409,False,Not Recommended,"I write this review as I m watching a replay of me getting quick scoped with iron sights on a kar from 800m away (obvious aimbot.) Last game I was teamed in a solo match on a North American server by a group of Chinese kids that were screeching ""CHINA NUMBA 1"" as they looted my body. This is a basic summary of half of the matches you get. You can't play squad as a solo player because you're going to get paired with people that only speak Chinese and you can t communicate at all so what's the point of playing with a team solo you're going to get teamed and in any game type you're going to be victim of some bs hacker which despite bluehole saying they're getting rid of them they are becoming more abundant. The game would be fantastic if these issues were fixed. However whenever you bring any of them to the attention of bluehole they either say that its not an issue that they're fixing it when they really aren t or that you're racist for being against having team members that are not from your countries server and that don't speak your language on your team.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-05-10,0,0,536,False,Recommended,After 500+ hours of PUBG I can make a decent review of the game. The graphics are great the game can play at a solid 60fps or 144fps if you have a decent rig. The gameplay can vary between the three maps that are already out the Sanok the fast paced map and the original two maps that play very slow. The new map that just came out at the time of this review. Gun mechanics and movement are decently balanced and solid. Overall this has the potential to be a great game. The biggest problem with Player Unknown's BattleGrounds is the terrible server quality and the poorly optimized fps issues that come with the game. For me at least the game has grown stale because of the lack of content and the lack of support by the developers to continually optimize the game. The game is fun but it can be very difficult to continually enjoy because of these small things. I personally have stopped playing because there isn't much to enjoy once you have explored the whole map. Chicken dinners are great but you can only stomach before it makes you sick and never want to comeback. If the developers decide to improve their game I will be open to returning. For now I'm sticking to more enjoyable titles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game breaking bugs broken mechanics and lifeless textures will keep anyone hooked onto this masterpiece for countless hours. The fact that 90% of the map is simply open fields and deserts forces the player to think and keep on their toes which i believe was an excellent choice by the devs. I've heard a few friends complain that the design of the map simply forced them to land into areas of the map that had buildings and loot which rendered the exploration of the rest of the map to be pointless however i couldn't disagree more. I'd happily admit that a solid two hour margin out of my nine hours played was just me running in emptiness. During all that time i was shocked and astounded at the beautiful greys browns and faint greens i was surrounded by. I was glad that the developers didn't finish the game before releasing it like the majority of game companies do. The glitches are still not fixed from what i know which is why i would recommend it to anyone that has a good PC. 11/10 IGN,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-20,0,0,167,True,Recommended,Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is a new entry in the still young battle royale genre. Offered by Bluehole a new South Korean company PUBG feels like the first real battle royale game to come on the market.Airdropped onto the soviet island of Erengal you and 99 other players must fight to the death until only one of you is left all while a circle closes in herding the survivors closer together and killing those who refuse to follow its path.After landing at a location you chose you must gather any weapons ammo healing and utilities that you can find. If you don t you ll be left without a weapon and a free kill for other players. Armed with whatever you could find you must either find a spot to hide at or find a vehicle to get inside the circle. The circle is a force field that gets smaller as the game progresses. If you fail to get inside the circle your health will slowly chip away until you either get inside the circle or die trying. If you fail to get inside the circle your health will slowly chip away until you either get inside the circle or die trying. You are then forced to either kill or be killed. Encounters are fast and frantic especially in the late game. Without good armour you ll die in one stray headshot. If you survive to the last 10 players you focus on survival in the hopes of being the final victor.The game can be played solo in duos or in squads of 3 or 4 allowing for playing with friends. This leads to memorable moments as you get great shots or all get shot by one person with a pistol and a frying pan.The game isn t perfect though its early access nature means that the game has many technical issues ranging from crashes and bad performance. Server performance is also poor when compared to other games but this is understandable as the server has to keep track of 100 people at once.Graphics look like any other early access game in the Unreal engine unremarkable but serviceable.

2017-11-07,0,0,292,True,Not Recommended,"Loved this game until it got infested with hackers...ashamed blue hole has done this.i agree and back this previous review""While immensely flawed from the begining PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz Warz and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.

2017-07-17,0,0,214,False,Not Recommended,Where do I start? Hackers? Buggy game that should have not been released? Well lets start. Rumor has it PUGB is running a verison of Unreal engine that has an exploit hackers can use to get undetected by battleye and what not so If you want a hack free game have fun waiting for the fix because this game has been out almost a year and no sign of fix. Whats worse about it is there is a report system however it will does nothing. The game is considered released however it plays like a pre alpha. So many glitches which affect gameplay exist. I honestly forgive the devs of No Man's Sky after playing PUGB. At least it was playable.Another thing is this game needs a region lock like Starcraft 2 pre 3.0 where NA players are forced on NA etc. Having a lock decreases the chances of someone having an advantage since the lag and ping will be managable etc.Other than that.

2018-04-10,1,1,213,False,Not Recommended,"When I was first introduced to this last man standing shooter game I was quite interested in PUBG. But after playing it for almost 200 hours the game itself starts to get me bored. I am not saying the game won't give you the feeling of thrill when you are playing. I'm saying after making such great amount of money before even releasing this game Bluehole wasn't adding a lot of new stuff to the game. So now everytime I play this game it's either I drop at a popular spot and get a gun and kill the unlucky guy who didn't get a gun when they landed or it's me who got killed. Also the company really didn't work on their weapons they made a great amount of money by selling copies of the game and now they don't even work on the actual ""in game content"" which could be adding more variety of weapons to the game. Instead they try to make more money by giving weapon skins. In comparison there is another last man standing shooter game that is quite popular right now which is called ""Fortinite"". It is a free game first of all and in my opinion this game has already surpassed PUBG in every way. While PUBG is trying to make more and more money Fortnite is keeping the game free and is about to unlock a PVE mode for every player in 2018. You can still pay the game to get cooler skins but it's not like PUBG that you will have to be really lucky to get what you want because you can only buy crates in game and get random items otherwise the price in the steam market is unbelievably high for a decent item. ""You buy what you want in Fortnite"". Fortnite also keeps adding new stuff to the game. This is why it doesn't make me feel ""repetitive"" to play. It normally has an update on every thursday sometimes there will be a new skin adding to the game a new type of gun a new rarity of an existing type of gun or even a new landing spot on the map. On weekends there will be a special play mode which I found out that PUBG recently copied this feature. There are so much more that Fortnite has done better than PUBG. You can see by yourself that there are more viewers in Fortnite sections than in PUBG section on twitch recently. I don't want to say I hate PUBG I will still play it with my friends sometimes but I personally prefer Fortnite. In the long run if Bluehole doesn't start to respond to the need of their players like what Fortnite is doing and really developing their game I don't think it is going to last longer than 2 years.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Fewer things are more irritating than spending 20 minutes running towards an ever shrinking safe zone only to get one shotted by the end The Butterface Cheating cheaters who cheat. Although many online games of this nature suffer from aimbots speed hacks and so on they stand out so much more in PUBG due to the nature of the elimination system I live in hope that this will be dealt with in the the near future. The implementation of the microtransaction random cosmetic item system was also suspect in an early access paid game but its not like it makes it pay2win. All in all.

It felt like such a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer world but as time passes by you come to a realisation this game isnt getting any better. Many of its player base gave it a chance arguing it was still in early access but bugs and issues which were in the game from the start are still there and nothing is changing. The only thing which is changing is the amount of skins purchasable in the game starting out light for their events its grown into literally not even being able to have access to even the most basic skins because they are overshadowed by the vast amount of loot boxes which require keys. An example of this is the in game currency you use to obtain loot crates they used to be free to open but require more and more currency to open but now you arent able to get any of these crates which are free to open because they are layered under locked boxes. The only change which seems to be happening is whenever you log into the game you are greeted by more and more advertisement for some way to give more money to bluehole. While the servers are a mess frame rates are low bugs are abundant in every map they release. Its just saddening that this game has so much potential if they would just focus more on the game rather than paid loot boxes and event passes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-11,0,0,396,True,Not Recommended,So this game is out of early access and they are still fixing issues. Optimization is still very much an issue. Even with great Specs on your machine will not help this game still drops frames. Poor load times on items when you enter structures will look empty like someone else beat you to it then suddenly poof more PANTS! Inconsistencies in damage output is mind boggling with point blank shotgun hits doing less damage than a single punch to the face. New and unnecessary weapons that usually are not worth swapping for the already exsisting weapons. On that topic why bring in more weapons when there are already other things that need addressing before I could say this is ready for the public. I would say this game is pretty much still in early access. I can be fun and also very aggrivating I have gotten my fair share in Chicken Dinners with and without my group of friends but....... there is so much that needs to be done before I can give this game a recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The map is perfect size if you like arma 3 you will love this because it's built on the same Engine. Though i must admit that the textures seem very off sometimes and it's sometimes too much ''popping'' in the rendering. But overall if you play with a friend this game becomes the best game ever.i'll give it 7/10 because the textures and the popping when it renders gets kind of annoying and the fps drops too much atm.My rig is GeForce GTX 980Ti Founders Edition16Gb 1600Mhz Rami7 4790k Z97 gaming 3 motherboardAnd i run the game on ultra with 60+fps with fps drops here and there so there can definatly be some better optimization done here.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-09,0,0,1176,False,Not Recommended,Ever since a week after the official 1.0 release cheaters have been abound. Two excellently designed maps and a large assortment of gear and weapons make this a great game but with a black eye due to seemingly reactive measures to stop cheating instead of being proactive to keep them from ruining the game in the first place. The first week of 2018 had me encountering BLATENT cheaters about 1/3 rounds and suspected cheaters another 1/3 rounds. Given the slow cautious format generally taken by someone who tries to win each round this is extremely frustrating to play 8 15 minutes just to have to wait another couple minutes followed by several more minutes of getting set up again just to be full auto headshotted again from 100 yards out with an UMP or hip shotted from 300 yards by a guy strafing sideways named Yangatsu_1478 or something of the likes.My recommendation do NOT buy this game until they get the cheating under control which hopefully they do because it is a truely awesome game when cheaters arent around.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-16,0,0,232,True,Recommended,"After Almost 100hours And 3 Solo Wins...This game will you off its that simple. Buy yet after every annoying death or almost wins i keep playing.After every match my heart is usually pumping. Which is a very addicting feeling. No matter what when you drop in with a 100 other people to fight it out. No matter who you are you have a chance. A tiny little sliver of a chance to win. Knowing that the games incredibly fun. Some Advice For New Players Luck Is a big part of it. Dropping in and finding good gear quickly and arming yourself with the best weapons as fast as possible is the ""Meta"" of this game. Inventory management and quickly tabbing in and out and using drag and drop to pick up weapons and gear is CRUCIAL. The Faster you do this the longer you will surivive. It takes time but youll get good at it I will say this is a game of choosing your battles planning out a strategy and being able to adjust to what the game throws at you. If you can overcome all those things and add a little proper marksmenship and i gurantee youll get a win. In terms of any negatives It's Early Access Theres gunna be server issues glitches alot of things that still need to be ironed out. But nothing game breaking. (Just expect it to happen) The Bullet Drop seems a little extreme to me. To hit a moving target 200 300 meters away you have to aim almost 5 feet in front of your target. When i feel like in most games and realisticly aiming for the bodys leading edge would do the trick. Now Ive played almost every battlefield ARMA 2 &amp 3. Im quite familair with extreme and realistic bullet drop in games. Honestly getting used to the bullet drop is what drew me away from the game about 27ish hours in. I just couldent hit anybody at range. Then finally it clicked. It took me quite awhile to get used to the gun play and finallly now around 80 hours in i can almost gaurantee ill make it to the top 5 at least. So at least for me i had a steep learning curve. In Conclusion In the end i feel like PUBG is a solid shooter once you learn its quirks and get used to the gunplay. I can easily say ive had more tense moments and smiles per hour playing this than any other game in years.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is stil early in development so there is still some desync and the game suffers from a few minor lag issues (mostly near the beginning of matches which are also intermittent and short lived). That aside Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a welcome addition to the FPS / 3rd person FPS genre. I haven't outlived the games fun factor even after 455 hours of game time.

2018-04-17,0,0,690,False,Recommended,Ok here is my thoughts after a couple days playtime. This game is a darn amazing accomplishment. They managed to take most of what we loved from the day z mod and boil it down to its base roots. Nemely a no holds barred kill fest. Kill on sight. Kill as fast as you can. And do anything you can NOT toi get killed!. Huge map...check. About 100 p layers...check. Realistic feeling weapons and vehicles...check. I can't speak really for rampant cheatring because I don't get to hung up on trying to find out who is cheating and who isn't. However I can say that out of the many times I have been killed it certainly looks and feels like every death was legit. In my opinion this is one of the best games I have played to date.

Don't go for it while in the hopes of complete satisfaction as a overall game. The optimization sucks awfully. We gotta expect everyone to have super computers for full efficiency. The development team for the potential sake of the happiness of us as a player base or even just as customers to just play the game is bad. Coming up to play the game and we have to deal with a work that has more time and money invested in it to make more money. I'm sorry to make this a two point thing but it is. It's more of a business structure than a product in the gaming industry. (following up the last point) Milking so much money out of events and just purchases and start ups from the early access point but none to show for progress.

Hackers. (Inevitable in multiplayer games but the system dealing with it is pretty meh) The state of being a ""early access game"" as a defense to excuse yourself is ridiculously hilarious.

Just make a choice to go down one path ffs.

The queue for each map says it will last ""around 2 3 minutes"" but a buddy of mine and i were waiting for Sanhok alone for over 15 minutes and decided to give up. I went on my own to see if Erangle and Miramar had the same queue and it took over 10 minutes before i gave up on it.

2018-02-27,0,0,1625,False,Recommended,"What I don't like is ineffective action by the developers. Regular updates about how many thousands of accounts banned except that somehow cheaters have monetized the loot in this game so for every account that gets banned another gets purchased AKA a regular income stream for Blue Hole. I will continue to play but in First Person only and that does separate me from some of my regular team mates. Blue Hole knows what needs to be done and they have been told LOUD AND CLEAR Region Lock China and prevent high pings from playing. I will continue to play until FPP gets infected with cheaters and then I will hang up my headset on this game for good. I cannot however recommend this game in third person at all. People who can shoot me around corners due to ping People who form a team of 8 in solos and proceed to gang bang anyone else People who can instantly lock on to me and shoot the wall im behind with no recoil People who can shoot through the wall im behind People who can shoot directly at the ground 4 km away from where I am and kill me People who can fire a Shotgun like an Assault rifle despite not having a AR equiped Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. theres No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.And if you say none of these people listed above were chinese. Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.Region Lock China Actually set anti cheat to hardware and shadow ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.ability needs added to increase what spectrum can be heard easier which specificlly should be footsteps considering the footstep is buuged sometimes you head them clearly and other times its nonexistant.for my last comment if the entire devoloper team and its ascoiates giveup on further improveing the pubg game they should sign the rights over to a group who would provide more improvements to the game to better its enviroment or atleast lease over the rights so that another group can do so without limitiations by the original owner of said rights. so they can the group can or group of individuals can simply work on bettering the anti cheat fixing repairing bugs adding more details to games registry along with the important thing ping / ms locking out high values such has excessive values of 160ms/ping and region locking /forceing th evast majority of cheaters to thier own servers thus not allowing them to access any server execpt for the specific region. battleye has announced that china is the mainstream of output that cheats and the users of cheats creators of cheats originate from which should be handled with extreme prejudice. ""(definition of extreme prejudice Play on the term terminate with prejudice when an employee's employment is terminated meaning will not rehire employee to same position in future (i.e. prejudiced against rehiring) hence terminate definitively)"" and for any outside of my specific country you have no say in the mater i have announced considering i have my freedom of speech .

I can also see why people compair this game to fortnite because it's literally the same thing but Fortnite has that stupid ""bloom"" thing that I don't like at all building (obviously) shields (which were added to the game later on) and breakable buildings. You could say that Fortnite is more of an arcade game where you will get rushed almost all the time by good players where as PUBG it is a bit more strategic and good placement along with the occasional rush by players that like to play aggresive and not passive. I am not sure how it is for duos and squads but I am still trying to learn the game at the moment and I don't find myself being frustrated as much in this game.I do recommened this game if you like a battle royal (BR) strategy game and if you're coming from fortnite you should play almost the same way when playing this game but probably a bit more passive when you're just starting out. I also hope the developers put out a majour update within the next few months or hopefully this month to tweek some of the glitches and fix a few things... Like the parachute for example I don't really like how it acts when you're landing and is a little confusing which shouldn't really be the case unless they're going for realism then I guess it's ok but I don't really know how a parachute reacts in real life so I can't judge that.I would like to point out one more thing when I started playing I liked to watch the death cam and I thought someone was aim boting players (along with me) but when i watched the full replay he wasn't. He was able to see people more easily than I could and slowing down the replay helped me see that beacuse he didn't notice them right away (if that makes sense) Anyway what i am trying to say is... Don't rely on the death cam alone when reporting someone look at the full game replay as well but they are not really relyable at this point since they also have their glitches and bugs too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I get a feeling of revulsion or profound confustion by someone saying this game is worth $30.00. Even if someone prefers this type of game there is still another catch. This thrity dollar game is in BETA which means that it has frequent bugs and constant updates to disrupt the enjoyment of a player. I would rather play an hour of Shaq Fu for the original Super Nintendo then play 1 minute of this excuse for a game. This game resembles H1Z1 too much and managed to be complete Why would people want to buy this game when they already got H1Z1 just with another title. To pay for a $30.00 game that looks like it was made in 2010 riddled with bugs and is still in beta seems like a bad idea. IT IS A BAD IDEA! I could get a handjob in the porta potty by a homeless man for $30.00 and I strongly suggest this instead of purchasing this ""video game"". Plus you need a really good PC to run this game at normal to max settings. I barely run this game on all low settings. I might as well just have shredded $30.00 becuase this game sucks in many ways and I could of turned this review into a novel becuase this game has an abundant amount of reasons on why it sucks.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-23,0,0,214,False,Recommended,Ok so basically I've played enough matches to know what's going on.Bit of a learning curve for the survival shooter battle arena newbie but if you drop high pop first 20 games you'll get the hang of it faster because you're going to have to down a crapton of peeps.You CAN make top 10 easily if you plan ahead and move stealthily. I've found that if you run around guns blazing you get downed hella fast. It's also possible to reach Top 10 without getting kills but it's kind of difficult.Solid time if you play with friends also enemy death voice is hilarious but rare af.As it is now I mean it's not bad but I don't know if it's worth $30 pesos my dude.There are no sales for PUBG as far as I'm aware so if you plan to get PUBG make sure you get the most out of it. I got my fun get yours.Das it later.*Edit*To address other concerns yes there are cheaters.Yes the game is repetitive but if it gets repetitive. Play a different game lmao. You can make the same excuse for any other title.Also I've noticed weird CPU issues with this game specifically my CPU jumps to 100% and sometimes when you join a match you can get stuck on the loading screen but that's not as common as there have been patches.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I rly dont know why u need to want to make this game like others games paying crates / keys ( &gt CS GO) emote system ( &gt dayz) and then the focus on to make the game more ""realistic"" this game ISN'T a realistic shooter like EFT.

Then focus the optimization of the graphic / servers / clients &amp network! This is rly important! You dont need to implement things like emotes or idk what it is a SHOOTER. In my opinion if the developers dont switch their focus what to do in the next time this game will die in 6 12 months.

2018-04-18,0,0,698,False,Not Recommended,Hello all Around 400hrs in and it's time to write something about this painful game. BR games seem to be taking over the gameplay is fun and there's a lot on the line if you die game over. PUBG led the way for me it even brought me over to the PC but after many hours the fun is pretty much gone. Whats weird is the game to me seems to be getting worse as time goes on not better. When real fixes need to be made players and paying customers get the ability to use...hand genstures. Yep completely usless in this game. Hand gestures and skins for weapons. First lets fix the gun play which is so terrible i never really know where the heck my bullets are gonna go from day to day some days an AR with ACOG is spot on and accurate other days i will go thru an entire mag without a single hit when i can see the person plain as day. thats one problem. Next would be what is happening on my screen is NOT what is happening on the opposing screen. On my screen I've pumped numorous rounds into someone blood flying getting my kill on...only to be insta killed by some random shotgun blast from the opponent then on my death cam hes barely taken damage or even the amount of impacts im registering on my screen. EXTREMELY frustrating to say the least. This is just to mention a few issues there are plenty more. The game can be extremely fun but once you start to get better the problems will be chrystal clear.

2017-03-27,0,0,65,True,Not Recommended,UPDATED REVIEW Game has introduced microtransactions in an early access state. Can't support developers that do this. I really don't care for games like H1Z1 or DayZ. I never liked the whole Ironman survival style games where it's you vs the server.That being said this game is like those mentioned above but without the bloat and BS attached. It is simple and accessible. You jump into a game you see how long you can live and you leave when you're done No strings attached. This product comes with a nice touch of tactical gameplay and highly encourages groups of up to 4.That being said this game is not something I would play alone. Having atleast a partner to communicate with and have your back...and also have a few laughs with along the way makes an otherwise stressful situation that much more fun. What I like most is the playable area constantly gets smaller as the round continues on forcing players to find eachother and fight till the last one stands. This also means that rounds will not last forever even if you are in the last 5 of 100 players.Being an early access game expect to find bugs/latency/server issues. However with the developer earning over $11 million dollars on the launch weekend alone we can hope the funding fixes these issues. Literally the only things I would want to see added to this game are improvements/bug fixes new maps and more gear.It's worth the 30 dollars. Get it and play with a friend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Instead of trying to improve their game to beat their competition they sue them copy ideas from them etc. The only form of progression you can make in this game with your ""Chicken Dinners"" is earning crates...that you have to pay real money to unlock. I played for a good 23 hours and don't remember ever feeling satisfied with the rewards from a completed game.I really tried to like this game but the poor optimization boring maps one dimensional gameplay cheaters bugs lack of any new content barring skins and emotes and overall neglect from the developers really do make this plain and simply a bad game.

PUBG is not a perfect though. There are bugs scattered all around as to be expected from an early access title but sometimes they improve the game even more.

That is the major reason I cannot reccomend this game at the moment. The weapon skins they added are a clear sign of that. I mainly play first person servers now since third person is still pretty heavy on the hacker side of things. It does seem like it has gotten better but not enough to call the problem solved. In addition the recent updates have caused the servers to be unstable ( at least on my end). It does not affect actual gameplay once you find a game but it is an annoyance no one should have to deal with.The game is still fun if you do not take it to seriously. For example playing the new event mode they added is pretty good.

Just hit one guy 8 times with Scar L and after 8 bullets he turned back killed me with 2. I know that make sense that you can get killed with 2 bullets with a different gun sorry in advance but i don't remember what he had. The thing is lvl 3 armor is ok it's useful etc but this world has 7 347 billion people (2015) who can cry to death with just one of those bullets i mean come on let's be real juuust a hair.. If you are ok with when there are 7 people left the game is already intense and area is so small that you can't even have a second of silence because of gunshots but you have to hit one guy i mean ONE (1) guy more than 8 times to kill i'd say f*ck it that's ridiculous.

2017-08-11,0,0,180,True,Not Recommended,This is an amazing game with beautiful gun mechanics well built on a wonderful idea. One that is plagued and consumed by severe FPS drops network lag glitches bugs and so many more problems that ruin the entire game experience.From parachuting down and getting caught on a tree just to fall to your death immediately to vehicles teleporting to the sky and falling to your death frames dropping as low as 20 FPS when engaging into a gun fight or to getting stuck inside of a door.. I'm sick and tired of playing this game on my $1 200 gaming PC and not being able to actually play due to game issues.Unfortunately I can not recommend this game to anybody in its current state. For a game with 1 000 000 concurrent players you would think that the developers will do something to save their game and fix the bugs but they don't listen.You know why I know they don't listen? Simple!A known bug that was in the Technical Test Server that defaulted all users to the Asia servers regardless of their geological location. This means tons of North American players are accidentally on the Asia servers every day. This is annoying why did you break your own game? This bug was reported to the PUBG developers IN TESTING over 1 000 times... Yet do you know how they fixed it? They didn't.. they pushed the patch into the live game with the bug still there.. 2 patches later I'm still playing Asia.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-29,0,0,52,False,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. While I rarely write reviews this one is a must so I ll keep it unbiased moderate and coincise.I'm a software engineer and a game development hobbyist I got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it on sale I used to watch online streams and have watched some of shroud so I have a fairly good idea about the game and the genre. What I liked The battle royal genre in this game is awesome the idea that you jump from a plane with other +90 enemies (solo) is thrilling experience you have to act quickly no movements wasted every second and every bullet counts. The blue zone idea is what complements this game's success its like the salt and pepper you apply to your food forcing everyone to fight aggressively for that chicken dinner. The battle system is pretty good I love the weapons recoil and reload the incoming fire sound is quite realistic as if you're fighting in real life quite an exotic implementation if I may say so. What I hated No introduction to the game no training bootcamps no briefing just instantly thrown into chaos veterans have a considerably higher survival chance. Next level EA microtransactions godforbid . The game lags like a there I've said it. Again I'm a game development hobbyist and have a fairly good knowledge on game optimization but omfg the amount of opimitzation they could have done by now would have helped this game retain its position (yes its going downhill) I played titles like GTA and OW and the amount of optimization this game requires isn't much and could be done within only 1 2 weeks or less (1 man job for at least +50% acceptable optimization) at this point its very questionable what in the world they're doing with their budget. I've spent an hour optimizing this game and even went online to try out community tweaks and the max fps I was able to obtain is a spiking 50 90 on a 144hz monitor with decent specs since I obtained my 144hz monitor I'm never able to go back to 60fps as it lags like a 30fps game I don't like sluggish games running on reasonable OC specs especially when the game settings are lowered to its absolute limit the game performance with its current game models is simply unjustifiable. So is the game ready for the public?A No. It's been rushed and it needs to be optimized bugs and glitches need to be ironed as well.Don't take my review the hard way I'm just an unbiased player giving you my totally unbiased opinion if the game works well for you then enjoy it while you can the reason I didn't even consider Fortnite is because PUBG looked more ""mature"" but now I'm dissapointed and I won't continue playing it until I receive news of proper optimization update.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-07-08,0,0,578,False,Not Recommended,Used to love the game concept but as all my friends have stopped playing by now it is time for me as well to realise how bad this game's current state is at. There seems to be absolutely no willingness to listen to the community and actually fix the issues of the game and instead only try to get as much money as possible before other games will push pubg out of the battle royale genre completely.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-05-31,0,0,58,False,Not Recommended,It's a game that has taken heavy inspiration from many other games. Many games exists that inspired the Battle Royale formula this includes H1Z1 Contagion DayZ etc. This game had the same ambitious motivation as its original mod from ARMA III to take from all of these and polish the mechanics to create this. Battle royale though has been in movies and books for many years has never been properly implemented in video games to such a scale until PUBG and Fortnite came to the scene both games greatly motivated by Day Z no doubt since Day Z showed the industry what gamers really want (since lets face it most people played the game for the survival aspect against other players not the zombies or the very tedious survival elements). The game looks pretty good for a game originating from its team size the gameplay is far from perfect but clearly polished. Many mechanics are imperfect but can be learned to be adjusted to. The greatest issues is their attempt in addressing cheaters and the amount of time it may take to fill games. The game also loads a lot for a long time so the ier players like myself may find themselves loading the game and being on the main menu more than actually playing the gameplay. Another issue is that the player count and map size ratio causes players to cross paths less frequently than desired mid game making it sometimes feel like work to play the game as intended (since how many times does one wish to play safely to relive what they did last hundred games?). Another issue is their special events and how they handle them. Players clearly enjoyed the eight player squads and would like to see it as an available mode regularly especially those of us that have more than three friends. What seems ideal is some form of deathmatch mode for us to just have quick and easy games maybe even practice the gun game meta. Their interpetation of a deathmatch is just a randomized mess with a terrible spawn system. You spawn with random guns meaning some have what feels unfair starting gear depending on the situations that starts. The spawn system is the same as the core mode parachuting. This is bad on small maps like deathmatch because players gain control of areas fast and get to loot for gear meaning they snowball while players respawning die more. This game isn't finished and the speed of developement is lackluster. The controversy of the team focusing more on their petty lawsuits rather than game developement tells us what they're focused on more than making a good game money. Instead of improving the game polishing all the issues they invest time in loot crates and time in lawsuits suing others for taking inspiration from their game. Hypocritical this game is far from original it's merely a polished interpetation of what we have had for nearly ten years on the market. For them to sue as if they own something they didn't create is ridiculous for them to address their losing battles against competition by suing them out of business rather than improving their own product shows us their intentions. This is a good game that was ruined by money. Get it on the cheap it's not worth full price when there is competition out there that's gaining popularity for a reason that's free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If you play arma H1Z1 csgo basically any game where distant shots are quiet and close shots are loud that isnt the case with this game distant shots are EXTREMELY quiet to the point where I jump when I get hit because i thought the shots were 200+meters away.

2018-01-07,0,0,295,False,Not Recommended,Can't recomend this game because it still feels like an Early Access title. Basically the game still runs like crap on the old map and the newer one has gotten worse. The lag is still prevalent and is even worse with the influx of Chinese players on the North American server. Basically around half of any North Amercian lobby will be chinese players. The cheating is extreme although they added a kill cam it basically useless for figuring out if they are cheating. It will lag so much it is not worth even looking at it........ Car spawns are horrible too! Boat spawn more then cars! How much sense does that make???Overall it can be a fun game. But in the current state that its in I can hardly recomend it.Update 1.0 Okay it would appear that the last patch made the old map more stable however more testing will be needed before I can re edit my review. Also the replay ability within the lobby is crashing every time now! Cheaters are also very dominate just got killed by a wall aimbot hacker. I'm really tring to re like this game but its really hard.Update 1.1 Well the game still runs like crap! The update didn't fix it at all. Overall lag is better!Update 1.2 Installed new drivers for my GTX 970 game runs much smother now. Will do some more testing before I remove from un edited review! Lag is still within the first five ten minutes. Not to bad but can still be a pain in the butt if you drop with an enemy. Cheaters are still horrible got shot in the face by a shotgun across the map.......... Yeah I rage quited after that one (TBH)!Update 1.3 (8/16/2018) I stopped playing this game for a while becaase it still has not been improved and I was getting burnt out on it! I restarted to play it after months! It's pretty much the same as before! Horrible netcoding ping bugs and just poor optimization! The devolopers want to push money more then fixing their game. It's pretty sad when you think about it. Don't buy the game if you havn't already! It's not worth the frustration and anger......lol.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The devs do need to look at thier banning policy this is the only negative i have. Stream sniping is an issue but i cant see how it is as common as people are saying it is with random servers. There are a few bugs its early access get over it. Compare this to many other early access games and its in a great place considering how long its been out.

2017-05-14,0,0,37,False,Not Recommended,When this game first game out I had the same reaction as a lot of others as the battle royal game scene hasn't had the best reputation as of late. H1Z1 left a bad taste in my mouth and I was hoping this genre had died forever ... Enter PUBG.The game rolled out wit a bang and made some real noise on the Twitch community but big deal right? H1Z1 was the same way and like I said I hated that game ... like a lot. So I didn't really give it a lot of attention but PUBG don't care PUBG don't give a sh*t it just kept doing it's thing and by god it's thing turned out to be pretty damn cool. I made a stand that I wasn't going to buy the game until it hit a sale. (mostly because I never got that H1Z1 refund I always wanted) I lasted about 2 weeks until my friends started caving and the temptation of having a squad to play with guarenteed this games way into my library.So I'm right around 20 hours and here's my report Desync is terrible like you get hit my shots or cars when you feel like you're way behind cover and sometimes how much you have to lead a player depends more on the amount of lag rather than the distance.The gear is repetitive yet effective maybe some people are getting air drops a lot and seeing that high tier gear but I've yet to get anything in a drop as they have always guarenteed death for me or the ones that havent have been terrible.Despite these being some decent issues the game is a lot of fun and only has room to grow since it's still in early access. There haven't been any major updates at this point but I'll attempt to update this review when they do so.I reccomend this game to if you want to play with friends but with all the issues so far I can't reccomend this game.

Yes it has its fair share of rubberbanding and other issues but the game is still addictive and fun. In the beginning you might get into the top 50 or so but you will always return longing the chicken dinner1.0 ReleaseThe full release of the game has brought a new map some UI changes as well as performance improvements. I would say that the game is well optimised now and more players can join the fun.PerformanceI have a GTX 1050ti and an i7 7700HQ on my laptop and I used to frequent around 50 FPS after the 1.0 release I get around 70 FPS indoors and 65 FPS outdoors. I have to commend Bluehole for optimising the game and hearing the cries of this large yet growing community.UIThe overall UI of the game is simple and easy to understand and there is not much to be said here.MapsIn early access PUBG had only 1 map and I admit it felt a bit boring and repetitive playing the same map each game. The new map however is in a desert setting and runs smoothly and offers a great balance when compared to the abandones cityscape and grasslands of the first map.GameplayMy favourite part of the game is it's gameplay. The gameplay is intuitive and the main idea of battle royale is easy to understand for newer players. The game has a large variety of weapons ARs DMRs Sniper Rifles Shotguns and Pistols as well as the legendary pan. Bluehole has done a fantastic job to make this game appeal to competitive and casual players more competitive players may seek the action and challenge one another while more casual players may take the more laid back approach and camp in a room until they need to move. PUBG is also streamer friendly the game is slow paced and offers down time from the action to allow streamers to interact with viewers. Streaming is what introduced me as well as many others to this game.CommunityOverall the communtiy is what helped shape what PUBG is today and most players are nice. Sure You will find some salt shakers and hackers here and there but from an anecdotal standpoint the community is helpful.In Game PurchasesI remember when the Gamescom crate came out and there was an outburst from the community however the game was in Early Access and Bluehole needed more capital to fund R&amp D so that they could release the game to more people.Bluehole has done a good job to keep the game fairly ""Un Pay2Win"" cosmetic items are the only available purchases there are some cosmetic items that may give competitive advantages like the ghillie suit but those items cannot be bought or opened through crates they are found in game.Battlepoints are earned by playing games and killing enemies. Players can buy weekly crates with their 'BP'. This ensures that players are rewarded for their time spent in the game and that all players have a chance to get a skin that they want.Inference/ConclusionThis game has improved alot since Early Access and I recommend that people buy it.I hope this review helped you in deciding whether to buy the game or not you can add me on steam to ask me questions and/or concerns that you have.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No matter what people say about cheaters and glitches I for one find it extremely satisfying. The rush of constant fighting and the feeling of surviving till the end is what makes it the best game of the year.After leaving Early access the game has actually become better. The game is now smoother and less laggy when compared to pre alpha. There are bugs and glitches that can be found quite easily but it still is a lot of fun to play with friends or go in solo. The problem of cheaters is very troubling in pubg but devs are doing everything they can to eradicate this issue. But being an online game i guess this issue will always exist.

This review will compare battlegrounds (BG) with it's main competition ARMA battle royale (BR) and king of the kill (kotk). Pro's and con's according to me are PRO's fluid beautiful graphics simplified looting fast paced games (around 20 mins as opposed to ARMA BR 30 50 mins) good map size and circle mechanics. CON's Combat feels flimsy especially up close poor weapon sounds (too muffled no ""punch"") too low recoil and lack of audio response when you hit your opponent. As of now too similar to kotk instead of the brilliant BR original. Less arcade please and more hardcore! Remove kill messages fully (make downed players scream / moan) make ""good"" weapons more scarce and WAY LESS AMMO! More weapon sway if injured or fatigued bleeding wounds (light/medium/severe) and other injuries (broken limbs concussions and involuntary screaming when badly hurt... ).

PUBG has sold over 50 million copies seeing that they are 30 bucks a pop then it is reasonable to estimate gross revenue at 1.5 billion dollars. Granted they have to pay their dues but this still leaves them with a large amount of money. And how they choose to spend is most damning they bring a frivolous lawsuit against Epic Games in a thinly veiled attempt to force Fortnite out of the market and in turn take a larger share of the market they keep implementing various ways to monetize PUBG in order to squeeze as much money as they can from the playerbase. the initial estimate of 1.5 BILLION dollars does not take into consideration the money they made from monetizing the Game. Rather than doing the described above they could have hired expert programmers to fix the game's optimization issues region lock the cheating hacking team killing teaming non English speaking commie rice mainland communist chinese players fix frame drops connectivity issues I could go on and on but make no mistake PUBG care about money enough said.

2018-07-15,0,0,454,False,Not Recommended,Ive put over 400 hours into this game since early alpha... honestly its gotten worse over time. When it first came out and after a lot of the first updates the game was looking good and i played it a LOT. Devs cared about the game and the issues and every update seemed to make everything better. But somewhere along when miramar got launched this game started to really suffer... at least in my eyes. The desync issues random crashes laggy hit reg just make me hate this game even though I love the gameplay and the concept. As of right now I can't really understand how they can claim this game is tournament ready or competitive mode ready at all... I literally chuckle every time i see the PUBG Invitational background. It just seems so ridiculous. I could care less about new maps and skins and vehicles as long as the CORE gameplay is really refined and well tuned. Fixing the desync lag and random crashes (crashes that i only have experienced after the last update) would make a world of difference. Maybe the devs just made too much money too fast... I can only hope that eventually I can redact my verdict on this game but for now not recommended at all. Good concept good feel poor optimization. It's really killing this game for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-03,0,0,181,False,Not Recommended,The game is exciting and tense. It is a stressful game AT BEST! Because of how tense and frustrerating this game can be laying the seemingly exorbitant number of cheaters now more obvious thanks to the death cam tips the game over from intense and stresful but satisfying to an excercise in frustration. I am taking a break from this game. I hope that Bluehole manages to get a handle on the cheeting problem in this game. The monitization and steam marketplace integration has proven to be a bad decsion. A few options to solve this problem would be to region lock it to ping lock it or to add a second layer of anti cheat software or detection such as the iron fist of VAC or removing steam marketplace integration to remove the incentive to farm credits(lol as if that will ever happen) If the cheating problem can be resolved it will be a great game again. Now its not a good experieince and I encourage anybody thinking about purchasing it to wait and see what steps are taken to make the game more fair for everybody.Edit**After attempting to fix the cheating problem with the battleye launcher Bluehole has fully bricked my game. I am compleatly unable to launch it due to a .dll error in an unrelated folder for an unrelated application. I can no longer launch the game at all and none of the fixes proposed anwhere worked.

First I'll go ahead and show you the pros and consPros+ Big playerbase I never have to worry about waiting to join a game+ Realistic+ Graphics are nice and smooth+ Sounds aren't horrible but it wouldn't hurt to improve them+Play invite system is great (You stay in the group even if you quit the game for instant playability when you log back on with your friends)+Improves upon H1Z1's KotK in everyt aspect+Loot system is a little slow but it makes up for it by having a lot to loot ( ie weapons and attachments)Cons There are some bugs but hey it's early access Some of the playerbase is loud and obnoxious on the mic but thankfully you can fix that with CTRL+T and mute them! Reward system isn't that rewarding (unless you just like killing and winning) It's early access so it's slightly not optomized. I get around 20 40fps with my 1070 AMD8350In conclusion I really enjoy playing this game I wish I could put more hours into it right now even as I'm typing this review.

I can't tell you how many times I've been running forward or gotten behind a wall etc. only to be rubberbanded back and suddenly killed because the server decided that I died six feet back from where I was. CQB encounters can be extremely hit or miss as your crosshair is on someone either ADS or over the shoulder only to see your shots land harmlessly against the wall to their left approximately four feet from where you're aiming. Played over 70 hours so far and I am happy with my purchase.

Nothing seems to be being implemented to combat people running scripts and various other 'cheats' so much so that these people are managing to rack up enough time in game to get onto the leaderboards with 50+ games is obviously a sign that very poor anti cheat measures are being used. When 1.0 launched managed to rack up 40 games in the first week and only encountering 1 maybe 2 blatant cheaters now literally every 2 games or so you encounter them especially if you get top10 and continually getting squad wiped from hip fire sprays.

2017-11-23,0,0,383,False,Not Recommended,So last review I wrote quite long time ago and since it was an early access I was hoping that Blue Hole will fix all the bugs and make this game awesome. However they did not do anything and just made this game worse than it was before. Tons of bugs lots of cheaters and now for some reason 90% of time I am playing on the new map 'miramar' that has so many bugs in a map you can die just doing nothing at all.The problem with cheaters. I think that everyone in this game saw cheaters at least at once and when you play this game as much as I play then you start to hate this game cuz of cheaters. AND NOW you can't even properly report them if you get killed and start to spectate your teammates you can only report them but for some reason you can't report other players.Another problem is 'miramar'. For some reason now I am playing this map around 80% of all the time. I am getting it nearly always. Why can't users choose map that they want to play on or at least make chance of playing on different maps 50/50.The last but not least is problem with FPS in this game. Yes the game looks quite good but it doesn't mean that you have to buy 2x 1080ti to play this game on ultra settings. I have nvidia 1080 and when I am playing other games I usually can set up everything on high/ultra settings but not in this game. You can get lags even using medium settings with 1080!In conclusion I want to say that the game idea is awesome but if Blue Hole comp. won't fix the bugs people will stop playing it. Every update makes playing worse and worse. Blue Hole please fix the game.PS. In this review I didn't write about quite many things about insta crashes etc... But you know... Buy this game if you have extra 30e and try playing it. However if you don't have extra money I don't advise you to buy this game right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Everyday PUBG gets more than one million players and if that much people are playing the game then you should look more into this game if you are more on the negative side right now. I have had this game since late July of 2017 and I still really like this game. For the time I have had this game only 100 or so hours isn't that much but if you want to play a lot of matches in one day you'll see it is kind of hard to do that (unless if you have friends of course). But playing a couple matches a day will not get you bored of the game (like I am right now) and you can still have fun playing it.

Some people have gone as fair as not letting you even watch the deathcam cause they know they are hacking. 30 hackers 30 god damn hackers in less then 2 day I have reported. Do you know how utterly disapointing it is to turn on a game that you know there is no chance you'll ever win cause of hackers?.

I've followed this game throughout the closed beta and was really surprised by the amount of content implemented so early in it's development which shows to me that PlayerUnknown's team are really dedicated to making this the best possible experience for it's players. If you enjoy a more realistic take on the Battle Royale series (compared to H1Z1 KOTK) then this is the game for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-10-09,0,0,437,True,Recommended,This is a great game. Don't let the high magnitude of poor reviews deter you from giving this game a shot. Yes there have been some major issues with the game but it is still early access and the devs were clearly not prepared for what came their way with the massive rise in popularity. However that shouldn't keep you from playing a game that at its core is an absolute blast to play.I think the game has a lot of areas it could improve in but it also stands out as a noteworthy and thoroughly exciting game.Pros Engaging combat that feels realistic Quick matches both lobby times and in game Lots of variance for play style slow games quick brawls stealthy its your choice how you play. Devs seem to be adding new content and fixing issues regularly A decently polished experience for being early accessCons The devs lack consistency no ads wait there will be ads no microtransactions nope now we have them etc.. Game has some lag and other minor technical issues nothing game breaking There are some missing features that would really make this game feel polished Crap graphics because you want high fps,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sign of subpar culling mechanism. Laggy servers Horrible netcode/hit reg due to low tickrate/lag Lack of custom servers for all customers Devtime spent on lootboxes and extra in game cashing systems instead of making the core of the game better Horrible UI decisions They actually took map selection out which was in last patch unbelievable decision. Back to leaving to lobby if Miramar is randomly chosen.+New map Sanhok is actually niceOverall the game has had multiple problems since it was released on steam lots of them still exist in the game. It's difficult to forgive many of these fundamental flaws and slow progress.

But be warned when I say that there is an update every single week. Usually 3 4 days. But nevertheless PUBG has some pros and cons.Lets start with the Pros The weapons are equally usable and strong the bulletdrop isnt bad and there are many ways to kill your opponent. Now the Cons Optimazation could use a lot of work to many updates and a lot of people trash talk to much. Now I wont complain about the players because you can always turn off public voice chat. So it wont really matter. But there are a lot of them just to get that out there. Updates are usually about 20 25mb when updating. Which isnt bad. But the huge updates are what im worried about. 6 10gb updates are usually what they go for. So just be prepaired for them. I always keep a spare hard drive somewhere for when they do release huge update.But as always PUBG is a great game and I would definitely recommend this game for all the hardcore players.

2018-07-06,0,0,535,False,Not Recommended,"Having put over 500 hours into this game since mid 2017 its safe to say that it was well worth the money back in early access. You would accept being killed by your 3 seater bike doing more barrel rolls than Google Chrome or having the game crash mid firefight. It was enjoyable learning how everything worked how to compose yourself when you were up against "" Destr0yer69XD"" who was killing everyone in the top 10 and how easily all your time in the match could be stripped from you by one bullet to the face. The adrenaline rush was great. Now though? No no no no. Auto run is your best friend. You simply dont care if you die because its probably a hacker or your connection the server was just a millisecond behind the guy who shot you even though you shot him 37 times in the head from point blank. The excitement is gone because the devs seem to just not bother speaking to their player base. If they are they sure are doing a terrible job monetising anything you can think of and wasting time making lawsuits they cant win. Major issues in the game like latency and balancing as well as countless bugs and optimisation issues are still ever present and are unlikely to go away soon. In short think of PUBG as an ex wife.

I have 600 hrs and i'm just getting angrier at the game. it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours enjoyed with friends had some unforgettably entertaining moments in and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.however thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot relatively new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync start game lag etc). since then the early access game has gone gold introduced a new map added cosmetics and taunts changed balance in weapons addressed cheats etc. the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.the problem? the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed. at this point given the focus of the dev team this signals to me that it will likely never change.the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre game items. to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed just worked around. the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens. the likelihood is that more often than not someone typically the one on the receiving end ) is shaking their head and it genuinely doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.as a comparison take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive. you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid. the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill not engine quirks.when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march having played only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say https //clips.twitch.tv/SwissCaringSowHoneyBadger ""after playing on LAN you come back to this you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game ... if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN online ho my god. it would be a dream.""it's 2018.2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability in perspective as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since my first install i have never been able to buy loot crates with battle points leaving my character naked with an empty inventory (wardrobe) screen. I am also unable to change my characters appearance leading the accumulation of somewhere just over 25 000 battle points. Much to my disappointment after the patch near 8/3/2017 all of my battle points are missing now and i am UNABLE TO EARN MORE from matches i play now. This is unacceptable and will be what breaks me from playing this game. I have reinstalled the game more than once and appears to be a bug attached to my account. i have posted about this in the past and would love to hear ANYTHING from anyone with information.

2018-03-19,0,0,677,False,Recommended,a superb BR type of game with heavy focus on guns and weapons. follow the realism path theres a lot of details that make every game you play a unique experience. pubgs gameplay is something you can never get tired off everything is fine tuned and still get improved overtime by devs. sure there are bugs and glitches that you still have to deal with every now and then but i dont think its a major down side. instead hack is still a big part of the game given how pubg is still in its prime time. devs ve been taking action and i have faith in their decisions. i recommend this game because it has a lot of potential in the future. possibly become one of the most important tiltle in this decade,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-23,0,0,130,True,Recommended,"Let's go through a list of events that will take place to see if you like what you read 1. Join a lobby of up to 100 players waiting for the match to start.2. After countdown hits zero everyone is spawned inside of a cargo plane. Once you reach a certain part of the island you can eject from the plane at anytime you wish except at the end of it's flight path it auto ejects you from the plane and you go skydiving down with any others who chose not to eject.3. As mentioned above you skydive toward your desired location the parachute will auto chute if you choose not to pull the chute. You will then get to steer yourself toward any direction you please.4. You land on your feet. You search the nearest building for resources. Some games you'll find a M16 some a pistol and then some clothes and an iron pan. The randomness is refreshing.5. You ready to go look for others to kill? The more you kill the more your points rack up. Don't really care for leaderboards? Just run around find a vehicle fire shots into the air to lure others to the sound or whatever it is you love to do to pass the time. No telling where other players are.6. Large map how are you going to find anyone? Oh the map has a circle on it which is the ""Play Area"". This over time will shrink and anyone caught outside the circle is drained of their health until they die. So it's a few minutes here shrink a few minutes there shrink again until the circle gets so small there is an infinity chance the match will end quickly.7. Did you die already? It's ok. As soon as you die you are given your stats for the session and you can go back to the main menu to start another match with another 100 people. It's that quick and easy there is no waiting til the end of the match to watch it unfold... though I hope the option becomes available in the future. It might be fun to kick back and relax after a lengthy session.8. Rinse and Repeat.Note I have not done a duo or squad matchup.Recommend? I do if you can get your rig to give you some good FPS. Mine is decent I had to go through an act of Congress to fix some issues. (It was easy btw there was no one alive in Congress so I signed the act forms myself)If PUBG is not optimized well for you there is always the Steam Refund.Personally I just like to have fun collecting a few guns getting in a vehicle and drive around. Hell I'll get a jeep and sit in the #5 seat (Back seat middle) and see if anyone notices. Everyone has noticed me so far. One day I hope to sit back there and someone take the jeep without knowing I was there the whole time.""Ok it's just us two. I'm driving around he's gotta be here somewhere.""

2017-06-18,0,0,1425,False,Recommended,This game is fantastic but after 400+ (1100+) hours I'm beginning to get a little sick and tired of poor bullet registry. That is not to say that this is a regular occurence but it only needs to happen ONCE per game and you are going to die and it's just luck if you survive. This game really is an interactive gambling addiction the r n g is much better than it was if you include variety in your game play. The investment of time can be a little limiting however it is what it is. For people with approx 36 minutes to kill (Per top 2 round) There's no Quake style deathmatch which this game could do with especially if it were unranked 40 players choose a kit to practice with and have a 1 kilometer playground to fight in.Ed. 3. Since the latest patch.. Every single round I've been killed by a cheater Every time I've played solo I've been killed under very suspicious circumstances. It's not desync either or video lag. I can't recommend this game to anyone under the current conditions.Ed. 4. 2 weeks ago very few cheaters on servers. Today (09/03/2018) Played roughly 30 matches and there in each game bar 2 were cheaters. I'm glad I have regular squad mates who don't just quit. Why are cheaters so hell bent on destroying this game? Oh that's right. THey can get items from crates which are worth a tonne.Ed. 5. Cheaters are returning and vanishing on a bi weekly basis */5/2018 but that's always going to be a constant and uphill struggle in pvp atleast that is what I've come to accept. They actually implemented weekly events such as 50 player deathmatch! The new map (Savage) is fun as !,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Today two of my friends along with thousand others (looking at reddit threads) randomly got banned from steam via the devs at BH. Most likely this will be resolved quickly but the way this is being handled is beyond bad. Although I will continue to monitor the game I'll most likely never play it frequently (at all) or as my go to game anymore and I would advise others to stay away from a product mainly aimed at being a money grabbing scheme with no promise of becoming a finished polished product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Your mileage may vary though especially when you have friends.And no I'm not talking about the region lock that everyone wants to be implemented to a certain country.

2017-05-14,0,0,316,True,Recommended,It's early access know what that means before you buy this do your homework on previous developers who have and have not met their promises with EA titles. Now with that said and that risk taken I think it was worth it and I have faith it'll pay off more and more as time goes on. The good gameplay is exciting visuals are great map is generally very interesting to play with more weather systems day/night cycles and other maps on the way. matchmaking is lightning fast you are in within seconds of clicking the play button least in my experience (100+ hours played now) guns are not arcadey feeling like a strange place between arma and h1z1 leaning more in the direction of arma. variation for weapons is good but not overwhelming custom matches can be good (if you can get in one) much potential for great setups on this (first person only mode is a must try)the bad the desync in the game at times is unbearable a lot of rubber banding on various servers in EU for myself not always but very often optimization has been worked on but i sincerely hope there is much more to come. On a 980ti with i74790K and i struggle running this game at 60 FPS on medium settings. Even low doesn't seem to do much. Having seen others with 1080ti's of all things and even better CPUs running into the same problems I know this cannot simply be my machine especially when I run other 2016 released AAA games on ultra without breaking a sweat hitting 144fps + with no issues (SW Battlefront The Division Battlefield 1 to name a few). guns don't feel great this could just be a personal thing though. I think take that with a pinch of salt and decide for yourself I could just be a really crap player afterall (in fact I know I am).That said I am HOOKED.

2018-06-28,0,0,433,False,Not Recommended,Alright lets get down to it First off I've played a good bit of this game. Most of it is when it was first released and the months following. This was all before the official release. And my time playing it was great either solo or with friends this game was a fresh breathe to my steam library. How ever the game never really felt crisp. The mechanics of the game as far as shooting and then later added vaulting have always felt great with minor changes here and there. But the games actual performance can be just downright pathetic. Not to mention the constant server issues that game used to have not that it is perfect now but you understand. This game had a lot to prove and in a lot of ways it really paved the way for this Battle Royale Genre to be seen by many. However Bluehole or PUBG corp what ever they want to call themselves I hope you are reading this. You are by far the worst most pathetic money hungry peace of company I have ever seen ruin a game. You charge $30 for a game then fill it with a loot crate system that with most crates NEED a $2.50 key to open? Seriously what the are you about? Not only did you make over $750 million dollars from copies sold across Xbox/PC but then you add mobile which is pretty much another market scheme and now you add a $10 battle pass where half of the items you get are TIMED? And you want to sit there and sue another company because they grabbed your spotlight with a Free to play game that can actually perform better. I would not ever recommend this game to anyone not because the game isnt fun or its boring (Miramar however is boring imo) but its because this games company does not care about there entire community asking for stability. They care for the next bundle of cash they can sweep up. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. you Bluhole you PUBG Corp and you Brendan Greene you promised me ing MOD Support on launch you ing,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When falling out of the airplane sometimes the houses aren't renderer or loaded at all and I stay falling in mid air until I get shot. The game has basically no skill based matchmaking so there is the 99% that won't win a single game in a 100 hours and the 1% (shroud) who wins about 10 games in the row.

On the flipside the coding is horrible and the tick rate is an absolute joke dipping as low as 2 ticks per second and only ever gets up to around 20 at it's max. The FPS is horrible and is more demanding than games with graphics that might actually be worth turning up to ultra. It's full of hackers and the incidence of people using soft hacks (ie. walls etc.) is rife and out of control. The devs have stopped listening to the community and now change the game in ways which seem counter to how the people who play the game feel it needs to move positively. I've played 1600 hours of this game and I honestly wish I had never even downloaded it. It's trash and the slowdown has started.

2017-11-23,0,0,418,True,Recommended,Honestly I bought this game a while ago and I love it. Everyone says it's a knockoff but a knockoff can be good especially if they do it better than the last one. PUBG is my favorite game right now. I would have so many mroe hours in it if I had more time and my friends would play it more with me. This game can be fun solo but duos are the most fun you could ever have. I convinced so many of my friends to buy this game and they all love it. We have had so many good memories in this game all the way from Gatka to Lopovka and Stalber to the Military Base. Of course if you go in and get destroyed immediately because you're a noob that decides to go to Pochiniki your first play through you're gonna hate it but I played like a little mouse when I started this game and enjoyed it. I am now so bored witht that play style and drop in a highly populated area like the school murder everyone there then hunt people. When I hear a gunshot I go towards it. That's how I love to play this game. Before you buy RNG loot spawning can and will screw you over all of the time. If you go into this game expecting to be good leave don't buy it. You will die over and over. I've been playing for close to 200 hours and still haven't won a game. I've gotten so close so many times. I on average get to the top 10 just about every game unless I'm being way to risky and playing like a maniac. Even never winning I love this game. It's so fun. It was absolutely worth the 30 or 40 dollars I spent on it. There are several bugs with this game.. because it's new. The bugs can be bad like you dropping 4 feet in a car and it exploding or your friend getting stuck in a door and you have to down him to get him out etc. etc. The terrain is poorly shaped in some areas there are little mounds that kill me every time when I'm on a bike riding around and just go flying 200ft in the air. The map is so big I still haven't discovered all of it. There are certain small areas I haven't been. And I just started going to places like Primorsk the quarry and the city in the very North West of the map. I've trained so many noobs it's not funny. And some of them still can't play right. However sometimes they surprise you. The main one that CAN play right just the other day we drove off to a little place with about 7 houses just west of the School and Legos. We were playing squads and we serperated because our other two friends had decided to go off to some random place. We were in the same house I heard footsteps a ways off and saw someone coming to our door. I backed up instantly killed him as he came through the door. I was seen through the window and ran back further into the house. I got into a side room and my squadmate was in an adjacent room. The only way they could get us was to come down a hallway. I had a UMP9 and he had a pump action shotgun. One guy ran down the hallway and jumped in between us. My squadmate shot... Perfectly through the space between his arm and his gun and one shot me to the ground. He ended up wasting the entire clip trying to down then kill him. He ran into the room and got me up. The enemies wasted their times throwing grenades instead of charging. I got up and healed about halfway. My squadmate went back to his side of the hallway and peaked around shot a few times then got downed. I peaked around instantly headshotted a guy with a lvl 3 helmet and downed him then his teammate came to the window and one shot me cause my helmet already broke. Our two even noobier friends despite our cries never came to help us so we died. And the one guy on that team survived. It would have been okay but the circle had passed over us as they were coming. So many good and bad memories have happened on this game. I love it and will continue playing it until it reaches it's peak in my excitement which won't happen for a while. This game is still fairly new and still updating I can't wait for the new maps and vaulting system to come out. I give PUBG a 9/10. I highly recommend especially if you like shooters and looting games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,291,False,Not Recommended,I love PUBG but their are too many hackers coming out of no where! And the game has no anti cheat system to detect such hackers and these hackers are getting crates and sending them to their main accounts and selling crates to make money if the game is to contine to gain hackers then the game will lose popularity this will lead to angry players like me having to write angry reviews to get more attention to a big problem. If you can not create anti cheat system then remove loot boxs or crates which will lead hacks to look away from the game for a time being making the game fair again until you have designed an anti cheat system. And after anti cheat system is made and implementated put loot boxes and crates back in. But until this is done my review will be on the no recommend side.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-15,0,0,740,False,Recommended,In the beginning I wrote a scathing review of this game. I pointed out the rampant cheating problems and persistent lack of any meaningful optimization updates. However plenty has changed and now I must say that PUBG is starting to look like a real game not a trashy early access experiment. I still don't think it was worth $30 perhaps $20 or $25 would have been more reasonable because let s face it the game is far from finished. In my opinion the 1.0 update was pushed out the door a little too early and I would have liked to see them hold back and focus on delivering the best 1.0 experience that they could. Don't get me wrong 1.0 wasn't bad but it could have been better. The optimization problem seems to be one that is seriously haunting this dev team and that was evident in the release of Miramar I do realise that considerable efforts have been made in the war of optimization however the dev team seems to focus more on new content than anything else. The latest big patch brought us Sanhok and I must say Sanhok is extremely impressive it totally shook up the gameplay making faster and more intense than ever before games are shorter firefights are far more engaging and the overall experience is highly refreshing. Sanhok also runs well it is by far the most well optimized map and does not compromise visual quality and detail. It looks outstanding. Despite the fact that PUBG doesn t really push the graphical capabilities of the Unreal Engine you can tell that some real effort went into Sanhok. I still think that it is possible to make the game look much better and at the same time increasing FPS because of the Unreal Engine however it not much of a concern. They knocked Sanhok out of the park and proved to me that they really are capable and that PUBG still has immense potential. PUBG is losing players faster than people would have expected. There are a variety of reasons such as other games like Fortnite dominating the market. However one could make a strong case that along with Fortnite drawing players away a significant cause of the decreasing player numbers is PUBG starting to stagnate. Millions of people bought this game back when there was massive hype surrounding it. People just wanted to get involved in this huge new game but soon realised that it gets boring. Sadly PUBG does get boring from time to time changes and exciting updates are generally few and far between for PUBG and when they arrive the new content is behind a pay wall such as what we got with this ridiculous event pass stunt that they pulled. In short PUBG is fun for a little bit and then people generally just go and play something that will keep them engaged for longer. PUBG also lacks the marketing and PR brilliance that Epic Games has Fortnites success can be largely attributed to it outstanding marketing. PUBG just struggles to keep up in this area and the few trailers that get shown are not even close to the actual gameplay. They show massive explosions and crazy 10 man shootouts but none of this happens in the actual game. If PUBG upped the effort on market they might be able to claw back some of their lost players.Overall I m too lazy to write a 2000 word review covering everything good and bad about this game. But I will say that its getting a lot better the latest changes are pushing the game higher and higher and its great to see. There is still plenty to be done and a load of room for improvement however PUBG in my eyes is on the right track. I recommend this game to anyone who is patient enough to endure little bugs and the occasional FPS drop overall PUBG is a decent game that can be made great given the proper changes and fixes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Sure there are sometimes that you can win however asian servers are populated with hackers. For example in cloudy weather someone in the end will kill you if they have a hack which they can see through the clouds. This is so unfair and in all honesty it pisses you off when you get second place because the other person is a hacker. The developers must control this like in GTA where Rockstar has done a phenomenal job by clearing modders. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR THIS GAME MAKE YOU EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED. If you look at this game and see the reviews prior it has been great and the game itself is amazing. But the maintance and finding the real hackers is tough so give the developers a break. Maybe come back to this game in one year? Now I just worry the boss after selling 13 million copies will leave this game and not put more money back in.

I have had occasional hard crashes of the game without an error warning heavy lagging due to server load vehicle colisions into minor changes of terrain height (bridge abutments and visibly minute changes in terrain grade) and experienced/witness the player model getting trapped next to objects (one witnessed today resulting in the death of a team mate by ""falling damage"" from a 4 foot high crate).

2018-08-10,0,0,448,False,Not Recommended,So I've given this game over 300 hours since the initial release of the game and I cannot at all say that I recommend the title to people who like shooting games. This is unfortunate because the feeling of winning this game is quite a high.The greatest detriment to this game is the fact that it has been over one whole year and they still call it a completed game. If it isn't the servers dumping out on you it's the poor optimization of the world geometry killing you. If it isn't world geometry it's the vehicle mechanics killing you when your ride decides that the piece of land you just drove over should launch you into low Earth orbit so you come crashing down in a fiery explosion. Beyond that the fact that they claim to have fixed these problems and more is just a bold lie to say the very least. Every patch they say optimization features have been updated and work better and every patch it does not seem as if anything at all has changed. Step further and every patch itself that claims to fix two bugs has introduced ten more bugs in the code.I think perhaps the most insulting thing though is the ownership and operation of the game itself. Bluehole and PUBG Corporation claim to be doing their level best to fix this game yet they spent money and resources on developing a mobile PUBG for phones and tablets. They spent money and time organizing a professional scene so they could make more sponsorship money and yet still that money has not reflected anything on the game itself in terms of functionality and a focus on fixing the problems that doggedly persist through every single patch. Even more insulting is that they use the default patch delivery service for Unreal Engine which would be fine if they were a small indie studio working on their first game but seeing as how they make millions I see no excuse for this game to even have half of the problems that plague it to this day. Perhaps the most discussed issue is the blatant cheating in this game. The claim they make that they have put into place anti cheat software and methods to remove cheaters from the game is laughable at best and a complete lie at the worst. Every set of patch notes seems to be a scripted piece that has been put up and while some of the patch notes might be accurate seeing them reflected in the game is woefully underwhelming when the issues they address in their updates are not the most prominent problems this game faces. The fact that a game that has earned millions does not even claim to have server side verification of client side game states is both amateurish and lazy. With all the money they make from the game sales from previously banned players you would think that the easy solutions would be easy to implement but alas excuses continue to come from the company. They refuse to address the issue of the overwhelming presence of Chinese cheat accounts letting this game slip further and further from the potential it once had. The attempts to placate people with promises of coming solutions that never come to fruition tells me that this company is more concerned with earning millions from banned players rebuying the game than trying to improve the game performance and experience for those who have bought the game and want to experience it without people using scripts and other cheat mechanics to exploit this game's terrible coding.2/10 and only because actually winning a match in this dreadful bucket of excrement is actually satisfying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,514,False,Not Recommended,"I won't mince my words here.The problem with this game is that it's a great proof of concept game with a poor follow through. The game's core premise is great huge deathmatch military sim style arena the problem is everything else. After the game concept's hype has worn off you'll get tired of things like getting killed by random teamates not obtaining chicken dinner because of 360 spinning map hackers with snap headshotting hacking the overall lag that is noticably apparent throughout such as when falling from the plane onto the ground for the first time. You may even notice that you feel like there is plenty of room for other innovation that just didn't make it.In my opinion the worst bit is the teamkilling that seems to be pathetically rampant. Just look up ""sxk7 team killing"" and you'll also note they have a no self defense policy tolerance. That is if you've vested 25 minutes in a game and notice team killing intent you can (ahem will) be reported for defending yourself. The best part of this joke is that you can then sign yourself up for another round of this ridiculous behavior. Particularly I've noticed this community's hunger for team killing or finding workarounds for getting you killed just to loot your body. In fact you'll notice many times your teamates are watching and waiting to loot your body first after an encounter.Take the above mix it in with the fact that in the NA server you will almost never be assigned to an English speaking team and you have a pathetic toxic Tower of Babel of an experience.See here is the problem. There needs to be NOTICABLE mechanics to prevent such toxicity. For example remove friendly fire allow for a no loot friendly option in matchmaking enable some type of post friendly fire vote kicking and I'm sure there are many other direct alternatives.This is the type of problem that primes people hop off this for the best next alternative to this battle royale genre.TL DR So here's the thing if your not going to be playing with friends and you intend to play group fps matches don't buy this game. You vest to much time per round only to get it stolen by ridiculous problems. To be honest with the rampant hacking your probably better off not buying this period.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-09-23,0,0,486,False,Not Recommended,The only reason I have so much playtime is because PUBG is all my buddy wants to play. I'd rather gouge my eyeballs out to be honest but playing with friends is more fun than playing on your own.Here are just some of the reasons why I absolutely despise this game The character movement feels slow and sluggish almost as if the character is not actually connected to your keyboard. In first person mode you feel like a toddler because the character model is too small compared to the map. The gunplay is supposed to be realistic but it's too much for me. Realism can be a good thing but only when it's carefully balanced with fun. I think PUBG completely missed that mark. And even when your shots are on point there is a good chance they will be blocked by invisible walls. Some fences can be penetrated from one side but not from the other making the player on the right side near invincible. Armor often doesn't display correctly. On your screen an enemy might have no armor making you think it's an easy kill. You rush him only to find out that he was actually rocking a level 3 vest that soaked up all your bullets. The loot spread is very inconsistent. One game you loot a compound of 5 buildings and you're pretty much set the next game you land at the same compound and you barely find anything. I get battle royales are a quest for loot but PUBG failed to balance this a fun and fair way. If you want to see anybody you'll have to land in a popular area. Because of the insconsistent loot this game has now become an RNG fest to see who finds a viable weapon first. But if you land in a safe area there is a good chance you won't see anybody for the first 20 minutes of the game. You aimlessly walk around ultimately losing your concentration so that when you finally are in a fight you might not be ready for it. The devs worked on a dynamic circle which closes faster or slower depending on how many people are left. This makes the game a little better but for some reason they chose to only implement the dynamic circle on one of the three maps. If you lose a fight you're frustrated because it often took you so long to get to the point. If you win a fight you burned through resources and now you have to find loot again. Kills and even wins are rarely satisfying. The game still runs very poorly and with all the flaws mentioned above I genuinely wonder how people can still play this game on a day to day basis especially with such a slow content roll out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Shambles of a dev team.The game is barely clinging to life with 50% mixed reviews and the most recent are climbing up from 30% Mostly negative.EVEN IF THIS GAME IS ON SALE FOR 3 DON'T BUY IT!With 800+ hours on the full version and 200+ on the Alpha/Beta version I know what version I'd prefer to still have.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since before the release there has been significant content additions and updates but the rollercoaster has been steadily declining. Issues such as dsync cheaters glitches and persistent crashing has made this game essentially un playable at times. While there have been ""fixes"" that seem to have a positive effect they usually don't last long and you end up dealing with the same old problems again and again. I loved this game and its potential but as of now I have little interest in it.

2017-10-17,0,0,422,True,Not Recommended,I bought this game just to play with my friends who told me it was a fairly decent game. Upon purchase ive played roughly 3 hours that day. Since i was obviously new to the game i didnt notice anything about it since i was still learning. After then havent touched the game since. Fast forward to months ahead between the last 3 months i picked this back up again. After pouring noticable hours in the first week or two. I started to get completely annoyed/frustrated with the game. First off i want to say the geography of the maps or the physics of it is seriously ridiculous. Unbelievably so. Driving a Dacia motorbike etc you can run into invisible walls/slants in the field that puts the car into a full stop dealing some damage. But there was nothing in the way the car couldnt scale over. Walking up mountains or hills is a mission on its own let alone having to run ALL THE WAY TO THE SAFE ZONE with no available vehicles around in sight. Its like they put it all on one side of the map either youre lucky enough to find one or you run the rest of your game to the safe zone. Rails are invincible with other things. Also parachuting in a a joke. Silly fall damage and it doesnt even cut the chute right away when you need to. Sometimes getting caught on a invisible telephone line or whatever.Second would be jumping on boxes like in Georgopol and novo etc. Im jumping forward but the character slides off to the right or left? Are these boxes made of grease and butter? Makes no sense why jumping forward/onto boxes has to be another game on its own. Third is the looting system RNG. You take forever to even get a gun in some buildings this happens numerous amount of times. School for example have 3 4 story buildings with no guns. Some rooms remain empty and its always the same ones. I had to hit two more buildings after that just to find a gun. This happens in multiple games. Now youre even futher behind on guns armor and safe zone each time this happensFourth one is major Combat. You guys do nothing to encourage firefights/engagements with other players at all!! Majority of the time youre spending on looking for loot to get a decent gun to fight vehicles to get to the zone (if there is even any). People camp so hard in this game its so stupid. Also the weapon damage to armor ratio calculations. They dont sync up at all. The bullets ignore all armor. I get hit once and none of it touches my armor but more than half my health is gone. As if armor in this game doesnt really matter so much kinda starting to look like cosemetics with a bit of purpose. Although cosemetics never really had a purpose in any game to begin with.Lastly the different types weather mode is ridiculous (but its really whatever in my opinion). I dont need rain or fog or sunset in my game play. In the rain you cant hear the fog eliminates more than 80% of your vision so there's point in holding a 8x scope. The 4x is alright and do able but hey still carring that 8x just in case right? If the devs implemented an option in the settings box to toggle that on and off this wouldnt be a problem since some of us dont care for this. Just fix the en game.Pros Feels good when you get a kill Getting an AR right upon landing Certain loot spots can deck you out very quickly (rarely and if lucky)Cons Looting system for guns/armor/vehicle Games physics/geography layout invisible walls or any kind of sort that gets you stuck for no reason No enough encouragment for combat during gameplay since everyone camps and waits to hear a car roll by to shoot at it but not at each other. Weapon dmg to armor ratio (bullets ignore armor) Cant open doors responsively and jump on boxes (you slide off like its butter) Game isnt ultimately optimized for br&gt Lag spikes up the wazoo Not regioned locked bunch of cheaters/hackersOnce Destiny 2 comes out this month for PC bye bye to this game.

2017-04-03,1,1,513,True,Not Recommended,This is the kind of fun game that's just developed by the wrong people. It's a good concept true to the fun with friends idea you can have a great time with a full squad and not much difficulty winning if you want to try but you'll have far more fun playing risky for kills. However the drawbacks for this game are many the poor optimisation is the most prominent and the reason i'm giving this game a negative review until they fix it. This is my personal experience I have a very good PC with an SSD (disk speed is the cause of this) and even I get buildings made out of rubber that I can't enter for the first 20 seconds of every game. This sounds not too bad but in the starting minutes of a round you'll likely be surrounded by enemies all running for guns at which point you can do absolutely nothing besides be punched shot or blown up and watch them as they do it. If scores were possible for games I would give this a 5/10 the concept is great and the gameplay can be very fun and lead to dynamic unique encounters every run but the performance issues leave it entirely lacking if the other person has a worse connection than you. You will die.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-25,2,1,746,True,Not Recommended,Despite a promising early development cycle PlayerUnknown is turning out to be no different than other Early Access titles. Bluehole is rolling back on their promises and now after selling 5 million copies at $30+ are creating a microtransaction system to squeeze even more money out of their fans. This is in spite of a promise not to do so being at the very top of their FAQ page and something they have been praised for up until this point.For a game that still has enorous technical problems that make it a strain to run on even state of the art equipment Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is ugly janky and prone to infuriating bugs that occur in the most critical situations.

The game is flawed that's why that ""Early Access Game"" banner that people seem to have forgotten about is still up there but I've still heavily enjoyed my time playing it. I understand that people are about the optimization issues the ping/server tick issues and the hacking issues but... ehh. I'm trying to look at the bigger picture in all this and see how far they've come and to be honest I'm not really disapointed. The dev team is slow as but they are moving in the direction we ask them to. Every time we get an update you see optimization in the patch notes. You don't always feel it but occasionally it becomes your turn and you revel in the boost. The network issues I don't have a position to talk about. They added an aditional server last update but since it didn't affect the U.S side of things people kinda glossed it over (I'm stationed in Korea right now though so I'm loving it.) Can't be about the hackers either. Classic case of the few ing over the many. As of Nov2017 +700 000 hackers have been banned. dude I'm not dissapointed I'm impressed.

2018-07-18,0,0,500,False,Not Recommended,"This is easily the worst FPS game I have ever played. If you own this game (meaning that you wasted $30) uninstall and literally download Fortnite for free right now. This is one of those games that has good potential but very incompetent developers. Since day one PUBG has been plagued by the most annoying bugs I have ever experinced. The game is being ruined by Chinese hackers ""lag switchers"" and high pingers who can shoot you around corners. The lag is so bad that you can feel the game stuttering every half minute. If you don't believe me just look at how the plane warps forward 10 meters every now and then. Then you have people who have hacks that give their guns no recoil. To make things worse PUBG corp is totally ok with players downloading third party software that can be used to make the footsteps of other players much more audible on their end which is analogous to ""legalizing"" a specific type of hack.This game also has some incredibly annoyinh features soo bad that they should be considered glitches except that they ain't (because they are actual game features). For instance the parachutes are actual rigid collidable objects that are capable of getting you stuck on any building (clearly none of the devs have played Battlefield 3 a 2011 game that has working parachutes). So in summary your character will have their parachute stuck on some wall while a lucky a lucky player who wasn't affected by this issue shoots you in the d!ck with a shotgun. When throwing grenades lets say you initially aimed at some point but decide to change the point you are aiming at in the middle of the throw. The grenade will go towards the original direction (I killed at teammate because of this one time I first looked at him after pulling the pin then attempted to look at the actual enemy in vain). Also grenades do not inherit the momentum due to your character's movement (or at least this is not as noticeable as in CS GO). Then there is the holstering mechanic which makes your character holster their weapon whenever their close to a wall. This feature can simply not coexist well with a leaning mechanic because everytime that you try to shoot from cover by leaning and moving slightly your character will holster their DP 28 and completely block your vision resulting in your opponent being able to actually see their target (whereas you can't). Long story short the game does its absolute best to $hit on you.Then you have absolutely completelly totally BS red zones which literally do not contribute anything meaningful to game rather the add a random chance that you just die for no reason (Like if the hackers weren't enough). Then you have the fact that AR's are still OP and that sniper rifles are still OP. Shotguns are broken AF. Pistols are simply not AR's. The only viable melee weapon is the pan the machete sickle and crowbar are just a prank. Btw lets agree that the crowbar is a straight rip off from Half Life's signature melee weapon (just for giggles and lols).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-23,0,0,52,False,Recommended,"v1.0 is a farcry from what this game version should be. ""1.0"" signifies a finished game. This game is anything but. It is borderlining Alpha and will likely not ever be in a finished state because of indie developer's tendancies to get money and never finish the game they promised. Early access in a nutshell. Still it is a great game and concept. Very rough around the edges and has a lot of bugs to work out not to mention the massive number of players hacking the game. It is not the kind of game you play for casual fun. It can be incredibly frustrating and gives almost nothing for a paid game. Fortnight's Battle Royale gives more casual entertainment from a free to play than PUBG's outrageous $30 price point. Costmetic upgrades are obtained at a slower rate than any other game I have ever played and are mostly downright boring. It's basically a slap in the face after paying for a game that has less content than most FTP games outhere. I still recommend the game because I have faith in the developers and they are going in a good direction. Giving players a little more customization wouldn't hurt since we paid for the game.

Pros Balanced weaponsAmazing soundHuge mapCharacter customizationPlane that flies overhead and looks amazingLots of attachmentsDoes not take forever to get started just jump in and playServers are lightning fast and put you in games immediatelyDifferent levels of gear to look forDifferent modes (solo duo four person)Constant updatesHardly any noticeable bugsLoot is plentiful so you never need to worry about not having anythingAmazing shooting mechanicsAnd last of all it is just downright amazing to playCons Spawning out of plane moving in straight line with 100 other players is annoyingGraphics will strain your system even on high / medium settings (I have a 6GB 1060 and get around 50 FPS)Home screen is unappealingAnd then last of all the community. The community of this game is by far the most hilarious game community I have ever encountered. One game for example while flying overhead to spawn everyone started singing magic school bus and we all dropped to our eventual doom below. Another instance six of us all landed on a school and some guy started running around with an UMP singing pumped up kicks. Another game a man chased me for a good three minutes then beat me to death for an apple I threw at him. Overall this is by far the best game community I have ever been in and have loved every moment of this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who comes across it and urge you to buy it immediately and get started on the fun. 10/10 Would get killed for an apple again.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-23,0,0,89,True,Recommended,Extremely fun. It is a simplified version of Arma's BR with amazing gunplay. Much better than H1Z1 due to added realism with the gunplay and graphically it is more appealing. Would rate 9/10. There are some performance issues but that's expected due to it being early access.

2018-10-04,0,0,43,False,Not Recommended,"This is my personal review of this game i know i might a few(many) people off for disliking this game but i came to write my own personal thoughts on this game. You are entirely entitled to your own opinion and suggestions are always welcome.First off I must say that these types of games live and die by their community YOU CANNOT HAVE A WORKING BATTLE ROYALE IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THE PLAYERS ENTERTAINED. As with the situation currently with the OCE servers have little or no players in them i recommend a buyers beware for people that are planning to buy and play this game if you are in Australia or New Zealand. That being said i came back to this game after a few months to see how it was doing and what the fuss was about topping the steam stats for quite a while now. Turns out my expectations of vast improvement and major change have turned into a massive dissapointment. First off let me say that i'm not a big fan of the battle royale genre (as most of my games mostly centre around competitive fps and the like) however through my experience of what was left of this game on OCE servers (don't really want to go to another server to experience 300+ ping) was a trainwreck of a game with very little change that i could notice from the early access version. With the long que times of up to 10 minutes long to get a single game with 4 10 players into it.The changes i noticed more guns (yay i guess) sound improvement? (stills sounds terrible) climbing seems smoother A ""testing island"" (not single player though) Better main menu screen? (now infested with buy menus for cosmetic items) New maps? (too bad i can't stand the 10 min que timers)Despite changes to the game i still find it quite buggy vehicles will sometime phase through bridges and explode vehicles will sometimes fly... and explode character will do some weird glitches in the terrainAnd now the section where i would rant but no one will probably be bothered reading entire paragraphs so here are some dot points more loot boxes that require keys to open! DID I MENTION NO ONE PLAYS THIS ON OCE ANYMORE? Sound is still garbage Fix PUBG seems like a joke (even Operation Health for seige was even more proffesional than this) Still a glitchy mess Focus on the cosmetics rather than the gameplay i see? Servers still kinda laggyin summary i cannot recommend this game currently in this state for players in OCE. A major buyers beware if you want a good battle royale experience this is not the game you are looking for.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-15,0,0,322,False,Not Recommended,"So I reviewed the game in july 16th when I first got the game. Now that the excitement has worn off let me tell you honestly what I think of this game.IT SHOULD NOT BE ON FULL RELEASE.Why you may ask ? For 4 simple reasons.1)GLITCHES2)HACKERS 3)TEAMKILLING4)BOREDOMSo lets start with the glitches.They are WAAAY to many.You get a motorbike go above 100km/s on a road and suddenly a MAGICAL INVISIBLE BUMP flips your bike and kills you.Another example is looting and not being able to pick up the item.These are just some of the glitches. If you buy the game you will deal with them A LOT and it WILL be frustrating.Now lets talk about hackers.You can find at least one in every other game.You will spend 20 mins of your life looting just for a hacker to come and shoot in the air and insta kill you.Bluehole said they would deal with this problem but they did NOTHING. They just rushed the game to full release put out a new map and also gave you 2 new lootcrates that NOONE ASKED FOR.Similar to the glitches the hackers are something you will have to deal with on the daily.Next are the toxic teamkillers.You find them less often but they are still annoying.You got some good loot and you dont want to give it to that 4 year old russian teammate of yours.GG my friend you are already DEAD. Another example is your teammate leaving a squad or a duo at the start of the game. But to this there are 2 solutions.Either play alone which is more boring than watching paint dry or go to discord. I have met some great people there.And to end this review I want to talk about boredom.A fellow reviewer described this better than I ever could. Here it is "" It starts off incredibly fun at first and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now once the honeymoon phase wears off this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.""So I give PUBG a solid 5/10 for the RARE fun times i have had and that I've made approximately 25 euros off of selling crates.All in all if you want to spent 30$ for a game that will make you rage on the first week do it.But I guarantee that your first week will be awesome.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-06-27,0,0,253,False,Not Recommended,With 220 hours on this game I think I am somewhat able to give a review on this game.Overall I personaly enjoy this game a lot. but just because i enjoy this game that doesnt mean that it's a good game. Bluehole in my opinion has taken some questionable and bad choices on the game. here are some of the flaws of Bluehole and what they did to this game.Examples Battle pass with a broken system. Why am I getting items that I am going to end up getting taken away? Battle pass missions are extremly boring. Its gotting to the point of killing my own teamates to revive them. Doesnt know how to deal with hacking. (yea i know region lock will help but I think getting a better anti cheat system will have the same affect and benifet the game.) Adds content instead of fixing the game. Bluehole pretty much put duct tape over the mouth of the community. For some reason they took out map select. Desperatly calls out fortnite for copying unironically.In conclusion I really enjoy this game and i think this game can potentially be better then what it is. If only bluehole can pull a u turn and fix up the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-30,0,0,151,False,Not Recommended,Game is pretty average. Often has random server connection issues initial load time is very long. Vehicles roll for little to no reason at times... from hitting glitchy ground sections. Guns are very inaccurate in full auto mode only semi auto firing mode is worth using. The bullet lead and drop is different to any other game you have ever played and feels wrong... you shoot way too far in front of people to hit them with bullet travel times of 3 5seconds.This game is only popular as it is the first DAYZ style survival game to release on consoles and consoles are the majority of the gaming market.

Some textures don't load until a minute after I've dropped. Just before writing this review a played a match with my friend where it wouldn't let me pick anything up. I could walk around I saw my friend picking stuff up. Turns out my character was still in the plane. This wasn't due to my internet since I had no lag while walking around and watching my friend.

2017-09-15,0,0,1412,True,Recommended,I have to say that the arguments that people are making against the developers are very valid especially those addressing the fact that the cosmetic clothing goes beyond cosmetics. It really does matter what you wear in this game because camouflage is incredibly important. Someone wearing dark colored clothing is a lot less visible than someone wearing a yellow jumpsuit. In the final circles this can be absolutely critical.With all of that being said I've never had so much fun in a tactical shooter. Playing with friends in a squad is some of the most rewarding gameplay I've personally experienced. Yes there are bugs and no it is not e sports ready but as a casual gamer I don't care about these issues as much as others would. There's nothing more satisfying to me than getting kills with the kar98 at range against a moving target. Playing with a squad is incredibly satisfying when each player is competent and has some situational awareness. I recommend the game as it stands currently and hope that the developers continue to make improvements instead of abandoning the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is becoming absolutely ridiculous and I'm about to quit playing the game. De sync seemed to get better for a while then it just became absolutely terrible. I'll be peeking behind a tree then watch my death cam and see that on their screen I was standing beside the tree in full visibility. Absolute crap.EDIT They dropped their lawsuits. Thank you. Shouldn't have been filed in the first place. Absolutely crap.Game needs optimizations. I have recordings of people killing me by shooting at the ground. De sync is freaking horrible. I've had people look straight into the sky and shoot and I died. Wasn't even in their sight. Once FIX PUBG campaign is complete I'll play and see if the game is worth giving a thumbs up.ORIGINAL Come on now. Filing a lawsuit against another company that made a similar game? Talk about anti competitive practices. That's stupid. I'll never support a game company that files lawsuits against other developers because they made something similar.I guess in this case the makers of the Battle Royale movies should file a lawsuit against you right? Since you obviously copied their work.Or maybe the creators of Arma should sue you since you took concepts content etc directly from their game. You made a one hit freaking wonder and have the audacity to go after other game developers that try to make something similar.Grow a pair and make quality content rather than just trying to sue your competition.

Regardless the networking funcitonality is horrible. Absolutely 0 support for SLI you just get a buggy menu and in game graphics glitches if you try. You really have to ask yourself what the santaclaus is the project manager is doing? Why on earth can they not fix their networking? why is it that with a new update an old bug returns? or something else entirely gets completely... ruined?This game is not something you would see in a E sport as it does not come down to skill.

Personally this is not a game i would play to have fun. On the other hand if i ever feel the need to punishing myself i'll play four hours straight without getting more than a few kills.Here is why i feel it's so tideous 1. Without 16Gb ram you are garuanteed to eventually run into some huge lag spikes. If you're one of us unfortunate souls you won't be able to render the buildings for the first 1 2 ish minutes. One perk with this tho is that you can kinda walk throu walls and shoot. You'll get stuck tho.2. You want to practice your aim? Sure! Go ahead. Currently the only way to actually get a bit better is to play play play! That means going to hours and hours (appearantly 300+) while scavenging a lvl three helmet and west. If you're so unfortunate to go meet a dude still with a shotgun he'll kill you point blank. You know all that loot? Yeah good wasn't it?3.Either i'm just not ment to be an ""aiming guy"" or there's something wrong with my game. More than once have i had a clear headshot calculated the distance with the lines zeroed inn triangulated all possible exits but still missed. Now hopefully i'm just not that good at shooters but i'm starting to think that 300 hours without ANY kind of result might have other causes than my terrible reactions and appearantly uneven mouse movements.4. You'll get mad. Why do you think i wrote this review? I just sat up til 03 30 to look through a recording of my own death again and again. I was trying to find out where my shots had landed when i suddenly found out that either the recordings are f ed up (which has been proven multiple times) oooor the game sometimes won't allow you to shoot or smthn idk * *On the other hand if you really (and i mean R E A L L Y) just want to play it for fun (whatever that is) squad can sometimes prove to be quite amusing. Just don't expect much of it.To summarise I do not recomend buyng PUBG if you plan to have fun and you ain't got le's Computes. If you've got the PC then great! Good for you! But still prepare to be served hot juicy t from time to time. Well if not all the time.PS I might have written this review in a bad mood 04 00 at night.PPS That doesn't change the fact that i it's the antichrist in form of a game.We from the resistance would like to give all ya'll buyers a good luck and happy suffering!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-29,0,0,758,True,Recommended,A shooter that s as invested in creating a smart Heart Pounding survival experience that is as fun as is action packed.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. From there you can decide whether to jump early which lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition. Or you may also place yourself farther from the center of the arena and loot freely with little to no interference. Its Battle Royal so once you land you need to find weapons and start killing to move to the next area of the map because there is this thing call the zone thats marked by a white circle. You need to stay in that circle as it continues to shrink closing in the amount of land players can be on. if you set out of the save zone you'll lose health gradually.If you are Action driven and love the feeling of your heart pounding by the sec then Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action.Whether its when your acending from the sky and your chute opens and you realize your not alone in the area as everybody scrambles for weapons and gear. Killing begins right from the get go. Be it by melee weapons like sicles and crowbars or even small arms fire like pistols. Theres no running from death. One of the most humerous things is Super man Punching someone. This action which is the combination of jumping and punching sends your character leaping in the air only to have them sending a forceful blow to an opponent. Weapons you pick up are never loaded unless you pick them up from a dead player However ammo is usually next to where the weapon are. With this in mind Another cool and humerous moment you can try which requires great timing if it presents its self to you is when you find a player about to pick up a Weapon go next to them and pick up the ammo D it will send them in a mad craze Thats when you punch the crap out of them and get the gun ) You'll always start off with nothing however dont worry from there you'll be in search for Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests healing items melee weapons and a good mix of firearms which are in all good supply.Happy Hunting Everyone!!

2017-09-10,0,0,664,True,Recommended,"I have over 400 hours in this game and in the past couple of months i've seen such a great improvement of the game.Pros 1 fun to play with friends2 solo isn't half bad especially if you want to have just quick matchmaking and get some frags for fun. Dropping high pop areas on solo matches can be a rush3 the weapon selection and customization are great and they are always adding new weapons4 weapons seemed pretty balanced for the most part. Damage is based off of the bullet type you are using and damage reduction is simply enough based off the level of armor you have.5 high risk high reward. now some people may think why should i have to risk losing a squad member or risk dying to get the gear i need. that's just the beauty of these types of game. if you want to make it to top 10 then you need to decide I'm going to loot for 20 30 minutes in a low pop area and I might get good gear? or am I going to drop high pop and ""may"" lose a guy in squad but get 3 guys fully tiered out. I say may because if your squad is good enough you can definitely come out on top by sticking together. Cons 1 server lag/instability/game performance (this covers all spectrums of the game from bullet registration delayed looting glitches FPS drops/optimization)2 I don't mind purchasable objects within a game. If you want to drop over $100 on a miniskirt. That's on you my friend. I had my time with CSGO crates and i'm done with that life. Personally I think the system is fine but there needs to be tweaks. In order to balance the system they need to give all players a default clothing item per map. For instance the current map gives a slight advantage to players wearing dark clothing/camo gear.TLDR I recommend this game if they fix the stability issues. I can deal with number 2 on my cons list because even if some people have enough money to purchase a million crates and get the cosmetics they like the ones that make a difference on the map are still fairly cheap on the community market. I myself bought a dark tshirt and camo pants for less than a dollar so can't really say a kid with the game can't do the same and sell a couple of crates to buy what he wants.On top of that it doesn't matter what you wear if you can't aim. You can be a tree in the woods but if you can't move your roots you can't dodge a bullet.""If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball.""",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-28,0,0,402,False,Not Recommended,Since the 1.0 update there has been countless Chinese players on the North American servers. Their astronomically high ping combined with their inability to speak English leads to a very hard time when attempting to get a win or match with random people.

There are some times in which I hear my friends complain about lag even more than I do and on higher end systems with better internet. This game is worth the buy if you have 1 3 other people to constantly play with but if you are thinking of matching with anybody that you dont know or just playing solo this game is not for you. You will experience parts in which you know you hit the person and it doesn't register and other times when you see people skipping around corners with very choppy movements. Don't buy this game.

Not only does the game have some realism to it such as Bullet drop but the replay value to it is what really sells me on it. People will downvote this game because of cheaters and the number of Chinese people that play it (yes i'm not joking) but PUBG is currently working on fixing the hacker situation. The game will be put into Full release soon and It amazes me that this game is quite stable while it's still in development. The only cons I would have to say about this game are the hackers that have come with it since Fall 2017 as well as optimization.

The gun mechanics in this battle royal are much better than in h1z1. Right now it is early access alpha so they are working things out. I think the reason why it is so laggy is because of the amount of players daily with this south korean corporation is that they have never really had this many players to deal with so the servers are going on maximum.

2017-04-13,0,0,220,True,Not Recommended,Rewriting the review as there's still major flaws with the game that prevent it from being worthwhile playing. Weapon Issues Every fight full auto jams after a few rounds and you have to take your finger off the mouse to reset (lag or glitching idk happens on other modes too). Impossible to gauge half of my sniper shots over 500m as terrain texture and depth doesn't vary same goes for foliage rock and tree cover. The fact that you can't seperate lean + ADS from changing your weapon hand in third person gets you killed and drives you batshit too. Bullet loops for your stock would serve a much better role of being a tactical reloading mod for sohtgun and bolt action rifles chambering single cartridges at a time.Community Issues My experience with the community is they fit into 3 main categories Casual gamers who don't know how to reload their gun somewhat experienced juvenile delinquents of millenial or H1Z1/ArmaModded/CoD backgrounds and absolute monsters from the Rust/GenXCoD/ArmaSquad/Squad/TacticalShooter crowd. It can drive someone to smash their monitor (whoops P) when they're constantly put with the latter types and vice versa please consider a skill based ranking system for everyone's sake Bluemoon. Regardless of category please don't make the community worse by exiting to lobby during flight turn off your mic or lone wolfing it like a (on that note please change chance base solo/semi squad queing in duos and squads to a checklist option deactivated by default).Overall game issues There is no overall purpose to the game from the onset the premise is so casual and yet the gameplay is so serious and replayable. Community market items aren't valuable (outside of the imfamous and pointless preorder) due to their rarity so your time is wasted on that front. I wish there was a way in game to search for discord communities and individuals when you wanna play seriously or for competitive tornament play with a way to register a persistent clan and their respective squads for match making. So the gameplay mechanics are remarkably versatile yet the mods being developed for custom servers are remarkably facepalm. Adding full ruleset and asset modding would be a massive benefit to your modding community. Finally please consider a Virtual Reality standalone launcher or custom modded option for those that want an Onward style battle royale experience. I've uninstalled for now as I can't be bothered with the existing issues but i'll keep an eye on your progress.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Perfect map size weapon variety great shooting mechanics and you can't just jump out of moving cars without dying (*cough* H1Z1 *cough*)This game does have a couple of downsides the major two being server stability and lack of optimisation. Luckily neither of these are game breaking and you're still able to enjoy the game completely through these flaws. Servers have become less of a problem through the latest patch and I'm sure many patches to come. Optimisation will be fixed very shortly (April 14th according to the dev roadmap) and I can still run the game 50 60 fps on low settings 1080p (GTX 960M 4GB). After this game has been optimised it will be even better and I can't wait to see what this game delivers. It has huge potential and we just have to hope the devs don't it up like H1Z1.ONE WARNING TO AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS I'VE FOUND THE OCEANIC SERVER TO BE MORE LAGGY THAN THE ASIAN SERVER FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD ADD IT.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The shrinking circles that force plays to a specific section of the map is a simple yet fantastic idea. The scrounging abilities are awesome as well. Granted half the things I pick up I never use but if I do manage to find a better weapon that fits whatever attachments I pick up I'm always happily surprised.

2017-09-06,0,0,392,True,Recommended,so after 200+hrs into this game i think its time to write an honest review 180 or so hours have been in the eu server after the amount of inconsitency's with bullet reg damage etc i decided to try N/A and SA servers the difference is unbelievable on both servers the responsiveness just feels all there bullet reg is 1000x better and i cant seem to figure out why that would be. doing research it shows eu servers have a very low tick rate.. and by very low we are talking 20ticks.. for a game that wants a competetive route that is diabolical NA and SA servers have around the 30 mark and the difference is day and night.. yeah sure its early access and all but instead of devs prioritising new maps and new weapons they should be focussed on the infrastructure within the servers and give it a good overhaul im sure many of you in the eu know what im talking about bullets seem to just miss even on people not moving. before 'git gud' kicks in try for your selfs. im near on finding it impossible to hold a 1.4k/d on eu servers yet N/A 3+ and SA 3+ K/D i really do love this game but the more i play it the more i realise the amount of that isnt being the number one priority for being sorted is near the back of the list it seems whilst i do recommend this game i dont recommend playing on eu servers and as for the RNG in this game it seems to be getting worse i can loot 8+ Houses and come away with no vest a level one helmet and if im lucky a double barrel yet the next house with have 2AK'S with 120 bullets an m16 and a ump all in the same house after the loot nerf this game has become more frustrating than ever it needs a rebalance and an even spread of weapons. as time goes on with this game i do feel like the servers for the eu are getting even worse from first playing the game to the last big update they released i had won 10+ games in solo. since then not even a wiff of a chicken dinner and its disapointing. maybe im just getting worse as the game goes on or the game its self is. again if youre in the eu and you purchase this game please dont play eu servers theyre terrible. just to add my internet is by far superior enough to play my own regions servers let alone across the ponds one so dont come saying internet etc when clearly it isnt..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Trying over and over again the same didn't work in past to fix but they try it again after the dust without notice of such definition of insanity and lack of transparency. The objective is to find a workaround instead of a fix to every single bug of the game if possible should be the exact oposite. Horrible graphics and terrible map design map feels a lot artificial not gameplay friendly for the game style and lacks any kind of detail. No proper roadmap plan as seen the way that they implemented features like first more than 1 map and only moths after map choice for the players and considered the affects on gameplay of having more than 1 map. (Now removing some map choice again) They don't really know what to do they live day to day and predict no future at all. Has free2play economy but the game is 30$. BP previously a good reward is now worthless since now everything is locked behind a paywall of keys. Ads inside of the game of diverse PUBG Corp events. THIS IS NOT A FREE GAME! Devs don't really have any comprehension of what the game needs vs. what the community want they just do what they want and try to make the most money of that.

Claim that ""they"" own the entire Genre of BattleRoyal and that others have copied them weeks later they copy DLC ""pass"" mechanics as the same way they acussed other of copy there genre.PROS Unfortunately there isn't still ANY game that offers a TRUE BR experience without building or magic bull so you are pretty much force into this pile of crap because is still to be found a true replacement to PUBG.TLDR You are force into this game because there isn't any other game that offers similiar experince if there is such thing the probability is that is a better game and you should play that instead of this money grab trap with a delusional dev team that obviously lives in another reallity.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-01,0,0,635,False,Not Recommended,This game should've never left beta.1. Servers are still ridiculously bad for a shooter. Constant desync and lag especially in the first 10 minutes of the game. Tickrates under 10 (yes ten!) are nothing special. You'll be lucky if you get 30 after 10 15 minutes into the game. 2. It's getting worse instead of better with every patch. If you're looking for a competitive shooter don't play this game. If you don't care about getting killed 1 2 seconds after being behind cover then have fun with it.3. There are still a million bugs and glitches. E.g. your scope randomly switches to another reticle and color.4. You're stuck a lot. Mountain terrain is the worst. There is no indicator that shows you whether or not you can e.g. climb/run on rocks/certain mountain terrain etc.5. Vehicle physics is a joke. You're still randomly dying from bikes falling over for no reason. Your vehicle will run into tiny objects you can't see and you'll spin around maybe even taking damage.6. I've got a i7 8700k and a GTX 1080ti and even I have problems maintaining FPS above 100. I use custom settings that should theoretically help with FPS but it's still nowhere near a decently optimized game especially when builings are around.I could go on forever. I have 620h in this game (including beta) so I can't complain that I didn't get enough bang for my bucks but this game is just such a sad story. It had so much potential. Sadly the devs are not willing/able to provide the improvements they promised. I fear that this game is dead in 1 year and this game won't ever come to a point I would consider a finished game that is truely e sports ready.Don't be fooled by all the e sports stuff btw. Nobody is signing up for this. At least no pro players/teams. There is a reason for that.

At that time it was understandable to encounter bugs even the most unknown and random bugs that costs your life. It was also understandable to see bad optimization in the game. It was understandable since it was in early access. More than that crates were used to have such high prices and in my opinion it was easier to gain BP to buy crates. I would also like to thank you for giving such an enjoyable gaming battle royale experience and for adding FPP servers in SEA. Even until now i am still enjoying the game.But Is this game still in early access? Nope.In addition they added keys to open crates what the ****? Are you planning to slowly kill this game like the most popular valve's shooter did? Alright you might be better for still adding contents such as new maps and guns but are you aiming for that? To be honest we players or at least me do not give a **** about skins. Rather than adding some unimportant content that makes us download a huge amount of updates with no significant nor noticeable changes this game should be more focused on improving their game optimization. I would not lie even tencent games optimize the game better than you in PUBG mobile some of my friends would also agree with that. Fix your servers i often get ""servers are too busy"" note while restarting lobby or starting the game. Somehow please do something to reduce me and my friends pressing restart lobby every time we want to play. Your servers sometimes (25% 50% of my playtime) is laggy as ****. I fully understand the problem also relies on my internet connection but i am not the only one who complain about this issue. Fix yout hitregs fix sound mechanics as for now it is kinda unrealistic on how you make a sound when vaulting and not making sound while jumping from the same height fix vaulting as well as i usually encounter some windows that should be vaultable but not Fix vehicle mechanics as sometimes it is not realistic kinda contradicts to law of physics (lol) and fix your map as well as i still find some invinsible objects in the way. Somehow i found some teleporters for whatever the reason is. So far i have not faced with cheaters but i hope you are keep improving the anticheat also please fix the lobby as sometimes i need to wait around 3 minutes for my character to ready after pressing ready button and i still have some or probably many unpleasant problems that might be missed during writing this review.Do not get me wrong i still enjoy this game despite rages on the backstage. But please fix those whole problems and i am certain this game would be enjoyable. So is this game worth buying? As for now if you do not mind with problems i have stated above then go ahead.

Metagame doesnt really get stale depending on wether u wanna have fun or find the most efficient way to win.3rd Person vs 1st Person Third person is extremely defensive and it's all about getting the good positions first and then just stay safe and defensive in third person. First person allows way more different approaches and is more fair imo. Sadly it's not fully optimized yet so it's kinda iffy since u're somehow very small lots of scaling problems and placements of windows and stuff is also optimized for 3rd person instead of first person.I'd recommend it regardless and hope it's gonna get better and better as it did till now.Edit Alright. Sadly i cannot recommend the game anymore or at least only for the first 10 20 hours. That amount of entertainment you can get out after that you will most likely get turned off by the greedy developers (battlepass locked crates no progression system only incentives to pay more and more and more...) and the STILL optimization.I'm very sad that such a great game is turning into a stale mcdonalds burger.I hope other developers are going at it differently lets hope for the best for battlefield and the other BRs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-24,0,0,81,False,Recommended,"Think of this as a mixed review becaue the game mostly plays fine but.. Guns handle nice the movement feels clunky. Looting sucks unless you use the inventory menu to loot. (PUBG mobile has a better looting menu it's kinda sad lmfao) Driving feels like driving a bathtub on wheels with a 1 second input delay when turning. The camera for riding in cars is awful and when trying to shoot people while riding in a car might as well be considered torture.As for the preformance it's kinda hard to say the game runs badly as of writing this review (on low settings at least). No more FPS drops when landing from what I can tell. You still need an SSD if you want to reliably load in. Also since #ReigonLockChina is still being spammed I personally haven't encountered any chinese players either since the recent ""achievements"" patch. It seems that they've actually implemented a ping limiter or some other thing. So people with high ping miiiight be matched with foreign players now. Though I can't confirm this without playing more. It's tough to recommend a game where in my 27ish hours I've encounterd 2 cheaters already. One was from China (locked on my head all the way from Po i through walls and buildings. I was in another town) and the other was from NA (being less blatent but still shot me through terrain).The microtransactions don't matter. People and moan about them but they're one of least disgusting implementations of ""lootboxes"" I've seen. Sure they focus on microtransactions instead of fixing their game but Overwatch is doing just fine doing the same thing )In conclusion I'd rather play this than Fortnite so it's got that going for it. It'll probably get better but until 2.0 (if this game lives that long) you should wait.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-05,0,0,431,False,Not Recommended,This game is extremely fun when playing with friends and not taking it seriously. I have had a lot of good moments playing this game but over time the issues with it start to get very frustrating. The biggest for me is the desync in combat that makes it so I have no desire to ever try to play this game competetively. One of the developers biggest mistakes was adding a death cam so the players could see just how bad the desync is. I would not reccomend this game unless you are patient don't care if you die from desync issues and have a group of friends to play squads with. If you are in NA expect random 3 4 hour updates during peak hours that will make you consider why you ever spent 400 hours on this game. Also if you want any of the rare cosmetics good luck getting them without spending money. The developers are starting to seem like they care more about getting money through loot crates and a battle pass than they do about fixing issues the community has been complaining about since release. Half the time the UI doesn't even work properly and you constantly have to refresh your lobby or reboot your game. Like I said the game is very fun when playing with friends and I would reccomend it if you are just trying to play casually in squads or duos otherwise I wouldn't waste your time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You've decided to make a game that everyone loves and enjoys and put something that a large majority of people hate and see it as a cancer to the communities that it is put in. Microtranactions.

Why should a game that you pay $30 for make you pay more for keys to open a crate for a chance to get an item. That's bad business practice and it shows that they just want more money. I also don't understand how with over 5 million copies sold (July 29th 2017) that they can't just host this GAMESCOM PUBG INVITATIONAL and have the prize money come from the money that they got from selling the game.

Do not play it alone it's much fun with friends otherwise you will get paired with Chineese players I am not saying they are bad but most of them are cheaters and I wouldn't want to get carried to a chicken dinner by a cheater.

And bare in mind theres 100 people in a game so you do the maths) Some players seem to be able to fire the single fire weapons (M16) in full auto with lazer like accuracy (Dont know if this is macros/ hax or whatever) So many times I die and and like ""How?!?!?!"" don't know if its the bad latency/ cheaters or what and it leaves you second guessing which isnt a great feeling The items in the crates are so rare and take so long to earn and even if I do earn something rare I'd have to sell it because I cant justify walking round in a 100 shirt in a 25 game They've taken us early access backers money and put it into the Xbox version (And its even more broken on Xbox) instead of finsihing the game and fixing the issues that have been in since early access releaseSuch a great game with such potential and until they fix these gamebreaking issues I cant see myself playing it much moreIf you got the game during early access fair enough but I wouldnt recommend buying now in its current state",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,1,1,572,False,Recommended,Review after 180+h of gameplay (Pre release)Cons Optimization is bad (please fix asap or atleast before the final release) client and server side performance is unstable and it's common to get low fps and to experience network lag when picking up items interacting with objects ... Sometimes it can be buggy (vehicles exploding randomly mostly) but it got much better with time. Some people are complaining about cheaters even if I haven't found one yet. Anyways the devs are going to improve the anti cheat system apparently so just wait It's now full of cheaters please make the Anticheat better. Even if the cheaters are noobs and can be killed (when they play from china with an high ping) it's very unlikely to defeat them and they ruin a perfectly played 30min game in 1 second.Pros Very dynamic gameplay the transition between a calm situation and an intense firefight is very quick. Variety of choices you can play it how you want. For example you can be very careful and follow the zone to keep your back covered or you can rush in and defend your position from others. Also the looting and late game strategies are probably going to influence your game the most. Non forgiving game this is the reason why it's defined as a competitive game. First of all the aim is important but it's not the only must have. The most important skill is being able to take decisions that offer the best reward/risk ratio the decisions that are going to bring you to the final circles. There you'll also have to get as much information as possible to spot your enemies and avoid being engaged from behind. Since the new update you also have to run away from the circle as fast as you can because staying outside is not an option anymore. Well made damage system the time to kill is decent as it's not too fast and not too slow. Even the most powerful weapons won't one shot armored enemies if not in the head. Since headshots are hard to master most of the times you'll have enough time to react at range. In CQC the story is different because shotguns and SMGs are going to take out enemies faster than ARs if properly used. Encourages teamwork going alone in duo/squad games is a suicide. Staying together is the only way to prevent getting killed when injured. At the same time the team must be fast enough to get as much loot as possible and stay inside the zone. Firefights are quite long when it's about taking out 4 enemies and revive your team so the time is the enemy number one. Getting downed in the final circles is very likely to kill you because the circle isn't going to forgive your mistakes.In the end this game has got many problems but I hope they're going to be fixed soon. Now the team is also producing new content to expand the game.I really like this game and if played with the right people it's the one of the best ways to have some action. I also find myself much more relaxed and I feel like I'm enjoying this game more than csgo a game on which I spend 700h. Winning on this game is a great feeling because it happens only if 1) You're a bit lucky 2) all your choices during the game were correct and made you stand over the other players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-21,0,0,490,False,Not Recommended,After many MANY hours I decided to finally review this game. In pro con thing...(sorry if I make mistakes english isnt my first language. JUMP TO THE END IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE CONCLUSION THERE IS A LOT TO READ IF NOT Pro's You can spend many hours on this. It is very addictive especially with friends.Very easy to lear but hard to master. Which makes it better the more you advance.Good Co op with friends. Teamwork is essential and is very rewarding and fun. And for laughes. 2 Maps with kinda different playstyle which gives you more gameplay and opportunities Many features and weapons which let you experiment and have guns. Overall good ish graphics. But with their budget they can do better. Two maps on the way. Which means the dev's are still working on this game. Quite often bug fixes. But not enough.Cons Many MANY MANY cheaters on this game. They try to ban them all and I get it's hard but there are still so many.You may experience a few games in a row with hackers which really sucks.Many small bugs nothing to bad but its really annoying that they dont fix them (rocks you can see through and walk in them and walls like that and stuff)Glitches with vehicles TOO MANY TIMES I have died from the vehicle deciding it wants to flip for no reason or crash with the air which results with dying. Which is really annoying especially if its in the late game.not enough updates! since I started playing which was soon after the launch of the game The only thing they added was ONE new map and some weapons and vehicles. Most of them going into the airdrop. They really can do many things with their budget but I fell they are wasting it on things we dont really need or want. Such as crates or Flare guns to the test server. (who wants that??). They do noteven add GAME MODES such as 50V50 or Zombies (as promised in the last E3 if I remember correctly) Which I was really waiting for.Player base. Pubg's community is pretty good. But it is starting to get smaller (Because of most of the thing I mentioned before and more) Including 4 of my friends and me too (partially)________________________________________________________________________________PUBG VS FORNITE the big questionI think overall Pubg is a better and more enjoyable game. There is more tactics and more skill ( i think so at least) needed for the game. Which makes it more challening and more fun. Pubg also has two maps and more vehicles and weapons that change with attachements and everyhing that comes with that. BUT Fortnite keep adding to their game. Almost every week there is a new gamemode and some new weapons here and there. Which keeps your interest there and makes it fun every week. also after all the hackers in pubg sometimes what you want to do is just play some fortnite A game with almost ZERO hackers.I think if you like more teamwork and tactics. With realistic graphics and weapons and dont rage easily at a game. Then pubg is the choice for you. But if you like to relax with friends and troll a bit and have here and there some fun without being too focused on the game. Then you should go to fortnite.Is it worth the price? No I dont htink so in it's current state. But if they do a decent sale or you know a decent place you can get it for cheaper. and have friends to play with. It's a very fun game.You should though watch some gameplay and maybe play the mobile version so you can get a grasp of what the game is like.In conclusion Pubg is a fun game but still has a lot of work to go through. It is worth a try but I think for this price you can surely get something better.Sorry for the long review. Hope this helps. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-30,0,0,236,False,Not Recommended,The concept for this game is fantastic It's an extremely addicting challenge to fight 99 other players to attempt to be the last one standing. The Negative review comes from the game itself. For about a week you can look past the glaring flaws and imperfections and indulge in pure silly fun either with friends or without but once you start getting into the game a bit more and start actively seeking wins the flaws become a lot more frustrating. From getting killed by someone who is already rounded a corner a good 2 seconds ago to killing yourself by having a vehicle you're driving launch into orbit and drop you to your death or even just being flatout killed by someone using hacks to see your model through objects across the map and aimbot you dead with a headshot PUBG just becomes one infuriating loss after the next. I don't expect to win every single game nor should anyone but deaths rarely feel like it's 100% on you. Most games leave you with a bitter feeling of being robbed of a kill from problems like your character putting your gun down because you nudged too close to cover while in a firefight or desync causing the player you see yourself loading hundreds of bullets into to flank and one shot you while you're too busy shooting at his doppelgänger.I cannot recommend this game to anyone in it's current state. It's playable yes but the amount of frustration and disappointment that comes from how poorly optimized and how little progress is being made to correct issues that have been in the game since it's EA launch aren't worth it.If the devs get off their and address issues that have been plaguing the game for months instead of doing like adding microtransactions and working on meeting some arbitrary release date instead of meaningful milepoints in the game's development I'll change my mind but I honestly don't see that happening any time soon.EDIT The game's not in EA anymore still runs like it is. Still isn't very much fun to play outside of the 1% of the match you spend killing someone compared to the 99% of running. Still don't recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

What makes this game appealing to me is the gun play. It feels more realistic than arcady which is something I value highly.

Came across one in NA Third person today and was wondering why he didnt have a helmet. Not funny thing is everyone he kills including me is headshotted and loses their helmet.

2017-06-24,2,1,93,True,Not Recommended,The game is (was) great when I first started playing it two weeks ego. I was actually able to get some kills and got killed alot. That is totally understandable. But things just changed. Now it is nothing but lag lag and nothing BUT lag. I truned my settings to Low and that didn't make one bit of difference. I installed CPUCores and that didn't make any difference. It actually made the game worse and more laggy. After the last update the lag has made the game basically useless for me. I have Intel i7 GeForce GTX 980 16GB RAM WIN 10 and I even tried using CPUCores wich didn't help one bit. I am somewhat familiar with speeding up my PC since I have been a PC repair tech for the last 20 years. For Example I used to be able to kill people easily with punching NOT anymore. Today I landed at the same time as this other guy I started chasing him trying to punch him not once I was able to make contact he was running away from me the hole time and I never saw him having a chance to pickup any weapons. It was lagging so bad that at one time I saw him outside of the building when we were both inside of the building. He cosntantly was skipping away from me and making distance then he turned around and pulled out a rifle and killed me. How the HELL is that possible when I was following the hole time from the moment he landed and I was RIGHT behidn him?????? I can tell you how LAGGGGG... Yes I understand that this game is in development but when you release an update please try to improve not make it ten times worse.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-28,0,0,305,True,Not Recommended,"UPDATE Looked into how much PUBG made so far well over 100M US currency ON AN EARLY ACCESS GAME?!?!??!?!??! THEN THEY WANT MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FU PUBG or MICROSOFT since it is going to console by next year.I like the came so far but it definitely has its issues. First I would have to say knowing that they are in early access and still going to impliment a microtransaction feature is STUPID!!! You will only lose your original fan base and keep the ones that either don't mind paying to get their ""cool stuff"" then they when they spent $2.50 on some bogus stuff. Next seems like for the first 30 seconds of landing you have to deal with major lag. noticeable if you go into a house/building and try to interact with objects within that period Last thing it is defintely way to easy to camp your way to top 10 and then pop out of the house to kill the final dude that probably had to run around the whole game to get into the 'safe zone'. I know this because I myself have been on both sides of the spectrum. Pros best battle royal to date IMO 100 players is the perfect amount to make it face paced but doesnt feel like you are in a huge war.Cons Camping Simulator Waaaaaay too many pistol/shotguns Not enough M16 AKM M24 etc.Conclusion Ill still end up playing this game because GTA V has gone to and CSGO has gotten old so ill play this til another game comes out or if the microtransactions on the game.

All of my friends had stopped playing it and they were the only reason I had continued to play this game after my initial negative review. It can honestly be a fun time with friends (by fun I mean humorous) but in my opinion solo is just pointless. Like everyone else on here I've played a lot of shooters. Almost never through all the years that I've played games like CounterStrike Call of Duty Overwatch and even Battlefield (except for 4 which was a mess for a while) have I felt like the game itself was consistently screwing me or somebody else over in a match. But PUBG does. I'm not even talking about when it's me doing the dying. Sometimes I land kills where I'm like ""Yeah that was stupid."" I'm not an expert on desync and lag and whatnot especially when it's not the kind that's right in your face but something makes this game incredibly inconsistent each time I play. The guns never feel like they are doing the same thing twice. And there seems to be a lot updates but they don't feel like they're changing anything on more than a cosmetic level. It's a shame because I've played a few Royale games now and I know I like this genre and I like the style of PUBG the best which is why I've put so many hours in.

Before release I probably encountered one or two in an entire night of playing (anywhere from 15 30 matches). Now (and this is not an exaggeration) over half the matches my friends and I play have hackers in them. Aim assist is a HUGE problem in this game. I have encountered multiple scenarios where I can move on the other side of a hill from a hacker (obviously not even close to being in his line of sight) and watch the bullets land at head level on the other side of the hill on full auto. Just tonight I was doing duos with a buddy and in the six matches we played we were killed by hackers in four of them (two of which we were down to 4 remaining). This creates an extremely unsatisfying and disappointing experience. Bluehole needs to get its act together on stopping these hackers or they'll end up with a game that only cheaters play. Thus until this changes I STRONGLY SUGGEST not buying this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

In that right I highly recommend.However I am not going to recommend this is game (thumbs up) as there does not appear to be any anti cheat code in the game at all. By the time you get to the top ten survivors the cheating becomes rediculously obvious (spin around and 1 shot kill or folks knowing your exact location etc) just watch a few YouTube videos of the hacking in this game. The folks at the top of the leaderboards have over %50 win rates... meaning that they win more than every other game... not really possible in this type of game... Update/Edit August 2017 I changed my review to ""recommend"" as there does seem to be a very strong effort going on to stop the cheating. I've seen very little cheating lately. The only real frustration lately is that the end game circle is a bit too random and often gives an unfair advantage to whoever happens to be left in it The circle should be determined via interpolation (average/mid point of player locations) to bring players closer and closer together.One small other thing... the map does not offer much cover in most areas the fields to the east of Gatka are incredibly good to fight in with bushes trenches uneven terrain and such however this is an exception to the current map. Update/Edit March 2018 There is a reporting system for hacking that is advertised. The way it works is that when people get killed they can click to report the person who killed them. A short time after winning just over a hundred games I received a notification when I logged into Steam stating that I was received a temporary one day ban from this game based on unconfirmed suspicions of hacking. I don't hack... I just play with stealth till the very end (I take a lot of screenshots and have very few kills). What this means is that unhappy players ""rage report"" after they lose a game.... hence betters players accumulate reports. This happened to me. So apparently at the current time the more one plays this game one will naturally accumulate reports from unhappy players. I guess an algorythm is setup to ban folks when a certain limit is hit. This is not a very good system. I used to be hopeful when the developer advertised that they banned such and such number of hackers in such and such amount of time (I despise hackers). Now as a victim of the system I know how the system works. It seems like just a marketing thing rather than an intelligent system.If the developers ever decide to actually combat real hackers and not do this broad spectrum appoach that occasionally hurts normal players they might consider region locking the game such that regions with large amounts of actual hackers can't play outside of their own region. I'll try to remember to update my review again if that ever happens.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-25,0,0,93,False,Recommended,Really loves this game!Its little bit hard to learn in the beginning because of the pvp and looting but IF u give it some time u get the hang of it.The matches IS not the same at all! Sometimes u get ing great loot and die 5 mins later and other times u get loot and u end up killing 5 people and winning the match. I'll recommend buying the game if u have some friends playing because its way more fun playing with friends than playing solobad things i can say is The new map sucks To many hiding spots and its to BIG for 100 people. Sometimes u just walk aroud for 10 mins before u meet any enemies. It takes ALOT from ur CPU even if u have the game on low graphics. And the performance sometimes is just awful when u load in to a match it take ages and when u finally done loading the plane just started to fly over the map.8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Now they're too caught up on making money while the game is dying instead of fixing and making pubg the great game it really is. Just a stupid amount of bugs poor optimization and too many ways to die that are just completely out of your control. If you flip your bike or car 9/10 you're dead on the spot. If you're not completely stopped in your bike or car and you try to get out? You have a very good chance of running yourself over. Dont even get me started on the lag.

2017-06-29,0,0,172,True,Recommended,"Needs optimization on both client and server side. If my PC doesn't run this game smoothly most won't. This has the potential to be a very good game. The biggest issue with it right now is lag. Blood splatter is client side. Every time you hit someone with a shot they will splatter whether the hit was registered on the server side or not. Game needs to be more clear on how hits are registered. Give a hit marker like on H1Z1 if the hit actually hit. Countless times I have hit someone in the face with a shotgun and see blood splatter only to be shot by what appears to be nothing and then I die.That's fine just let me know if my shot registered or not. Giving arbitrary ""hit points"" doesn't tell a player how much they hit someone or how much life they took from a player. It just feels like a lazy way to say ""sorry you lost and we aren't telling you whether it was lag or your fault""I put a lot of hours into this game and the things that used to be cute about it are the same things that frustrate the hell out of me now.

For a developer that seemed so against paid cosmetics in early access they've certainly changed their viewpoint now. There were much better ways to do if if the sole purpose was to actually test the crate system (for example just make the crates that players earn normally need a key and give them a key along with any crate they unlock). Also trying to organize an esports event while the game is in early access is just dumb. How is a not finished game supposed to be competative in such a serious enviroment?

2018-05-30,0,0,671,False,Not Recommended,After EA release I spent a ton of time on this game. I was on par with some streamers like Grimmmz. It's still the same as before except buggier. There used to be funky physics cars that would crash and fly through the air which was gotten rid of. Instead of are either glued to the ground or roll for an eternity.The team apparently has no idea how to balance their weapons. For a time the M4 was the objectively best weapon for a long time and instead of tuning it down a little everything got nerfed so that the vector is considered the best weapon for close medium range.But my by far biggest complaint is the absence of any kind of change in gameplay. The last gameplay update was in December 2017 when vaulting got released. Vaulting is still badly animated and buggy as hell. Pros still prefer bumping into a window to simulate crouch jumping. Atleast at the beginning the ridiculousness was fun but they removed the weird fun mechanics and now it's either running or sitting simulator.You wonder why a kids game like Fortnite is doing so well? Every damn week they add something new push the boundaries. Meanwhile they still get a story hidden in there and really good skins on top of that!

The distance of gunshots being fired is easilly distinguishable the type or gun being fired is also easilly distinguishable Negative Random loot can really mess up the experianceVery poor optimization at the time of this review with even powerful gaming machines struggling to get consistantly good performance out of the title.Loot boxes they're becoming somewhat a standard feature in every game these days but really..

2017-08-18,0,0,166,True,Recommended,This game will make you suffer for the first 50 hours of gameplay.But after you surpassed that hours of gameplay im sure you have already or shortly after win a game for the first time or if before 50 hours you already won its god given talent.And a couple more hours later you will get your first 15+ kill game winner winner chicken dinner.AND IT FEELS SO GOOD.So would reccomend but for the start reccomend you playing with your friend that has played earlier than you to give you a head start on what to do where to land what to get whats good and not what works what doesnt and all of that shennanigans.So the only CON that i currently have is that you need ateleast 12 GB of ram to make the houses already fully render when you landed on the ground.8 is just not going to cut it. You will have atleast 30 45 seconds (or sometimes less depending on how many players on your match) Then after it renders you will be able to get into the house and loot (If you havent died by someone that has a better pc than you.) And the adventure goes on from there.Personally the hitreg is kinda 50/50 but it works most of the time.Its like when you are feeling it everything hits but when you are just riding everything nothing will even hit even from 1 meter away.It feels like that.So would i reccomend it? Absolutely will i have invited alot of friends to play so i dont get lonely from playing to much solo matches because solo does get boring after awhile without a switchup playing duo or squad.FPP is good still in beta but it works.9.5/10 Would reccomend,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The amount of lag after dropping in somewhere is just disgusting and is only getting worse with the increasing amount of players getting the game (which doesn't make sense because it's only 100 players per server so why does the over all volume of the game effect the individual server? Maybe it's time for a server upgrade).2.) Hackers own this game right now (They are working on it but this doesn't take away from the relevance)3.) Your client will crash whenever it feels like it.4.) If someone's ping is just one point lower than yours they become Angelina Jolie from Wanted and curve bullets around any obstacle so don't even bother getting behind cover.5.)

2017-12-29,0,0,11,False,Recommended,First of all im a newcomer in this game or rather type of game. But I'd already have to reccomend it it is a solid game but there are a couple things to note before playing it.1.) There are alot of hackers. Alot. It gets really annoying when you get shot by a bullet that was aimed 5 feet behind you but you can report players. It's also kind of mediocre that there are 3 million active players and that 1.5 Million players have already been banned. Seriously read this article http //store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/22848799495361194752.) There are alot of Asian players and i haven't been in an American server yet without any Asian players.3.) Running around. There is alot of running. Whether it be to a house or highway running away from bombs / enemies or just trying to get back inside the boundaries.4.) Play this game with a friend. It's pretty stale if you play it alone.5.) You're gonna get shot alot. And if you're new to this style of FFA you're gonna get shot from people you couldn't see in the distance.This game is fun though. If you like games such as H1Z1 or Fortnight's battle royal its pretty much the exact same thing. This was useed to inform you guys if you buy this game which i reccomend these are things you need to look forward to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-08,0,0,664,True,Not Recommended,I played this game a lot. Heck even my wife played it and she DOES NOT play video games. I really enjoyed it despite all the glitches and saw that it was constantly getting better. And then i was BANNED for no reason. I'm sure they had a reason but refused to share it with me. They said i was cheating. Which is strange... 359 hours in and i won the game once solo and maybe twice in squad. I'm not very good but i enjoyed playing it and watching wife learn WASD and all that. I appealed ban and they said they reviewed it and truly beleive i was cheating. But didn't say how. .40 K D ratio .10 head shots. just doesn't make sense. So they essentially stole 37 dollars from me. I appreciate that hacking was a huge problem for a while but i guess they decided to err on the side of caution and handed out PERMANENT BANS. Maybe market shares were dropping and counting on people buying another copy? I don't know.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-09-17,0,0,10,True,Not Recommended,Personally I find this game sort of boring (7 hours and I feel like I have to make myself play it.) I got it because it's wildly popular and I design games myself so maybe I'm not strictly the target audience but let me elaborate.So I hear a lot of people turned off by the game because it's a shooter. When I first picked up the game and was impressed to be in the top 50% I thought that maybe that wasn't true because you can make it pretty far through wits and strategy.Here's the thing though. The game literally monentarily reward killing people and you are only going to get that credit if you shoot someone. There is no other way to outplay someone. Sure you can have the highground better items and even a car but to take someone out you are going to have to kill them and that almost always means playing the game like a first person shooter.Now personally I think shooters are sort of a played out genre. I really enjoy the early stages of the game where you plan out your route try to get as much loot while taking as few risks as possible but the map shrinks. That means that no matter how successfully you outmanuvered others in the early stage of the game winning means that you are going to end up in a tiny circle in a firefight. To me that sounds more like losing because it's the part of the game I least enjoy.I think that the survival elements of this game the circle contracting the design of the map and even the way items spawn are excellent and interesting but to conclude I just don't enjoy the actual gameplay when it gets to what the game is really about.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-01-26,0,0,1073,False,Recommended,When only 1 person out of 100 wins each game there tends to be a lot of rage and salt. Especially if you're bad at the game. This I suspect is the case with half the reviews who are people who make excuses for their performance. Anyways on to the review like most games especially fps games there's hackers desync issues etc. But it definitely isn't a bad game because of it. And in the long run this shouldn't make the game unenjoyable for you. I recommend it because of how strategic you have to be while playing. What I mean is how you act according to the situation that match gives you. Do you rush somebody or wait for them? Which building or hilltop do you take? What weapon or attachments? Should you take a car or go on foot? These are only a few questions out of the hundreds you'll be asking yourself (or teammates) every match. And the more you play the easier the answers will be and the more games you'll win. After over 500 hours I still enjoy it and so do the people I play it with. This game has come a long ways and unlike so many others it's getting constantly updated and improved weekly. So if you're the impatient gamer I'll tell you not to waste your time. And if you want to win everytime you won't but that's part of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It used to be hell of a lot of fun at first but then from patch 1.0 and forth it'd been going downhill and has recently reached the bottom. Bluehole had everything they could ever wish for. Insanely huge playerbase? Check . Loads of support from streamers/youtubers? Check . And man don't even get me started on the amount of suggestions for gameplay improvements they've recieved it was pure madness (most of them never to be implemented unfortunately). The community was thriving and willing to give the developers every bit of help they could. Bluehole however didn't care. They opted for adding new crates/keys/skins/etc. instead of actually fixing the game (it's not early acces anymore though it runs as if it was) and getting rid of all the bugs and issues (which trust me are plentiful).

If they havent fixed it yet how do you expect them to get help from the game engine design team they are now suing. You know what flops around? A dying fish gasping for air. That is this game. A dying fish flopping around on the beach. I have played 1 000 hours. I have tried to have fun and EVERY SINGLE TIME said yep F this game. Only to try it again hours later or days later. 100's of millions of dollars earned months and months of time to spend some of that making the game a better expirience. Still nothing. Gun skins emotes new maps that take almost 6 months to develope. All to avoid fixing the onkly point his game ever had to shoot someone else with a gun and for that bullet to impact them as intended and to do dameage and kill that person. Its all RNG and latency. So you end up firing a M24 at a persons head 3 times. hitting him twice with a 4 x scope from 250m only to have him spin find you take aim with a red dotted KAR98 and blow your head off in one F'ing shot. Im over it. Done. The Bluehole vs Epic lawsuit is a suicide attempt so they can move on with no excusses from a game they know cant be fixed. They have proven they do not know how to fix this game. Plain and simple.I am having fun playing Ring of Elysium. It does what PUBG tries to do. Its pretty back to basics as far as being the same BR model with TPP and terrible Asian servers for a US player. But I think things will come around. And it offers me the ability to still be addicted to BR style games without having to jump into a land where you can build walls while you run around and shoot candy canes and pompoms at 12 year olds. Fortnite is a kids game and makes no sense in a Realistic Battle Royal simulation. RoE is pretty much PUBG without the FPP skins and netcode issues. Even playing from NA. Do not buy this game.

But if the rapidly shrinking player base is an indication of anything its that we are all quite sick and tired of the dev's empty promises for improvements.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They need to fix the lag of every fight because if you are behind a wall you will still get shot which pisses 99 9% of players off. They insane lag when you land on the map is insane if you dont know what im talking about im talking about the delay of doors to open and the pick up on items. It's the small things that makes people mad in the lenght. I really hope all this negativity from people will make them realize that they soon will lose the majority of players. But also that should try to listen to the players that actually play the god forsaken game.

2018-03-16,0,0,644,False,Not Recommended,"Bought this sh it like 10 months ago and for now I can easily say that do not buy it.The first point is optimization. It su cks a lot. There is no fuc kin difference between pubg may 2017 and pubg march 2018. Maybe middle fps is around 60 but its still too low for online shooter(especially for the first person which I am only playing). Still drops to 40 in big cities sometimes in open space sorry Bluehole that I dont have PC with 2x 1080ti. And for sure crashes even with SSD good enough.The second point is cheaters. Every fuc kin update saying that ""we are improving our anticheat system"".Okay for sure some of cheaters are really got banned but what percent of them? Why the fu ck am I seeing cheaters in every 2 3 games?Is this your improve?The third point is gameplay. What tickrate does this idiotta game have? I think the number is near 0. Occasionally you can't kill a man with no vest in 3 4 bullets with m4/scar/ak. You can't kill the guy with 2 armor in 6 bullets but he does it in 3 bullets to your 2 armor. Really? About sniper rifles is separate history I would better keep silent. So maybe ballistics is good? No it's more terrible than situation with tickrate. What are you trying to do Bluehole? Make ballistics like in Arma 3? So I have got some sad news for you. I see the guy in 100 metres in front of me so why the fu ck I need to shoot ahead of his running trajectory like 1 2 centimeters from the screen of my monitor? Do you think that m4 bullet has 1 meter per hour speed? In last season my k/d was like 6 8 but anyway I can't get used to that bullsh it tickrate and shooting. If you can't make ballistics like in Arma 3 so return old pubg ballistics it was much better and nicer. First person viewmodel is so stupid it feels like my height is 120 cm.The fourth point is PLEASE PROTECT EUROPEAN SERVERS FROM FUC KIN CHINESE PEOPLE. They are lagging as fu ck if there is a chinese guy for sure you are exactly dead cuz they got some teleport skills . Or is that secret chinese season pass for pubg which giving them teleport ultimate?The fifth point is loot. I won't tell a lot just pay attention for one thing. You can easilly loot 2 3 big houses and you will find a lot clothes with pistol.So much problems and what is developer doing? Yeah let's add emotions it's so fuc kin important isn't it?And pubg is cybesport game really? This game alive only beacause of cases.

Having said that this game tops all of them. Immediately. Even in EA with a few bugs (disconnects few FPS drops here and there some laggy controls when opening doors and picking things up and some lag when shooting) it is still thebest battle royal game out there. The graphics are very similar to Arma/DayZ but with unreal 4 engine they look great. Distance viewing is a little blurred and undetailed but still looks pretty good. Sound in this game is amazing. The guns sound good. The directional sound is spectacular (knowing where shots are coming from hearing where footsteps are etc). Controls are little clunky at times but pretty good compared to some others (I'm looking at you Arma...). Once the updates start rolling in and new vehicles and guns come out it will get even better. 9/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-27,0,0,244,False,Not Recommended,"As a ""fully released game"" this is an absolute joke. The months and months so many PUBG players waited through during early access for it only to be squandered on pushing the console titles totally wasted. The rubber banding the network lag (mind I'm on the fastest Fibre connection possible in Australia) the incredibly poor optimisation. I quote an incredibly relevant review (sorry I don't have a source) PUBG is an example of the right game being made by the wrong company. Such an incredibly fun concept so fun that hundreds of thousands to millions are willing to put up with the terrible aspects (of which there are many) of the game sadly Bluehole can't get it together and optimize debug and just generally fine tune the game.I'm saddened to write this review as I stuck through early access to hopefully get a game that would run consistently however upon full release I see that the delevopers care more about sticking to a timeline rather than release a full game. I don't have the beefiest gaming rig but it certainly ""should"" be capable of running this game besides that I wouldn't have written this review if not for the fact that all of my friends suffer through the same issues in the hope of this game running well for one match out of ten. I am uninstalling and requesting a refund (however unlikely it may be that I actually get one) and I advise any one considering getting this game to back away wait until a better battle royale game is released play something else you like or shoot yourself.

2017-12-27,0,0,320,False,Not Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS was in early access almost a year. In early access bugs like flying with motorbike or random falls from meter which was sometimes more deadlier than weapons could kill you easily. There was also big problem with rendering textures and game was for people with mediocre spec computers practicly first minute after landing not playable.But there is a change! Game is out of early access and now... the game is more broken...Developers obviously are not able to invest into more servers and something like lags are here for the most crucial part of the game and that is LANDING. After you land you are not able to loot or kill someone because you are just unable because of extreme lagging... Textures are now loaded correctly but obviously lag could be a bigger problem...There is also many more bugs that are still happening. Riding motorbike and flipping it on straight road vaulting and climbing not working time to time and many more. Plus let's not speak about lauch of the game... They kind of delayed lauch for next 30 hours and forget to mention it until they updated steam...Another problem is server are just too BUSY! There are just moments you can't even log in.

I played forntite and i did have fun but since playing Pubg have not logged back into fortnite.

I like this game it still has quite a few bugs or just major server issues but I find it unique and a very fun game to play with friends once you know what you are doing. Don't buy if you want a bug free or server lag free esport quality game it just isn't that quite yet but I think it is pretty close. Other wise I would reccomend it to you if you think it would be fun and you don't care about the problems I and others have listed. I personally haven't found really anyone that I could say was actually cheating yet but it is hard to tell due to the somewhat random lag. Oh also I will say that it may be a good idea to wait for a sale in it's current state as it may not yet be worth a full 30$.I found my first cheater so yeah there must be no anti cheat in yet or at least no way to report it and obvious ways to cheat.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2018-03-30,0,0,1500,False,Not Recommended,For nearly 1 200 hours The best part is that when you first come into contact with this game it's fun to look around for weapons and equipment.Since the rise of some exiles Players are more likely to cheat to win the game.And it's growing.Compared to competitive games like lol The growth and continuity of the game is not guaranteed.And the authorities are not sincere about it.Some game anchors use software that identifies cheating players. But the authorities are just trying to add new tricks to their lives.So it's not a technology that hasn't responded. It has to be thought of as some sort of benefit to cheater software companies and authorities.Of course it's just personal speculation.In my mind In less than a year PUBG has begun to decline.But lol has been playing for eight years.Not that it's good or bad of course but it's a good way to get a better sense of what's going on as a video game player.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This is my honest review of this game.Lets start with the postives Heres a small list of my positives will explain more after list... Great gun play Great experiences with friends and randoms The immersion when you are in a gun fightNow let me explain I love how this game plays out in gun fights you feel like you have to be dug down and really figure a good way to outplay your enemies. This provides great experience that you like to talk about with your friends .Now lets get into the negitives Heres a small list of them... Loading times if you are not on a SSD Way to many bugs that effect gameplay Communication ProblemsNow let me explain these. When it comes to the loading times on without a ssd without one it would just sit at the black loading screen and you would hear the lobby audio then you enter the plane and you would have to close the game and reopen it and by that time you were either dead or so far away from the circle you leave. Switching to a SSD fixed it for me. With the bugs I have experienced are glitching through walls not being able to pick things up. Falling through the map. When they update this game it always feels like they take one step forward to only then take to steps back. With communication problems when you solo que in duos or squads you can end up with a person who just doesnt want to work as a team or someone who doesnt speak your language.

2018-04-09,0,0,355,False,Recommended,I have really enjoyed this game. It's a great way to relax or to play competitively. This is a game for people that want to play more competitivly and more seriously rather than what fortnite has made with its community and fan base. I see PUBG as a game to be taken a lot more seriously.It's fun with friends and also on solo as long as you make it fun. I myself have spent many hours playing with my friends and messing around. Not only that but I have spent a few hours playing with ex pro ChosenZygote (Calvin) and a few others.I've heard people say it's boring however I have to disagree it's only boring if you make it boring. Drop in a big area and try kill as many as possible make it fun. This game can become hugely more entertaining if taken seriously.With fornite recently growing massively and becoming such a popular game it's hard for PUBG to compete. My best advice to the developers is to make it free to play or at least half the price however though it really is hard for them to make these kind of changes because the community would not take it lightly with so many people paying full price for it recently. I know there are many hardcore fans out there I know some personally and know there are many more out there that should be supporting this game in its rough spot.Summary of this mess of a review is that it's a pretty good game and doesn't deserve the hate it has been getting. Good luck dev team!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-26,0,0,362,False,Not Recommended,"Really tried to like this game since it offers many great squad gameplay moments. Aside the battle royale core it also absorbs some of the elements of survival games like DayZ which went down the sh*tter so it's nice to have a substitute. Looting choosing and sharing equipment adapting to the situation hunting the most precious virtual prey Humans.After over 130 hours playtime I can't find anything to learn anymore and the design and technical shortcomings of the game become obvious. My skill mastering the clunky gunplay stagnates and the constant death to bad RNG and the technical issues of the game made me quit. It's was still a good value for the money though and therefore I recommend the game if you get it cheap. Just don't listen to all the fanboy fcks out there hyping it as the holy grail. It's a stagnating early access battle royale shooter which did enough good to become streamers favourite. Short version c 3The game is not as perfect as all the hyped fanboys and streamers make it seem to be. Design problems many not unknown to developers and shooter players especially if used to play other third person shooters and battle royale games. Bad technical optimisation and many basic technical issues not fixed yet.Gameplaywise easier to handle than DayZ or Arma when it comes to the inventory system and gunplay but still very clunky for a shooter. The loot system and very punishing zone system mix in a high amount of RNG which often kills the fun especially in the endgame.Looking at the development status it currently looks to become another abandoned early access game which did not change much since it's ""Alpha"" release. Prepare to get milked by microtransactions. Long version c 3Good + Nice inventory system. Clear layout and smooth to use while moving over lootpiles or fallen players.+ The equipment choice seems well thought out with its 3 Tier armor system and many weapon types.+ Weapons are sharing few types of ammo and many attachments so adapting to new guns works smoothly and does not require too much inventory time.+ Many attachments can be ommited. Many ""raw"" weapons are in the right hands fine as they come.+ Attachments increase usefullness of a weapon over the course of a match especially scopes which enable spotting and long range engagements.+ Gunplay is overall challenging and has some elements you don't expect from a casual game e.g. bullet drop (significant) recoil no markers on enemies.Technical bullsh*tt Cheaters. Some quite obvious (headshotting everybody over half the map). The main menu is not updating anything correctly to show the actual status of stuff (buttons friendlist etc.) with the sad manual (!) refresh buttons everywhere telling us that the devs are very much aware of it since release. Being tabbed out the game while starting a match? Nope does bug out. Random memory exceptions when closing or starting the game. Broken explosion sounds (Red Zone artillery and grenades) Smoke grenades can drop fps massively. Slow and primitive loading/unloading of objects and their detail levels. Can even lead to death when landing near enemies (e.g. by getting stuck for a short time after landing on a rooftop the game has yet to render as more than 5 polygons). Horrible optimisation. Mediocre graphics but still unplayable on my middle to high end system on release barely staying above 50 fps in it's current state (hardware unchanged). Unreasonable hardware demand considering the amount of players effects props etc. (Maximum of 100 players visible at the same time on screen as seen on the starting island. Barely more than 4 squads à 4 people in a typical firefight). &gt I know there are people it runs perfectly for but thats neither the majority nor the factor you measure good optimisation on. It runs on a proofen engine and does not look demanding so it should not massively drop fps for reasonable composed systems. Derpy hit recognition. Sometimes you can repeatly hit people in the head and they don't give a damn neither loosing HP nor their armor. The blood splatter effect (practically a hitmarker) is rendered locally without any confirmation by the server as it seems giving the impression of hits while there actually are none. Unclear states of models rubberbanding etc. ... you never know if the guy staring at the wall doing nothing did not already turn and started shooting at you. Especially CQC feels clunky and off (people warping into your room with few animation steps seemingly oneshotting you). Many typical hits behind cover sometimes hilariously late (e.g. already in cover starting bandaging when the hit registers).The gameplay side has some problems too Loot crates for vanity items. Cheap system preparing players for microtransactions but also directly influencing gameplay by camouflaging the player. So far many vanity items are more anti camouflage (yellow tracksuit red t shirts etc.) but it's a potential source of pay to win issues once more content is released (imagine camouflage pattern clothes). Ironsight aim is in toggle mode and can only be changed to hold mode by manually editing a config file. Third person has the typical camping around corners issue. It gets especially stupid when extrem short time to kill (shotguns uzi M416 etc.) meet easy pre aim and pre fire positions like flat rooftops doors housecorners trees etc. which the game is full of. Gameplay benefits force to play on very low graphic settings (shorter drawing distance for grass so far players can't hide players easier to spot infront of muddy textures etc.). Typical shooter problems known to mankind for ages especially in third person games. Just take a look at Arma and DayZ for gods sake and set the damn ground foliage to a usefull fixed minimum so everybody sees the same! Inbalanced weapons. Some are justified by being more rare or only avaliable in air drops (M14 M24 AWP Groza) but some are straight overpowered and readily avaliable (Mini 14 Shotguns in early game M416 vs other ARs). Weird balance of the (common) loot player hp and the armor dmg absorption Sometimes players find a shotgun in the beginning and can practically onehit everybody with it while pistols and smgs do puny dmg and practically none to high tier armor and only start working with many attachments (shifting their usefullness to mid/endgame). The only guns fun and useable throughout the course of a match are sniper and assault rifles. Fun killing blue zone circle in the endgame While causing reasonable damage in the first iterations and giving much time for players to loot and move the last stages seem rushed in a manner which puts RNG over skill. It's more about having the luck to find medical equipment and armor as well as high dps weapons than about tactical movement. Using the blue zone to trade taking damage for repositioning or getting the jump on other players moving in? Good luck when it's ticking your hp down in seconds. Healing after a nice firefight before moving to the next zone? You die because you dared fighting people for longer than 30 seconds. The smaller circles drop on your enemies position multiple times? Just run over open field and attack their turtled position... what should possibly go wrong? If you can't win the short peek a boom fights from cover to cover because of a lack of armor high alpha scoped weapons or unlucky circle positioning you're basically relying on pure RNG.!!! EDIT 27/12/2017 Version 1.0 !!!They managed to some stuff up even more (laggy as never before unprepared for obvious serverload) while improving the game very little (overall +10 15 fps for me... barely usefull when the lagg kicks in close to other players).

2017-03-27,0,0,1435,True,Recommended,I honestly can't say enough good things about this game. For early access I haven't basically any bugs or issues. It runs well and is stable and looks decent. The great thing is the community is pretty nice and a lot of people use mics and actually want to cooperate and work together if you're playing duo or squad. Finding full matches and starting right away is never an issue at any time in the day. With a little more optimization to keep frame rate dips it would be perfect IMO. Other games in the genre usually only get some of the pieces right but this game has the best combat system if you ask me. The second you drop it is an intense race to loot up and that feeling never dies. It is hard for me to actually get hooked on games these days and its rare for me to sit in front of a game for 5+ hours straight and this game made it easy. Easily the best 30 bucks I've spent on a game in a while!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-03-27,0,0,459,True,Recommended,Playerunknown's Battlegrounds for an early access game at this point in development of about rougly 9 months it is phenomenal! Besides the obvious bugs and required optimization tweeking this game cannot get any better. It gives you a fantastic feeling of intensity and maturity which other gives fail to give you The developer himself as stated in the game's title is great as I've had experience with both the Arma 2 and Arma 3 Battle royale mods in the past. So if you enjoy games similar to this such as H1Z1 or not I would highly recommend this game if you can run it. From what I can tell this game won't be in early access for much longer at most a year and the content seems to be being updated quickly with interaction between the dev's and the community. The game is well balanced with enough weapons to keep up the variety but not enough to be overkill. Killing other players require skill with recoil on guns bullet drop and bullet travel time which makes this a game you must play to understand and to be good at rather than another run and gun Call of Duty type of game. Character customization is also there along with weapon customization giving you the player a more adaptive experience and not a shallow one. Overall it's a fantastic game as long as the development maintains on it's course I would highly recommend you giving this game a go.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The problem is after around 10 mins playing the game it crashes his computers audio and then makes it un usable. So I would just play an hour after you buy it and if the same problem happens to you get a refund and go get H1Z1. Other then that issue this game is a 10/10!!!

2018-02-23,0,0,199,False,Recommended,"Although many recent reviews have condemned the constant bugs and hackers in the game this issue has ceased for me at least temporarily since I purchased the game. The bug/glitch problem is still a definite issue but usally the result of it is minor such as taking a little bit of damage when you land.I'm unsure if I'm on top of the see saw here but there is not many other negative things I can say. The game creates fantastic scenarios of Player vs Player battles with intense FPS mechanics and strategy involved. It's atleast semi realistic or competent for a battle royale something that was certainly modernized by this game. I have been playing for several months and have sailed to the top 0.5% of solo players. While I wouldn't call myself ""a god"" or anything I have racked up enough experience in Solo Duo and Squad to say that many of the issues reviewed by other players are a result of their own play.

2017-04-10,0,0,142,False,Recommended,"Edit Jan 2018 the game has taken some major steps in the right direction and is worth the asking price now. IMO the early access was pretty rough and hopefully you didnt end up like me having it uninstalled for over 75% of the time. With that said game runs MUCH smoother the new map looks good and the new UI is actually a working UI. Gameplay has its ""WTF"" moments but they are far and few between.Original Review It's worth noting that this game has major potential. Is it worth the asking price right now? Absolutely not. The greed in developers has overcome the passion of making a polished game before releasing it. I realize there are limitations with the engine but there are major issues across the board with this game. Servers are constantly experiencing latency issues water is basically bulletproof and the ""knock down"" system is flat out bad in my opinion. Just have a player either live or die from my shots pretty simple. Fall damage is inconsistent and random (sometimes you jump off a three story building and are fine sometimes you clip a tree while parachuting and take 75% fall damage).

2018-01-12,0,0,542,False,Recommended,I think it is high time when i should write a review about this game after playing almost over 400hrs.This game overall is a very very good game and the everincreasing player base simply signifies the same.This is a game we must never forget which broke steam concurrent player records even in its early access stage.To be very right this is not the very first game which hold the crown of being first of its genre it holds the crown of first Battle royale game that is being liked and accepted everywhere so much.If I am not wrong this game is not completely released as a complete game of its standard is always a work in progress and to be correct this is a game which is out of early access.There were loads of major bugs among which very few you will encounter only if you sit to play the game having a testers mentality.Issues are there true but the developer team is working one them too.The main issue with this game right now is the numbers of hackers you might encounter if you play on AS/SEAS/OC servers.And Then Bluehole inc. and now PUBG Corp. Must understand that the game is still in very good health as players have not yet started stopping playing this game due to cheaters.....but if they dont take any drastic action any soon this game too might end up like what happened to R6 siege at some point when players stopped playing not just because the game had lots of bugs but also it had lots of cheaters/hackers.This is a very common issue nowadays hacks become available before the game itself is available to people so which clearly indicates that there are some people who are working from inside but again finding then out is also a nasty kind of job when you have got enthusiastic game developers at your disposal.Again Region lock on some country is never a solution as it will be injustice towards the non cheaters even though the numbers are very less.But there are brutal measures which can be taken against these kind of noobs(I would call them) like in other major titles like overwatch league of legends and others which ban the cheaters by their hwid i.e. Hardware Id.If the cheaters problem is properly taken care of this game will surely succeed maintaining its playerbase.Gameplawise tweaks are required and its improving so growth wont be hampered.Graphical glitches are there but hopefully will be fixed as the dev team are working on them everyday.My rating to this game is 9.1/10 as per its current state considering this as a multiplayer(which it is) game.And this is a definite buy for everyone who likes to play copetitive games.......GG everyone......This truly is Battle Royale,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-12,0,0,79,False,Not Recommended,Pros Had the potential to be a great game Fun to play with friends Plenty of money to be made from lootboxesConsWhere to I begin... Developers don't seem to listen to customers. Simple Collision systems and physics systems can send you soaring through the air to your death. Playing on minimar is pretty much a running simulator. Hackers in 50% of games NO REGION LOCK! Massive issue. Can be pretty repetitive. No map choice feels like they force feed you a map they know we all hate. 3 hour downtime for updates every weeek (Always during primetime US) In my opinion its an unfinished game pushed into full production by greedy game developers who wanted profits from the console market.But the thing that will tip most players over the edge is the latest update.Not listening to the consumer increasing the zone speed early game turns this game into a sprinting simulator now. If you are unfortunate enough to not get a circle spawn you are more likely to be killed by the zone than other players. This takes the entire competitve side away from players early game. It could have been a great game but it has been wasted by very bad development choices.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The game is not perfect by any means and has a lot of room for improvement but with that being said it has a charm to it that makes me come back to play it each time. I have to agree with other people when they say that the game should be region locked not because I don't like players from other parts of the world but because It's more enjoyable when you can communicate with your squad in the same language. the game plays well altough the FPS could be better and the servers tend to crash every once in a while. other than that the game is fun and I'm looking forward to see how the game improves.

Even PUBG Mobile has more content at this point theres a really ranking system in that game also a training area to practice aim. Why is this not in the PC version when you PAY FOR THE GAME THE MOBILE VERSION IS FREE!!! This makes me want Bluehole just to give 10 cent the game so they can finish it.

The only reason I have rated this game 8/10 however is due to the lack of english mates that i will encounter during playing squads looking for a team. It really concerns me but at the same time it pushes us players to interact with another ways such as discord to counter this issue. Overall this game is great especially after the recent updates (Higher fps for all of us!).Conclusion Overall this game is brilliant and always has this refreshing feeling every game.

2018-01-12,0,0,779,False,Recommended,From a gameplay and spectator perspective PUBG generally shines. Due to the randomization in every game from the plane paths and loot distribution combined with the freedom given to players to play how they want PUBG can offer a unique experience every time allowing the player to tell their own story. Most matches payout similar to a horror movie story arch. You always get a taste of the danger in the beginning either just by seeing the other players dropping onto the map or getting in some early game gun fights. Then you get the mid game where you loot up generally with little interaction with other players but the suspense builds as the player gets more invested into the match as they loot house to house with the possibility of an enemy player around every corner ready to fight. Then comes the late game where the stakes are high as the players generally invested a lot of time into the match gathered a bunch of loot and won a few gun fights already. In late game its down to the best players in the entire 100 person lobby and is the climax of the match story arch resulting in a win for only 1 person or team. PUBG is also great as a spectator game due to the reasons as well. It is generally easy for an outsider to understand how well the player is doing in any given match thanks to the visual queues of the loot and the player counter ever ticking down. The lull in action in the middle also gives streamers a chance to interact with their audience while still playing the game. One major issue with the gameplay that has been highlighted with the release of the new larger map is that due to the borders of the game always shrinking and sometimes very quickly vehicles can be essential however the vehicle spawns are not spread out well and in general are just not frequent enough often leading to the gameplay experience for a portion of the players in any given match consisting of running from the circle cutting out most of the suspense build for those players as they can t loot or explore very much or risk succumbing to the encroaching wall which means they won t get very invested in the match. From a technical perspective the PUBG has suffered for most of its existence with terrible FPS and server reliability however these issues have been greatly improved in recent updates. The main technical issues that still exist are cheaters inaccurate death cams and poor net code. Since users can select which server they want to play on this allows a huge amount of cheaters from china to play on all servers which ruins the experience for others. The problem of cheating is also more noticeable in PUBG compared to other games thanks to the huge lobby size of 100players so only one of those 100 players needs to be a cheater in order to ruin the match as supposed to a much smaller lobby of 1 in 5 or 10 like in most other games. Most of the cheating could be mitigated if china or all countries were region locked so you could only play in your region. Region locking the game would also improve the poor net code situation as it wouldn t have to deal with such extreme ping. Currently the games net code is terrible and ranks at the bottom of the pack for similar games. PUBG s net code fluctuates between 32 updates per second all the way down to two updates per second which is not ideal for a competitive shooter. This poor net code results in items not being picked up shots not registering and also affects the death cams. Due to the games net code being so terrible the recorded death cams can appear as though the enemy is aiming nowhere near where they actually were this leads to huge amounts of false cheat reports which makes it harder for the game studio to find and remove real cheaters.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It is a good time with friends occasionally but I would not recommend this game for someone looking for a solo experience. I have 40+ hours into the game which is a fanstic return on my investment but not all 40 hours were amazing or entertaining the majority of it was frustrating with a few occassional wins mixed in there.Solo players It is not uncommon for you to spend 20 minutes in a match gathering loot and supplies just to die to the first person you run into or die to people you never even saw and will never see shot from a direction you probably did check already. Having this happen a few times doesn't sound that bad but it can happen fairly often when you're just starting out.The shooting portion of this game are not what you would expect. It is a pretty complex and interesting system you inevitably have to learn bullet drop and leading shots things along those lines which is great but somewhat clunky right now in early access. I've had to execute teammates who DC'd (you can't reconnect to games right now) and I will aim directly at their head while standing still and it will say I did not hit them. All early access bugs I assume.The dev team is engaging and seem great so I think this game will be successful and very enjoyable down the line. It simply was not an enjoyable experence for me yet. While twitch is an amazing platform to watch and enjoy games do not think you can get this game and have the same success as the great streamers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-30,0,0,801,False,Recommended,This game might be glitchy but the glitches are what make it funny. PUBG was hacker paradise but more hack makers have been brought to justice in PUBG than any other game because of the devs of PUBG helped the Police to aprehend them and now this game is almost hacker free. The performance isnt the best but not even Valve could do better with CS GO even though Valve have made more than 3 Counter Strikes so why do people dislike that PUBG doesnt run well its this companies first massive game. The servers are full all the time is something i heard alot well yes they are full cause everyone enjoys playing PUBG they have a safe capacity of 1 Million players and yet can have 3 Million concurrent players as their record!!!So what do I think well this game could have been made better sure but no other game devs have been able to have the same graphics and performance without increasing ping. Plus just for a second consider how big the maps are in PUBG so sure game devs have worked around this problem but the problem with the way they did is that it made that you couldnt see someone in a building from far cause they only load in when you get close enough it upps performance but lowers graphics plus makes camping in a building so much more op.Thx for reading hope you enjoy your decision I know I do,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The cheating is obvious why not pay money and use a better anti cheating system I rarely see cheaters in BFBC2 and I played that for a while but we had to use Punk Buster. I understand that Chinese players are what gives you numbers but you aren't going to increase numbers this way you have already saturdated the Chinese market and other markets aren't going to jump onboard if all they hear is yelling followed by being shot in the head from the other side of the map in 2/3 games. I have had good games with some Chinese guys and I don't mind the loud obnoxious open voice thing but i can't stand the cheating.

It has an addictive playstyle that keeps you coming back. That being said it's plagued with hackers that use scripts aimbot wallhacks snaptargeting etc. I'm no where near a pro at this game but if you watch the match replay (not the deathcam the actual match replay) you can see these hackers not even aim or simply ""seeing"" targets that are impossible and land headshots with weapons that are not able to do so. A Prime example is when my friend and I both got headshot by a sawed off shotgun from this guy that was in the middle of an open desert while we were both inside 2 different houses with no line of sight. (300+ metres away and no line of sight)The gameplay is however fun and when you do get a match where it's hacker free it is a breath of fresh air. I feel like the price should be $19.99 as it isn't as polished as it should be and still has a large amount of flaws and issues. In it's current state with all these issues I cannot recommend this game to others due to the price glitches hackers etc.If the above issues are resolved (doubtlful) I may change this review but otherwise save your money for another game and avoid this one as it'll cause more frustration than enjoyment",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To much not fixed and new added bugs ( like pixilated Sights or Mouse Malfunctions just in PUBG) and to many Cheaters. I would love to can say to new Players Come. we play PUBG but the Game has transform from a not ready but playable game to a Bug and Cheater Festival. Its a shame because I like PUBG very much and I hope that PUBG Corp. fix the Bugs soon( Or just try to make the Game playable) I give this Game a rating of 4/10 for a good Idea. a good Style but a bad Game Experience right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-20,0,0,163,False,Not Recommended,"This was a great concept when it was made as a mod for Arma series. Now when it's a standalone game looks much more better then it was back then with few bugs encountered by me and those I encoutered aren't bigger deal and I didn't found those bad ones yet when you fly away with a car or any of the sorts. In short it's an really great game pretty well made weapons and gun battles and awesome concept that have been brought into an standalone version and can really get addictive and under the skin of many gamers with lots of hour pass and can't really tell when you try to be number 1 from 100 players with great gun battles for a building with maybe some loot in it the intense battle when there are just 5 players left and many other nice things that happens. But......and this is a big BUT.... But all comes after some time with an reality check when you will find lots of cheaters everywhere. I thought at first some of the cheaters dont actually cheat and players are that good....but NO. This game is really full of cheaters with autoaim speed or no recoil and after some time you will really loose interest and build frustration up. I thought maybe if I play in FPP (first person perspective) as others recommend I will not find so many of those said cheaters and I couldn't be more wrong full of them on that mode also so even if you play FPP or TPP (third person perspective) at this point it's the same thing and same amount of cheaters. I know I played just 100 hours but in that time I had so many matches with cheaters around the game so is hardly an joy for me and as I can see for many others too. If cheaters wont kill you the ones that have lag and low ping will as you try to shoot them over and over and your hits will not register but they will kill you pretty fast. So no fun with them also. The devs promised they will lock China never happened. They promised some sort of anti cheat solution but they messed that up and they removed (I actually didn't had any problems with it). They promised lots of other things and quess what?? Never happened tho they got us a nice patch some days ago but it was forgoten fast because of who? You guess it cheaters!!! Should you spend money on this game? Hell no buy something nice to your girlfriend buy some nice addon for another game from your game list buy another game but just don't buy this one until they fix the game and they get rid of all this cheaters and lag problems. If you do and start playing this one you will get frustrated as you will like it and you will play more and more and more but you will only find cheaters all around and you will hardly win a dinner. A big thumb down from me for this popular game as I've seen lots of games on a downslide and this is clearly one of them developers knows pretty well the problem and they didn't fixed it after sooooo much time and this is just a clear sign of ""We got our money so bye bye"" We have all seen this in the past in other games and now it's like a clear pattern and this one follows exactly",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A lot of my friends started getting it but as someone on a budget I do like to do my research on a game before I buy it. Of course after looking at reviews I came to the conclussion that maybe this game wasnt right for me. ""Hacking server issues lack of region lock"" and the list goes on from user reviews. I ended up receiving the game as a gift and of course I was excited to get into this hyped game. Ill tell you after playing for the past couple weeks I really havent run into these issues that people have negatively reported. I will point out that the game is poorly optimized. I have to run all seetings on very low and still pull only 20 25fps. I still have hope that it will get fixed by the time its a full release. Would overall recommend Pubg though.

Yeah I love this game and I love to continue play it but I think that it doesn't deserve his fame. WHY SHOULD I BUY IT?I think it's one of the greatest PVP game in the last years. I love looting in Dayz. So looting in this game it's like dayz. Constant go to places to loot. If you hate this don't buy it. Probably it's not the most realistic FPS you can find but it's satisfying to shoot in this game. Every single weapon has different handling and you must try long before you became good. CHEATERS CHEATERS EVERYWHEREYes cheaters are a big problem. Death cam and replays are useful to report them but they can ruin your match if you find them.Personally I advise this game.

2017-11-24,0,0,190,True,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an interesting game. It perfectly represents the Battle Royale concept and it never falls short. The game has minor bugs but nothing game changing. Bluehole is constantly fixing updating and giving the players what they would like to see in the game. The loot consistancy is great the hitboxes are more than perfect weapon damage at the moment could use some work but overall the game is pretty good. My opinion on the blue forcefield is that it should last a little longer before pushing people in to the white safe area.Vaulting and this new map coming out will keep us fans of PUBG playing the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

He has a scope I have a red dot sight or iron sights despite looting 10x more than him. At least I managed to find a bunch of blue combat pants and hi top trainers though I guess...My only weapon is still just a double barrel shotgun. The red zone spawned on me so I hid in a building then the red zone spawned on me again immediately after the first one finished in the EXACT SAME SPOT. Oh look the circle moved towards the far opposite side of the map from where I am. Oh look I ran across the map to get to the outskirts of the circle and it moved to the far opposite yet again. And again. Oh look I finally made it to the innermost section of the circle and there's a guy camping the one bush that I happened to not be looking at even though I was trying to observe all of my surroundings. Oh look he had a kar98k and it hit me in the head so despite having a level 2 helmet I instantly died. He had a level 3 helmet.Well I guess I could try again and for this new round I'll try spawning in the military base to reduce the aspect of RNG loot that's so heavily entrenched in the game. Oh what's this? 60 other tilted people decided to spawn here as well? Hope I can pick up a micro uzi before anyone else...Oh this room has a revolver and the guy right next to me got a room with an S12K. Next round here we come.

2018-03-23,0,0,499,False,Recommended,"I bought the game after a few days when it came out and I loved it. Till today I still enjoy it. Good game recommend it better than H1Z1.The game just keep on getting better and better. New map weapons vehicls and now events. There are new bugs after new patchs but hey like this happens in softwares (reminds me of my fukn Java assignment). After a new patch and there is a bug that does influence game play eg in the old UI ""no randos in squads"" tickbox didn't work once and they solved it pretty quick the time where the in game screen is all up they fixed that pretty quick too.The developers actually update stuff unlike h1z1 they once said they fixed the double door problem (just one of the bugs) I decided to give it a go *opens a door at top of a building"" it's a fukn double door. Now H1Z1 is adding new things more constantly this is because back in the day H1Z1 was the only Battle Royale game and the developers dogged us because they were like &amp quot their aint any other BR game so either play me game or off"". Even though they fixed most of the stuff stole some ideas from pubg eg compass adding markers to map etc it still aint getting me back into the game. They didn't listen to the community the guns' recoil makes the cross hair snaps to the left and right instead of going up now they are doing all these updates is because they have competitors now. On the other hand PUBG does listen to the community and makes changes accordingly.For my opinion on hackers yes they do get banned. My own Chinese friends one borrowed his account to his friends and apparently this friend of his uses hacks which got my mate's account banned. RIP. I met this other dude online and a few days later he told me he got bored so he bought a hack and got his account banned. RIP. It's anti cheat system is working. For those who writes in Chinese ""I did nothing and I got banned"" off will ya you don't get banned for doing nothing By the way one of the reasons why they didn't region lock China is because H1Z1 did that and they lost too many players. And besides you do get some Chinese who hacks or team kills but there are still a lot of nice people too.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-23,1,1,204,False,Not Recommended,After putting in +100 hours into this game I wanted to write a review on my experiences thus far. Overall I cannot recommend this game to anyone because the issues outweigh the positives.Pros Fun to play with friends Great opportunity to meet new people if you play Squads or Duos Ranking system gives you pretty neat statistics that give you a decent analysis of your gameplay stats.Cons Cheaters. I don t even have to mention it this game is riddled with cheaters and it just seems that they are continually able to circumvent whatever implementations Blueballs does to try stop them. Servers are busy please reconnect later . I paid you money to be able to play the game and I expect to be able to play it whenever I feel like it excluding your patching times . If you live on PST expect patching periods to conflict with your gaming time because it naturally happens around 7PM till 10PM. They put a new loot crate in the game recently to try to milk their community for more money when there are other more PRESSING MATTERS TO ADDRESS! For the love of God why do you litter the map with useless cosmetic items? I haven t met one squad member or person throughout my entire time playing that has legitimately made an effort to grab any of the attire. They are useless and it effectively messes me up everybody in the end if they accidentally pick it up rather than the gun or ammo that they need to protect themselves! You walk/run like you have cement blocks for feet and the houses sound like they are made out of 1 ply wood. The second you get near someone they will immediately stop moving and just wait to hear you stomp your way into their vicinity so they can end your pathetic life. Have you ever complained about lag before? Do you want to? There s this reoccurring problem on Miramar where you will not have the right amount of squad members in your games. You either begin the game 1 3 people down or you leave lobby and re enter in hopes of a full squad. Glitches falling and dying randomly vehicles flipping into space because of a bump boxes that immediately block your vehicle from moving and the list just goes on and on. Why does the Mobile Version of this game have more features/functionality than the PC version? Are you serious?TL DR? Region Lock China!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-03-07,0,0,203,False,Recommended,"Having played for over 80 hours most of it in early 2018 I reckon this is a pretty decent game. Sure it has its down points but they are heavily outweighed by the ups.DOWN 1) Poorly optimzed to the point that this game has become a 'benchmark' for hardware ""Will X system play PUBG?"" Not a good look. I play with a GTX970 clocked 'n' cooled FX8370 and 16GB of fast dual channel DDR3... and it runs okay. People are getting reasonable results with Ryzen 3's / G4560's and GTX750ti's but I would think that at this stage an SSD or M.2 drive is mandatory to optimise the experience even then most likely limied to 60fps on 'Very Low' settings. 2) Hackers. Yes there are hackers big suprise. I play Oceania (I'm Australian) on first person view and find there aren't a heap but most third person games seem to have one or two hackers or teamers in them. Once I was covering the entry to the second story of a building when I heard a smash and died. Deathcam showed someone spawning into my corpse and no explanation for how I died at all. What the hell??? For the most part I don't have problems but occasionally there are issues with hackers.3) Lootcrates. They are average at best and its a grind if you want to keep getting them. I keep the pay to open crates in my inventory as it seems as soon as you stockpile 3 to 4 of them your liklihood of getting more drops. Get rid of them or open them and you instantly get more. Yay... not. The customisation is moot for the most part as a standard grey shirt and brown pants provides good camo for most areas anyway. Maybe thats just me being spartan... and cheap... but whatever.4) Sound. Overall not terrible but good surround would be nice!So whats about the UPS?1) Hugely diverse open word maps. Sure theres only two (and a third incoming) maps but they are vast and lots of fun to play. With 80 hours on record I'm still familiarising myself with areas of each map to the point that I am still finding little areas (and some larger ones) I havent explored yet. Lot of fun.2) Great looting! Find your weapons come find your weapons get 'em in the dust! Lock and load an assault rifle for you sir? Nicely done. And you ma'am? Oh no bad luck there's only a frypan and a beanie in this hut! Hahaha... classic.3) Intense combat. So a round lasts about 30 minutes until the final few players get ushered into the tiny last areas and kill each other... and imagine being one of them waiting until the next zone shrink so you can rush forward scanning all the terrain popping a player or two in the face as you go watching that ""Player Remaining"" count drop... only to be completely blinsided by the 2nd or 3rd last player in the game! AH! So much suspense intensity and fun.4) Replayability. Doesnt matter whether its the 1st time or the 1000th this is a hella fun game. Every drop is different sometimes some random will yell out ""Hey everyone go some landmark "" and whaddaya know everyone does! Intense fighting followed by anything from a mad rush to the combat zone or intense anticipation as the zone forms on top of you and you have to decide whther to wait it out or risk going to the next house in search of better loot...Overall? A must play and reasonably priced for what it is. Get it just so you know what the hype is about and don't be surprised if you find yourself playing for hours on end match after match chasing that elusive Chicken Dinner!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-10-16,0,0,463,True,Not Recommended,This game is a gamblers paradise. Its gun mechanics are fantastic and the ending is full of tension which is really exhilerating.The loot in this game has terrible RNG. You are likely to go through multiple buildings and not find even a pistol. It can result in uneven disadvantaged fights or looting for too long trying to find a decent weapon and a sight with no car around getting terrible circle RNG and having to run across the entire map for 3/4 of the game. This is very fustrating boring and happens way too often. The blue circle is mechanics are annoying. It isn't a big disdvantage for players until the very last few safe zones come into factor. So players can sit in and move around safely inside the circle for a good chunk of the game. With the size of the map the possibility of no vehicle and the terrible loot RNG you will often be forced to run to the safe zone with terrible weapons few meds and sights.

There has been no visual differences no new guns (There has been new guns but it took 1 year to make like 4 or whatever that are basically copy paste of different weapons ex Aug M4 . SLR SKS . MINI14 M16) This game used to look beautiful in my eyes until they gave ban warning for people using reshade (Visual Game Filter). And comparing Pubg from last year to today. I see no difference in there minds its quanity over quality. There also are still so many bugs that have been complained about since LITERALLY DAY 1. I hope this game dies so Blue Hole/ Pubg Corp can get through their minds that they truely Fycked up.

To be honest I miss PUBG's Early Access... even though it was a mess. The game seemingly was going in the right direction back in the day.

2017-12-11,0,0,545,True,Not Recommended,The plain and simple truth of this game is that it is a legitimately fun experience but is completely ruined by the complete lack of intiative on the part of the developers. Instead of making new maps and new guns they need to get rid of the hacking problems and fix the issues regarding bullets registering on enemy players and vehicles. You could be wearing the highest tier of armor available in the game and a headshot from an enemy player can knock you down. But the minute you try the same thing on an enemy player your bullets don't perform the same as theirs. More than half the time it seems like the tick rate favors enemy players. The bullet damage is grossly inconsistent.I love this game but I cannot bring myself to recommend it to anyone until all of its early access issues are finally fixed. In spite of its popularity this game is plagued by problems that could kill it stone dead within a few months.Region lock the game or something and keep the Chinese players out of the North American servers. It's nothing against a particular region it's just that there are simply millions of hackers coming out of that region of the world. Anyone with a 51 KD ratio or higher is an obvious cheater and shouldn't be allowed to log in and f*** up everyone else's gameplay experience. For the time being maybe a region lock would cut down on the bulls***.And Valve this review targets you too. Your VAC system is complete s*** and hasn't worked since CSGO. What the hell is your deal? Do you guys even care about hackers anymore?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-11,0,0,170,True,Recommended,Superb game that is very relaxing and is compatible with different playstyles. Do you play it safe and stealthy looting from rural villages? Do you compete with more experienced players at military bases for a chance to emerge with the best loot? Do u go to school just to kill as many people as you can before been killed yourself? Do you play on first person only servers? I personally take the safe approach and usually play third person allthough when me and my mates play squad we launch organised offensives onto villages housing other squads. Game looks decent at a mixture of medium to low graphics. It also has more realistic recoil and bullet drop and velocity so you can't just spray at the head at medium to long range.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-07-11,0,0,673,False,Not Recommended,"This game since the begininng had nothing but problems. From d sync to hacking. Bluehole had an opportunity to create a game that stood the test of time. But with the lack of community transparency and the lack of oblivious known issues that needed hotfixes this game went straight into becoming a money grab. Instead of fixing known exploits in their maps they introduce loot crates. Of course you have to pay to open. Instead of doing a normal region lock on the servers that the community begged and pleaded for the creator told its player base that they are racist people for not allowing international IPs to play in domestic servers. Taking weeks almost months for a general hotfix that could have saved it's player base. This game was enjoyable at first. Now it's all about d sync and hacking issues within its servers that Bluehole and PUBG are taking forever to fix. Let's put it this way it took PUBG almost a full year (from beta access) to implement an ""anti cheat system"" and it didn't even work for the first couple of months of implementation. There are a lot of reasons that PUBG's competitor Epic Game's Fortnite is beating them even after completely changing their platform of Fortnite. Some people don't remember Fortnite's original genre. It was a survival horde game with a linear storyline and had a horrendous multiplayer which was the same thing but just playing with friends. They implimented their battle royale multiplayer servers and it was hit. Not only because it was free to play but Epic Games listened to their community and did the hotfixes that needed to be done to help players play the game with ease and comfort without d sync and hacking. Yes there are hackers in Fortnite there are always going to be hackers in multiplayer PC game but you can for damn sure rely on Epic to solve these issues a lot faster and a lot swifter than Bluehole and PUBG could ever do.Would I recommend this game? No. Go play fortnite. It's free. It's practically the same game with a different twist. and it's developer knows a thing or two about keeping it's playerbase happy.This game had so much potential but because of the money hungry company that never listened to it's community and instead implemented cash grabs within its game this game is now trying to catch up in popularity that it once started.Good job PUBG and Bluehole.

2017-11-27,0,0,674,True,Recommended,Firstly TL/DR it s a good game if you are lucky to not be matched into games with hackers or have a few friends to play with. But be prepared for pure rage at points usually for stupidly dumb reasons.Overall 6/10 buy this game when it's on sale if you have friends to play it with or just wait until the problems are solved. Game Breakdown The concept for this game is get 100 people stick em on a plane and send that plane over a deserted island jump out and land where you want to start the game. good concept but when you put it into practice you are basically playing loot simulator 2017. you get all this sweet loot and then die for the stupidest reason that you probably caused and then watch as the person who killed you just loots through your stuff to take your carefully selected loot. but that's the nature of the beast just be aware of that going in.This game is a good game at its core. the game's mechanics and overall gameplay are pretty unique and feels pretty realistic. the fact that the devs have done their research into the weapons into the game and that their names appearance and mechanics are identical to the real thing is pretty good. no call of duty renaming existing weapons or anything (which is just something that is one of my pet peeves pretty stupid i know)solo games are pretty boring in my opinion they are either easy to win or you die to someone hacking or for equally stupid reasons (again usually your own fault playing recklessly or not paying attention) duo's are probably the best gametype in my opinion it's not overwhelming when it comes to coordinating your group or making sure everyone lands in the right place. and of course tying into that you have full 3 4 man groups which can either be great or can be horrible. it's usually pretty bad if you are the only one to die right at the start and you have to watch your squad win while basically looking at memes for the 20min that it takes em to either all die or win the match. How i want the devs to improve this game Outside of repetitive game feel as there is only one map at the moment and the HUGE PROBLEM WITH HACKERS (see below) The biggest problem i have with this game s mechanics is that you are able to kill downed players granted downed players aren't always killed by the enemy but it's pretty common to be killed. The devs should really consider removing the downed players ability to move and make it so they can't die to bullets this increases the chance that you and your friend don't need to now worry about the other players gunning your friend and ruining your game just out of spite or whatever reason. Granted this stance of the problem is pretty polarizing and i'm sure A LOT of people will hate that idea but it's just what i think this game needs to improve gameplay for full squads or duo s this games 2 giant problems Firstly Hackers just . Hackers everywhere. Speed hackers people who are running 10 times faster than some cars move. Aimbots people who seem to land every single shot with a pistol from halfway across the map. Arm stretching this hack lets hackers raise their aim down sights up into the air its pretty hard to explain but think of it as making their gun float in the air while their body is still safe inside the building below the gun. The devs are banning people left and right but this game has no sort of kill cam so we don't really know if we were killed by a hacker or if it was just skill or luck on the other player's account. Frankly the devs need to add this in fortnight battle royal has this feature if i remember right so it is possible for them to add some sort of 10 second capture before your death from the other players perspective.Secondly there is no ping cap these servers are open to everyone and i'm sorry if this is insensitive foreign players go play on your own servers the asia european atlantic and many other servers are there for a reason. This game's second huge problem is players with ping ranging from 400 2000 joining a game and this game being client side hitboxes meaning if my ping takes 2000 ms to ping the server and return the info to me on my screen your player will still be running in the field for me but on your end you will be safely behind a tree when i shoot you in the face and you are dead on the floor this is the most enraging thing and the devs have done nothing to stop this. It's a stupidly simple fix they could impose a simple ping check at the beginning of a match is your ping above 300ms? If yes then you are not able to join this game it's a soft fix to the game's biggest problem it doesn't have to be a ping check during the entire game just at entry to the servers that way if you have a ping spike in the game you won't be auto kicked out and this way it keeps the unwanted players out of our server with their client clearly gaining preference for their ping values. Final Thoughts All in all this game is faaaar from perfect but it's still actually pretty fun the devs are working on most of the problems they have new game mechanics being introduced soon and a new map that they have been teasing for like 6 months now. The game is definitely a game to play with some friends but i feel you won't get the full experience just playing it solo. At least one of the problems are being fixed or being addressed at the very least and the other problem will be fixed eventually if people keep bringing that problem to the developers attention.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-06-12,0,0,317,True,Recommended,I was wary of buying this game at first because of the fact that it was early release.

I am incredibly excited to see how the finished product looks as I have already fallen in love with it. I have managed to convince a few of my other friends to get it and we have been playing every day since then. The only downsides that I can see so far in this game is that there are some issues with connecting to friends at times through the lobby where it would say they are offline and there is some issues at times with trying to aim through windows or over barricades where sometimes you would hit the edge of the cover instead of the enemy though this is hardly an issue most times (just would be nice if they tweaked it).

Overall this game has a ton of awesome potential but it is in alpha so it's laggy and a little bit buggy but this is one of the best developed alphas ive ever played and well worth the money because I feel like even though the devs are a small team they're going to try and develop this game as best they can.

2017-07-10,0,0,76,False,Recommended,CURRENT REVIEW NON EARLY ACESS I still absolutley love this game but it had some problems here is what PUBG Corp fixed and did not fix.PUBG's preformance has gotten much better.Their map making skills have gotten much better Miramar looks really nice and very lived in.The sound design and UI are great but this leads me into my only gripes The map looks really grey and I think it is a step down from the previous early acess version.There are still hackers and other nasty cheaters but PUBGCorp has gotten better at dealing with it.Something that is not a gripe but more of a question is will old PUBG menu music return. I actaully kinda liked it...Overall the quality has increased and is worth your 30 dollars.At this point I give it a 9.5/10 expect sweaty palms.THE ENTIRITY OF MY EARLY ACESS REVIEW OK There are some good things and bad things about this game. THE GOOD PUBG is a fun action packed game that requires high skill quick thinking good long term thinking deep knowledge of the game and how it works. It's loot and scoot gameplay has tons of fun. You can play with different preferences different stratagys.PUBG has large open maps with lots of destinations and with enough unique buildings to make the map feel very believable though there are a lot of re used assets it's ok for the most part it doesn't detract from gameplay and the map is still pretty interesting. The way loot is distibuted onto these maps is very good.The gameplay is camping running looting and fighting the camping is tense but boring at times (which further adds to the dread) running is tense looting is tense and rewarding fighting is tense and action packed. It's an exciting game.The game is really fun to watch. It's one of the best games to play with friends while it is also lots of fun to play solo. I highly reccomend you play for these reasons. HOWEVER THE BAD PUBG naturally has lots of streamers and as you can probably see from the other reviews stream sniping is the problem PUBG corp has to get it together the streamers are getting themselves into that situation. I understand it promotes this game but seriously the game has sold 10 000 000 copies do you really think people don't know about it by now. It's silly people are being banned.Preformance is very poor I have a GTX 1070 and it still runs very poorly the game is still in early acess though and I have seen the game improve on preformance greatly from when I first purchased PUBG. For some reason PUBG corp doesn't beef up its servers despite have bucketloads of cash.The bugs are rampant though there are increasingly fewer as time goes on I doubt this will be a huge problem in the future just a heads up.There are microtransactions this THIS made me so angry this is unacceptable. they've made at least 60 000 000 dollars. Don't get any crates it's not worth it it just isn't. It literally makes no sense I won't rant about it much longer but it makes me ANGERY.There are also a lot of hackers in PUBG which occur on a 40% basis they're annoying and no fun to play against and they're not getting banned... SO IS IT ANY GOOD? yeah it has some problems but it's really fun too,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-07-10,0,0,134,True,Recommended,OK so this is the best battlegrounds based game out there by far. Good solid controls. It does have some minor issues that can be frustrating but it is in Early Access. Overall I recommend the game if you like games such as H1Z1 King of the Kill. This is a must have game for all competitive players out there. No game breaking glitches or bugs to worry about. Just beware of not flying with the vehicles since they are alittle wonky at times and can go flying into space if you hit someone while landing from a flying position. Or just try to ram another car.

2018-04-17,0,0,744,False,Recommended,"Before you read the rest of the review check if these things apply to you. You have a powerful rig that can handle the latest gen games at a stable frame rate. You do not consider yourself a casual FPS player You like tactical shooters(not run and gun) You do not mind the potential downtime you will have during a battle royale game(looting running etc)PUBG was the first big hit for this genre and it is still played a lot today. I know H1Z1 KotK happened but PUBG was much more popular during its peak time. I have been with this game since nearly the beginning when I had a ""dollar store"" PC and now I have a powerful gaming PC that can handle this games lack of optimization. Back in the beta the game was new the battle royale genre was booming and I had plenty of friends to play with who all genuinely enjoyed the game. The voice chat was cancerous in a way we all knew and loved. The game was buggy but we all expected that for an EA game. Now it has been released for almost 7 months and a lot of things that should have been fixed haven't. Sound is still subpar compared to other tactical shooters like Rainbow 6 Siege the servers have always had issues with too many players and entities in the same space and the way parachuting works is constantly changing so only the players that keep up with the meta know how to land multiple seconds before others giving them a significant advantage. I put up with the bugs and server issues because I can honestly say I have never played a better battle royale. Fortnite didn't do it for me and Realm Royale is closer but wasn't my cup of tea because I prefer military shooters not fantasy. I have made friends through this game that I won't ever forget and I have some great memories with those friends.I wish I could recommend this game to everyone but I can't. If you have a bad PC don't buy this game. If you don't want to pay attention to the patch notes and meta don't buy this game. If don't want to think about positioning and listening for other players don't buy this game.But if you do want a tactical military battle royale shooter then PUBG is definitely the game for you.also the game is still only $30 which I appreciate.

The gameplay is solid* the shooting feels good* and the RNG loot system* works really well. Maps are well designed for the most part and the game is getting new additions constantly*. I put the asterisks because 4 problems hinder this product The game has a lanudry list of netcode problems it's at 18hz when it really should be 30 minimumThe game has performance issues for some systems it runs 60fps above on my rig but it might be diffirent to youThe game really needs a region lock lots of players taking advantage of the poor netcode The game has an anti cheat system that's stopping hackers but not fast enoughI still enjoy the game there is nothing like it.4/5,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That's not acceptable coming from BlueBalls Entertainment . Fix your game! This game is terrible at close range engagements and I feel that if minecraft were an fps it would be FAR better than PUBG.Not to mention all the blonde haired chubby cheeked punk kids who are constantly screaming in the lobby.

2018-05-28,0,0,16,False,Not Recommended,This has been a huge dissapointment for such a popular game. I gave it a chance and tried every mode available but the constant problems with hit detection lag network issues and gameplay bugs make this unplayable. When a game expects you to spend so much time each match gearing up with very few enemy interactions until late game it is completely unacceptable for each enemy encounter to be luck of the draw. I had several instances where I would get the drop on an enemy and my shots would simply not register for one reason or another. To make things worse dieing from this means starting from scratch again with a VERY SLOW start to each match. I requested a refund but did not get it due to time played. To me this is BS considering how much time you have to put into a game like this to get a good feel for it and how its running. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME there are much better games out there that perform so much better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Literally nothing about this game is fun The game is client based so your bullets have delayed damage. The game for some reason loves making you run for extremely long distances. The graphics are absolutely appalling for instance you have to turn down all of your video settings just so you can see threw the of horrible textures. The game has a HORRIBLE reward system they literally have NORMAL Tshirts as rewards for chests you can BUY for THREE ing dollars what a complete rip off games like Dota 2 have similar loot boxes that give you 100 times cooler than PUBG oh and Dota 2 is free if you live under a rock. The game is to play with friends most of the time you end up blaming eachother for your mistakes. WHEN in actuality the game just sucks and it's the dev's fault. Sometimes you can load 3 clips into people from across the map and all of the damage will be absorbed by a ing cast iron PAN. IN TEAM BATTLES YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR TEAMMATE which means if you don't have any good friends who will spend 30$ oh a game you're screwed. Vehicles are a NIGHTMARE to drive not only can the enemies hear you from miles away if ONE of your tires hits a ing FRACTION of a hitbox that's the size of a grain of sand your ing car will do 20 barrel rolls and explode. This game is the opposite of fast paced the best way to win when theirs not a lot of people left is to wait on the corner of the ing fog and just sit their and hope someones stupid enough to stop proning so you can kill them. When your character throws a grenade he instantly turns in to a Japanese anime girl and ing tosses it like hes never done a push up in his entire life. This game THRIVES on cheaters because of the client side connection players can do pretty much whatever they want without the fear of instant consequences and even if they do get banned they can just easily buy it again on another account with a spare 30$ they saved up from the 6 months of playing the game and cheating constantly. the game is extremely buggy players sink threw the floor of the map you can sometimes see and shoot people who's body is glitching threw a wall.TL DR PUBG is one of the worse Battle Arena games and should be considered a GAME simulator how dare you guys sue another game company just because they made a better game then you.

2018-05-21,0,0,294,False,Recommended,"Overall 3.5/5 starsPUBG The original battle royale game. While you may be more familiar with Epic Games wildly successful Fortnite this was the first and some might say the best. While I've enjoyed PUBG immensely it's hard to say how this title and the batte royale genre will hold up over time. And even if I'm not playing in three or five years time I'm having a whole lot of fun with it right now despite some of its shortcomings. But should you buy it?Gameplay 4/5 starsFirefights are great and there's some really tactical play that you can dive into here. The gunplay tries to be more realistic than most shooters and you'll have to lead your target at certain ranges and your shots will drop over distance. Guns are based on 'real life' weapons and the developers have tried to make each gun's performance match the ballistic properties of the particular round it actually shoots. There are lots of RNG elements in this game and that's okay with me. You never know what loot you'll find where the circles will end up or if you'll get destroyed by a random redzone. In order to be the last man or last squad standing it will take a little of both luck and skill to get it done.Where PUBG really shines is with friends. In my experience I've had the most fun strategizing and working toward those tasty chicken dinners with pals. Solo offers a good time sure. If you're into the stealthy stuff and you know if you are you'll absolutely love solo. Graphics 2.5/5 starsThe graphics are just okay. You won't be blown away by either of the two available maps as of the time of this review. Textures are very basic you won't find any fancy features you've seen in AAA titles for the past five years maybe because this game is derived from another toned down title called Arma 3. If you're looking for a smooth polished visual treat you're going to be very disappointed here. Developer Support/Bugs 1/5 starsIt's probably fair to say Bluehole has done a fairly poor job in supporting this game and it shows given the surge in popularity of Fortnite PUBGs primary competitor. Community requests like map selection went ignored for what seemed like eons while the company pushed out extremely weak weapon skins. Bluehole chooses to conduct server maintenance and implement patches in prime gaming time on the east coast of the US around 10pm. In the past few months the company has been experimenting with various gametypes on a limited time basis that have added some extra flavor. It's a lot of reactionary moves based on what the competition is up to but it's nice to see.Value 3/5 stars This game is really fun and a great way to spend a few hours a night with friends. The introduction of new event modes and the gradual release of new maps gives me hope for the survival of the game long term. With the random nature of each game ""replayability"" value is high.

2018-05-30,0,0,302,False,Not Recommended,I cannot support such an immature and self entitled company as this. I will not play this game anymore and I've just uninstalled it. They've decided to follow through with their lawsuit against Epic Games for Fortnite which they have no basis for. This case will likely be laughed out of the court room if it even makes it that far... but just the gall of this company very much rubs me the wrong way. They are really more guilty of copying games than Fortnite is anyway... this is not the first battle royale game or the second or third... but those developers would have just as much trouble suing Bluehole that is unless their lawsuit succeeds. If that were to somehow happen (it won't) it would open the floodgates for all these other companies to start suing Bluehole. Also in a world where this lawsuit did succeed they would be changing gaming forever and severely stunting growth and innovation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It also has a dedicated team behind it regardless of what the trolls want to say this game has constatnt support from its developers. Unlike Fortnite and H1Z1 there is no crafting element for better or for worse so what you get is what you get. This means there is some luck involved in each game which can be frustrating for some.

You can hit someone 8 times with a rifle and never kill them. You hold your breath for the same time a 3 year old can when you want to zoom in pistols will somehow defeat your military grade armour and helmets no determined spray patternsDriving vehicles will hit invisible walls/ rocks the size of a baseball and explode vehicle maneuvering is sluggish at best and comical usually some vehicles have the density of tanks others are made from brown paper bagsGeneral local servers tend to never be available so you should probably learn chinese now hackers are abundant when you pick duo or squad expect to still be playing solo because screw the player every patch is one small fix for doors and one giant step back for textures animations shot registration and delays. there is a delay between using a medical item and when your health restores. The loot or gear distribution looks like a kid with turrets and a sharpie descided where things would be there is a terrible delay between clicking and trying to pick something up. If you even pick it up it will often take several attempts to grab one item and that will most likely not be the item you need anyway.Conclusion The concept for the game is great but so is H1Z1 or literally any other king of the hill gameIf the developers wanted a fast paced game they would get rid of all of these dumb delays so that players feel like they can actually do things fast pacedThe game has a lot of potential but if youre gonna charge people for trash they should know they're buying trash.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Another battle royal type game with good mechanics (not bad not perfect) good graphics and good gameplay. BUT the game is poorly made thus so many bugs still exist some mechanics are exceptionally idiotic (such as a vehicle going at 90+ km/h crashing into a stopped motorcycle and the vehicle would just stop as if it crashed into a wall and many more which for the sake of a kinda small review I will not mention) the RNG system of the game is unbelievably terrible from the spawn rate of cars to the airdrops (many times a crate will get stuck on top if unclimbable buildings or even in mid air) the terrain is terrible meaning at many points in a field you can crash while driving at imaginary little hills there is still no map selection the devs won't even pay attention to out feedback and will just keep ""improving"" the game in their own direction (which of course is to keep earning more money) hackers still reign this game after all these updates to eliminate them and last but not least more than enough times there is an inout lag between server and client resulting in slow response of in game actions from opening doors to picking up items.

There is no hop in for a quick game (yet) some buckle for a ride that will last you a solid half hour of intensly scavinging for guns in schools and looting houses like never before. COD and other typical shooters have no thrill running and dying gets you a pic and the battle is have a high K/D. This feels like what a shooter should be. Punishing you for dying like you deserve (you WILL die ALOT no matter you Battlefield 1 K/D). Best parts inckude actually putting me on the edge of my seat lets be honest Titanfall 2's campiagn to a solid 4 hours of simply gameplay (and COD III even less) without the basic boringness of a campaign the game makes you learn through dying. Rage inducing but in the end actually helps those who do rage. It self prevents toxicity from drunk COD players and those normal people who want to play the game play the game. In solo you hide for your life in duo you and a friend can win with teamwork and in squad you get a random German guy in the NA server because he's stupid and your 4th friends mic is broken (mic is required for teamplay really). The game has already put itslef in Steams best with three modes 1 map and basic game requirements.

The gameplay is amazing when it is working correctly. The loot system could be better as I am level 21 and i still have not received the skull mask when people that are level 2 get it. the loot system is useless as you grind for achivements only to get a striped shirt for a limited time. Other than that there are hacker but it is not as big of a problem as people make it out to be. I only see one hacker out of every 30 games i play if that people that claim hackers are usually people with bad enternet or computers or they are just bad at the game in general. Pub G does have a little bit of a desync problem as well. Even with these flaws I still recommend the game as it is my most played game and I believe this is nthe best br out there and it is a very fun shooter once you get the hang of it.

2018-02-18,0,0,697,False,Not Recommended,The game is exciting and overall awesome. I can't speak more highly of the gameplay. I can't recommend this game right now because the cheaters are out of control and the anti cheat system they are using is not effective simply because the cheaters just buy the game again. With 100 players in each match you are absolutely going to have a dozen cheaters that just wreck the game. Every single match now. A couple months ago this wasn't the case. The cheating situation is continually getting worse not better. Do not send this company any more money until they take real action. They quote high ban numbers all the time as if that means anything but a large portion of the cheaters are in internet cafes in China and they just immediately rebuy the game. So in effect no cheaters are being banned. They need to IP ban all the cheaters including their public VPN's or ban hardware serial numbers. I suspect though since the cheaters just rebuy which generates more sales of the game the company is not to excited about actually fixing the problem that is wrecking this great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-05-25,0,0,59,False,Not Recommended,"UPDATE 06/02/18 Frame Rate is better but nowhere near up to the standard it should be for a game this ugly.Still a broken mess. While driving our car wheel got stuck in the ground and nearly killed us. Also we were killed by a glitched grenade which deafened us with its broken physics sounds. Hit detection is a joke too. I'm not talking about the players i'm talking about the parts of the map. There's such a disconnect between where your bullets should be hitting and where they actually hit that it makes the game more frustrating than fun. 1.0 release Rubber banding. Non stop. EARLY ACCESS For a game that holds so much potential and promise the developers behind it are scummy and dont seem to be doing what's necessary to make this game actually good.It'll be far easier to go through the problems first and foremost as there are a tonne. OptimisationYes everyone talks about it that's why i'm putting it first. The optimisation in this game is STILL garbage. I hear people all the time responding to this criticism with ""it's early access"" and ""it runs fine for me. First of all It may run fine for you but considering the sheer number of people complaining it must be a real issue! It can run fine for you doesn't mean it's well optimised!! Secondly in response to the ""It's early access"" argument.. Yes that would be fair however in the months it's been in early access improvements to the games optimisation have been miniscule. In addition the game is coming out of early access next month!!!PlayerUnknown himself said that optimisation will take months and lots of effort and yet the game is prepping for a 1.0 release in a matter of weeks implying that when this is out of early access it will still be unfinished! This is indefensible. They're releasing this game in an unfinished state with less content that star wars battlefront. BugsThe game is insanely broken. I've had friends forced to refund due to falling through the map i have found countless exploits vehicle physics are a complete disaster and so much more. Again does this seem fit for a full release??? GraphicsFor how shockingly bad this game runs the visuals are just atrocious. Blurry textures horrid animations terrible particle effects and so on. ContentFor 27 you get a single map lackluster customisation options and microtransactions. The developersThe developers can best be described as Incompetent greedy liars. They have promised things then gone back on their promises countless times ignoring complaints and causing even more issues with the game. Instead of fixing core problems with the game and remaining in early access they took the route that'll give them a bigger paycheck in that they are releasing an unfinished mess of a product as a full game (which they'll most likely charge even more money for).But enough railing on this game...

When the game officially rolled out it wasvery exciting. It ran extremely smooth FPS was at an all time high and there was zero crashing. AND THEN YOU HAD TO GO AND F&amp %K WITH IT. Every single update you have come out with since the release has made the game more and more unplayable. I can't go more than three games without it crashing. Forget getting loot when you first drop.

2018-02-21,0,0,1435,False,Not Recommended,Having spent an extensive amount of time playing this game I would have to recommend against purchasing it. Though the concept and premise of the game is incredible and entertaining the execution by the developers is poor. This game is fundamentally flawed and is very far from being a complete game. It should still be in pre release however the developers have shown time and time again that they are vastly more interested in generating a profit than they are with improving let alone meeting the standard of a finished game. This is apparent with their astonishing disconnect between the playerbase and their development team. As updates and patches come out you will often find yourself wondering if they even play their own game or if they update simply to create the illusion that they are actually trying to fix the numerous bugs and glitches this game has. Instead of implementing changes requested by fans such as map selection and regionlocking they decided to introduce a $2.50 aesthetic loot crate system. Thanks. Furthermore every server is plagued with individuals who are unable to effectively communicate or cooperate and will often team kill. Tie that in with outrageous ping and you have an unplayable and frankly frustrating experience. On top of all this the paramount issue that is encountered with striking frequency is that of hackers from over seas. Whether it be instant healing shooting through walls auto aim 600 meter triple headshots unlimited grenades it is now near impossible to play in any server without facing off against cheaters in the final 5 if you're lucky enough to have not been killed by one prior. And don't be confused there is no subjectivity on the matter of cheating the hackers are bold enough to be completely blatant with their cheating because they farm crates and used the money to purchase more game keys. Do not give this company your money. They do not care about their community unless they generate money for them and if that means sacrificing the experience for any legitimate player looking to kick back with some friends and have some fun then they will do so with a smile.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-24,0,0,339,True,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a very strategical game you can play with 1 3 of your friends. Loot spawns at locations and it varies due to the popularity and size of the location. At the start of the game you sit in a lobby with the toxicity of the other players. After a certain amount of time you will be put into a plane which has a random path over the island (Erangel). This is when you figure out where you want to go. Once you find the location you wait for the drop and proceed. When you land you need to find weapons as soon as possible. Check the zone and then if you need to leave it will be smart to find a vehicle. If you don't need to leave you can still find a vehicle but will have more time to loot. At least once during every zone there is an airdrop. These contain high tier loot such as M249's and Ghille Suits. Finding these will give you a very large advantage. While the zones are closing in you need to mind your flanks. Towards the very final zones you need to watch for grenades and people crawling up to you. In the final few you have a pretty good chance of survival. In this game the Chicken Dinner is everything. Get it and get clout. Without it you have no clout. Good luck out there!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-12-13,0,0,284,True,Recommended,Awesome stuff aside there are some really frustrating things about this game.Since the new killcam system has been around you can actually see who killed you and how which helps with the frustration of being killed by a pistol assassin from 10 miles away which seems to be impossible. Another thing you might notice is the mind ing lag of the game. Many times looking at the killcam after being killed from around a corner you will see your killer landing shots with his/her recticle not even remotely close to where you are. I'm sure on the other player's screen you are within the recticle but it is frustrating as to constantly be killed when you are actually in cover but to another player you are still in the open.Like a said this little rant is one of the frustrating things in an otherwise awesome title.Will definitely recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've never played a game like this one and it's pretty damn good. I'm pretty new to it so far so I'm pretty bad but it's also an esy game to adjust to.

2017-12-14,0,0,61,True,Recommended,Its pretty fun. It does have some rubberbanding right when the match starts but it typically subsides. The new test branch of the game has major optimization improvements gained about 40fps or so. Ive never experienced any hackers before either. I'm pretty sure most of the negative reviews are from people who arent good or who dont have good internet or a powerful enough machine. I mean it IS early access after all you can't expect superb quality for how relatively new the game is. Honestly it does crash sometimes but not enough that its ruined my experience.

There is something different in this game which attracts me really much. Only few bugs and it feels complete despite being early accessEdit After playing PUBG some time I have to give it a No. The main problem with this game is desync problems. Sometimes when there are no network problems the game is great. But only desync problems start people lag teleport in close combat your bulets are sometimes dropped by server people kill you before you can even see them or the worst You shoot a shotgun from a close distance at a guy thinking this is a 100% kill and afer 0.5 a sec you are dead because it appears that the server favoured his shots.And no this is not my network problems because I do not have these problems in other FPS games,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-07,0,0,601,False,Recommended,After 550 hours of a love hate relationship I have finally brought it upon myself to write a review. Gun balancingGun balancing has reached a point where I can actually consider it fair there are some guns that are made completely irrelevant by others like the Scar and M416 or the SKS and Mini 14 but overall the balancing with the ARs and Snipers is done well enough for a game like this. PerformanceTo PUBG's credit performance has actually improved by quite a bit since july of last year (when I started playing it). This of course isn't an exuse for the consistant frame drops in CQC and ADS when near an enemy. The CQC issue has existed since the beginning of this game's release and I have yet to see an actual effort to fix it it's truly painful to drop to 1fps for 3 seconds when you're at point blank of an enemy. Other than this the game will normally keep a consistant frame rate in mid and late game. The new war mode is pretty much unbearable because of extremely low frame rates due to having 100 players in such a small place but it's not yet part of the game so I won't knock them for it. Updates****ing hell do I wish the devs would listen to the community when it comes to adding more content. No one asked you to remove the last event mode. They keep adding new content for custom games which is a terrible decision IMO most custom games are run by twitch streamers that will give codes to their subs first and usually won't play what you want them to play. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else to play the content that blueballs adds. The new shotgun event mode is a step in the right deriction but they lack control over their own games it's clear that the event mode was thrown together in custom games and then ported into the menus as a game mode. All ammo types will spawn in shotguns only because apperantly the devs can't custom set items in their own game. Also we were promised a shooting range 9 months ago and we have yet to recieve one. Custom Games The next time I have to wait for Rahani Gupta to click start on a custom game lobby is when I unistall this game. Brendan Greene must have a daddy kink because he is basically every small PUBG custom game twich streamers . Custom games should have been released for everyone by now BlueBalls entertainment has confirmed that custom games DO NOT run on their own dedicated servers yet we still don't have public custom games. There are literally twitch streamers that survive by linking their streams in the title of a PUBG custom game making you sit through an entire ad to find out the code that probably won't even be there. Just flood the market by making custom games public drive these rats out of your game. This will only hurt those who take advantage of your game as twitch streamers will still be able to create custom games with passwords for their viewers. Final suggestionsPlease just pump out new stuff every week I don't care if you put in an unbalanced weapon it's still content that will bring me back into this game. Pushing out new content and tweaking based on testing will insure that your players will aprove of it when it's finished. I've probably left a lot of things out but this what I think is wrong with the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Both maps are frustrating to play.I think this game would really prosper in the hands of a AAA company and I know they would kill to pick up this title after how big it has become.

2017-10-29,0,0,258,False,Recommended,"7/10 TLDR It's fun with a few friends but it gets annoying because network lag clunky controls and involves a lot of luck (drops circle when you are a certain place). You can get to end game without looting or moving. Basically... Drop out of plane. Run to nearest weapon. Kill. Survive. Loot. Kill till you are the last alive. Plane path is random Loot is random who lands near you *basically random. A lot of ""randomness"" in this game and its frustrating when you dont need a lot of skill to win. The Juicy bits... You feel adrenaline near end game but as you play more and more you dont feel the adrenaline anymore. Killing people is satisfying especially when you snipe them from far away with a silenced 1911 (jk I didnt do that but it would have been cool if i did) Controls The controls feel clunky in the beginning (especially jumping) but you get used to it. Learn to crouch jump trust me it helps out so much. Especially when you are at school because you can jump in and out of windows that people wont expect you to come out of. The more you play the better you get with controlling the character and guns. Vaulting over walls is VERY slow.

2017-12-20,0,0,38,True,Not Recommended,PUBG is an uninteresting waste of time. The fun part of the game aka the shooty shooty part is so few and far apart. You can either start aggressively and land in a high loot area like the various cities to get some gun fights but this will normally result in a loss because even if you do kill every person in the time it took you will be to far from the circle to survive. The shooty part also comes at the end but it is mostly sniping behind trees. Between the start and finish of a game you have a 15 20 minute period of just running and finding the same you already have with a gun fight once in a blue moon. On top of very very boring gameplay the game runs like hot and even on high settings it still looks ugly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I have made a small list of pros and cons to the game belowPros Immersive and realistic A well developed game (so far please note the game is still being worked on) A very avtive development team constantly releasing information and updates to the game Nice graphics! (even on the lower settings)Cons some may find the $30 pricetag to high for an early access game ( i do understand that the game is still being developed ) if you do not have a very powerfull computer it may be hard to run It can be very frustrating at times e.g. you can be in a game for 20 minutes then just get shot in the head (keep in mind that this is of no fualt of the devs)Overall i really enjoy this game if you are willing to spend the 30$ nad have someone to play it with i would absolutely reccomend it ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-12,0,0,178,True,Not Recommended,"Judging by my hours in the game you can tell that i have been a fan of this game since its release. I played this game about everyday i came home from work knowing it was in early accsess and wanting to test for new bugs and what not and report these things because this game has MASSIVE potential. However recently the game has completely phased out of early access and has transfered over to a complete show. The game in its current state i cannot recommend AT ALL. In the games current state there are so many things that are wrong with the game at this point it feels like they're trying to hide it. They're simply showing new development on maps anti cheat measures etc keep in mind this is after they said their new ""cheatbuster"" was banning 6k hackers a day. The moment that post came out from the company almost every single game i got into had atleast 1 2 hackers. To put a long story short and sum this game up in a nutshell as of now the game is entirely run by de sync servers no region locking and last but not least hackers. Like i said earlier the game has MASSIVE potential but it seems to be is being completely neglected just for money and not for the community.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-16,0,0,704,False,Not Recommended,This game had the potential to be so good but was ruined by the developers. Currently the game has been plagued by hacking for months especially in Third Person modes. None of their anti cheat updates have shut down large scale hacking yet. On top of current issues they have backed on promises and had a lot of other problems that continue to degrade the quality of this game. Modding was promised with version 1.0 which still has not released. A 4x4 map was promised to be the second map released with faster gameplay as requested by users. Instead we got Miramar an even slower 8x8 that also had very bad optimization issues. Microtransactions were promised not to be released until 1.0 arrived. 3 months later they backed on this and started selling crates + keys. The xbox release was a joke and not even close to ready for a public release. To capitalize on hype they released anyways.This game is amazingly fun when it works and is hack free but since alpha release there has always been major problems that prevent this game from being the best it could be. The developers are excessively greedy for cash and will burn their playerbase for an extra buck.5/10 would drop another 700 hours in game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Because everyone was lagging it wasnt that big of a deal it put you on an even playing field.Ever since a few month prerelease this game has just became horrible for me. I have have put so many hours in trying to get better and play more stategic and it means absoulutely nothing. Every time I get down to the final 10 I am guaranteed to have to fight a hacker it feels like. Which is horrible. The only way to win is when they are aimbotting someone else k9 headshot them. It isn't fun. I have to play completely different to try and outplay these kids that are garbage. It is even worse on other servers besides NA. Every game in asia and kr has a hacker.

Looking at the top 10 in every region that all have 50 hours+ per season and are obviously hacking should tell you everything you need to know about the the quailty of the pubg devolpment team and their lack of desire and capability to react with any sense of urgency. One would think that being the most popular game on the internet for a year would have increased the frequency and quality of their devolpment. You're wrong. Instead of taking the money earned from this game during its beta and reinvesting it they took the money to make a new company and are already starting devolpemnt of a new game Ascent instead of finishing this one. The game has sold an astonishing 20 million copies....and it's still unfinished. Unexcusable and pathetic and in my opinion is borderline criminal. This is a cash grab by the devolpers same as with Day Z that will be in ""devolpment"" for the next 4 years and will never come out of beta. They slapped a 1.0 label on it but don't let it fool you. This game is the exact same quailty as it was in beta. They added a new map for the same crap product and called it 1.0....slow clap.

Before this starts here are my computer specs Nvidia geforce 960m 16 gigs of ram i7 intel processor my internet connection clocks in stable at 10 20 ping over 100 mbps download over 25 mbps download. When I first started playing this game maybe 5 months ago it was addicting. It seemed rather balanced and it was a rush. Especially with friends. I came back to it after not playing it for weeks. Expected the same amount of fun. I was DEAD WRONG. I have never posted a bad review before but this game will be the first. The hackers are out of control. Out of the last 8 games I've played between now and writing this review NOT ONCE WAS I NOT KILLED BY SOMEONE WHO WASN'T HACKING. Not once. Hackers arent even the main problems. This game LAGS. Shots at long distances are almost impossible. Short distances are choppy at best. The only time you can get a kill is if you within 20 meters and the opponent has not seen you and uve got a clear shot. Which happens almost never. I have logged over 60 hours into this game and have yet to win a game with over 150 matches. The loot boxes give you multiples of the same items. I have two of the same shirt....I mean comeon. Why even give me a crate? And all of these complaints are only viable if you can connect to the servers without them being ""full"". I admit I'm not the best at this game there are certainly people better than me. Before this degregation I would average every 2 3 games I would make it in the top 10.

2017-07-03,0,0,188,True,Recommended,Pros If you like Miscreated Squad Rust ARMA Search and Destroy (Call of Duty) or any game like that then this is the game you've been waiting for. It uses Battle eye for anti cheat. Also unreal engine is used in this game. It's very team based and communication is 100% key to victory. The gameplay including vehicles is very smooth for an early access game which is very promising. So future optimization will only make it better. The game is a nice mix between firefights and being stealthy/ sneaky &amp camping. The way the game is designed prevents people from hard camping which is great. There's no leveling system for your character or attribute points which makes the game 100% SKILL BASED. Game physics is really niceCons Character customization is very limited limited amount of guns (for now many more sure to come) limited armor options (for now more might come)The game has many updates coming into the near future such as being able to climb as well as vaulting walls vehicles and even through a window! Also there will be many more maps as well as different weather!

2017-10-31,0,0,794,True,Not Recommended,I have played this game between 3 different accounts. Mainly because I had 2 ones for playing challenges and having laughs with friends. PUBG is a great game with a not so great chinese community. They join non asian servers in mass. To the point where I can't even que NA or OCE (the two farthest servers from eachother) without getting minimum 2 Chinese players and the entire feed is 90% chinese players. This in its own right is an issue not because of their race country of origin etc. But rather because of the way the game handles lag/delay. It BENEFITS the lagger/delayer.Then there is the fact that if you que into 3 chinese friends they will most likely team kill you. Which has no effect on them because for the most part they use internet cafe accounts..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Not to mention of how the UMP is now very op. I get to see very less pro players joining and more of normal skilled players.

Furthermore the gameplay that is available at the time of this review is extremely sound with a well designed map for official games. I don't have much experience in solo play but jumping into a match with 3 of your buddies can some of the most fun you can have in a video game today.For the price tag of $30 this game already delivers a solid product even if it was released today.

It was fun for a while but it went into the garbage can quickly. Most servers are filled with people from the asian region with their garbage rubberbanding and this isn't even including the hackers from the region. It's disappointing when you get a few kills into the game and then have a random asian hacker fire 500 yards away and kills you with their aimbotting program. Just a major disappointment compared to the numerous other Battle Royale games. (Even H1Z1 has a better anti cheat detection service and they've been desperately reworking their game.)I rather play Fortnite or H1Z1 over this garbage. Fortnite offers events to keep the game exciting and bans hackers often. H1Z1 went free to play and deseprately reworking the game especially keeping hackers out of their game. (For a free to play game a hacker can easily remake an account but they don't last long in the new system.) If you want developers who actually care about the health of their game and not focused on doing a cash grab from their customers avoid this game entirely.

2017-11-04,0,0,66,True,Recommended,This is a pretty amazing game for this genre. It is familiar and totally fresh at the same time hard to remember when an fps game made me feel that way. Hunger games for PC is easiest reference if you have no idea what this game is. 100 players go onto island play area gets smaller and smaller. Last man standing wins. A lot of the game is about the tension and having no idea if someone is about to blow your head off. The rest of the game is often about not firing your guns and simply staying still lying down on the ground as enemies walk right past you and you feel your heart beat. It took me a little while to really get into it (you just die a lot early as there is no tutorial). Once you push through the early learning phases what lies underneat is fun exciting calming and has a great pace to the games. Suprised me with how fun it got once I was a few hours into playing.

Its as if the game's servers cant handle 100 people.2 Middle game (when there is 40 30 people left) is so borring with most of the time you running around place to place just to find no one then get instantly headshoted from 100 meters away from some camping in a house.3 The map is to big since there are times where you wont find people for 5 10 minutes even when you running around trying to find people (this mostly happens with my friends in sqaud/duo) with us running around the area where 20+ people landed to find no one. This is also extremely dumb during mid game as its just a game of you cant kill the last guy not who can kill the most people4 The amount of bugs and glitchs in this game are insane with veiclhes flying across the map from the smallest ramps and when you run into a motorcycle (with a bigger veichle) it will get stuck inside instendly killing you and you're squad.5 The amount of hackers in this game from only play 17 hours i have found 10+ (to my believe) aimbotting and wallhacking. Its only going to get worse as if they dont fix the anti cheat system it could become like csgo with everyone cheating agianst the other team who is also cheating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Gameplay is good i've met some good people had some good times but it needs some updates.

2018-02-21,0,0,973,False,Not Recommended,If i were to write a review based on my first few weeks playing this game it would be a HUGE THUMBS UP. However after 700 hours of gameplay and tons of chicken consumed I have to say please DO NOT BUY this game. It is truely tragic that a game this great has fallin so far. At least 1 out of 5 games end by a headshot burst from an AR from hundreds of yards away because some people cant play by the rules. Then once a month or so we get to read how PUBG Corp has come up with new anti cheat software and have banned X amount of acounts as a result. Yet still the cheating continues. Honestly PUBG when you dont get cheated is a blast and a half but its a true waiste of time and a huge disapointment when you spend upwards of 30 minutes playing a game just to get offed by a cheater. Thank you for those who read my rant and please do yourself a favor and atleast wait for the game to be fixed before you buy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-11-26,0,0,384,True,Recommended,"Let me start by saying that I do thoroughly enjoy this game and if you're into open arena type games this game is sure to catch your attention. Everything I say is to try to give a completely unbiased opinion to allow outside users to get a feel for what they're getting into.Now... Let me tell you why I absolutely want to break my screen in half over this game. PUBG (PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS) as of right now is unbelievably unoptimized graphically among other things. The balance of the game is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to fairness. I understand that it's a game so it's not going to be realisitc but when someone has a double barrel shotgun with a choke on it can one shot headshot me from down the block after I tagged them with 4 rounds to the chest and they don't even flinch I don't much think that's very fair. Apart from even that imense BS grenades other then the HE grenade is next to useless. Smokes are rarely used and even when they are you don't know which direction the ""wind"" will take it possibly not even providing you with cover to move. Stun grenades are almost non existance in terms of actual play. Graphically speaking the game has major issues with maintaining a constant framerate even in non dense quiet areas meaning no explosions or a bunch of fog or smoke or rain is going on. Server lag isn't a big issue compared to the other problems with the game but at the start where I notice most server lag if you land somewhere with a lot of people and have to quickly grab a gun and fight there's too much delay which could give your opponent a leg up. The sound is way too muffled and faded out and can't usually be made out too well unless it's quiet in the surrounding area. The point system is very unforgiving and can get very frustering.Now that's all said and done I do understand that the game is still undergoing mass changes a lot of updates and fixes which is just ONE reason why I love this game. This game brings so much fun and enjoyment it's hard to step away most of the time. Playing with friends doesn't punish you for goofing around the game itself doesn't limit you on what you can or can't do (Aside from the TOS of course) and it can really make for a lot of good times and goofy moments. If the developers continue on the path they are fixing bugs updating and reworking tweaking just the right way... This game has a very VERY bright future. With all memes aside this game has a long ways to go before it's eSports ready but when it truly is I'm sure it'll be great. MuFFiN",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-04-09,0,0,504,True,Recommended,Short version As far as gameplay and concept go this game is pretty spot on. It blends excellent gunplay simple yet effective looting mechanics and a beautiful well designed environment to create a heart pounding tactical chess match. While there are still plenty of problems even in the current state it s a great experience. Pros Emphasis on tactics positioning and careful movement without sacrificing good gunplay. Balanced and fun weapons. Risk vs Reward implemented well. Easy to get into games. The game looks great. (I ve been playing on ultra) Very immersive Map size and design. Good level of randomization mixed with the choices of 90ish other players make the game very replayable. Paced well. A full game down to the last player ends up being like 25 minutes. I honestly don t normally make it longer than like 10 15. ctrl t Devs communication. Cons Poorly optimized at the moment. If you re not on a good rig I d wait. Vehicle mechanics are a little wonky. Some weird stuff happens. Occasional bugs. I ve only experienced 1 or 2 that really negatively affected playability. It s not finished ? Addressing some of the concerns that I've seen pop up in other reviews From a technical side there are some issues most of the negative reviews I've read have mentioned poor optimization and server issues and those are definitely something to consider before picking this game up. I'm running it on a pretty high end rig and there are definitely times when the framerate tanks. That being said I've never had it drop below 30fps which I'd still consider playable. As far as server issues I've almost never had any lag or slow downs but maybe I'm just lucky. I also see a lot a people talking about cheaters but can't say that I've ever come across any (yet). It doesn't seem to be plagued with them which was something I was worried about before getting into the game.The vehicle mechanics are pretty bad but I ve also seen worse in finished games. I m excited to see where the devs go with them. The sound is another thing I ve seen talked about a lot. I personally really like the way it s set up and the effects themselves are wonderful. It is very hard to identify where shots are coming from when you re being shot at no denying that but I personally love what it does to the immersion and keeps the game more focused on tactical maneuvering and strategy than strictly gunplay. Anyways I hope this is helpful for those interested. I ve really enjoyed this game and am very excited to see it progress and hopefully improve on it s very promising frame.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-04-07,0,0,149,False,Not Recommended,Although this is probably one of the best king of the hill games in terms of its gameplay I can't even come close to recommending it due to its severe development problems. Lag is always present whether you have a good connection or not I often find myself trying just to get to the lobby because it keeps telling me that the server is busy (well put me in a queue genius) or it timing out before I conect to my duo / squadd game effectively banning me from the game in progress and seperating me from my team. The game also regularly crashes especially as soon as I join a game. Doors are buggy bikes are buggy and if you're not concentrating almost impossible to control. They will also do about 50 backflips before exploding and killing you after they touch a pebble. Being in a vehicle with someone else driving is buggy. Being in the back of a bike while the driver leaves the car is buggy. Getting weapons at the start of the game is buggy I'll pick up a shotgun right next to a guy who just got his m16 except either it doesn't show the shotgun in my hotbar or it won't let me reload for a while effectively condemning me to a ridiculous death. Swimming is also buggy but it's more of an animation glitch rather than anything annoying. Hitboxes on objects are I've hit the fence in front of me or the half meter of air above a rock instead of someones head countless times. While grenades have a bow trajectory it may aswell just be an arrow pointing in the direction of where you are throwing because it rarely throws the grenade in the given trajectory. The servers are also down very often.To summarize unless you plan on playing with friends or have extremely high tolerance for broken games I wouldn't reccomendd this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

If the players use the cheating programm in normal servers their account will be locked and if they wanna play this game they have to buy a new account and go to the new plays server at the begining instead of the normal servers and protect the the players in the normal servers. and if that works i do believe it will be much less cheating players in normal servers.if you think it is a good idea thumb up please.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2017-12-19,1,1,1181,True,Recommended,This game is amazing. been playing it since march and i love the game play and machanics behind it. The thing that i feel would make this better is the latency and tick rates in the servers. Many times i would be behind and object during a fight and somehow i would get a late hit being rejestered. Another thing would be while the RGN aspect is great when it comes to weapons the vehicle spawns are something of a challenge. When the zone is starting to move i spend forever trying to find a vehicle wo make it in but fail to While other times i find 5 right next to each other. So it will feel like to find a vehicle you need to have a vehicle. The last thing is when i comes to shotguns in particular. The shots with a shotgun is the most frustrating thing to me. Close range it should be the most feared and deadly weapon PERIOD! But a lot of the time when i use it close range i have to hit the opponent 3 4 time before they go down and many times i get hit once from a distance and get 1 shotted. Its an incredibly frustrating thing to deal with even if i put a choke on the gun. Other then that this is a fantastic game to play and recommend it with any of my friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

While this occurs across the board in the BR genre I think it is exacerbated in PUBG. A new 4x4 km map could certainly remedy this situation and is in development.It gets a lot right but it still needs a lot of fixing.I'd still recommend buying it since it's a really fun BR game (and I prefer its style over the cartoonish trampoline shotgun simulator that is Fortnite).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But it went out only for some marketing purposes not because its optimized and fixed. What is really negative in this game random crushes (in the middle of the fight yeah those are the best) cars stuck or flip because of the smallest rocks you can cover behind postion but you will still gonna die because of the tickrate which is really low redzone this shouldn't exist lack of shooting range when you can modify your weapon and actually learn how to shoot it you can acually get locked lootbox from random crate adding more lootboxes you need to buy a 2 5 $ key to open alt tabing the game is nightmare sometimes you can die because of game loading so poorly after you die if your teamates are too far from each other fast changing the camera can give you ability to wallhack the game because buildings wont spawn so fast (im using nvme ssd to play this game btw)OH BTW Bluehole adding more useless boxes won't fix your creation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-02-17,0,0,279,False,Not Recommended,To start off with this game was a lot of fun to play and enjoy with friends. Though the game had and still has many many bugs and lag issues I still had fun with it. The running around and looking for guns and hoping to make it was enthralling choosing to be sneaky or go full comando or even stay back and snipe was insanely fun and the fact that you can kinda choose what kind of person you're going to play. There were a lot of things that also made the game still feel like it's still in beta as well and I do believe that this game was nowhere near fuill release ready. The loot boxes were and still are a horrible idea and you get them on random so when you get the desperado crate you need to buy a key with actual money to open it and you can't get rid of them if you aren't going to buy the key. Though the biggest issue besides the loot crates and bugs are the sheer giant amount of hackers/ cheaters/ people with clearly band internet connection in this game. Those with high ping and those that hack and cheat are fully destorying any kind of fun that this game use to have. Being shot by a dead person or shot around a wall because of their high ping or just being shot through the wall or even being shot by a shot gun while being on the other side of the map completely ruins any enjoyment in this game. It completely destroys any kind of balance for this type of game where reaction will be who generally will win. And when you cheaters and high ping are completely ruining the game's balance then something should be done. It's even on record that 99% of cheaters come from China and many people are asking to be region locked. Hence why a lot of people say region lock china. But in the end Brendan Greene Mr PlayerUknown himself (the creator of the game) has basically told everyone that we are nothing but racist people for asking for the region lock. For asking that the game's balance be intact and that let skill win you the prize. And it's an major issue that needs to be fixed. But let's also think about when you go and play with squads or duo how would you be able to play with a partner who doesn't speak your language ? How can you help them? How can they tell you where the enemy is coming from? Do they need health items? Do they need ammo? What kind? And there's no body language to look at so are completely up in the air in trying to figure out. And this can frustrate any player in any region where someone else from another country is trying to talk to them or you. I would love for this game to be balanced and be fair for everyone no matter where you're from but when that experience is being ruined and the creator clearly doesn't care then it's hard to care for a game where you're told you are the racist or wanting things fixed and balanced. Would I recommned this game? No not at all. Until the creator and the developer understand what a balanced and fair shooter is suppose to be and clearly stops calling everyone who disagrees with him a racist then go for it. Till then go to Fortnite or wait for the many other games that are now going to be doing battle royal in a much more fair and balanced way.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-01,0,0,21,False,Not Recommended,"As it stands this is a decent game. I can't currently recommend as even after it ""1.0"" release it is still plagued with problems. Random crashes mid match that if you are moving while you crash when restarting you continue to run forward several times I have had to restart only to come back to of run into the fog and have to turn around and run back due to a crash taking needless damage. To further annoy me upon relaunching I am unable to aim forcing me to hip shot constantly until the end of the match. Audio is bugged more times than I can count a player will drop off something and I will hear the landing sound in one ear turn to face that direction then get shot in the back this happens randomly I have yet to figure out if there is a specific set up that causes it. Same thing happens with gun shots the over all report in this is semi accurate by semi you will hear the ""pop"" than the bang. Most games that actually use this system have a pop followed by a bang the bang telling you where the shooter is. In this it's still the same concept except instead the bullet whizzing by you is a bang and the report is a pop. While the bang pop sounds being swapped is not a big deal the the sound coming in random ears is. If I had my guess it's almost as if it is based on the direction you are facing when they fire. So if they are to your right and they fire we'll say they miss and the pop is behind you and you turn around before the report. The report will still come through the right ear instead of the left at this point you will turn right putting your back toward the shooter and start scanning the horizon for them while being shot at from behind. While you will figure it out pretty quickly the fact this is a game about spotting before being spotted this is a huge problem. This one is a tad more rare but a couple of times I have jumped off the plane had no parachute and slammed into the ground. While it has not killed me I remain the rest of the match unable to turn use weapons or aim. As I am stuck in the free falling animation. I am not going to cover the not region locked servers as there are plenty of reviews on that and I'm not going to rehash that complaint as it's already been covered. I will just say it is a problem. A ""Cheat"" you can do is to turn your graphics down which will remove or lessen some surrounding grass and make players easier to spot. This should be addressed somehow. A game having bullet drop mechanics and travel time there should be a way to practice on a shooting range where you can take your time. The closest thing I have seen to being able to do this is jump through hoops to set up a private server then get a couple of friends to join you with the intent of not actually trying to win the match but to learn the weapons while still dealing with the wall. At the time of writing this review I have Steam telling me I have 15 hours in the game and these are all problems I have found in that short time. The game is fun and is a good way to waste some time if you have friends to play with it's where the game really shines but until the issues are fixed I personally can't recommend the frustration of that feeling of being bowled over by game mechanics instead of being wrecked by another player's skill is infuriating. As a side note if you do get this game. Avoid trying to melee if at all possible. The hit box for melee is all wonky. TLDR The game is plagued with bugs and issues from audio to game play mechanics server are not regionlocked and the anti hack / anti cheat is extremely weak. The game is fun but has some issues that need to be worked you to go from being decent to actually good.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

So don't expect anyone to speak your language with even the slightest of understanding unless you are also Asian.

If you like shooting games with a sense of strategy involved and are tired of repetitive small map shooters. Fun to play and watch on Twitch. Great with friends fun solo. Very rewarding feeling when you do well(winner winner chicken dinner!) and it's very easy to tell if you are improving. Game is still in early access and still needs some tuning but the devs are always hard at work and are constantly updating and listening to the community! Don't listen to the people whinning and giving the game a bad review because they got banned for cheating/harassing other players. They stream snipe Twitch streamers to kill them and/or harass them in an attempt to ruin the stream and have their 15 seconds of fame. Once these trolls are all delt with the community will be better!I recommend watching Athony_Kongphan and Grimmmz on Twitch if you are looking to get better at the game.

Ive had problems with loading into the game stupid glitches whle landing and guns not work when i clearly had better postioning. But PlayerUnknown has said on Twitter that they have version 1.0 done theyre just working out the bugs and kinks.

Fun game but until the cheating is addressed Id save my money.Follow Up (August 2017 almost 500 hours) While the cheating has been being addressed another note worthy con of this otherwise very fun game is the crate and key system they have implemented. While the game is still in early access the dev chose to attempt to build an in game economy to further profits before completeing the game. Now lets not be confused I fully support games that make microsales in games. Everyone has to eat.

Now ordinary Chinese players are also disgusted with cheating and have someone make video to teach people how to tell the cheating software. more and more chinese player go against the use of cheating software. however If blue hole itself is not paying enough attention to the crackdown cheating software i think is useless to prevent cheating software. thus i have a suggestion The blue hole can try to buy a cheat software and then test the effect. All players can be treated as cheating if they have similar places. in addition As a Chinese player I hate cheating software. It's not about the country. It's a personal problem so I hope that people who like this game can see Chinese players more rationally. Although I was also annoyed by the cheating software. LOL,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Very tactical you need to be focused 100% on the game if you want to take it seriously and it is fun. Taking into consideration that the game is still in early access (and has already broken many records (!) ) the ceiling is nowhere to be found for it. If the devs keep working hard on this game and fix the MMAANNYY bugs that it is currently bothered by it can leave its mark for many years as one of the most popular games out there. It has already re defined the ''Battle royale'' genre of games and I am sure that they won't stop here! Buy it fearlessly but you should be ready to face some annoying bugs and performance issues.

Whether it be watching my friends drive and flip into a pillar only to explode by the red zone or speeding past bridge campers on a bike wildly shooting back to save myself PUGB is filled with enough encounters and moments that will always be either the scariest or the funniest memories of this game.The backlash that PUGB has recieved though isn't completely unwarrented. The community has continued to discuss about a wide range of issues in the game such as hackers bugs and computer inconsistancies and for the most part they have the right to say these things. Personally I've had none of these community issues. I run the game on the minimum requirements and play on Oceania servers and so far I have no complaints. I haven't encountered and ""Chinese Hackers"" and performance wise I simply suck it up knowing that my 5 year old GPU is to blame and keep playing.With all the complaints I believe that PUGB's hard work with the game is being overlooked. They've worked to ensure that this game doesn't end up like DayZ or Halo The Master Chief Collection high profile games that were essentially abandoned simply because of the lack of innovative fixes/too big of a project to complete in the timeframe given.All said I'd recommend you play this game with friends.

From the start the game seemed really really sick. The graphics looked nice the music the HUD everything. We got into a game and intantly died (the usual) and we were too hyped to stop. Second or third game in is when things started to roll down hill. Me and my friends couldnt start a game because the game auto cancelled our game and we were confused. We decided to hop into the Eu (usually NA) servers and played fine for a bit and then it happened. ""Network Lag Detected"". If you get this game expect to see this A LOT. The game is still in beta and is still getting fixed. I went on the forums on the interwebs and tons and tons of people are experiancing the same issues as everyone else.

2017-12-20,0,0,383,True,Recommended,I do not really understand all the negativity around this game unless it's about hackers. I get that some people have problems with bugs and I do too trust me. But to say that the developers do not know what they are doing is IMO a joke. This game has been in early access for less than a year and they are set on releasing the full 1.0 version tomorrow. This is still impressive and a breath of fresh air when compared to other Early Access games. (day z for example.) They have improved the stability and performance a lot since the release and in my opinion the game is very much playable even on the test servers except the rubber banding. For me personaly I have not encountered a single person hacking in this game yet. I don't know if I am lucky or not but I guess this problem is more apparent on the US and the Asian servers and not the EU. I think the team has made great progress so far. When the game hit 1.0 tomorrow the team will most likley adress all the stability issues that we may encounter and not focus on new content. Early access is just not a funding campain. It's more aimed at getting the minimal viable product to the hands of the customer and then let people play and give the developer feedback so the game gets better. A lot of games get stuck and sometimes for understandable reasons. Some developers just wanna make money on the trend. But Bluehole has in my opinion made a fantastic game that has more potential than the majority of Early Access games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
2017-08-04,0,0,243,True,Recommended,In my opinion this is the best game of 2017 and it's not even close. The perfect blend of ARMA 3 BR DayZ and H1 elements. No games get my heart pumping like a final circle in PUBG. Development is fast updates are frequent they are always adding more and more to the game as well as slowly bringing along optimization which is to be expected. The game already runs pretty great for me as is though. I've been playing PUBG since alpha back in I think November '16 and it's insane to look back and see how far it's come along in only just over half of a year. Can't wait to see where this game goes. I know a lot of people reviewing this game recently seem to care alot about the crate system and broken promises. Personally I could not care less. I don't plan on buying crate keys much if ever and I can't see myself using any of the current cosmetic items in those crates. I'll leave my enemies to wearing the yellow jackets and skirts that show your legs by all means. Not to mention once first person servers have all the kinks worked out and are stable its the only mode I plan to play so I'll only be seeing my gloves. The only people I would not recommend this game for are people who can't control their gambling urge or money in general because I know that's a slippery slope for some. Overall I love this game and I hope to see it thrive. 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Regarding the comments about bad performance I'm playing on maxed out settings on a pretty normal gaming rig with a GTX 1060 (which is by no means an overpriced graphics card) with no issues at all. Yes the graphics are not that good even on ultra this is an early access game though. If you expect a great looking game without any bugs whatsoever just wait for the release. It may be overhyped but still It's a ton of fun and the gameplay is good. I love it for it's casuality and the ability to play solo since I don't always want to wait for friends or play in a team with people I don't know that are constantly whining in VC about other players just because they're so scared of loosing a few virtual ranking points in a videogame. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes playing multiplayer shooters.

2017-10-22,0,0,631,True,Not Recommended,Great game especially if you have friends. It's a very steep learning curve but you'll get some wins eventually. I've put in hundreds of hours in this game and I would like to put in many more but I find myself going from playing a few hours daily to maybe one or two nights a week. Why? Cheaters.Cheaters are running rampant all over this game and the developer is not doing anything proactive about it. They are very slow to ban even the most blatant cheaters. People are speed hacking to run faster than any vehicle can move in the game shooting through walls headshots from a few kilometers away and even making guns shoot faster than possible. It's completely ruined the experience for me and many others. I've checked profiles of cheaters days and even weeks after I first noticed them and they are still active with 90% headshots and averaging 30 kills per round ( 100 people total are in a single round).They boast about banning thousands of cheaters each day but thousands more just show up as they buy new accounts and give the developer more money. There is no reason for them to try and stop these people on a more permanent basis because they are profiting hugely off of their cheating. It's quickly ruining this game.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this game as your experience will inevitably be ruined by cheaters winning game after game and wasting your time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-01-14,0,0,351,False,Not Recommended,I DO NOT recommend this game...not until they fix it and here is why. 1. Countless times have we (the community) expressed our displeasure with the Situation around Hackers and it seems as though nothing has been done. Three games in a row now i have been killed by someone hacking and just standing in the field miles away shooting randomly. 2. While Everyone Screams region lock for the hacking problems and i agree lets make it a simpler reason. NA users in most cases (Probabaly more than 90% DO NOT speak Chinese or any other asian language this makes it impossible to queue for random squads or duos. 3. Miramar Simply put most users i've ever talked to dont really like this map. and while i no longer get this map 100% of the time. i still end up getting this pile of garbage a good 7 or 8 out of 10 games. Even leaving and rejoining (while waiting a min or two for the other to start) i find myself getting this map. Just give us a check box already. 4. the Lag has gotten better however i find myself and fellow players getting this freeze and then resume issue every game and its not due to my PC (i7 6700k 16GB DDR4 RAM GTX 980 8GB model and Samsung 850 evo M.2 SSD) while you are too busy releasing console ports and hotfixing them to scoop in cash the PC version is far from 1.0So until they decide to fix these issues i unfortunately will be uninstalling this game and no longer live streaming making Content ( www.Youtube.com/Fraglrokt ) or playing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One of the worst games to come out of early access of last year. People are either blind and ignorant or simply put up with the t this game is because there is nothing else really popularity &amp battleroyal wise besides Fortnite. Game still has so many problems with game breaking bugs servers and cheaters but hey let's add in more pay to open loot crates and 6Gig ""updates"". ""updates"" that you will either not notice or will take away features that made the game unique or interesting like the weather system. Oh and only now do they finally choose to listen to the community about adding a map selection feature even though it's easily one of the most wanted features in the game besides the cheating problem and optimization issues. Just wait for a big sale or wait till a Triple A gaming studio does a battleroyal game/mode. There are many coming out this year that'll do much better and will be worth your money. Maybe then the PUBG devs will actually do something about their game when they have more competition because they surley have the money.

I'm greeted with loud and angry Chinese chatter followed by an awkward pause. No one is getting in the jeep. However I do get shot in the face with a Kar98.

UMP sniping no ironsight 800m away through a tree while looking at the sky.)No region lock playing in your own server is pointless since you can change region and being in other regions somehow is less laggy and everyone isnt talking your language nomatter what server region you join.Vehicle physics need fixing especially on the new map with all the bumps the vehicle come to a stop constantly on nothing.The gun play on this shooter is one of the worst in any modern shooter and the hit detection is even worse.No map select.Everyone plays with no foliage appiled in the graphics to get an advantage so it should be taken away entirely or lock as on for all. (making Ghillie suits that you risk getting at a crate drop useless)The loot box system hands out points to buy them on kills in a match literally encouraging cheaters to hack to get kills in turn granting them loot boxes to sell on the market place for a real money profit thus increasing cheating popularity.The main menu has a refresh button because of how badly it was designed and ive had to use it alot to make the menu work.Crashes alot. If you like to Alt tab out of games alot this is bad for you because thats usually when it crashes.At the moment id suggest getting H1Z1 Fortnite or even bloody DAYZ to enjoy a game of this style of gameplay.This game should be removed from the store until its major cheating problems are fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Microstuttering rubberbanding unexplicable deaths utterly broken deathcams/replays cheaters and so on are ruining the experience. The game is equally fun as it is infuriating. If it wasn't for the fact that i am relatively sure that bluehole are incompetent developers that are incapable of consistently fixing stuff without making things worse while they're at it i would probably still give this a thumbs up but it isn't the case is it... Not to mention their ridiculous lootbox system where you need to spend in game money you earned to get a lootbox that you then have to spend real money on to be able to unlock i mean WTF? Oh right you can change skin color with the game currency... skin color........ What the is the point of having this currency again?

2017-07-10,1,1,421,True,Recommended,Absolutely irritated at the fact that it supports a controller for game usage but has NO controller settings. My sensetivity on the controller is very high. On a scale of one to ten I play with a sensetivity of 4. My sensetivity is baseline 8 and I can't change it. Until I can change my x and y axis senstivity I don't think I will be playing much because it becomes a waste of my time to build up gear and then die cause I either severely over or undercorrect my aim. Your survival becomes a matter of luck more so than skill. will start recommending when I have controller support.Update. The controllers are very comfortable for me now but I found a work around using steam controller settings in combination with the mouse and keyboard settings. using the steam controller settings I adjusted to a semi comfortable custom x and y axis settings. then I go in game and adjust the base settings for the game for each kind of scope. so its very customized to my liking. very much ove the game and would recommend. although there are a few new issues as the game updates I will mention elsewhere.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

2018-08-18,0,0,278,False,Not Recommended,Here's a list of issues this game have 1. Cheators everywhere (Mostly from China)2. Bugs and gliches all over the entire game (Interference in game play etc.)3. Server Lagging Problem4. Constant and irregular maintance without any formal prior notice (Nothing but a twitter twit)5. Performance Issues (FPS drop Overheating etc.)6. Rude and irrogant Players Long story short this company AKA bluehole doesn't give a about their player base and they are doing everything they can to lose their business to other competitors. For a careless company like this I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
